https://openalex.org/W1590052782,"Endoglin, a dimeric membrane glycoprotein expressed at high levels on human vascular endothelial cells, shares regions of sequence identity with betaglycan, a major binding protein for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) that co-exists with TGF-beta receptors I and II in a variety of cell lines but is low or absent in endothelial cells. We have examined whether endoglin also binds TGF-beta and demonstrate here that the major TGF-beta 1-binding protein co-existing with TGF-beta receptors I and II on human umbilical vein endothelial cells is endoglin, as determined by specific immunoprecipitation of endoglin affinity-labeled with 125I-TGF-beta. Furthermore, endoglin ectopically expressed in COS cells binds TGF-beta 1. Competition affinity-labeling experiments showed that endoglin binds TGF-beta 1 (KD approximately 50 pM) and TGF-beta 3 with high affinity but fails to bind TGF-beta 2. This difference in affinity of endoglin for the TGF-beta isoforms is in contrast to beta-glycan which recognizes all three isoforms. TGF-beta however is binding with high affinity to only a small fraction of the available endoglin molecules, suggesting that some rate-limiting event is required to sustain TGF-beta binding to endoglin."
https://openalex.org/W2086617442,"The rate and extent of the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors and rhodopsin by beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) are markedly enhanced on addition of G protein beta gamma subunits. With a model peptide substrate it was demonstrated that direct activation of the kinase could not account for this effect. G protein beta gamma subunits were shown to interact directly with the COOH-terminal region of beta ARK, and formation of this beta ARK-beta gamma complex resulted in receptor-facilitated membrane localization of the enzyme. The beta gamma subunits of transducin were less effective at both enhancing the rate of receptor phosphorylation and binding to the COOH-terminus of beta ARK, suggesting that the enzyme preferentially binds specific beta gamma complexes. The beta gamma-mediated membrane localization of beta ARK serves to intimately link receptor activation to beta ARK-mediated desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1997664222,"Extracellular signals that promote cell growth activate cascades of protein kinases. The kinases are dephosphorylated and deactivated by a single type-2A protein phosphatase. The catalytic subunit of type-2A protein phosphatase was phosphorylated by tyrosine-specific protein kinases. Phosphorylation was enhanced in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, consistent with an autodephosphorylation reaction. More than 90% of the activity of phosphatase 2A was lost when thioadenosine triphosphate was used to produce a thiophosphorylated protein resistant to autodephosphorylation. Phosphorylation in vitro occurred exclusively on Tyr307. Phosphorylation was catalyzed by p60v-src, p56lck, epidermal growth factor receptors, and insulin receptors. Transient deactivation of phosphatase 2A might enhance transmission of cellular signals through kinase cascades within cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970473343,"Using several naturally occurring and synthetic retinoic acid (RA)—responsive reporter genes, we show that the patterns of transcriptional activation by various retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms vary according to the nature of the RA response element and the context of the stimulated promoter. We demonstrate the presence of autonomous, ligand-inducible, and promoter context—dependent transactivation functions (AF-2s) located in the C-terminal region of all RARs and RXRs. In addition, promoter context-specific modulating transactivation functions are associated with the N-terminal A and B regions of RARs and RXRs. We also show that these transactivation and modulating functions exhibit response-element specificity. The modulating functions display a marked specificity in their cooperation with the AF-2 transactivation functions, cooperation that depends on the receptor origin of the modulating and transactivation functions and the promoter context of the RA-responsive gene, thus accounting for the specific transactivation properties of RAR and RXR types."
https://openalex.org/W1569540889,"Antihormones are potent antagonists of hormone action in vivo, but the mechanism underlying this antagonism is not understood. Several steroid hormones transform (activate) their receptors from a cytosolic, non-DNA binding 8 S sedimentation form to a nuclear, DNA binding 4 S form. Transformation is accompanied by the loss of associated heat shock proteins. We have previously demonstrated that an additional hormone-dependent step, separate from heat shock protein removal, is required for activation of the human progesterone receptor. We have devised an assay in which the human progesterone receptor translated in vitro binds to its specific response element in a hormone-dependent manner. As assessed by limited proteolytic digestion, hormone treatment of the nascent receptor induces a dramatic conformational change within the protein. The conformational change occurs in the absence of DNA and renders the entire ligand binding domain resistant to digestion by proteases. A number of antiprogestins, including RU486, induce an equally dramatic, but distinct, structural alteration of the ligand binding domain. The distinction centers upon the final 30 to 40 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The conformational change can be induced by ligand prior to dissociation of the 8 S complex and is not induced by heat shock protein removal in the absence of hormone. Remarkably, virtually identical hormone-induced conformational changes were detected following proteolytic analysis of in vitro translated retinoic acid receptors. Our data indicate that the sole necessary event in the activation of steroid receptors is conformational modification by the ligand. Furthermore, we conclude that transcriptional inactivation of steroid receptors by antihormones involves the induction of an inappropriate structural conformation at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2036887760,"Minutes after injection into the circulation, malaria sporozoites enter hepatocytes. The speed and specificity of the invasion process suggest that it is receptor mediated. We show here that recombinant Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CS) binds specifically to regions of the plasma membrane of hepatocytes exposed to circulating blood in the Disse space. No binding has been detected in other organs, or even in other regions of the hepatocyte membrane. The interaction of CS with hepatocytes, as well as sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells, is inhibited by synthetic peptides representing the evolutionarily conserved region II of CS. We conclude that region II is a sporozoite ligand for hepatocyte receptors localized to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. Our findings provide a rational explanation for the target cell specificity of malaria sporozoites."
https://openalex.org/W1979347172,"We examined the binding interactions of the methylation-dependent chemotaxis receptors Tsr and Tar with the chemotaxis-specific protein kinase CheA and the coupling factor CheW. Receptor directly bound CheW, but receptor-CheA binding was dependent upon the presence of CheW. These observations in combination with our previous identification of a CheW-CheA complex suggest that CheW physically links the kinase to the receptor. The ternary complex of receptor, CheW, and CheA is both kinetically and thermodynamically stable at physiological concentrations. Stability is not significantly altered by changes associated with attractant or repellent binding to the receptor. Such binding greatly modulates the kinase activity of CheA. Our results demonstrate that modulation of the kinase activity does not require association-dissociation of the ternary complex. This suggests that the receptor signal is transduced through conformational changes in the ternary complex rather than through changes in the association of the kinase CheA with receptor and/or CheW."

https://openalex.org/W1542767024,"Abstract Gene transfer experiments indicate that induction by the peroxisome proliferators, clofibric acid and WY-14,643, of luciferase expression driven by the promoter and 5'-flanking sequences of the rabbit cytochrome P450 4A6 gene (CYP4A6) is dependent on cotransfection of expression plasmids for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, PPAR. Activation by PPAR is observed in the absence of the inducers. However, a mutant, PPAR-G (Glu282----Gly) activated luciferase expression only in the presence of peroxisome proliferators. Deletion analysis has localized a response element to a 34-base pair segment located 677 base pairs upstream of the CYP4A6 transcription start site that is similar to an element that regulates the response of the rat fatty acyl-CoA oxidase gene to peroxisome proliferators and that binds PPAR."
https://openalex.org/W1712774648,"The action of three matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 72- and 95-kDa gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and PUMP (MMP-7), and a cysteine proteinase, cathepsin B, were investigated on aggrecan the major proteoglycan of cartilage. All the enzymes cleaved aggrecan although the activity of the 95-kDa gelatinase was very low. Specific cleavage sites were investigated following incubation with a purified aggrecan G1-G2 domain fragment (150 kDa). Both gelatinases produced 110-kDa G2 and 56-kDa G1 products by a single cleavage at an Asn-Phe bond within the interglobular domain close to the G1 domain. This was similar to the action of stromelysin (MMP-3) (Fosang, A. J., Neame, P. J., Hardingham, T. E., Murphy, G., and Hamilton, J. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15579-15582). Cathepsin B also produced two fragments from a single cleavage at a Gly-Val bond only three amino acids C-terminal to the metalloproteinase cleavage site. PUMP cleaved at the metalloproteinase Asn-Phe site, but in addition produced a low yield of a smaller G2 fragment (56 kDa) corresponding to cleavage between Asp441 and Leu442 (human sequence), within the interglobular domain, close to the G2 domain. The apparent difference in size between the two G2 fragments released by PUMP (110 and 56 kDa) was much greater than predicted from the peptide length between the cleavage sites (100 amino acids). However, keratanase digestion greatly reduced the size of the 110-kDa G2 fragment, while producing only a small reduction in size of the 56-kDa product, showing that there was approximately 30-40 kDa of keratan sulfate attached to the interglobular domain between the PUMP cleavage sites. This new structural information on aggrecan may account for the previously observed stiffness of the interglobular domains when viewed by rotary shadowing electron microscopy (Paulsson, M., Morgelin, M., Wiedemann, H., Beardmore-Gray, M., Dunham, D. G., Hardingham, T. E., Heinegard, D., Timpl, R., and Engel, J. (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 763-772). These results show that in spite of a high keratan sulfate content the interglobular domain provides important sites for cleavage by different proteinases, including several members of the matrix metalloproteinase family."
https://openalex.org/W1603199903,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) induces Ca2+ oscillations and waves in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Microsomes from oocytes exhibit high-affinity binding for Ins(1,4,5)P3, and demonstrate Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (InsP3R) was purified from oocyte microsomes as a large tetrameric complex and shown to have a monomer molecular mass of 256 kDa, compared with 273 kDa for the brain InsP3R. Binding to the oocyte receptor is highly specific for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and is inhibited by heparin (IC50, 2 micrograms/ml). Immunoblot analysis revealed that an antibody against the C-terminal sequence of the brain receptor recognized the oocyte receptor. These results, in addition to the difference in pattern obtained after limited proteolysis, suggest that the oocyte InsP3R is a new shorter isoform of the mammalian brain type I InsP3R. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated the presence of the InsP3R in the cortical layer and the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum of the oocyte. However, immunological and biochemical experiments did not reveal the presence of the ryanodine receptor. The presence of an InsP3R and the absence of a ryanodine receptor support the importance of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in Ca2+ handling by oocytes and particularly in the induction of Ca2+ oscillations and waves."
https://openalex.org/W2068223677,"Nitric oxide (NO) is considered a diffusible messenger involved in neuronal communication, although the postsynaptic target cells of NO action and the associated biological function in the CNS are still a matter of controversy. Within the discrete pattern of NO-synthesizing neurons in the brain, NO synthase is specifically colocalized with the cholinergic brain stem-thalamic system, which is thought to regulate the state-dependent activity of the thalamocortical circuit. Here we report evidence indicating that the release of NO onto thalamocortical neurons results in an alteration in voltage dependence of the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance, probably mediated via the cGMP system. NO selectively dampens oscillatory neuronal activity, indicating a rapidly diffusing signaling mechanism that controls the functional state of the thalamocortical network."
https://openalex.org/W1633703614,"Site-specific and random fragmentation of human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) was observed following the glycation reaction (the early stage of the Maillard reaction). The fragmentation proceeded in two steps. In the first step, Cu,Zn-SOD was cleaved at a peptide bond between Pro62 and His63, as judged by amino acid analysis and sequencing of fragment peptides, yielding a large (15 kDa) and a small (5 kDa) fragment. In the second step, random fragmentation occurred. The ESR spectrum of the glycated Cu,Zn-SOD suggested that reactive oxygen species was implicated in the both steps of fragmentation. The same fragmentations were seen upon exposure of the enzyme to an H2O2 bolus. Catalase completely blocked both steps of the fragmentation process, whereas EDTA blocked only the second step. Incubation with glucose resulted in a time-dependent release of Cu2+ from the Cu,Zn-SOD molecule. The released Cu2+ then likely participated in a Fenton's type of reaction to produce hydroxyl radical, which may cause the nonspecific fragmentation. Evidence that EDTA abolished only the second step of fragmentation induced by an H2O2 bolus supports this mechanism. This is the first report that a site-specific fragmentation of a protein is caused by reactive oxygen species formed by the Maillard reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1494856533,"Rod transducin (Tr), a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, couples photolysis of rhodopsin to the activation of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase in the vertebrate visual signal transduction cascade. To determine if T alpha r is covalently modified, we analyzed tryptic fragments of bovine retinal T alpha r using electrospray mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography. A novel heterogeneous fatty acylation was detected at the NH2 terminus. Four types of NH2-terminal tryptic fragments of T alpha r were isolated, and each contained either a lauroyl (C12:0), myristoyl (C14:0), (cis-delta 5)-tetradecaenoyl (C14:1) or (cis,cis-delta 5, delta 8)-tetradecadienoyl (C14:2) fatty acyl residue amide-linked to the NH2-terminal glycine residue. NH2-terminal fatty acylation does not anchor T alpha r permanently in the membrane, since T alpha r used in these experiments was eluted without detergent from rod outer segment membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1485526495,"Abstract We have isolated and characterized the gene for the human endothelin-A receptor. Southern blot analyses demonstrated a single copy gene for the receptor. The gene spans more than 40 kilobases and contains eight exons and seven introns. Intron 1 exists in the 5'-noncoding region, and introns 2-7 occur in the coding region. The locations of introns 2-7 exist before or after the regions encoding the membrane-spanning domains. The transcription start site, determined by primer extension experiments, is 502 base pairs upstream of the methionine initiation codon. The 5'-flanking region lacks a typical TATA box but contains a potential SP-1-binding site 27 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Using human-rodent somatic hybrid cell DNA, the gene was assigned to human chromosome 4. Northern blot analyses revealed a 4.3-kilobase mRNA in a wide variety of human tissues, at the highest level in the aorta and at a substantial level in the cultured human mesangial cells. This is the first report of cloning of a gene for a member of the endothelin receptor family. The present study should give a clue to the discovery of possible disorders of the endothelin-A receptor, as well as facilitate the elucidation of the mechanisms by which the gene expression is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1494579587,"Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) convert 6-trans isomers of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to dihydro metabolites (Powell, W.S., and Gravelle, F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2170-2177). In the present study we investigated the mechanism for the initial step in the formation of these products. We found that the 1,500 x g supernatant fraction from human PMNL converts 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 to its 5-oxo metabolite which was identified by mass spectrometry and UV spectrophotometry. The latter compound was subsequently converted to the corresponding dihydro-oxo product, which was further metabolized to 6,11-dihydro-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4, which was the major product after longer incubation times. The 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase activity is localized in the microsomal fraction and requires NADP+ as a cofactor. These experiments therefore suggest that the initial step in the formation of dihydro metabolites of 6-trans isomers of LTB4 is oxidation of the 5-hydroxyl group by a microsomal dehydrogenase. Studies with a variety of substrates revealed that the microsomal dehydrogenase in human PMNL oxidizes the hydroxyl groups of a number of other eicosanoids which contain a 5(S)-hydroxyl group followed by a 6-trans double bond. There is little or no oxidation of hydroxyl groups in the 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, or 15-positions of eicosanoids, or of the 5-hydroxyl group of LTB4, which has a 6-cis rather than a 6-trans double bond. The preferred substrate for this enzyme is 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE) (Km, 0.2 microM), which is converted to 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. Unlike 5(S)-HETE, 5(R)-HETE is a poor substrate for the 5(S)-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase, indicating that in addition to exhibiting a high degree of positional specificity, this enzyme is also highly stereospecific. In addition to 5(S)-HETE and 6-trans isomers of LTB4, 5,15-diHETE is also a good substrate for this enzyme, being converted to 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15-hydroxy-ETE). The oxidation of 5(S)-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE is reversible since human PMNL microsomes stereospecifically reduce 5-oxo-ETE to the 5(S)-hydroxy compound in the presence of NADPH. 5-Oxo-ETE is formed rapidly from 5(S)-HETE by intact human PMNL, but because of the reversibility of the reaction, its concentration only reaches about 25% that of 5(S)-HETE."
https://openalex.org/W1557409643,"In certain cyanobacteria and algae, cytochrome c553 or plastocyanin can serve to carry electrons from the cytochrome bf complex to photosystem I. The availability of copper in the growth medium regulates which protein is present. To investigate copper induced control of gene expression we isolated these proteins from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Using immunodetection and optical spectroscopy, the steady state levels of cytochrome c553 and plastocyanin were measured in cells grown at different copper concentrations. The results show that in cells grown in 20-30 nM copper, cytochrome c553 was present, whereas plastocyanin was not detected. The opposite behavior was observed in cells grown in the presence of 1 microM copper; plastocyanin was present, whereas cytochrome c553 could not be detected. Both proteins were present in cells grown in 0.3 microM copper. Northern analysis of total RNA, probed with a gene fragment for cytochrome c553 or the plastocyanin gene, showed that cells grown in the presence of 20-30 nM copper have message for cytochrome c553, but not for plastocyanin, whereas cells grown in 1 microM copper have message for plastocyanin, but not for cytochrome c553. These results demonstrate that copper regulates expression of both of the genes encoding cytochrome c553 and plastocyanin prior to translation in Synechocystis 6803."
https://openalex.org/W2002626811,"A novel strategy, termed suppression cloning, was used to identify a 7.4 kb cDNA encoding a putative subunit of the calcium channels that regulate transmitter release at nerve endings of Torpedo californica. The 585 nt open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a polypeptide of about 21.7 kd that is essential for the expression in frog oocytes of ω-conotoxin-sensitive, dihydropyridine-resistant, calcium channels. Sequence analysis reveals that this protein is closely related to two cloned cysteine string proteins of undetermined function that were recently localized to Drosophila nerve terminals using monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1964897006,"The distinction between receptor-binding sites for agonists and antagonists underpins the pharmacological differences between these two classes of ligands. In the glycine receptor, antagonist (strychnine) binding requires an interaction with residues Lys-200 and Tyr-202. We now demonstrate that the agonist-binding site of this receptor is located at the residue Thr-204. The agonist-binding site interaction is thus likely to be mediated by hydrogen bonding and not by ionic interactions. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to other studies of ligand-gated ion channel receptors, agonist- and antagonist-binding sites are composed of distinct amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1531850676,"The lamin B receptor (LBR) is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that interacts with lamin B in vitro. If contains a 204-amino acid nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain and a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal domain with eight putative transmembrane segments. We found cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of LBR using phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping of in vivo 32P-labeled LBR immunoprecipitated from chicken cells in interphase and arrested in mitosis. LBR was phosphorylated only on serine residues in interphase and on serine and threonine residues in mitosis. Some serine residues phosphorylated in interphase were not phosphorylated in mitosis. To identify a threonine residue specifically phosphorylated in mitosis and the responsible protein kinase, wild-type and mutant LBR nucleoplasmic domain fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by p34cdc2-type protein kinase. Comparisons of phosphopeptide maps to those of in vivo 32P-labeled mitotic LBR showed that Thr188 is likely to be phosphorylated by this enzyme during mitosis. These phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events may be responsible for some of the changes in the interaction between the nuclear lamina and the inner nuclear membrane that occur during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1529224585,"Considerable structural similarities are present in a region of approximately 270 amino acids in most known cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) sequences, opening the possibility that this region encodes the catalytic domain of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, the structure of a high affinity cAMP PDE (cAMP-PDE) was analyzed by deletion mutations and site-directed mutagenesis. A ratPDE3 cDNA was mutated using a strategy based on fragment amplification by polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the introduced mutations was determined by expressing wild type and mutated proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The level of expression of the PDE protein was monitored by immunoblot analysis using two specific cAMP-PDE polyclonal antibodies and by measuring the PDE activity. After removal of a 99-amino acid region at the carboxyl terminus flanking the conserved domain, the protein retains its catalytic activity even though its Km and velocity were changed. Internal deletions at the amino terminus of this PDE showed that the enzyme activity was increased when a 97-amino acid fragment (from Tyr49 to Lys145) was removed. Further deletions within the amino terminus produced inactive proteins. Within the domain that appears essential for catalysis, 1 threonine and 2 serine residues are conserved in all PDEs. Substitutions of the invariant threonine (Thr349) present in the most conserved region with alanine, proline, or serine yielded proteins of the correct size and a level of expression comparable to the wild type PDE. However, in both expression systems used, proteins were completely devoid of the ability to hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides, except when the threonine was substituted with a serine. Conversely, mutations of 2 other conserved serine residues (Ser305 and Ser398) present in the catalytic domain either had no effect or produced changes only in Km and Vmax, but did not abolish catalytic activity. In addition, 2 histidine residues (His278 and His311) present in proximity to Thr349 appeared to be essential for the structure of the catalytic domain, since any substitution performed in these residues yielded an inactive enzyme. Mutations of a serine residue (Ser295) in the region homologous to the cAMP binding site of the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase demonstrated that this region does not have the same function in the two proteins. These data provide direct evidence that a 37-kDa domain, which in part corresponds to the region of conservation in all PDEs, contains the catalytic domain, and that threonine and histidine residues are probably involved in catalysis and/or are essential for the conformation of an active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1495897262,"The region including the conserved Ser65-Asp66 dipeptide in the tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TET) encoded by transposon Tn10 is thought to play a gating role (Yamaguchi, A., Ono, N., Akasaka, T., Noumi, T., and Sawai, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15525-15530). The dipeptide is in putative interhelix loop2-3, which also includes the conserved sequence motif, GXXXXRXGRR, found in all TET proteins and sugar/H+ symporters. Through the combination of localized random and site-directed mutagenesis, each residue in loop2-3 was replaced. Among 10 residues in putative loop2-3, the important residues, of which substitution resulted in significant reduction or complete loss of the transport activity, were Gly62, Asp66, Gly69, and Arg70. The defect in the transport activity of the Gly62 and Gly69 substitution mutants corresponded to the steric hindrance by the substituents as to the putative beta-turn structure of the peptide backbone containing these glycines. Of 3 conserved Arg residues, the replacement of only Arg70 caused complete loss of the activity except for replacement with Lys, indicating the importance of a positive charge at this position, which is similar to the essentiality of a negative charge at Asp66. A charge-neutralizing intra-loop salt bridge between Asp66 and Arg70 was not likely because the double mutant in which Asp66 and Arg70 were replaced with asparagine and leucine, respectively, showed no transport activity. A triple mutant with only one positive charge at Arg70 in this loop showed about half the wild-type activity, indicating that the polycationic nature of the loop was not critical for the activity. Cys mutants as to the unessential residues in the loop were modifiable with N-ethylmaleimide, except for the Met64----Cys and Arg71----Cys mutants; however, the modification of only the Ser65----Cys mutant caused significant inhibition of the transport activity, indicating that position 65 is a unique position in the structure of loop2-3."
https://openalex.org/W1562862680,"To examine the role of intramolecular beta subunit trans- and cis-autophosphorylation in signal transduction, the vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 expression system was used to generate insulin holoreceptors composed of a kinase-defective half-receptor precursor (alpha beta A/K or alpha beta A/K.delta CT) and a kinase-active half-receptor precursor (alpha beta delta CT or alpha beta WT). In the alpha beta A/K-alpha beta delta CT hybrid insulin receptor, insulin stimulated a 20-fold increase in intramolecular beta subunit trans-phosphorylation, whereas cis-phosphorylation increased only 3-fold over the basal state. Similarly, in the alpha beta WT-alpha beta A/K.delta CT hybrid insulin receptor, insulin stimulated trans-phosphorylation approximately 30-fold and cis-phosphorylation only 3-fold over the basal state. Although cis-phosphorylation of the kinase-functional alpha beta half-receptor was observed within these hybrid receptor species, this was not sufficient to stimulate exogenous substrate kinase activity. These data demonstrate that insulin primarily activates an intramolecular beta subunit trans-phosphorylation reaction within the insulin holoreceptor and suggest that this reaction is necessary for activation of the holoreceptor. Furthermore, our results suggest a molecular basis for the dominant-negative phenotype observed in insulin-resistant patients possessing one kinase-defective insulin receptor allele."
https://openalex.org/W1541642856,"In 1989, Shier and Watt identified a gene which was predicted to encode a new member of the insulin receptor (IR) family, and they called it the insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) (Shier, P., and Watt, V. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14605-14608). However, the tissues expressing this receptor, its ligand binding specificity and its signaling capability have remained unknown. In the present studies we report Northern blot analyses and polymerase chain reaction data, which indicate that the IRR mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the human kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas. In order to examine the ligand(s) recognized by IRR, we constructed a chimeric receptor with the extracellular domain of the IR replaced with that of IRR. This chimera was found not to bind radioactively labeled insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), or IGF-II. These ligands and relaxin, the only other known member of the mammalian insulin family, also failed to stimulate the tyrosine kinase activity of this chimeric receptor. A second chimeric receptor with the extracellular domain of IR and the kinase domain of IRR was also constructed and utilized to study the signaling capabilities of the kinase domain of IRR. This chimera exhibited high affinity insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. The kinase domains of the IR and IRR were found capable of phosphorylating the same spectrum of exogenous and endogenous substrates. However, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably overexpressing the kinase domain of IRR exhibited elevated basal thymidine incorporation and 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with CHO cells and CHO cells overexpressing wild-type IR. We conclude that: 1) IRR is expressed in the human kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas, 2) IRR does not appear to be the receptor of any known member of the insulin family, and 3) the tyrosine kinase of IRR appears to be similar to that of IR in both the spectrum of substrates phosphorylated and the biological responses stimulated."
https://openalex.org/W1595161640,"Recent evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic domains of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa are involved in the agonist-initiated transformation of this integrin into a receptor for fibrinogen. To identify intracellular reactions that regulate the receptor function of GP IIb-IIIa, membrane-impermeable agonists and antagonists were introduced into the platelet by permeabilizing the plasma membrane with the pore-forming complement proteins C5b-9. Platelet responses were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Non-lytic concentrations of C5b-9 caused permeabilization of the platelet plasma membrane, as determined by uptake of a water-soluble fluorescent tracer dye. The complement pores were large enough to permit the entry of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled oligopeptides in a size-dependent manner. Under conditions of low external Ca2+, C5b-9 treatment per se did not activate GP IIb-IIIa, as measured by binding of the activation-dependent antibody FITC-PAC1. However, FITC-PAC1 binding to C5b-9-permeabilized platelets was stimulated by a thrombin receptor agonist acting at the cell surface and by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), a membrane-impermeable activator of G proteins. Permeabilization also permitted the entry of cyclic AMP and the peptide, RFARKGALRQKNV, a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of protein kinase C. Each of these inhibited agonist-induced FITC-PAC1 binding to permeabilized platelets but not to intact platelets. Agonist-induced GP IIb-IIIa activation in permeabilized platelets was also inhibited by tyrphostin-23, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Thus, C5b-9 can be used to permeabilize the plasma membrane to permit the selective entry of small peptides and other bioactive compounds into permeabilized platelets. Results obtained with these platelets indicate that GP IIb-IIIa receptor function is regulated by a network of signaling reactions involving G proteins, serine/threonine kinases, and tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1566587067,"Cytochrome b558 in phagocytes is a transmembrane protein composed of large and small subunits and considered to play a key role in O2- generation during the respiratory burst. The COOH-terminal regions of the cytochrome subunits protrude to the cytoplasmic side and are assumed to be the sites for association with cytosolic components to form an active O(2-)-generating complex (Imajoh-Ohmi, S., Tokita, K., Ochiai, H., Nakamura, M., and Kanegasaki, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 180-184). We show here that two synthetic peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of each subunit inhibit NADPH-dependent oxygen uptake induced by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in a cell-free system consisting of plasma membrane and cytosol. The inhibition was observed when either peptide was added to the system before, but not after, the activation with SDS suggesting that interaction between the COOH-terminal regions of the cytochrome subunits and cytosolic components is important for the assembly and the activity of the O(2-)-generating system. Using the cross-linking reagent dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobis-propionimidate, we found that the cytosolic 47-kDa protein, an essential component of the O(2-)-generating system, interacted with the synthetic peptides in the presence of SDS. In addition to the 47-kDa protein, a 17-kDa protein was found to be associated with the peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of the small subunit. These results indicate that the cytosolic COOH-terminal regions of cytochrome b558 subunits are the binding sites for both the cytosolic 47-kDa protein and the 17-kDa protein and that the binding takes place during activation of the system."
https://openalex.org/W1621354261,"A number of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PLC) of different species have recently been cloned. The predicted amino acid sequences of these isoforms contain two highly conserved domains. Here we report the identification of a PLC gene of Dictyostelium by using the polymerase chain reaction. Primers were designed coding for highly conserved amino acid regions located within one of the conserved domains of PLCs. Cloning and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product revealed one unique PLC-like sequence. This sequence was used to screen a library and isolate several overlapping cDNA clones. The complete cDNA was expressed in Dictyostelium cells resulting in increased basal levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and enhanced PLC activity. The identified Dictyostelium PLC, DdPLC, encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 91 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the two conserved domains found in other PLC isoforms, separated by a short variable region. The C-terminal part of the protein shows strong homology with the mammalian PLC-delta isoform. DdPLC is expressed at all stages of development, with an increase in transcription during starvation and in the culminating fruiting body."
https://openalex.org/W2155822976,"Partially degenerate oligonucleotides based on peptide sequence were used to isolate cDNA to a 63-kDa bovine brain calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE) isozyme. A 412-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment was obtained and used along with the oligonucleotides to isolate several cDNAs each encoding sequence identical to known peptide sequences from the 63-kDa CaM-PDE. The largest cDNA contained a full-length open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 534 amino acid, 61,005-dalton protein. It had 69% amino acid identity to the 61-kDa bovine brain CaM-PDE and included a carboxyl-terminal conserved domain containing the PDE catalytic domain consensus sequences. The NHz-terminal region fits the criteria for a calmodulin-binding domain. When its expression was driven by a cytomegalogvirus promoter on a pCDM8 vector in COS-7 cells, the cDNA encoded a catalytically active, calmodulin-stimulated PDE. Northern analysis of RNA from several tissues with a probe containing much of the conserved PDE catalytic domain showed only a single band of 4.0 kilobases. Hybridization was seen in mRNA from several regions of the central nervous system with the greatest signal in basal ganglia. Strong signals also were seen in other tissues including kidney papilla and adrenal medulla. Antisense RNA probes were used in RNaseprotection assays to look for evidence of multiple 63kDa CaM-PDE transcripts. A catalytic domain probe was fully protected by RNA from cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, adrenal medulla, and kidney papilla. However, a probe to the NHzterminal region was fully protected only by brain and adrenal medullary RNA indicating the likelihood of one or more isozyme(s) divergent in this region in the kidney papilla."
https://openalex.org/W1579785356,"To further understand the mechanisms involved in phagocyte activation in general and in NADPH oxidase activation in particular, a polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbit against a partially purified oxidase preparation. The enzyme was solubilized from zymosan-activated human neutrophils and resting cells and separated by preparative isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbit against the pI 5.0 fraction, which had the maximum superoxide-producing capacity. Analysis of the polyclonal antibody revealed marked differences between activated and resting neutrophils. The antibody recognized in particular an 8-kDa protein (p8) in resting human neutrophil cytosol and in the membrane of zymosan-activated cells. A polyclonal antibody (anti-p8) was raised against the pure cytosolic p8 protein. This anti-p8 reacted not only with p8, but also with cytosolic proteins of 14 kDa and 6 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of p8 revealed homology with the calcium-binding myeloid related protein (MRP-8). Upon neutrophil activation, translocation of the 8- and 14-kDa proteins to the membrane was observed with stimuli known to depend on extracellular calcium. In calcium-depleted medium, the absence of translocation correlated with a depression of superoxide production, supporting a role for the calcium-binding protein in cellular activation."
https://openalex.org/W2248763542,"We have measured the activity of the n type K+ channel present in human (Jurkat) T lymphocytes using the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. We report that protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) modulate, in a dual manner, the K+ conductance in these cells. Activation of PKA decreases the amplitude of the current, as previously reported (Bastin, B., Payet, M. D., and Dupuis, G. (1990) Cell. Immunol. 128, 385-399), and this is also the case for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-dependent activation of PKC. In contrast, inhibitors of PKC (H7, staurosporine, polymixin B, and anti-PKC antibody) increase the current amplitude. Of importance, down-regulation of PKC or its inhibition prevented the PKA-dependent inhibition of the K+ channels. Addition of alkaline phosphatase via the patch pipette increased the K+ conductance under basal conditions and reversed the inhibition produced by PKA. The dual modulation of K+ channels in Jurkat T cells is in agreement with the presence of consensus sequences in the primary structure of the n type K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W1543893902,"cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) of vertebrate retinal rod outer segments (ROS) is composed of two catalytic subunits (PDE alpha and PDE beta) and two identical inhibitory subunits (PDE gamma). Native PDE alpha beta gamma 2 is peripherally bound to the membranes of ROS discs. We studied quantitatively its partition between soluble and membrane-bound fractions in ROS homogenates. In the presence of its activator, the alpha-subunit of transducin loaded with a triphosphate guanine nucleotide (T alpha*), PDE displayed a greatly enhanced membrane binding. Neither the purified PDE gamma.T alpha* complex, nor the PDE alpha beta and PDE alpha beta gamma forms of active PDE, showed a membrane binding comparable to that of PDE alpha beta gamma 2 in the presence of T alpha*. The T alpha*-activated PDE is therefore an undissociated complex tightly bound to the ROS membranes. Using limited proteolysis, we showed that the membrane anchoring of the whole complex implies not only PDE (mainly by the C terminus of PDE beta) but also both termini of T alpha*. The membrane binding of the purified PDE alpha beta species was also enhanced in the presence of T alpha*; a direct link would therefore exist between the activator and the catalytic subunits. From this work emerges a plausible structural model of the T alpha*-activated PDE, with its internal interactions and its sites of anchoring into the ROS membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1480426081,"Multiple isozymes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are expressed simultaneously in mammalian tissues. To identify and clone these PDEs, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy was developed using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to hybridize with highly conserved PDE DNA domains. Both known and novel PDEs were cloned from rat liver, the mouse K30a-3.3 lymphoma cell line, and a human hypothalamus cDNA library, demonstrating that these PCR primers can be used to amplify the cDNA of multiple PDE isozymes. One unique mouse PDE clone was found to encode a polypeptide identical with the corresponding portion of the bovine brain 63-kDa calmodulin-dependent PDE as reported in the companion article (Bentley, J. K., Kadlecek, A., Sherbert, C. H., Seger, D., Sonnenburg, W. K., Charbonneau, H., Novack, J. P., and Beavo, J. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 18676-18682). This mouse clone was used as a probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library for a full-length clone. The conceptual translation of the nucleotide sequence of the resulting rat clone has an open reading frame of 535 amino acids and maintains a high degree of homology with the bovine 63-kDa calmodulin-dependent PDE, indicating that this protein is likely to be the rat homolog of the 63-kDa calmodulin-dependent PDE. Expression of the full-length clone in Escherichia coli yielded a cGMP hydrolyzing activity that was stimulated severalfold by calmodulin. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the mRNA encoding this PDE is highly expressed in rat brain and also in the S49.1 T-lymphocyte cell line. These data demonstrate that the PCR method described is a viable strategy to isolate cDNA clones of known and novel members of different families of PDE isozymes. Molecular cloning of these PDEs will provide valuable tools for investigating the roles of these isozymes in regulation of intracellular concentrations of the cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1586528058,"X-ray diffraction studies of human thrombin revealed that compared with trypsin, two insertions (B and C) potentially limit access to the active site groove. When amino acids Glu146, Thr147, and Trp148, adjacent to the C-insertion (autolysis loop), are deleted the resulting thrombin (des-ETW) has dramatically altered interaction with serine protease inhibitors. Whereas des-ETW resists antithrombin III inactivation with a rate constant (Kon) approximately 350-fold slower than for thrombin, des-ETW is remarkably sensitive to the Kunitz inhibitors, with inhibition constants (Ki) decreased from 2.6 microM to 34 nM for the soybean trypsin inhibitor and from 52 microM to 1.8 microM for the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The affinity for hirudin (Ki = 5.6 pM) is weakened at least 30-fold compared with recombinant thrombin. The mutation affects the charge stabilizing system and the primary binding pocket of thrombin as depicted by a decrease in Kon for diisopropylfluorophosphate (9.5-fold) and for N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (51-fold) and a 39-fold increase in the Ki for benzamidine. With peptidyl p-nitroanilide substrates, the des-ETW deletion results in changes in the Michaelis (Km) and/or catalytic (kcat) constants, worsened as much as 85-fold (Km) or 100-fold (kcat). The specific clotting activity of des-ETW is less than 5% that of thrombin and the kcat/Km for protein C activation in the absence of cofactor less than 2%. Thrombomodulin binds to des-ETW with a dissociation constant of approximately 2.5 nM and partially restores its ability to activate protein C since, in the presence of the cofactor, kcat/Km rises to 6.5% that of thrombin. This study suggests that the ETW motif of thrombin prevents (directly or indirectly) its interaction with the two Kunitz inhibitors and is not essential for the thrombomodulin-mediated enhancement of protein C activation."

https://openalex.org/W1572229681,"The activin receptor protein was isolated from the mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line P19 by three cycles of affinity chromatography on an activin A-immobilized column. The purified receptor had a specific and high affinity for activins A, AB, and B (Kd = 345 pM), but not for transforming growth factor beta. The purified activin receptor was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ligand blotting analysis as a single protein of 70 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the first 18 NH2-terminal residues revealed that the receptor is a member of the activin receptor family. The purified receptor phosphorylated itself and exogenous substrate proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, indicating that the activin receptor is a transmembrane serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase. These results suggest that signal transduction of activin employs a novel pathway via a new class of cellular receptor in EC P19 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1488490590,"Steroid hormones have been shown to modulate a number of physiological processes in addition to their potent antiinflammatory effects. Endothelin (ET) is a newly discovered vasoconstrictor that is synthesized and released by endothelial cells and acts on adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. Proinflammatory agents such as thrombin and transforming growth factor beta have been shown to up-regulate ET gene expression in vascular endothelial cells. We wondered whether the anti-inflammatory steroids might have any regulatory effect on the ET receptors present in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A-10 cell line, ATCC.CRL 1476) were used as a model system to study the effects of glucocorticoids on ET receptor expression and function. These cells display high density and high affinity ET receptors that belong to the ETA subtype. Pretreatment of these cells with dexamethasone reduced the number of ET receptors by 50-60% without changing the affinity. Of the steroids tested, dexamethasone was most effective followed by prednisolone and hydrocortisone. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, was 5000-fold less potent than dexamethasone. This effect of dexamethasone was dependent on the time of pretreatment and concentration of the steroid used. This down-regulation of ET receptors was also accompanied by an attenuated response to ET-1 in dexamethasone-pretreated cells. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was selective for ET receptors because the vasopressin-mediated response was unaffected. In addition, dexamethasone pretreatment of these cells resulted in 50-60% reduction in the steady-state level of ETA receptor mRNA as revealed by Northern analysis. These results suggest that glucocorticoid pretreatment of smooth muscle cells resulted in the down-regulation of the ETA receptor at the mRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1512142111,"Cytochrome b558 of pig blood neutrophils was purified from the membranes of resting cells to examine its ability to reconstitute superoxide (O2-)-forming NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay system containing cytosol and fatty acid. The membrane-associated cytochrome b558 was solubilized with a detergent, n-heptyl beta-thioglucoside, and purified by DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and Mono Q column chromatography. The final preparation of cytochrome containing 11.5 nmol of protoheme/mg of protein gave bands of the large and small subunits on immunoblotted gel. The cell-free system with the purified cytochrome alone as a membrane component showed little O2(-)-generating activity in the absence of exogenous FAD. However, the system showed high O2(-)-generating activity of 31.8 mol/s/mol of cytochrome b558 (52.5% of the original O2(-)-generating activity of the solubilized membranes) in the presence of a nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reductase fraction that was separated from the cytochrome b fraction by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Heat treatment of the NBT reductase fraction resulted in loss of the O2(-)-generating activity in the reconstituted system. The O2(-)-forming activity of the reconstituted system was markedly decreased by removal of FAD from the NBT reductase fraction and was restored by readdition of FAD to the FAD-depleted reductase. The reconstituted system containing purified cytochrome b558 plus the NBT reductase showed approximately 100 times higher O2(-)-generating activity than a system containing rabbit liver NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase instead. These results suggest that both the FAD-dependent NBT reductase and cytochrome b558 are required as membrane redox components for O2(-)-forming NADPH oxidase activity. The present data are discussed in comparison with previously reported results on reconstituted systems containing added free FAD."
https://openalex.org/W2037267957,"The effects of intracellularly applied inositol phosphates on voltage-dependent calcium channel currents were assessed in rat cerebellar neurons using the whole-cell recording configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Intraneuronal perfusion of 10 μM inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) increased the amplitude of currents elicited by depolarization from a holding potential of -40 mV. IP3 did not modify current activation, but shifted the steady-state inactivation curve toward more positive values. The dose-response curve indicated an ECso of 0.5 μM for IP3. Inositol 1,3,4,5, tetrakisphosphate (IP4), but not inositol 4,5, bisphosphate, mimicked the effect of IP3. The effect of IP3 persisted in the presence of 100 μg/ ml heparin and did not depend on intracellular calcium mobilization, as similar responses were not produced by 10 mM caffeine or by intrapipette calcium buffering at pCa 6 instead of pCa 7.7. Preincubation with ω-conotoxin led to a 5596 inhibition of barium current; however, inhibition was reversed by I P3, which reestablished the control current amplitude. These results imply that IP3 and IP4 can elicit calcium entry by modifying both the gating characteristics and the pharmacological properties of voltage-dependent calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1487395896,"The class 2 outer membrane protein (MIEP) of Neisseria meningitidis has recently been shown to be mitogenic for lymphocytes (Liu, M.A., Friedman, A., Tai, J., Martinez, D., Deck, R. R., Hawe, L. A., Shieh, J. T.-C., Jenkins, T. D., Donnelly, J. J., and Oliff, A. I. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 4633-4637. In this study, a possible connection between MIEP's mitogenicity and its possible action as a porin was investigated. MIEP, purified from the bacterial outer membrane protein complex under denaturing conditions, caused a modest but specific release of ions (86Rb) from both erythrocytes and lymphocytes, ultimately resulting in cell lysis. The dose-response of MIEP on erythrocyte lysis was qualitatively similar to a known porin (protein I from Neisseria gonorrhoeae) but was much less efficient. Induction or preservation of native structure in MIEP increased pore formation, resulting in levels comparable to that of the protein I porin. These observations suggest that native MIEP, free of the other outer membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis, can efficiently form pores in cells, but that denatured MIEP is variably and marginally effective. However, pore formation by MIEP was not related to its mitogenicity in lymphocytes, based on: (i) native MIEP was not mitogenic; (ii) denatured MIEP was highly mitogenic; and (iii) denatured MIEP was mitogenic at concentrations below the threshold level for pore formation. Therefore, mitogenicity is dependent upon MIEP being in a denatured, monomeric state and is masked by native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1532360582,"The identification of free glycoinositol phospholipids (GPIs) following biosynthetic labeling with [3H]glucosamine in cultured cells has been reported by several laboratories. We applied this procedure to two of the cell types used in these studies, H4IIE hepatoma cells and isolated hepatocytes, but were unable to detect a [3H]glucosamine-containing lipid that met any of the criteria for GPIs, including sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) or GPI-specific phospholipase D. Part of the difficulty in radiolabeling a GPI by this procedure was the rapid metabolic conversion of [3H]glucosamine to galactosamine and neutral or anionic derivatives. A PIPLC-sensitive radiolabeled lipid was detected only after 16 h of labeling. The water-soluble fragments released from this lipid by PIPLC corresponded largely to myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and myo-inositol 1-phosphate, products expected from PIPLC cleavage of phosphatidylinositol or lyso-phosphatidylinositol. In an alternative approach that we introduce here, free GPIs in lipid extracts from rat liver plasma membranes were labeled by reductive radiomethylation. This procedure, which radiomethylates primary and secondary amines, has been shown to label a glucosamine residue adjacent to inositol in all GPIs characterized to date. The labeled extracts were fractionated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, and a cluster of polar labeled lipids were assigned as GPIs based upon the following observations. 1) They were cleaved by PIPLC, 2) after hydrolysis in 6 N HCl, both radiomethylated glucosamine and a glucosamine-inositol conjugate were identified by cation exchange chromatography, and 3) hydrolysis in 4 M trifluoroacetic acid generated a fragment consistent with glucosamine-inositol-phosphate. These results illustrate new criteria for the identification of GPIs. The labeled GPIs also contained radiomethylated ethanolamine, another component found in GPI anchors of proteins and in mature lipid precursors of GPI anchors, suggesting that the liver plasma membrane GPIs retained considerable structural homology to GPI anchors."
https://openalex.org/W1584903823,"Extracellular cAMP serves as a chemoattractant as well as a signal which regulates gene expression during development of Dictyostelium discoideum. The cell adhesion molecule gp80 is expressed at the aggregation stage, between 6 and 10 h of development, and is known to be under cAMP regulation. Transcription of the gp80 gene is first turned on at a low, basal level at the preaggregation stage and is then greatly augmented by pulses of low levels of cAMP at the aggregation stage. Using cloned cDNA sequences, we have isolated genomic DNA fragments encompassing the gp80 gene. The gp80 gene has a single open reading frame, with multiple transcription start sites located downstream from a putative TATA box. Several short, repeated sequences in the upstream sequence have also been identified. The cloned 1.3-kilobase upstream DNA was sufficient to confer proper temporal and cAMP regulation on a gp80 minigene reporter in Dictyostelium cells. Deletional analysis of this 5'-flanking DNA led to the mapping of a cAMP-response element (CRE) in the gp80 gene to sequences between -306 and -289 base pairs upstream of the translational start site. Present within this region is a sequence we refer to as box 1 (TGGTGTG). The gp80 box 1-CRE binds specifically to a protein present in nuclear extracts, but binding is abolished when mutations are introduced in the box 1 sequence. The gp80 box 1-CRE shows little sequence homology to CREs of late developmental genes and the expression of gp80 may involve a distinct signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1598352287,"Abstract The effect of the tus protein-terB sequence complex of Escherichia coli on the movement of the SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen)-mediated replication fork during SV40 DNA replication in vitro has been examined. In the monopolymerase and dipolymerase systems, the tus protein-terB complex efficiently blocked the replication fork movement in a polar fashion, as observed in prokaryotic replication systems. With crude cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells, the same polarity of fork arrest was observed, but the block of replication fork movement was inefficient. These results indicate that the structure of the prokaryotic tus protein-terB complex allows it to block replication fork movement in an orientation-dependent manner. We also show that the tus protein-terB complex blocks the 3'----5' helicase action of T antigen in a polar fashion, using substrates comprised of single-stranded M13 DNA with either a 52-base pair (bp) or 29-bp duplex containing the terB sequence. The tus protein-terB complex formed on the 52-bp duplex was less effective than the complex formed on the 29-bp duplex in blocking the helicase action of T antigen. With the 52-bp duplex substrate, T antigen movement was only partially (30%) blocked by the tus protein-terB sequence complex in the active orientation, whereas the E. coli dnaB helicase moving 5'----3' was blocked more than 90% by the complex in the active orientation. However, with the shorter 29-bp duplex substrate, the complex blocked the T antigen helicase activity about 75%, whereas the dnaB helicase activity was completely blocked. Altogether, these results suggest that the T antigen helicase activity, when coupled to DNA replication, is more susceptible to arrest by the tus protein-terB complex than the T antigen functioning as a helicase alone."
https://openalex.org/W1510835878,"Abstract An amiloride binding protein in adult rat and rabbit alveolar type II (ATII) cells was characterized using three different antibodies against epithelial Na+ channel proteins. We found that 1) polyclonal antibodies raised against epithelial Na+ channel proteins from bovine kidney cross-react with a 135-kDa protein in ATII membrane vesicles on Western blots; 2) using the photoreactive amiloride analog, 2'-methoxy-5'-nitrobenzamil (NMBA), in combination with anti-amiloride antibodies, we found that NMBA specifically labeled the same M(r) protein; and 3) monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against anti-amiloride antibodies also recognized this same M(r) protein on Western blots. We also demonstrated a low benzamil affinity binding site (apparent Kd = 370 nM) in rabbit ATII cell membranes and both high and low benzamil affinity binding sites (apparent Kd = 6 nM and 230 nM) in bovine kidney membranes using [3H]Br-benzamil as a ligand. Pharmacological inhibitory profiles for displacing bound [3H]Br-benzamil were also different between ATII cells and bovine kidneys. These observations indicate that adult ATII pneumocytes express a population of epithelial Na+ channels having a low affinity to benzamil and amiloride and a pharmacological inhibitory profile different from that in bovine kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1567280519,"The quaternary structure and binding activity of the murine 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (46MPR) were studied in semi-intact murine cells that overexpress the murine receptor. Chemical cross-linking studies showed that the murine 46MPR exists in monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms in membranes of overexpressing murine cells. Treatment of permeabilized cells with Mn2+ increased the tetramer form of 46MPR, and this tetramerization was reversed by removal of Mn2+. Thus, the divalent cations affected the distribution of receptor among the three forms, favoring tetramerization at the expense of dimer and monomer. Low temperature (4 degrees C) also increases the fraction present as tetramer. The binding assay results show that Mn2+ is required for the 46MPR to achieve and retain the ability to bind ligand at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. Preincubation with Mn2+ produced a 3-fold increase in Man-6-P-specific binding of beta-glucuronidase which paralleled the 3-fold increase in tetramer seen during preincubation with Mn2+. The similarity of the effects of addition and removal of Mn2+ on enzyme binding to the effects of Mn2+ on favoring tetramer formation suggests that divalent cation-dependent tetramerization of the 46MPR contributes to the stimulation of ligand binding to the 46MPR by divalent cations."

Frog brain membranes and membranes from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the cDNA coding for the frog kainate-binding protein (CHO-4 cells) bound kainate with essentially identical affinity (KD values of 1.9 and 2.1 nM, respectively). In both tissues, the affinity for kainate decreased 9-fold in the presence of 100 microM GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate). No specific kainate binding to nontransfected CHO cell membranes was observed. GTP gamma S and GDP were effective inhibitors of kainate binding, while cGMP and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate had no effect in either frog brain membranes or CHO-4 membranes. Pretreatment of CHO-4 cell membranes with pertussis toxin led to a 34% decrease in kainate binding. Kainate increased the binding of [3H]5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate by 61%, and the rate of GTP hydrolysis by up to 5-fold. These results indicate that the kainate receptor cloned from frog brain can interact functionally with a G protein present in CHO-4 cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1507406473,"Transducin, a retinal G-protein, has been shown to exist as heterotrimers of alpha (39,000), beta (36,000), and gamma (approximately 7,000) subunits. Blue Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography of a transducin preparation extracted with a metal-free, low salt buffer containing GTP showed three distinct alpha and two distinct beta gamma activities in frog (Rana catesbeiana) rod outer segment. The binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog in these alpha fractions was proportional to the amount of the M(r) 39,000 protein. The first alpha was eluted in a complex with an inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase, but alpha subunits in the second and the third fractions were not complexed with any proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and characterization with regard to the interaction with the inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase suggested that the first and the second alpha s were the same protein; however, the third alpha showed different characters as follows. We designated alpha in the first two fractions as alpha 1, and alpha in the third fraction as alpha 2. Nonlinear regression analysis for the binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog to both alpha subunits revealed a single class of GTP binding sites with an apparent stoichiometry of 1 mol of GTP/mol of alpha. Compared with alpha 1, alpha 2 required larger amounts of rhodopsin and beta gamma for the binding of a hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog. alpha 2 also showed less binding with the inhibitory subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase. Both alpha 1 and alpha 2 complexed with beta gamma or beta delta (described below) were substrates for pertussis toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation. The protein profiles of two beta gamma fractions revealed that the main fraction was composed of a beta gamma complex; however, the second active fraction was composed of beta complexed with delta (M(r) 12,000). Compared with beta gamma, beta delta stimulated GTP binding to alpha 1 at approximately 10-fold higher concentration. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed five beta and two gamma isoforms in beta gamma. Only one beta isoform was present in beta delta. The diversity of transducin subunits may reflect different signaling pathways in visual signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1520005541,"Since iodination of the tyrosine residue in the pressin ring of vasopressins abolishes binding to the V2 (renal) isoreceptor, the low specific activity tritiated vasopressins have been the only radioligands available for this receptor. Alternative vasopressin radioligands are described in the present study. N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl- (N-t-Boc) 125I-tyrosine or [35S]methionine were conjugated to the 8th amino acid of lysine- (LVP) or deamino-ornithine-vasopressin via active succinimidyl esters. Following the purification on C-18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, t-Boc removal, and a second high pressure liquid chromatography purification, specific activities of 2200 and 1300 Ci/mmol were obtained for the 125I- and the 35S-labeled ligands, respectively. These vasopressin analogues, conjugated outside the pressin ring, were found to bind with high affinity to the V1A (vascular) and V2 vasopressin isoreceptors (Kd less than or equal to 10(-9) M) and to retain the full biological activity of intact vasopressin. The present study demonstrates the possibility of producing high specific activity radioligands with high affinity for the V1A and V2 vasopressin isoreceptors by conjugating labeled moieties to the 8th amino acid of vasopressin analogues. Since these new radioligands have specific activities much higher than the tritiated ligands (1300-2200 versus 10-30 Ci/mmol), they should provide considerable advantages in the future study of the physiology and biochemistry of the AVP receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1592563636,"Differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing light microscopy have been used to investigate kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the phase behavior of cholesteryl ester contained in Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells and J774 murine macrophages. These cultured cells store cholesteryl esters as cytoplasmic inclusions of approximately 1-micron diameter and thus are models of the foam cells characteristic of atherosclerotic plaque. Simple binary mixtures of cholesteryl palmitate and cholesteryl oleate, the predominant cholesteryl esters in cellular inclusions in both cell types serve as models to explain important aspects of the phase behavior of these inclusions. Although inclusions should exist as stable crystals at 37 degrees C under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, microscopic examination of cells indicates that inclusions exist as metastable liquid crystals at 37 degrees C for extended periods of time. Using an analytical model based on nucleation theory, we predict that the cholesteryl ester inclusions should be liquid-crystalline in the cytoplasm of living cells. This may not be true either for lysosomal cholesteryl ester or for extracellular cholesteryl ester present in advanced atherosclerotic plaque where fusion of droplets can enhance the possibility of crystallization. The enhanced metastability of the relatively fluid liquid-crystalline state in cellular inclusions should result in increased activity of the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541036298,"Abstract Low temperature photolysis of nitric oxide from the nitrosyl complexes of ferric cytochrome P450scc was examined by EPR spectroscopy to elucidate the stereochemical interaction between heme-bound ligand and side-chain of cholesterol or its hydroxylated analogues at the substrate-binding site. The photoproducts of the NO complexes trapped at 5 K exhibited new EPR absorptions providing information on the steric crowding of the distal heme moiety. Without substrate, the photoproduct exhibited a broad EPR absorption at g-8 due to magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the photo-dissociated NO (S = 1/2) and the ferric iron (S = 5/2). This indicates that the photo-dissociated NO can move far away from the heme iron in the less restricted distal heme moiety of the substrate-free cytochrome P450scc. In the presence of substrates, such as cholesterol, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol, the EPR spectra of the photoproducts exhibited many variations having broad g-8 absorptions and/or the widespread signals together with zero-field absorption. Among the steroid complexes used, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol complex exhibited a conspicuously widespread EPR signal with a distinct zero-field absorption due to a spin-coupled interaction between the ferric iron (S = 5/2) and the photolyzed NO (S = 1/2). These results indicate that the 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol complex has restricted substrate-binding structure and that the hydroxylation of the cholesterol side-chain at the 22R position is necessary to proceed the side-chain cleavage reaction properly in cytochrome P450scc."
