https://openalex.org/W1974012180,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process important for cell fate determination. Fibroblasts, a product of EMT, can be reset into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via exogenous transcription factors but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that the generation of iPSCs from mouse fibroblasts requires a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) orchestrated by suppressing pro-EMT signals from the culture medium and activating an epithelial program inside the cells. At the transcriptional level, Sox2/Oct4 suppress the EMT mediator Snail, c-Myc downregulates TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta receptor 2, and Klf4 induces epithelial genes including E-cadherin. Blocking MET impairs the reprogramming of fibroblasts whereas preventing EMT in epithelial cells cultured with serum can produce iPSCs without Klf4 and c-Myc. Our work not only establishes MET as a key cellular mechanism toward induced pluripotency, but also demonstrates iPSC generation as a cooperative process between the defined factors and the extracellular milieu.

Temporal gene expression reveals three phases during somatic cell reprogramming Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) is a hallmark of the initiation phase RNAi screening defines MET and BMP signaling as essential for reprogramming BMP induces miR-200 family miRNAs to drive MET and somatic cell reprogramming The capacity of differentiated cells to reacquire a totipotent state was first revealed when the nuclei of differentiated cells were reprogrammed in enucleated oocytes to generate frogs (Gurdon, 1964Gurdon J.B. The transplantation of living cell nuclei.Adv. Morphog. 1964; 4: 1-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of just four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc, and Sox2 (OKMS), is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

Fully reprogrammed iPSCs have a similar developmental potential as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and can contribute extensively to the three germ layers and the germline (Zhao and Daley, 2008Zhao R.

At the molecular level, reprogramming results in large changes in gene expression that remodel the somatic cell properties to a state similar to embryonic stem cells (Maherali et al., 2007Maherali N.

Nanog is a component of the stem cell regulatory network that is critical for acquiring the pluripotent state during somatic cell reprogramming (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W.

Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Furthermore, failure to suppress differentiation-associated genes or block differentiation signals leads to incomplete reprogramming (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Although a considerable amount is known about the transcriptional networks that regulate ESCs, relatively little is known of the signaling pathways that integrate intrinsic and extrinsic cues to maintain the pluripotent state and control reprogramming. TGF-β-related factors that include the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are an important family of morphogens that regulate cell fate decisions in stem cells (Varga and Wrana, 2005Varga A.C. Wrana J.L. The disparate role of BMP in stem cell biology.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5713-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the BMP pathway, ligand binding to the heterotetrameric complexes of type II and type I receptors leads to phosphorylation of receptor-regulated R-Smads 1, 5, and 8 that in turn bind to Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription (Attisano and Wrana, 2002Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Signal transduction by the TGF-beta superfamily.Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). In mouse ES cells (mESCs), BMP signaling together with leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF) signaling is important for maintaining the pluripotent state (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar), whereas TGF-β/Activin signaling is critical in human ESCs and mouse stem cells that are derived from the epiblast (EpiSC) (Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Mendjan S. Brown S. Chng Z. Teo A. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Cho C.H. Martinez A. Rugg-Gunn P. et al.Activin/Nodal signalling maintains pluripotency by controlling Nanog expression.Development. 2009; 136: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β receptor-specific small molecule antagonists were recently shown to promote reprogramming by promoting Sox2- and Myc-dependent functions (Ichida et al., 2009Ichida J.K. Blanchard J. Lam K. Son E.Y. Chung J.E. Egli D. Loh K.M. Carter A.C. Di Giorgio F.P.

Biol. 2009; 19: 1718-1723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TGF-β and BMPs may thus play important regulative roles in controlling distinct stem cell states and reprogramming. Understanding the process of reprogramming and in particular the signaling networks that control progression to a stable pluripotent state has been hampered in part by the low frequency of the event. Here we employed mouse iPSCs generated with a piggyBac transposon system that expresses OKMS in a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible manner (Woltjen et al., 2009Woltjen K. Michael I.P. Mohseni P. Desai R. Mileikovsky M. Hämäläinen R. Cowling R. Wang W. Liu P. Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (2° MEFs) from piggyBac iPSC-derived chimeras reprogram efficiently, thus allowing us to apply temporal gene expression profiling coupled to a functional siRNA screen to dissect mechanisms underlying the early stages of reprogramming. This integrative approach reveals three phases of reprogramming that we term initiation, maturation, and stabilization and uncovers an early mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) that marks initiation. Furthermore, we show that BMP signaling synergizes with OKMS to induce a microRNA (miRNA, miR-) expression signature that is associated with MET and promotes progression through the initiation phase. These studies unveil broad temporal alterations in gene expression during reprogramming and define a critical initiation phase that is regulated by a BMP-miRNA-MET signaling axis. Reprogramming of primary murine somatic cells by ectopic expression of OKMS occurs at low frequency, making the molecular characterization of reprogramming difficult. However, reprogramming occurs in secondary systems with much higher efficiencies (Maherali et al., 2008Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Rigamonti A. Utikal J. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K.

Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Recently, we established a reprogramming system with Dox-regulated OKMS transgenes delivered via piggyBac transposition (Woltjen et al., 2009Woltjen K. Michael I.P. Mohseni P. Desai R. Mileikovsky M. Hämäläinen R. Cowling R. Wang W. Liu P. Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice from two primary iPSC lines (6C and 1B) were used to isolate chimeric 2° MEF lines (2°-6C and 2°-1B MEFs) in which the GFP+, iPSC-derived 2° MEFs reprogrammed with high efficiency upon Dox induction (see schematic, Figure 1A ). We confirmed the pluripotency of iPSCs derived from the 2°-6C MEFs via embryoid body assays, teratomas, and contribution to diploid chimeric embryos (Figure S1 available online). iPSCs derived from 2°-1B MEFs also contributed extensively to adult chimeric mice (Figure S1E). Thus, secondary iPSCs generated from the piggyBac system are pluripotent, like their primary counterparts. Because our secondary iPSC system reprograms with high efficiency (Woltjen et al., 2009Woltjen K. Michael I.P. Mohseni P. Desai R. Mileikovsky M. Hämäläinen R. Cowling R. Wang W. Liu P. Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), we sought to characterize changes in the transcriptome during reprogramming of 2°-6C cell line by microarray analysis at 2, 5, 8, 11, 16, and 21 days after OKMS induction (Table S2). Comparison of the starting MEF population and their iPSC progeny revealed 4,252 genes, out of the 13,389 genes detected, changed expression more than 2-fold with 3,520 genes upregulated and only 732 downregulated. Of these, 61% were the same as those identified in a previous analysis of MEF reprogramming (Sridharan et al., 2009Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K. Role of the murine reprogramming factors in the induction of pluripotency.Cell. 2009; 136: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), indicating good concordance between the two studies. We next analyzed the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the transcriptional profile, which showed increasing similarity to the primary iPSC profile through the course of reprogramming (Figure 1B), and unsupervised clustering revealed segregation into temporally distinct early, middle, and late phases (Figure 1B). To further resolve these temporal changes, we clustered genes based on when expression changes occurred (Figure 1C). This showed that a large number of genes changed expression early in the time course of reprogramming (clusters I and II), as well as distinct subsets of genes that were altered at later time points. Embryonic stem cell-associated genes clustered into either the middle or late phases (Table S1) and their patterns of expression were validated by qPCR (Figure S2A). Nanog, an exemplar of the middle cluster, initiated expression after day 5 and then rapidly climbed to a high level that was sustained throughout the reprogramming time course, peaking in 2°-6C iPSCs at levels comparable to primary 6C iPSCs (Figure S2A). Sall4 and Esrrb shared Nanog's expression pattern. Similarly, Rex1, Tcl1, Nodal, and Cripto were expressed at high level in the middle phase although their expression initiated slightly later. In contrast, the late-phase cluster was characterized by induction of Dnmt3l, Lin28, Utf1, and slightly later by Pecam, Stella, and Dppa4 (Furusawa et al., 2006Furusawa T. Ikeda M. Inoue F.

Schwartz P.H. et al.Regulatory networks define phenotypic classes of human stem cell lines.Nature. 2008; 455: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies reveal three phases during OKMS-induced MEF reprogramming that we refer to as initiation, maturation, and stabilization (Figure S2B). Interestingly, no embryonic stem cell factors were expressed in the initiation phase, while the maturation phase, as marked by the beginning of Nanog, Sall4, Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, Cripto, and Nodal expression, occurred at approximately day 8, and the stabilization phase, marked by Dnmt3l, Lin28, Utf1, Pecam, Stella, and Dppa4, started at around day 21. Nanog drives the broad changes in the transcriptional program that are associated with the acquisition of pluripotency (Mitsui et al., 2003Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S.

Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Nanog is not expressed until after day 5 in our reprogramming system, suggesting that the initiation phase might not be self-sustaining. Indeed, SSEA1 induction and morphological changes induced by OKMS are rapidly lost when OKMS expression is suppressed early in reprogramming (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether the initiation phase was elastic, thus allowing cells to reattain their parental gene expression profile upon OKMS removal. For this, we induced OKMS for 5 days, followed by 5 days of OKMS withdrawal (Figure 1D). Comparative analysis by PCC (Figure 1D) revealed that 2°-1B and 2°-6C parental MEFs were most similar to each other (PCC = 0.97) and to primary MEFs (PCC = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). OKMS induction led to a divergence of the gene expression profile of 2°-1B cells (PCC = 0.86), with 3421 genes altered greater than 2-fold. Remarkably, after OKMS withdrawal, 88% of these genes reverted back to expression levels observed in the starting MEF population (Figure S2C; Figure 1D; PCC = 0.97). These results indicate that the initiation phase is not self-sustaining and is elastic, thus allowing rapid reversion to a differentiated state once OKMS expression is removed. The molecular events in the early phases of reprogramming are poorly understood. We therefore focused on the initiation phase, which is induced over the first 5 days of reprogramming, and noted induction of a large number of epithelial-associated genes. These genes include the epithelial junctional protein E-cadherin (Cdh1), as well as Cldns -3, -4, -7, -11, Occludin (Ocln), Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Epcam), and Crumbs homolog 3 (Crb3), all of which are components of epithelial junctions (Figure 1C). These results, which were validated by qPCR (Figure 2A ), led us to investigate the expression of the mesenchymal regulators: Zn finger transcription factors Snail, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2. These factors maintain the mesenchymal phenotype by directly repressing epithelial gene expression (Thiery et al., 2009Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). Consistent with the gain of epithelial-like markers, these transcription factors were repressed in reprogramming 2°-6C cultures and paralleled the loss of the fibroblast markers Cdh2 and Thy1 (Figure 2A). These findings suggest that initiation of MEF reprogramming involves a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). To confirm this, we initiated reprogramming for 5 days and stained early reprogramming colonies with phalloidin, which stains F-actin, together with β-catenin and Cdh1, both of which mark adherence junctions (Figure 2B). In parental MEFs, F-actin was organized into stress fibers characteristic of fibroblasts, Cdh1 expression was undetectable, and β-catenin was diffusely cytosolic and localized to puncta. In contrast, after OKMS induction, colonies with cortical F-actin and both β-catenin and Cdh1 in cell junctional regions were readily apparent, similar to fully reprogrammed 2°-6C iPSC colonies (Figure 2B, arrows). At 5 days, all colonies were positive for AP and SSEA1, both markers of early reprogramming (Figures S3A and S3B). To further confirm MET in reprogramming cells, we FACS-sorted SSEA1-positive (SSEA1+) cells 5, 8, and 11 days after OKMS induction and observed that Cdh1, Epcam, Crb3, and Ocln were all strongly induced in SSEA1+ cells (Figure 2C). We confirmed that these cells also express Nanog, Sall4, and Oct4, but not until day 8 (Figure S3C). Conversely, Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2 were all strongly repressed. The initiation phase of fibroblast reprogramming is thus characterized by a coordinated MET that precedes the upregulation of ESC markers. To understand how the transcriptional program induced by OKMS drives the initiation phase of reprogramming, we next devised a systematic genetic RNAi screen with 2°-6C cells. To optimize assay parameters, we used Oct4 siRNA as a positive control and dharmacon control siRNA and Nanog siRNA, which is not induced until after initiation, as negative controls. After transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of Dox for 5 days, after which colonies were stained for AP, an early marker of pluripotency (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R.

Knockdown of Oct4, which is expressed from the integrated piggyBac transposon, inhibited colony formation (Figure S4A). In contrast, Nanog siRNA had no effect, consistent with its lack of expression at this early phase. We then developed an automated image analysis strategy to identify colonies based on the distribution of nuclei and AP counterstaining (Figure 3A) and optimized parameters via mock, control, Nanog, and Oct4 transfectants (Figure S4B). Because of the limited proliferative potential of primary cells, we were not able to conduct a genome-wide screen, so we generated a custom siRNA library that targets all signaling genes, transcription factors, and chromatin regulators (4010 genes; Table S3). Each siRNA was assessed in replicate, the results were averaged, and those with less than 15% covariance plotted (Figure 3B). Only 413 siRNA showed covariance greater than 15%, indicating excellent concordance between replicates and a robust screen. Analysis of screen data revealed that knockdown of four Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc, and Sox2, that were present in the library suppressed reprogramming to varying extents (Figure 3B). Of note, p53 knockdown enhanced formation of colonies (Figure S4C), consistent with recent studies showing that p53 suppresses reprogramming (Zhao and Xu, 2010Zhao T. Xu Y. p53 and stem cells: New developments and new concerns.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 170-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To gain mechanistic insight into key events required for progression through the initiation phase, we explored the siRNAs that suppressed or abolished colony formation. Interestingly, analysis of genes associated with MET revealed that siRNAs targeting Cdh1 and the polarity complex components, Par3 and Crb3, all strongly suppressed the appearance of AP-positive reprogramming colonies (Figure 3C). These findings suggest that MET is a functionally important early event during reprogramming. We also wanted to gain insight into signaling pathways that might regulate initiation and found that knockdown of Smad1, which is a key transcriptional mediator of signaling by BMPs, suppressed formation of AP-positive colonies (Figure 3D). Furthermore, knockdown of the Smad1 partner, Smad4, also inhibited reprogramming, as did knockdown of the BMP type II receptor, BMPRII, and the BMP type I receptor, ALK3 (Figure 3D). We confirmed that the siRNA pools to both the epithelial and BMP pathway components efficiently knocked down their targets and tested the individual siRNAs that comprise the pool, most of which efficiently reduced expression of their target and inhibited reprogramming (Figure S5). These results suggest that efficient progression through the initiation phase of reprogramming is dependent on MET and BMP signal transduction. Our functional genomics screen implicated the BMP pathway as a key regulator of reprogramming initiation, though no exogenous BMP is added to the media. However, BMP derived from serum, the cocultured MEFs, or the reprogramming cells themselves might activate the pathway. To examine this, we analyzed the receptor-activated form of Smad1 with a phosphospecific antibody, which revealed strong Smad1 activation in reprogramming MEFs that was blocked by the BMP receptor antagonist, dorsomorphin (Figure 4A ). Dorsomorphin has poor specificity, so we also used the soluble BMP ligand antagonists Noggin (Herrera and Inman, 2009Herrera B. Inman G.J. A rapid and sensitive bioassay for the simultaneous measurement of multiple bone morphogenetic proteins. Identification and quantification of BMP4, BMP6 and BMP9 in bovine and human serum.BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the extracellular domain of ALK1 (A1ECD) (David et al., 2008David L. Mallet C. Keramidas M. Lamandé N. Gasc J.M. Dupuis-Girod S. Plauchu H. Feige J.J. Bailly S. Bone morphogenetic protein-9 is a circulating vascular quiescence factor.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Each alone decreased Smad1 activation, while together they strongly suppressed the pathway. Thus, intrinsic BMP signaling occurs during the initiation phase of reprogramming. We next examined whether supplementing BMP or suppressing intrinsic BMP signaling with Noggin/A1ECD-modulated reprogramming. In the absence of OKMS expression, BMP2, BMP7, or BMP9 failed to induce AP in 2°-6C MEFs, whereas they enhanced AP-positive colonies in the presence of Dox-induced OKMS (Figure S6A). Similarly, FACS analysis revealed 41% of OKMS-expressing cells were SSEA1+ by day 5, while BMP7 strongly enhanced the proportion to 68% of the population (Figures 4B and 4C). In stark contrast, only 26% of Noggin/A1ECD-treated cells were SSEA1+ and almost no SSEA1+ colonies were observed (Figures 4B and 4C). Of note, SSEA1 was not induced by BMP7 in the absence of OKMS (Figure S6B). Finally, we examined primary MEFs transfected with OKMS-expressing piggyBac transposons and observed that 2 nM BMP7 stimulated formation of reprogramming colonies by 3-fold (Figure 4D). We also confirmed that reprogrammed primary iPSCs, which were treated with BMP7 during the initiation phase, successfully produced adult chimeric mice (Figure 4E). Our results show that BMP signaling promotes the early stage of reprogramming. This was not due to regulation of proliferation as assessed by phospho-histone H3 (Figure S6Ci) and CyQuant staining (Figure S6Cii). However, Sall4, Nanog, and endogenous Oct4 all showed enhanced expression upon BMP stimulation that was reduced by BMP antagonism (Figure 5A ). Importantly, these genes were not induced by BMP in the absence of OKMS induction. BMP thus synergizes with OKMS to stimulate the onset of Nanog and Sall4 expression. Nanog is required for (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, hippocampal/prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward predicting activity in prefrontal networks, tagging it for subsequent memory consolidation.

Hippocampal-prefrontal theta LFP coherence increases at the Y maze fork upon learning Pfc interneuron inhibition of pyramidal neurons increases during high coherence Pfc neurons shift phase relative to hippocampal theta leading to assembly activation Acute dopamine injection in Pfc replicates coherence increases and phase shifts Selective communication between brain areas is a key component of the neural processing underlying cognition. This information exchange must adapt to the current situation and brain state, with functional networks continuously forming and disbanding (Fell et al., 2001Fell J. Klaver P. Lehnertz K. Grunwald T.

This would help filter and select signals to be processed and transmitted to other areas, possibly supported by the emergence of highly synchronized activations of cell groups or cell assemblies representing a highly effective input for afferent structures (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley & Sons, New York1949Google Scholar, Fries, 2005Fries P. A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence.Trends Cogn.

The resulting dialog would drive plastic changes in short- and long-range synaptic connections and contribute to create widespread integrated representations of items and experiences, selecting and retaining the information most valuable for adaptive behavior. Such valence and salience information is thought to be transmitted by neuromodulators such as dopamine, which could act as a reward prediction (error) signal (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P.

Brain rhythms are likely to be a fundamental mechanism for modulating, filtering, and redirecting information in the nervous system: neural circuits are naturally predisposed to oscillate in a wide range of frequencies (Buzsáki, 2004Buzsáki G. Large-scale recording of neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Oscillations are a key mechanism of dynamical coupling between brain areas: task- and state-dependent changes are observed in local field potential (LFP) coherence (Fell et al., 2001Fell J. Klaver P. Lehnertz K. Grunwald T. Schaller C. Elger C.E. Fernández G. Human memory formation is accompanied by rhinal-hippocampal coupling and decoupling.Nat.

Fries P. Singer W. Dynamic predictions: oscillations and synchrony in top-down processing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). From the functional point of view, synchronizing and desynchronizing activity between two brain areas exert dramatic effects on their ability to engage or effectively block out one another's input (Womelsdorf et al., 2007Womelsdorf T. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Singer W. Desimone R. Engel A.K. Fries P. Modulation of neuronal interactions through neuronal synchronization.Science. 2007; 316: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Within individual brain areas, oscillations can synchronize neurons, creating coherent cell assemblies (Harris et al., 2003Harris K.D. Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Dragoi G. Buzsáki G. Organization of cell assemblies in the hippocampus.Nature. 2003; 424: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and favoring plasticity processes depending on the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity (Markram et al., 1997Markram H.

Hebbian STDP in mushroom bodies facilitates the synchronous flow of olfactory information in locusts.Nature. 2007; 448: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying such synchronization-induced modifications of local functional circuitry. Here, we will examine learning-related changes in oscillatory coherence between hippocampus and Pfc and associated changes in Pfc local circuitry, which will be shown to closely resemble the effects of local application of dopamine. The hippocampus-neocortex network is a primary conduit for cerebral information flow for learning and memory. Anatomically located at the top of the cortical hierarchy (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5141) Google Scholar), the hippocampus (Hpc) was proposed to create “pointer” representations, linking together activity in multiple cortical areas pertaining to the same context and facilitating the formation of permanent cortical episodic memory traces (Eichenbaum, 2000Eichenbaum H.

Neurosci. 2005; 6: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Effective communication between the hippocampus and the neocortex involves oscillations: for example, transient synchronization at gamma (30-80 Hz) frequencies between the Hpc and the rhinal cortex accompanies successful memory encoding (Fell et al., 2001Fell J. Klaver P. Lehnertz K. Grunwald T. Schaller C. Elger C.E. Fernández G. Human memory formation is accompanied by rhinal-hippocampal coupling and decoupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Pfc, which receives monosynaptic hippocampal projections (Jay and Witter, 1991Jay T.M. Witter M.P. Distribution of hippocampal CA1 and subicular efferents in the prefrontal cortex of the rat studied by means of anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin.J. Comp.

Hippocampo-prefrontal cortex pathway: anatomical and electrophysiological characteristics.Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), has been shown to be functionally connected to the hippocampus: Hpc theta (5–10 Hz) synchronizes medial prefrontal cortex (Pfc) neurons (Siapas et al., 2005Siapas A.G.

Medial prefrontal cortex cells show dynamic modulation with the hippocampal theta rhythm dependent on behavior.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) depending on task demands (Jones and Wilson, 2005Jones M.W. Wilson M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), possibly supporting corticohippocampal maintenance of working memory (Floresco et al., 1997Floresco S.B. Seamans J.K. Phillips A.G. Selective roles for hippocampal, prefrontal cortical, and ventral striatal circuits in radial-arm maze tasks with or without a delay.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1880-1890PubMed Google Scholar). This study examines changes in synchronization of Hpc and Pfc LFPs and single and ensemble Pfc neuron activity in rats learning and flexibly switching between rules. If oscillatory coherence plays a role in memory encoding and acquisition, it would be expected to vary with learning, and to be associated with the creation of neural substrates of memories, possibly in the form of functionally linked cell assemblies (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley & Sons, New York1949Google Scholar). If those cell assemblies carry relevant information, then they should be more readily consolidated into long-term memory (Peyrache et al., 2009bPeyrache A. Khamassi M. Benchenane K. Wiener S.I. Battaglia F.P. Replay of rule-learning related neural patterns in the prefrontal cortex during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These hypotheses are examined here. However, the mechanism by which these assemblies would be “tagged” at acquisition is not known, and evidence will be put forward for this in the form of coherence-induced and (possibly dopamine influenced) creation of learning-related, reward-predictive cell assemblies that are tightly synchronized, permitting their stabilization by spike-time dependent plasticity. We recorded a total of 1475 Pfc neurons (see Figure S1 available online) in 60 experimental sessions in four rats as they successively learned two reward contingency rules on a Y maze: go to the arm on the right and then go to the lit arm (selected at random at each trial; Figures S2A and S2B). LFPs were recorded in the pyramidal layer of ventral/intermediate hippocampal CA1, while multielectrode single-unit spike activity and LFPs were recorded in medial Pfc (Figure S1A–S1D). Strong 5–10 Hz theta band LFP activity was detectible in both Hpc and Pfc (Jones and Wilson, 2005Jones M.W. Wilson M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Hyman et al., 2005Hyman J.M. Zilli E.A. Paley A.M. Hasselmo M.E. Medial prefrontal cortex cells show dynamic modulation with the hippocampal theta rhythm dependent on behavior.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar; Figures 1A and 1B ). Strong Hpc-Pfc spectral coherence was observed in the theta frequency range (Figures 1A and 1B). Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence fluctuated, with no simple relation with either theta power in the two structures or with rat motion (Figures 1A and S2). On a trial-by-trial basis, coherence at the decision point did not correlate with running speed (r = 0.04, p > 0.05), which correlates with Hpc theta amplitude (Ekstrom et al., 2001Ekstrom A.D. Meltzer J. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. NMDA receptor antagonism blocks experience-dependent expansion of hippocampal “place fields”.Neuron. 2001; 31: 631-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or with acceleration (r = 0.01, p > 0.05; see Figure S2). The phase lag between Hpc and Pfc theta rhythm was 40 ± 4 ms, similar to previous reports (Jones and Wilson, 2005Jones M.W. Wilson M.A. Phase precession of medial prefrontal cortical activity relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and compatible with Pfc response latencies to stimulation of the Hpc (Dégenètais et al., 2003Dégenètais E. Thierry A.M. Glowinski J. Gioanni Y. Synaptic influence of hippocampus on pyramidal cells of the rat prefrontal cortex: an in vivo intracellular recording study.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 782-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, while the mechanism underlying this coherence is not known, it would nonetheless dramatically augment prefrontal receptivity to hippocampal signals. To control for potential contamination of LFP coherence measures by volume conduction artifacts (Sirota et al., 2008Sirota A. Montgomery S. Fujisawa S. Isomura Y. Zugaro M. Buzsáki G. Entrainment of neocortical neurons and gamma oscillations by the hippocampal theta rhythm.Neuron. 2008; 60: 683-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), we compared LFP-LFP coherence with LFP-spikes coherence in the same structures (Womelsdorf et al., 2007Womelsdorf T. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Singer W. Desimone R. Engel A.K. Fries P. Modulation of neuronal interactions through neuronal synchronization.Science. 2007; 316: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B, 1C, S1E and S1F). Of the 1373 Pfc neurons with average firing rates exceeding 0.01 Hz, 541 (39%) were significantly modulated by Hpc theta (p < 0.05, Rayleigh test). Coherence of Pfc spikes to Hpc LFP is most marked in the theta range (Figures 1B and 1C). Moreover, the time courses of coherence of prefrontal LFP and spike trains with hippocampal LFP show peak correlations in the theta frequency range, both for single prefrontal units (Figures 1B and 1C) and when all theta-modulated cells in a session are considered (Figures S1E and S1F). In the latter case, the correlation reached significance in the theta range only (Figure S1F). Thus, local Pfc circuits are likely to be involved in the expression of coherence with Hpc theta both at the LFP and spike train levels. Coherence peaked when the rat was at the fork of the Y maze (Figures 2A and 2B ). Strikingly, the increase of coherence at the choice point was significantly greater after acquisition of a new rule (Figures 2C–2E; Right, n = 123; Light, n = 148, two-way ANOVA, factors: before/after learning (L) and position on maze (P); Right, main effects: L: p < 0.01, P: p < 10−5, interaction p < 0.02; Light, main effects L: p < 10−4, P: p < 10−5, interaction p < 0.01). This effect was observed for LFPs recorded in both superficial and deep layers of Pfc (Figure S2C). Similarly, Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence at the choice point was higher at a learning stage when the rat reliably complied with the rewarded rule (compared with trials prior to criterion performance; Figure 2F, t test, p < 0.05), as assessed by high values of the “certainty” measure developed by Smith et al., 2004Smith A.C. Frank L.M. Wirth S. Yanike M. Hu D. Kubota Y. Graybiel A.M. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Dynamic analysis of learning in behavioral experiments.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar. This was not merely due to the higher incidence of rewards after rule acquisition, since, when considering only trials prior to this, coherence was not significantly different between rewarded and unrewarded trials (Figure 2G; n = 271, t test, p > 0.05). These results, taken together, suggest that Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence is a predictor of the rat's performance level: indeed, we show that trials with high coherence had, on average, a high level of performance, whereas in trials with low decision point coherence, rats operated at only slightly better than chance level (Figure 2H). Because coherence was elevated upon learning and functional connectivity in the Pfc network increases with learning (Baeg et al., 2007Baeg E.H. Kim Y.B. Kim J. Ghim J.W. Kim J.J. Jung M.W. Learning-induced enduring changes in functional connectivity among prefrontal cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we tested for changes in activity correlations in simultaneously recorded prefrontal neurons during high Hpc-Pfc-θ coherence episodes. During high coherence periods the distribution of correlation coefficients between all simultaneously recorded neurons pairs shifted relative to low coherence periods (Figure 3A , Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, p < 0.05 each day). During high coherence, cell pairs with elevated correlation values appeared (Figure S3A). This reveals a profound modification in the dynamics of the prefrontal neuronal network when Hpc-Pfc-θ coherence is high. The increase in significant correlations in cell pairs during high (versus low) Hpc-Pfc-θ coherence periods was restricted to those Pfc neurons modulated by Hpc theta (Figure 3B; n = 32, two-way ANOVA with factors theta modulation and high/low coherence: effect of interaction p < 0.05 and post hoc t test, p < 0.01). In contrast, pairs of neurons with one or both not modulated by Hpc theta showed no significant change in coactivation during high coherence periods (Figure 3B). In the five sessions with new rule acquisition (and at least 20 simultaneously recorded neurons), only after rule acquisition, but not before, were pairs of theta-modulated neurons more likely to be significantly correlated than pairs of neurons without theta modulation (Figures 3C and S3; n = 5 two-way ANOVA with factors high/low coherence and before/after learning and post-hoc t test, p < 0.05). Thus, rule acquisition corresponded to increased coactivation within subpopulations of Hpc modulated Pfc neurons. The increased activity correlations held at two time scales, whether firing rates were binned at 30 ms or by theta cycle (approximately 125 ms) time windows (Figure S3). This indicates that, during high coherence periods, theta modulated cell pairs tend to fire together within the same theta cycle, as well as at a shorter time scale. The network reorganization during high Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence suggested by the results in Figure 3 may reflect not just coactive pairs of neurons, but rather synchronization of activity in subgroups of neurons, or cell assemblies, as proposed by Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior. Wiley & Sons, New York1949Google Scholar. Neuronal groups that coactivate reliably and hence act as cell assemblies can be extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the matrix of binned simultaneously recorded spike trains (Chapin and Nicolelis, 1999Chapin J.K.

Battaglia F.P. Replay of rule-learning related neural patterns in the prefrontal cortex during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and the time course of their activation can be calculated from the principal component (PC) scores of the instantaneous population vectors (see Experimental Procedures; Peyrache et al., 2009aPeyrache A. Benchenane K. Khamassi M. Wiener S.I. Battaglia F.P. Principal component analysis of ensemble recordings reveals cell assemblies at high temporal resolution.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2009; (in press.

Battaglia F.P. Replay of rule-learning related neural patterns in the prefrontal cortex during sleep.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Since pairwise correlations increased during high Hpc-Pfc-θ coherence periods, PCA was applied to 30 ms bins of spike trains of units simultaneously recorded then, and the strongest components were retained (see Experimental Procedures). The signs of the coefficients of each PC distinguished two neuronal populations: cells with high weights and same sign coefficients which fire together, and cells with high weights but opposite signs which are anti-correlated (Figure S4A). Thus, the projection of the recorded coactivation onto the PC at each time bin describes the temporal evolution of the activation of the neuronal assembly (Peyrache et al., 2009aPeyrache A. Benchenane K. Khamassi M. Wiener S.I. Battaglia F.P. Principal component analysis of ensemble recordings reveals cell assemblies at high temporal resolution.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2009; (in press. Published online June 16, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-009-0154-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Figure S4A and S4B). Figure 4A shows examples of time courses of PC activations (see Experimental Procedures), showing high, transient peaks occurring over a very low background. These peaks correspond to the coordinated activation of those cells with elevated, positive weights in the PC (displayed in the upper rasters), and occurred during periods of high Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence. The transient nature of PC activation time courses (Peyrache et al., 2009aPeyrache A. Benchenane K. Khamassi M. Wiener S.I. Battaglia F.P. Principal component analysis of ensemble recordings reveals cell assemblies at high temporal resolution.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2009; (in press. Published online June 16, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-009-0154-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was observed throughout the recordings as shown by the elevated tail (relative to power law decay) of the histogram of activation values over time. (Figure S4C and S4D). We therefore termed these strong bouts of coactivation (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B) coherence-related cell assemblies (CRCA). Here, we considered the cells with the five largest coefficients in the PC as taking part in the CRCA, defined as the times in which the PC activation measure exceeded a threshold value of 3 (Figures S4C and S4D). Results did not change when different values of the threshold were considered (Figure S4E). CRCA frequency increased in elevated Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence periods relative to low coherence periods (paired t test p < 10−200; Figure 4B). Similarly to coherence (Figures 2A and 2B), their spatial distribution presented a distinctive peak at the decision point (Figure 4C). We analyzed the phase locking of Pfc CRCA activity to the hippocampal theta rhythm. For each recording session, at least one of the PCs identified a Pfc cell assembly significantly modulated by Hpc theta (i.e., with a significant Rayleigh Z test, p < 0.05). Notably, during high coherence periods, the phases of occurrence of these Pfc CRCAs were concentrated at the trough of theta recorded in both Hpc CA1 stratum pyramidale and in Pfc (n = 92, Rayleigh Z test, p < 10−26), that is, the theta phase at which hippocampal CA1 cell assemblies are principally active (Harris et al., 2003Harris K.D. Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Dragoi G. Buzsáki G. Organization of cell assemblies in the hippocampus.Nature. 2003; 424: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). On the other hand, during low coherence periods, the theta phase of CRCA occurrence was uniformly distributed (Figure 4D). The same result was obtained when PCA extracted assemblies from spike trains grouped by theta cycle (∼125 ms time bins; Figure S5A). This rules out the possibility that these observations could be an artifact due to PCA merely capturing subsets of neurons with similar theta modulation. Moreover, this increased phase locking in high coherence periods was not observed in the general neuronal population. Rather, it was limited to those cell assemblies more strongly active during high coherence periods, because no such effects were observed in PCs with low signal strengths, likely corresponding to ‘noise’ (Peyrache et al., 2009aPeyrache A. Benchenane K. Khamassi M. Wiener S.I. Battaglia F.P. Principal component analysis of ensemble recordings reveals cell assemblies at high temporal resolution.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2009; (in press.

Thus, high Hpc-Pfc-θ-coherence signaled a state in which Hpc and Pfc assemblies are aligned at the same theta phase, possibly favoring interaction. To investigate the neurophysiological processes leading to the formation of CRCA, we analyzed the behavior of the cells with the five largest weight coefficients in the PC (positive and negative), that is, the ones most likely to participate in synchronous firing events. These neurons were then subdivided according to their putative cell type on the basis of action potential duration (Barthó et al., 2004Barthó P. Hirase H. Monconduit L. Zugaro M. Harris K.D.

Although several approaches for the alleviation of tinnitus exist, there is as of yet no cure. The present article proposes a testable model for tinnitus that is grounded in recent findings from human imaging and focuses on brain areas in cortex, thalamus, and ventral striatum. Limbic and auditory brain areas are thought to interact at the thalamic level. While a tinnitus signal originates from lesion-induced plasticity of the auditory pathways, it can be tuned out by feedback connections from limbic regions, which block the tinnitus signal from reaching auditory cortex. If the limbic regions are compromised, this “noise-cancellation” mechanism breaks down, and chronic tinnitus results. Hopefully, this model will ultimately enable the development of effective treatment.

The neuroscience of tinnitus.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 676-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar on the neuroscience of tinnitus, the level of interest in this often debilitating disorder has mounted steadily. This can be attributed to the rising average age of populations in Western countries and increased hearing loss in young people, partly due to the popularity of music players with in-ear loudspeakers. Tinnitus is also one of the most frequently reported problems among veterans returning from two recent armed conflicts, often co-occurring with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although the number of published articles on tinnitus is growing and more funding agencies are now supporting tinnitus research, our basic understanding of the disorder is stagnating (Adjamian et al., 2009Adjamian P.

It has been assumed for some time that most cases of tinnitus are caused by peripheral noise-induced hearing loss followed by changes in the central auditory pathways (Jastreboff, 1990Jastreboff P.J. Phantom auditory perception (tinnitus): mechanisms of generation and perception.Neurosci. Res. 1990; 8: 221-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar).

Using a whole-brain approach, human neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have visualized various regions of hyperactivity in the auditory pathways of tinnitus patients (Arnold et al., 1996Arnold W.

Imaging studies have also demonstrated activation of nonauditory, limbic brain structures, such as hippocampus and amygdala, in tinnitus patients (Eichhammer et al., 2007Eichhammer P. Hajak G.

Final common pathway for tinnitus: theoretical and clinical implications of neuroanatomical substrates.Int. Tinnitus J. 2009; 15: 5-50PubMed Google Scholar). This limbic activation has been interpreted as a reflection of the emotional reaction of tinnitus patients to the tinnitus sound (Jastreboff, 2000Jastreboff P.J. Tinnitus Habituation Therapy (THT) and Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT).in: Tyler R. Handbook on Tinnitus. Singular Publishing Group, San Diego, CA2000: 357-376Google Scholar). As the present article will argue, however, limbic and paralimbic structures may play a more extended role than previously proposed. In our model, efferents from structures in the subcallosal area, which includes the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the ventral striatum and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), are involved in the cancellation of the tinnitus signal at the thalamic level. Although the tinnitus signal may initially be generated in parts of the auditory system, it is the failure of the limbic regions to block this signal that leads to the tinnitus percept becoming chronic. Tinnitus, i.e., hearing a disturbing tone or noise in the absence of a physical sound source, is a phantom sensation (Jastreboff, 1990Jastreboff P.J. Phantom auditory perception (tinnitus): mechanisms of generation and perception.Neurosci. Res. 1990; 8: 221-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) comparable to phantom pain felt in an amputated limb (Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998Ramachandran V.S. Hirstein W. The perception of phantom limbs. The D. O. Hebb lecture.Brain. 1998; 121: 1603-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In both cases, the firing of central neurons in the brain continues to convey perceptual experiences, even though the corresponding sensory receptor cells have been destroyed (Birbaumer et al., 1997Birbaumer N. Lutzenberger W. Montoya P. Larbig W. Unertl K. Töpfner S. Grodd W. Taub E. Flor H. Effects of regional anesthesia on phantom limb pain are mirrored in changes in cortical reorganization.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5503-5508PubMed Google Scholar, Rauschecker, 1999aRauschecker J.P. Auditory cortical plasticity: a comparison with other sensory systems.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 74-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As such, chronic tinnitus is thought to originate from plastic reorganization of auditory cortex following peripheral deafferentation. According to this “remapping” hypothesis, the reorganization process usually begins with a loss of hair cells in the inner ear, a “sensorineural” hearing loss (SNHL). This cochlear lesion can result from acoustic trauma, i.e., loud-noise exposure within a certain frequency range, or age-related hair-cell degeneration (usually corresponding to high frequencies). Although the lesion causes elevated thresholds in the corresponding frequency range, neighboring frequencies become amplified because their central representations expand into the vacated frequency range. Indeed, preliminary findings from human PET and MEG studies indicate an expansion of the frequency representation in the auditory cortex that corresponds to the perceived tinnitus frequencies (Lockwood et al., 1998Lockwood A.H. Salvi R.J. Coad M.L. Towsley M.L. Wack D.S. Murphy B.W.

Frequency organization of the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response in normal hearing and in tinnitus.Neuroimage. 2006; 33: 180-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations, however, continue to await confirmation by high-resolution fMRI studies (Leaver et al., 2006Leaver A.M. Renier L. Purcell J. Costanzo M. Fieger A. Morgan S. Kim H.J. Rauschecker J.P. Auditory cortical map plasticity in tinnitus.Soc. Neurosci. 2006; 32 (800.802)Google Scholar). Animal models of tinnitus also support the claim for a cortical origin of the tinnitus percept. Restricted cochlear lesions in cats and monkeys lead to a frequency-specific reorganization of auditory cortex and thalamus but not of more peripheral stations (Rajan and Irvine, 1998Rajan R. Irvine D.R. Absence of plasticity of the frequency map in dorsal cochlear nucleus of adult cats after unilateral partial cochlear lesions.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Rajan et al., 1993Rajan R. Irvine D.R. Wise L.Z. Heil P.

Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear hearing loss.Am. J. Otol. 1993; 14: 252-258PubMed Google Scholar). As detailed microelectrode mapping in these and other studies has shown, frequency regions adjacent to the lesioned area invade the vacated space and become “overrepresented” compared to other frequency regions. Additionally, the “lesion-edge frequencies” lose intracortical inhibitory input from the deafferented region. Thus, cortical neurons with input from frequency ranges next to the cut-off frequency display permanently elevated spontaneous activity (“hyperactivity”) as well as transiently enhanced burst-firing and increased synchronous activity (Noreña and Eggermont, 2003Noreña A.J.

High-frequency tinnitus without hearing loss does not mean absence of deafferentation.Hear. Res. 2006; 222: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Auditory brainstem hyperactivity has also been reported in human tinnitus patients (Melcher et al., 2000Melcher J.R. Sigalovsky I.S. Guinan Jr., J.J. Levine R.A. Lateralized tinnitus studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal inferior colliculus activation.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1058-1072PubMed Google Scholar) as well as animal models of tinnitus (Bauer, 2003Bauer C.A. Animal models of tinnitus.Otolaryngol. Clin. North Am. 2003; 36 (267–285, vi)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Brozoski et al., 2002Brozoski T.J. Bauer C.A. Caspary D.M. Elevated fusiform cell activity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus of chinchillas with psychophysical evidence of tinnitus.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar), but it seems to be the cortical remapping that ultimately forms the basis for a chronic tinnitus percept (Melcher et al., 2009Melcher J.R. Levine R.A. Bergevin C. Norris B. The auditory midbrain of people with tinnitus: abnormal sound-evoked activity revisited.Hear. Res. 2009; 257: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lesion-induced plasticity in the adult brain has also been documented in the somatosensory and visual systems (Calford et al., 2005Calford M.B. Chino Y.M. Das A. Eysel U.T. Gilbert C.D. Heinen S.J.

Large-scale reorganization at multiple levels of the somatosensory pathway follows therapeutic amputation of the hand in monkeys.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8083-8095PubMed Google Scholar) (but see Smirnakis et al., 2005Smirnakis S.M. Brewer A.A. Schmid M.C. Tolias A.S. Schüz A. Augath M. Inhoffen W. Wandell B.A. Logothetis N.K. Lack of long-term cortical reorganization after macaque retinal lesions.Nature. 2005; 435: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The cellular and synaptic mechanisms responsible for this process include the unmasking of hidden inputs (Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998Buonomano D.V. Merzenich M.M. Cortical plasticity: from synapses to maps.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 149-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) and the sprouting of new connections (Darian-Smith and Gilbert, 1994Darian-Smith C. Gilbert C.D. Axonal sprouting accompanies functional reorganization in adult cat striate cortex.Nature. 1994; 368: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes at the cortical level have been found in combination with perceptual consequences of phantom sensations (Ramachandran et al., 1992Ramachandran V.S. Rogers-Ramachandran D. Stewart M. Perceptual correlates of massive cortical reorganization.Science. 1992; 258: 1159-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and a “filling-in” of the deprived region by neighboring representations (Gilbert et al., 2001Gilbert C.D. Sigman M. Crist R.E. The neural basis of perceptual learning.Neuron. 2001; 31: 681-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A similar line of work on the cortical contributions to focal dystonia (a somato-motor disorder affecting specific body parts, such as the hand in musicians or writers) has argued that this disorder shares the same signature (Breakefield et al., 2008Breakefield X.O. Blood A.J. Li Y. Hallett M. Hanson P.I. Standaert D.G. The pathophysiological basis of dystonias.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, Elbert et al., 1998Elbert T. Candia V. Altenmüller E. Rau H. Sterr A. Rockstroh B. Pantev C. Taub E.

Sensorimotor training and cortical reorganization.NeuroRehabilitation. 2009; 25: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar, Hirata et al., 2004Hirata Y. Schulz M. Altenmüller E. Elbert T. Pantev C. Sensory mapping of lip representation in brass musicians with embouchure dystonia.Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that lesion-induced reorganization has similar consequences across modalities and that the same process in the auditory cortex may be an underlying cause of tinnitus. Recently, high-resolution structural MRI studies with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) have indicated that tinnitus-related reorganization of auditory cortex in humans may be accompanied by structural changes at the thalamic level (Mühlau et al., 2006Mühlau M. Rauschecker J.P. Oestreicher E. Gaser C. Röttinger M. Wohlschläger A.M. Simon F. Etgen T. Conrad B. Sander D. Structural brain changes in tinnitus.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The VBM technique can identify differences in volume and tissue density of brain regions by direct comparison between two groups. Using VBM on tinnitus patients, Mühlau et al., 2006Mühlau M. Rauschecker J.P. Oestreicher E. Gaser C. Röttinger M. Wohlschläger A.M. Simon F. Etgen T. Conrad B. Sander D. Structural brain changes in tinnitus.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar observed a significant increase of gray-matter density in the posterior thalamus, including the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Using individual morphological segmentation, which is better able to detect changes within small and anatomically variable areas, Schneider et al., 2009Schneider P. Andermann M. Wengenroth M. Goebel R. Flor H. Rupp A. Diesch E. Reduced volume of Heschl's gyrus in tinnitus.Neuroimage. 2009; 45: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar also found volume loss in the medial portion of Heschl's gyrus (HG) in tinnitus patients. Additional evidence from the somatosensory system suggests that lesion-induced functional reorganization may be amplified at the thalamic level, and thus structural changes could manifest more readily there: effects of cortical reorganization of the hand representation in macaque monkeys are enhanced in the ventroposterior nucleus of thalamus via descending projections (Ergenzinger et al., 1998Ergenzinger E.R. Glasier M.M. Hahm J.O. Pons T.P. Cortically induced thalamic plasticity in the primate somatosensory system.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In summary, as evidenced by the various approaches discussed, the long-term reorganization of central auditory pathways following sensorineural hearing loss appears to consist of changes at the cortical as well as thalamic level. It is entirely possible that tinnitus, like many apparently heterogeneous neurological syndromes, may be the end result of various different causes. Different subtypes of tinnitus have indeed been described in cluster analyses, for instance cases in which tinnitus gets better with (i.e., is masked by) noise (a fundamental tenet for many treatment attempts; [Okamoto et al., 2010Okamoto H. Stracke H. Stoll W. Pantev C. Listening to tailor-made notched music reduces tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related auditory cortex activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Roberts, 2007Roberts L.E. Residual inhibition.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 166: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar]), but also cases in which tinnitus gets worse in noise (Tyler et al., 2008Tyler R. Coelho C. Tao P. Ji H. Noble W. Gehringer A. Gogel S. Identifying tinnitus subgroups with cluster analysis.Am. J. Audiol. 2008; 17: S176-S184Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Notably, tinnitus has been reported to occur in individuals with normal hearing (Heller and Bergman, 1953Heller M.F. Bergman M. Tinnitus aurium in normally hearing persons.Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 1953; 62: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In cases of tinnitus with intact hearing, a model of lesion-induced plasticity would not apply, as a lesion in the auditory periphery may not exist. On the other hand, “normal hearing” is often determined on the basis of standard audiological examination, which is performed in octave steps and only at frequencies below 8 kHz. Cases of mild notch-like hearing loss or hearing loss above 8 kHz could easily escape such testing. When audiological testing is performed at finer intervals and at frequencies above 8 kHz, cases of tinnitus with absolutely no hearing loss become more rare in our hands and in those of other investigators (Salvi et al., 2009Salvi R. Lobarinas E. Sun W. Pharmacological treatments for tinnitus: new and old.Drugs Future. 2009; 34: 381-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is safe to say, therefore, that the great majority of tinnitus cases do involve SNHL, i.e., damage to the sensory periphery (Hoffman and Reed, 2004Hoffman H.J. Reed G.W. Epidemiology of tinnitus.in: Snow J.B. Tinnitus: Theory and Management. BC Decker, Inc., Hamilton, Ontario2004Google Scholar). Importantly, the reverse is not true, i.e., not everyone with SNHL develops tinnitus (see below). Thus, although universal models or treatments for tinnitus may not exist, we argue that central auditory system reorganization is a necessary prerequisite for chronic tinnitus. Although reorganization of auditory cortex and thalamus in response to peripheral deafferentation may be necessary for the tinnitus perception to arise, it is almost certainly not sufficient. First, if peripheral hearing loss results in central auditory reorganization, which leads to the tinnitus percept, why is it that only a subset of patients with noise-induced hearing loss (between 20% and 40% [Hoffman and Reed, 2004Hoffman H.J. Reed G.W. Epidemiology of tinnitus.in: Snow J.B. Tinnitus: Theory and Management. BC Decker, Inc., Hamilton, Ontario2004Google Scholar]) develop chronic tinnitus? Shouldn't one expect that noise-induced hearing loss always leads to cortical reorganization and, thus, to tinnitus? Second, modulation of tinnitus strength by nonauditory factors is well known in chronic tinnitus. In cases of “somatic” tinnitus, the tinnitus percept can be modulated by movements of the eyes, neck, or jaw (Fields, 2007Fields R.D. The case of the loud eyeballs.Sci. Am. Mind. 2007; 18: 12-13Crossref Google Scholar, Levine et al., 2003Levine R.A. Abel M. Cheng H. CNS somatosensory-auditory interactions elicit or modulate tinnitus.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 153: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Significant changes in tinnitus level also occur as a result of stress or sleep deprivation (Alster et al., 1993Alster J.

Psychiatry. 1993; 34: 84-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Folmer and Griest, 2000Folmer R.L. Griest S.E. Tinnitus and insomnia.Am. J.

A sizeable portion of tinnitus patients suffer from what is known as “intermittent” tinnitus, in which the ringing sensation disappears completely for days or weeks, only to resume at full force. It appears that, in addition to changes in auditory pathways, a “switch” exists elsewhere in the brain that can turn the tinnitus sensation on or off. In neurophysiological terms, such a switch may be referred to as an inhibitory gating mechanism. A potential breakthrough in our understanding of such gating mechanisms occurred when, in their VBM study, Mühlau et al., 2006Mühlau M. Rauschecker J.P. Oestreicher E. Gaser C. Röttinger M.

Cortex. 2006; 16: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar found a highly significant volume loss in the “subcallosal area” of tinnitus patients (Figure 1). This result was recently replicated by Hyde et al. (K.L. Hyde, R.J. Zatorre, A.C. Evans, and S. Hebert, 2009, meeting abstract, “Structural brain differences in unilateral tinnitus,” Organization Human Brain Mapping, San Francisco) and, in a more general form implicating paralimbic structures, by Landgrebe et al., 2009Landgrebe M.

Volume loss may point to atrophy of neurons or glia cells (i.e., changes in a region's intrinsic architecture) with characteristic functional consequences (May and Gaser, 2006May A. Gaser C.

Though the subcallosal area is not sharply delineated as a homogeneous region and contains medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate areas, various findings suggest that it constitutes a major hub linking limbic-affective systems with thalamo-cortical perceptual systems. Activation of the subcallosal area, for instance, correlates by varying degrees with the unpleasant effects of dissonant music (Blood et al., 1999Blood A.J. Zatorre R.J. Bermudez P. Evans A.C. Emotional responses to pleasant and unpleasant music correlate with activity in paralimbic brain regions.Nat.

Furthermore, abnormal activity levels in the subcallosal (subgenual anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal) area are found in people with certain depressive disorders (Drevets et al., 1997Drevets W.C.

In addition to encompassing the above cortical regions, the subcallosal area in its posterior portion overlaps with the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which is a major component of the ventral striatum (Blood and Zatorre, 2001Blood A.J.

The striatal projection neurons are GABA-containing medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which are divided into two subpopulations, i.e., striatonigral neurons in the direct pathway and striatopallidal neurons in the indirect pathway (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

However, these techniques would have global effects on many other brain regions as well. Furthermore, two types of MSNs are morphologically indistinguishable and exist in a similar number (Surmeier et al., 2007Surmeier D.J. Ding J. Day M. Wang Z. Shen W.

This similarity has made it extremely difficult to determine how the neural information is processed and integrated through these two pathways. To explore the regulatory mechanisms of the basal ganglia function, we adopted a gene-manipulating technique termed reversible neurotransmission blocking (RNB) (Wada et al., 2007Wada N. Kishimoto Y. Watanabe D. Kano M. Hirano T. Funabiki K. Nakanishi S. Conditioned eyeblink learning is formed and stored without cerebellar granule cell transmission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission of cerebellar granule cells in vivo by genetically manipulated expression of tetanus neurotoxin light chain.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6759-6767PubMed Google Scholar). For this technique, we used previously developed transgenic mice (TN mice), in which the expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TN) was controlled by the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) in a tetracycline-derivative doxycycline (DOX)-dependent manner (Wada et al., 2007Wada N. Kishimoto Y. Watanabe D. Kano M. Hirano T. Funabiki K. Nakanishi S. Conditioned eyeblink learning is formed and stored without cerebellar granule cell transmission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission of cerebellar granule cells in vivo by genetically manipulated expression of tetanus neurotoxin light chain.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6759-6767PubMed Google Scholar). TN is a bacterial toxin that cleaves the synaptic-vesicle-associated VAMP2 protein (Schiavo et al., 1992Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Tetanus and botulinum-B neurotoxins block neurotransmitter release by proteolytic cleavage of synaptobrevin.Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) and abolishes neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (Wada et al., 2007Wada N. Kishimoto Y. Watanabe D. Kano M. Hirano T. Funabiki K. Nakanishi S. Conditioned eyeblink learning is formed and stored without cerebellar granule cell transmission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 16690-16695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SP and Enk are specifically expressed in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively, but are also distributed in other brain regions (Cuello and Kanazawa, 1978Cuello A.C. Kanazawa I.

Cytochem. 1980; 28: 903-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To restrict the expression of the tetracycline-repressive transcription factor (tTA) to striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, we combined with the adeno-associated virus- (AAV-) mediated gene expression system, which has been reported to effectively express incorporated transgenes in MSNs and modify properties of these cells in a transgene-dependent manner (Lerchner et al., 2007Lerchner W. Xiao C. Nashmi R. Slimko E.M. van Trigt L. Lester H.A. Anderson D.J.

We constructed two types of AAVs, termed V-S-tTA and V-E-tTA, in which expression of tTA was directed by the SP or the Enk promoter, respectively. When these recombinant viruses were injected into the striatum of TN mice, TN was specifically expressed and in turn separately blocked neurotransmission in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. This investigation has indicated that transmission blockade of either of the two pathways abolished the psychostimulant-induced acute responses but that the blockade of the direct and indirect pathways caused selective impairments of the reward-based and aversive behavior, respectively. Synaptic transmission of the two pathways is thus coordinated, but each plays a distinct role in controlling adaptive mechanisms involved in the basal ganglia function. The selective and reversible blockade of synaptic transmission of the two types of MSNs in vivo was achieved by combining the TN transgenic mice (Wada et al., 2007Wada N. Kishimoto Y. Watanabe D. Kano M. Hirano T. Funabiki K. Nakanishi S. Conditioned eyeblink learning is formed and stored without cerebellar granule cell transmission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission of cerebellar granule cells in vivo by genetically manipulated expression of tetanus neurotoxin light chain.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6759-6767PubMed Google Scholar) with the recombinant AAV transfection technique (Figures 1A and S1, available online). In the TN mice, the expression of the fusion protein of TN and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was driven by the TRE and was induced by interaction with the tTA (Figure 1A). The AAV-mediated gene expression system (V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA) was used to restrict the SP- or Enk-derived expression of tTA within the striatum (Figure 1A). With this strategy, the SP or Enk-promoter-derived tTA would activate expression of the GFP-TN transgene in specific striatal neurons. The administration of DOX would then terminate the expression of TN and allow recovery of synaptic transmission through newly synthesized VAMP2 (Figure 1A). The success of our strategy relied on accurate and mutually exclusive expression of TN in one of the MSN types. We first examined whether the SP and Enk promoters would faithfully direct the expression of tTA in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively, in wild-type mice (Figure 1B). The V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA virus was injected into the striatum. The cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)-Alexa 594 retrograde tracer was then injected into either the globus pallidus (GP) or the SNr of these mice. Two weeks after the injection, the retrograde tracer and the flag-tagged tTA were visualized in serial sections of the striatum by fluorescence and immunostaining with anti-flag antibody, respectively (Figure 1B). Immunoreactivity of the flag-tagged tTA was exclusively seen in striatonigral neurons of the V-S-tTA-transfected mice, which were retrogradely labeled from the SNr; the tTA-positive cells were 68.6% ± 1.0% of retrogradely labeled cells (n = 3). Conversely, the immunoreactivity was restricted to the striatopallidal neurons of the V-E-tTA-transfected mice, which were retrogradely labeled from the GP; the tTA-positive cells were 66.2% ± 3.1% of retrogradely labeled cells (n = 3). We then examined the tTA-dependent, cell-type-specific expression of TN by injecting the recombinant virus into the striatum of the TN and wild-type mice. Upon double immunostaining of the TN mice 2 weeks after V-S-tTA injection, immunoreactivity of the TN-GFP fusion protein was exclusively seen in SP-immunoreactive but not in Enk-immunoreactive neurons (Figure 1C); the GFP-immunoreactive cells were 74.2% ± 1.9% of SP-immunoreactive striatonigral neurons (n = 4). This immunoreactive colocalization was reversed in the V-E-tTA-transfected TN mice (Figure 1D); the GFP-immunoreactive cells were 71.1% ± 0.9% of Enk-immunoreactive striatopallidal neurons (n = 4). In controls, no GFP immunoreactivity was observed in any other striatal interneurons (Figure S2), nor in the virus-transfected wild-type striatum. Although viral tropism may also contribute to specific expression of transgenes in MSNs, the results indicated that TN was exclusively expressed in striatonigral or striatopallidal neurons, depending on the transfection with the V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA virus, respectively. We next examined the DOX-mediated reversibility of TN expression and cleavage of VAMP2 in TN mice. The V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA virus or the tTA-free control virus was injected into one side of the striatum of wild-type and TN mice. Two weeks after the viral injection, DOX was continuously administered or the animals were left untreated. At 2, 4, or 6 weeks after the viral injection, the striatum was dissected from DOX-treated and DOX-untreated animals. No anatomical alterations with Nissl staining nor changes in patterns and intensities of immunoreactivity of dopamine transporter and hybridization signals of SP and Enk mRNAs were observed at the striatum in virus-transfected TN mice regardless of treatment or not with DOX (Figure S3). Immunoblot analysis showed intense GFP immunoreactivity in both the V-S-tTA-injected and the V-E-tTA-injected TN mice at least up to 6 weeks after the viral injection (Figure 2A ). This immunoreactivity completely disappeared 4 weeks after DOX treatment in both cases (Figure 2A). No GFP immunoreactivity was seen in striatal sections transfected with the control AAV or in those of wild-type mice transfected with either the V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA (data not shown). The expression of TN was thus reversibly controlled in a DOX-dependent manner. The reversibility of the TN-mediated cleavage of VAMP2 was examined by immunoblot analysis of striatal lysates with antibody against N-terminal VAMP2 (Figure 2B). The intact 18 kDa VAMP2 was significantly cleaved to the 12 kDa N-terminal fragment in TN mice with either V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA transfection. This cleavage disappeared 4 weeks after DOX treatment (Figure 2B). Upon densitometric measurement, cleavage of the 18 kDa VAMP2 was calculated to be about 30% in both virus-transfected TN mice (n = 2). If striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons are assumed to exist in a 1:1 ratio within the striatum, the densitometric calculation indicated that about two-thirds of the VAMP2 was cleaved in targeted cells in both viral transfections. This value was consistent with more than 70% of GFP-positive target cells in the virus-transfected striatum (Figures 1C and 1D). No VAMP2 cleavage was detected in the virus-transfected wild-type mice nor in the control virus-transfected TN mice (Figure 2B). We tested transmission blockade of the virus-transfected TN mice by extracellular recordings of the GP or the SNr in anesthetized animals after electrical stimulation of the striatum. The striatal stimulation evoked a rapid and monophasic response in the SNr of wild-type mice (Figure 3A ). This response was inhibited by perfusion with the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline methochloride into the SNr (Figure 3A), confirming GABA-mediated transmission from the striatum to the SNr in wild-type mice. Importantly, the striatal stimulation failed to evoke an electrophysiological response in the V-S-tTA-transfected TN mice but induced a normal level of response in the V-E-tTA-transfected TN mice (Figures 3A and 3B). These results indicate that neurotransmission of the direct pathway was selectively blocked in the V-S-tTA-transfected TN mice. Extracellular recordings of the GP after striatal stimulation of anesthetized wild-type mice were also conducted, but this attempt failed to identify GABA-mediated transmission from the striatum to the GP. This failure was due to close localization of the GP from the striatum, so that electrical excitation within the striatum hampered identification of the striatum-stimulated response in the GP. However, the blockade of striatopallidal transmission was confirmed by a different approach that examined the striatopallidal transmission-mediated upregulation of c-fos mRNA in the ventral pallidum (VP) (see Figure 5E). These results demonstrate that neurotransmission of the direct and indirect pathways was selectively blocked in the V-S-tTA-transfected and the V-E-tTA-transfected TN mice, respectively. The two types of MSNs exert opposing effects on the SNr neurons (Deniau et al., 2007Deniau J.M. Mailly P. Maurice N. Charpier S.

Consequently, deficit of the striatonigral transmission on one side of the striatum induces abnormal turning ipsilateral to the impaired side, whereas deprivation of one side of the striatopallidal transmission elicits contralateral turning (Kaneko et al., 2000Kaneko S.

To examine the DOX-dependent, reversible motor imbalance in the virus-transfected TN mice, we injected the recombinant virus unilaterally into the left side of the striatum. Two weeks after the injection, DOX was continuously administered or the animals were left untreated. The abnormal turning behavior was then analyzed by forcing the animals to rotate on a hemispherical container. In the absence of DOX treatment, unilaterally V-S-tTA-injected TN mice all showed rotation ipsilateral to the side of the viral injection (Figure 4A ). Conversely, contralateral rotation was induced in unilaterally V-E-tTA-injected TN mice (Figure 4B). Consistent with the TN expression ontogeny (Figure 2A), the abnormal turning behavior remained up to 2 weeks and then disappeared 4 weeks after DOX treatment in both the V-S-tTA and V-E-tTA-injected TN mice (Figures 4A and 4B). In the virus-injected wild-type mice, the abnormal turning never occurred, irrespective of DOX treatment (Figures 4A and 4B). The abnormal turning was thus not only induced in a TN-expression-dependent manner but also was consistent with the coordinated role of the striatonigral and striatopallidal transmission in motor balance (Figure S4). The results described above all support the conclusion that synaptic transmission of the direct and indirect pathways was selectively and reversibly blocked in our model animals. We hereafter refer to the direct-pathway-blocked and the indirect-pathway-blocked TN mice as the D-RNB and I-RNB mice, respectively. Psychostimulants methamphetamine and cocaine both stimulate the dopamine system in the striatum and enhance acute responses of locomotor activity (Hyman et al., 2006Hyman S.E. Malenka R.C. Nestler E.J. Neural mechanisms of addiction: the role of reward-related learning and memory.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 565-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). So we examined whether the methamphetamine-induced acute hyperlocomotion would be influenced in the D-RNB and I-RNB mice by bilateral injection of the V-S-tTA or V-E-tTA virus, respectively, into the striatum including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Figures 5A and 5B ). The D-RNB and I-RNB mice showed no abnormal locomotor activity under the ordinary condition. The wild-type mice showed a significant methamphetamine-induced acute hyperlocomotion regardless of the viral transfection and DOX treatment. Similarly, hyperlocomotion was induced in the TN-transgenic mice before the viral injection. Remarkably, blockade of either the direct or the indirect pathway abrogated the methamphetamine-induced acute hyperlocomotion. Importantly, when DOX was administered for 4 weeks, the methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion recovered in both the D-RNB and I-RNB mice to levels comparable to those of the wild-type mice. In controls, the injection of saline alone had no effect on locomotor activity in any experimental stages of the D-RNB or I-RNB mice. The cocaine-induced acute hyperlocomotion was also examined by bilateral viral injection into the NAc, the ventral part of the striatum that is the central neural substrate for cocaine actions (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988Di Chiara G. Imperato A. Drugs abused by humans preferentially increase synaptic dopamine concentrations in the mesolimbic system of freely moving rats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 5274-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar) (Figures 5C and 5D). In remarkable contrast to the wild-type mice, neither the D-RNB mice nor the I-RNB mice showed the cocaine-induced acute hyperlocomotion immediately after a single cocaine administration. Synaptic transmission of both pathways is thus required for psychostimulant-enhanced acute responses. The dopamine stimulation induced by cocaine administration excites the pallidal neurons of the indirect pathway and suppresses the SNr neurons, which receive convergent inputs from the direct and indirect pathways (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

The basal ganglia.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R509-R511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This modulatory effect on the VP and SNr neurons was examined by quantitative in situ hybridization analysis of the activity-dependent up- and downregulation of c-fos mRNA at the corresponding brain regions 30 min after cocaine administration (Marshall et al., 1998Marshall J.F. Ruskin D.N. LaHoste G.J. Dopaminergic regulation of immediate early gene expression in the basal ganglia.Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that c-fos mRNA was upregulated in the VP of both the wild-type and the D-RNB mice but not in the VP of the I-RNB mice (Figure 5E). Furthermore, the cocaine treatment downregulated c-fos mRNA in the SNr of the wild-type mice but failed to show such downregulation in both the D-RNB and I-RNB mice (Figure 5F). This finding further confirmed the conclusion that the input transmission from the striatum/NAc to the SNr was impaired by selective blockade of the direct and indirect pathways in the D-RNB and I-RNB mice, respectively. Repeated cocaine administration induces neural adaptation of the dopamine system and causes a progressive increase in locomotor activity, called locomotor sensitization (Hikida et al., 2001Hikida T. Kaneko S. Isobe T. Kitabatake Y. Watanabe D. Pastan I. Nakanishi S. Increased sensitivity to cocaine by cholinergic cell ablation in nucleus accumbens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

When the recombinant virus was bilaterally injected into the NAc, the I-RNB mice showed delayed cocaine-induced sensitization but reached hyperlocomotor levels comparable to those of the wild-type mice on days 3–5 (Figure 6B ).

Long-lived HSCs have unique survival mechanisms Short-lived myeloid progenitors are poised to die Quiescent and proliferating HSCs use different mechanisms of DNA repair Quiescent HSCs are intrinsically vulnerable to mutagenesis DNA repair is essential for cell survival and maintenance of tissue homeostasis (Lombard et al., 2005Lombard D.B.

Cellular organisms must constantly contend with endogenous DNA damage caused by intrinsic or extrinsic stresses and have evolved multiple DNA repair systems to deal with these insults (Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the most cytotoxic type of DNA lesion and can arise during DNA replication or upon exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic chemicals. DSB formation triggers a global DNA damage response resulting in the activation of the DNA damage sensor ATM, which in turn activates cell cycle checkpoints and phosphorylates an array of downstream targets including the tumor suppressor gene p53. This global DNA damage response (DDR) is directed toward the cells' own preservation and can lead to growth arrest and initiation of DNA repair by specialized DSB repair mechanisms, with programmed cell death being an alternative outcome of excessive or unrepaired DNA damage. The two principal and complementary mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells repair DSBs are homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). HR-mediated DNA repair uses a template for accurate repair, usually the sister chromatid, and thus can only occur in cycling cells. In contrast, NHEJ-mediated DNA repair has a limited requirement for sequence homology and can take place at any stage of the cell cycle. NHEJ-type repair is a more error-prone mechanism than the high-fidelity HR-type repair, which often leads to misrepaired DSBs that may result in chromosomal deletions, insertions or translocations, and subsequent genomic instability (Weinstock et al., 2006Weinstock D.M.

Modeling oncogenic translocations: distinct roles for double-strand break repair pathways in translocation formation in mammalian cells.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although defects in DNA damage responses have been associated with cancer, aging, and stem cell abnormalities (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20695) Google Scholar, Park and Gerson, 2005Park Y. Gerson S.L. DNA repair defects in stem cell function and aging.Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), much remains to be learned about the mechanism by which stem cells normally respond to DNA damage and repair DSBs. The hematopoietic system provides a uniquely tractable model to investigate the activity of specific cell populations (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic development is organized hierarchically, starting with a rare population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that gives rise to a series of committed progenitors and mature cells with exclusive functional and immunophenotypic properties. HSCs are the only cells within the hematopoietic system that self-renew for life, whereas other hematopoietic progenitors cells are short lived and committed to the transient production of mature blood cells. Under steady-state conditions, HSCs are a largely quiescent, slowly cycling cell population, which, in response to environmental cues, are capable of dramatic expansion and contraction to ensure proper homeostatic replacement of blood cells. In this context, the quiescent status of HSCs is widely considered to be an essential protective mechanism that minimizes endogenous stress caused by cellular respiration and DNA replication (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T. Deconstructing stem cell self-renewal: Genetic insights into cell-cycle regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Proper execution of DNA repair processes is essential for normal HSC function. Mice lacking components and regulators of the DNA damage response and DSB repair mechanisms all display severe hematopoietic phenotypes and HSC defects (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K.

Deficiencies in DNA damage repair limit the function of haematopoietic stem cells with age.Nature. 2007; 447: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Defective DNA repair has also been associated with a spectrum of human blood disorders (Wang, 2007Wang W. Emergence of a DNA-damage response network consisting of Fanconi anaemia and BRCA proteins.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and the occurrence of chromosomal translocations is a hallmark of human hematological malignancies (Look, 1997Look A.T. Oncogenic transcription factors in the human acute leukemias.Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that genotoxic insults such as ionizing radiation (IR) differentially affect subsets of bone marrow hematopoietic cells, with HSCs being more radioresistant than their downstream myeloid progeny (Meijne et al., 1991Meijne E.I. van der Winden-van Groenewegen R.J.

Variations in radiation sensitivity and repair among different hematopoietic stem cell subsets following fractionated irradiation.Blood. 1995; 86: 122-127PubMed Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the low levels of intracellular oxidative species (ROS) observed in HSCs compared to myeloid progenitors (Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R. Sears C. et al.FoxOs are critical mediators of hematopoietic stem cell resistance to physiologic oxidative stress.Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) and the well-established link between irradiation-induced DNA damage and ROS generation. However, limited information is currently available about the precise DNA repair capacity of HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells as well as on the mutagenic consequences of such repair for their biological functions. Here, we use flow cytometry to isolate a highly enriched HSC-containing population referred to as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and two distinct subsets of myeloid progenitors (MPs), the common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), and the granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs). We show that long-lived HSPCs have robust and unique cell-intrinsic mechanisms to ensure their survival in response to IR exposure, which include enhanced pro-survival gene expression and a strong induction of p53-mediated DDR leading to growth arrest and DNA repair, whereas short-lived MPs are molecularly poised to undergo apoptosis and are predominantly eliminated in response to genotoxic stress. Most importantly, we demonstrate that HSPCs are forced to initiate DNA repair by using the error-prone NHEJ mechanism because of their largely quiescent cell cycle status and the molecular composition of their DNA repair machinery. We show that this preferential use of NHEJ-mediated DNA repair renders quiescent HSPCs susceptible to genomic instability associated with misrepaired DNA, which can contribute to HSC loss of function and/or pre-malignant transformation in vivo. In contrast, HSPCs that have been induced to proliferate, either by in vitro culturing or in vivo mobilization treatment, undergo DNA repair using the high-fidelity HR mechanism and have a significantly decreased risk of acquiring mutation(s). Taken together, our results demonstrate that HSC quiescence is a double-edged sword, which on the one hand protects HSCs against endogenous stress but, on the other hand, renders HSCs intrinsically vulnerable to mutagenesis following DNA damage. We first defined the radiosensitivity of our purified hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cells. We isolated HSPCs (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1+/Flk2−), CMPs (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1−/CD34+/FcγR−), and GMPs (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1−/CD34+/FcγR+) from the pooled bone marrow of five to ten wild-type mice, exposed them to increasing doses of IR (0–10 Gy) and performed clonogenic survival assays in methylcellulose and liquid media (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). We observed a striking difference in colony numbers at the 2 Gy dose of irradiation, with HSPCs displaying significantly enhanced radioresistance compared to MPs that correlated with the differentiation status of the populations analyzed (HSPCs > CMPs > GMPs). At doses greater than 4 Gy, all three populations were equally radiosensitive and did not form colonies, in agreement with the fact that the hematopoietic system is one of the first organ systems to fail after total body irradiation. To determine whether the enhanced radioresistance of HSPCs results from cell-intrinsic differences in their DNA damage response, we performed a similar clonogenic survival assay with HSPCs and MPs isolated from Atm-deficient mice (Ito et al., 2004Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Hamaguchi I. Nomiyama K. Hosokawa K. Sakurada K. Nakagata N. et al.Regulation of oxidative stress by ATM is required for self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2004; 431: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). In contrast to wild type cells, we found that Atm−/− HSPCs, CMPs and GMPs all displayed matching hypersensitivity to increasing doses of IR (0–4 Gy). These results confirm that HSPCs are intrinsically more resistant to IR exposure than CMPs and GMPs and indicate that ATM is an essential mediator of this differential DNA damage response. We also showed that Slam-HSCs (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1+/Flk2−/CD150+/CD48−), one of the most pure HSC populations characterized so far, display radioresistance similar to that of HSPCs (Figure S1), which indicate that our analysis of HSPCs may be generalized in this instance to HSC biology. We then investigated the cellular outcomes (i.e., proliferation and apoptosis responses) induced by 2 Gy IR in HSPCs and MPs. CFSE dilution assays uncovered a profound delay in the division rates of 2 Gy-irradiated HSPCs that was still evident 3 days after IR exposure (Figure 1C). Although CMPs displayed an intermediate behavior, with a recovery of normal proliferation by 3–4 days after IR, the irradiation treatment had almost no effect on GMP proliferation rates. We then measured the apoptotic response occurring in these cells by using intracellular cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) and Annexin V/7-AAD staining (Figure 1D and data not shown). We found that unirradiated MPs had significantly higher basal levels of CC3 staining compared to HSPCs after 1 and 2 days in culture (∼1.3- and 8.5-fold higher in CMPs and ∼3.7- and 10.4-fold higher in GMPs, respectively). Furthermore, we observed a robust and immediate IR-mediated apoptotic response in CMPs and GMPs but a minimal induction of apoptosis 2 days after irradiation in HSPCs. To establish the status of the apoptotic machinery in these cells, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of a comprehensive panel of bcl2 family pro- and antiapoptotic genes in freshly isolated HSPCs, CMPs, and GMPs (Figure 1E). We observed an overall deficit in prosurvival genes and a trend toward increased expression of proapoptotic genes in MPs compared to HSPCs. Using western blotting, we confirmed several highly significant changes (p ≤ 0.001) found at the mRNA level including decreased Mcl-1 and increased Bid proteins in GMPs (Figure 1F). To functionally test whether a deficit in prosurvival genes contributes to the higher rate of apoptosis in MPs, we isolated cells from H2k-bcl2 transgenic mice (Domen et al., 2000Domen J. Cheshier S.H. Weissman I.L. The role of apoptosis in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells: Overexpression of Bcl-2 increases both their number and repopulation potential.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and evaluated the effect of enhanced bcl2 expression on their apoptotic response (Figure 1D). Whereas HSPCs remained essentially unaffected by bcl2 overexpression, we observed a significant decrease in the basal level of CC3 staining in MPs, especially in GMPs. However, H2k-bcl2 MPs displayed an unchanged IR-mediated apoptotic response, which suggests that overexpressing a single prosurvival gene cannot compensate for the strength of IR-mediated death signals in MPs. Taken together, these results suggest that the short-lived, expendable MPs (especially GMPs) are poised at the molecular level to undergo apoptosis because of a deficit in prosurvival genes and are mostly eliminated in response to IR treatment. In contrast, the long-lived HSPCs predominantly survive and undergo growth arrest after irradiation. p53 is an important downstream target of ATM, which can mediate either growth arrest or apoptosis following DNA damage. To determine whether HSPCs and MPs engage a p53-dependent DDR, we first treated mice with 2 Gy IR and measured the changes in p53 protein levels occurring in these bone marrow compartments at 12 hours postirradiation by using intracellular FACS analysis (Figure 2A ). Although we observed stabilization of p53 protein in in vivo-irradiated HSPCs, no significant changes were found in irradiated MPs. We also confirmed by immunoblotting a ∼2-fold stronger phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15) in HSPCs compare to MPs at 1 hr post-IR in vitro and a trailing off in both populations by 4 hr post-IR (Figure S2). To directly assess p53 activity in these compartments, we then measured the induction of p53 target genes (i.e, bax, noxa, puma, and p21) by qRT-PCR with purified cells grown in liquid culture for 8 and 12 hr post-IR (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the strength of the p53-mediated DDR (as measured by the levels of target gene induction) was much higher and sustained for a longer time in HSPCs compared to the limited and transient response observed in MPs, especially in GMPs. We further confirmed the functional importance of p53 in both HSPCs and MPs by using cells isolated from Trp53−/− mice (Liu et al., 2009Liu Y. Elf S.E. Miyata Y. Sashida G. Liu Y. Huang G. Di Giandomenico S. Lee J.M. Deblasio A. Menendez S. et al.p53 regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Analysis of Trp53−/− HSPCs, CMPs, and GMPs both in clonogenic survival assays and liquid culture (Figure 2C and data not shown) revealed increased radioresistance in all three populations. Furthermore, we showed that removal of p53 prevents HSPCs from undergoing growth arrest after IR exposure (Figure 2D), whereas in MPs, p53 deletion considerably decreased the basal level and abrogated IR-mediated induction of apoptosis (Figure 2E). As expected, p53-mediated induction of p21 and bcl2 proapoptotic targets did not occur in irradiated Trp53−/− HSPCs and MPs (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results highlight the dual role that p53 plays in modulating opposite outcomes in irradiated HSPCs and MPs. We postulate that in HSPCs the high basal level of prosurvival genes coupled with the strong p53-mediated induction of p21 protect against the killing effects of increased proapoptotic gene expression, resulting mainly in growth arrest as already observed in other cellular contexts (Abbas and Dutta, 2009Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: Intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). In contrast, in MPs, the limited induction of proapoptotic genes that occurs in the context of very low basal levels of prosurvival genes and in the absence of or with weak induction of p21 results predominantly in cell death. To determine the extent of DSB DNA repair in irradiated HSPCs and MPs, we first used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify γH2AX-containing ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), which form at the sites of DNA damage (Figure 3A ). Unirradiated HSPCs and MPs all displayed extremely low levels of IRIF and, after exposure to 2 Gy IR, showed an immediate induction of γH2AX-positive DNA damage foci. By 4–24 hr post-IR, the numbers of IRIF declined in HSPCs with relatively faster kinetics than in MPs. To determine whether the loss of γH2AX foci corresponded to ongoing DNA repair or simply reflected cell elimination, we next subjected unirradiated and irradiated cells to an alkaline COMET assay and scored the tail DNA content on a 0 (undamaged) to 4 (very damaged) scale to assess the severity of the resulting DNA damage (Figure 3B). We started this assay with identical numbers of cells for all conditions and normalized the tail DNA content score for the numbers of cells actually detected on the agarose slides, to account for the observation that dying cells are often lost during the various steps of this experimental procedure. Quantification of the results revealed that all three populations acquired equivalent amounts of DNA damage 2 hr after irradiation (Figure 3C and Table S1). By 24 hr post-IR, we observed a significant shift toward less damaged tail DNA content scores in HSPCs, which occurred without overall loss of cells thereby demonstrating active ongoing DNA repair. In contrast, in MPs, we predominantly observed cell elimination, with the persistence of only undamaged cells or a few cells undergoing DNA repair. Taken together, these results demonstrate that irradiated HSPCs survive and undergo DNA repair, and confirm that the majority of irradiated MPs are eliminated. They also highlight the fact that the decrease in γH2AX staining can be skewed because of the confounding impact of cell death (as in MPs) and, although marking the resolution of DSBs (as in HSPCs), cannot simply be equated with complete DNA repair. We then investigated the type of DSB repair mechanisms used by irradiated HSPCs and the few surviving MPs. To assess HR activity, we quantified IRIF containing the Rad51 recombinase protein by immunofluorescence microscopy. Unfortunately, none of the components of the NHEJ machinery that we examined (Ku70, Ku80) were detectable by microscopy in IRIF (data not shown). Therefore, as a surrogate, we quantified IRIF containing the 53BP1 DNA damage response protein as 53BP1 has been shown to function, albeit not exclusively, in NHEJ. Rad51 IRIF formation occurred rapidly in irradiated MPs, reaching its maximum (∼50% of the cells) by 2 hr (CMPs) and 4 hr (GMPs) post-IR and then remaining unchanged for up to 24 hr (Figure 4A ). In contrast, no significant Rad51 recruitment was observed in HSPCs until 24 hr post-IR. This staining pattern is consistent with the proliferation index of the respective populations (Figure S3), with irradiated HSPCs being mostly quiescent at the start of the culture and only initiating their first cell division by ∼ 24 hours in vitro (Figure 1C). Conversely, recruitment of 53BP1 in IRIF occurred immediately in all three populations but then declined at a slower rate in HSPCs (Figure 4B). To support these observations, we also analyzed the basal expression level of HR and NHEJ components in freshly isolated HSPCs, CMPs, and GMPs (Figure 4C). Strikingly, we found that all of the HR components and/or regulators we investigated were expressed at significantly higher levels in MPs compared to HSPCs, whereas the NHEJ machinery components were either dramatically decreased (Ku80) or unchanged in MPs. Finally, we used a reporter assay in which the religation of a digested plasmid expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) allowed a measurement of the NHEJ activity present at baseline and after IR in transfected cells (Figure S4). Consistent with the predominance of NHEJ as a repair mechanism in HSPCs, we observed high basal levels of NHEJ activity in unirradiated HSPCs and a ∼2-fold increase after irradiation (Figure 4D and Figure S4). In sharp contrast, GMPs displayed extremely low basal levels and no IR-mediated induction of NHEJ activity, whereas CMPs showed intermediary levels of basal and IR-mediated NHEJ activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSPCs are forced to initiate DNA repair with NHEJ-type mechanisms because of their largely quiescent cell cycle status and the molecular wiring of their DNA repair machinery. They also indicate that the few proliferating MPs that escape IR-mediated cell killing are molecularly primed to undergo HR-mediated DNA repair and do not use NHEJ-type mechanisms. It has been suggested that quiescence provides HSCs with enhanced resistance to genotoxic stress (Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R.

To experimentally test this assumption, we forced HSPCs to proliferate before exposing them to 2 Gy IR (Figure 5A ). First, we precultured resting HSPCs (“Rest. HSPCs”) for ∼ 24 hours in vitro (“24hr preC HSPCs”) to induce their proliferation and, second, we used an in vivo mobilization treatment (Passegué et al., 2005Passegué E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. Global analysis of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fates.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) to harvest proliferating bone marrow HSPCs (“Mob. HSPCs”) after one injection of cyclophosphamide and 2 days of stimulation with G-CSF. Both strategies resulted in a net increase in HSPC cycling rates as measured after a 1 hr BrdU pulse (Figure 5B) and a loss of quiescence as measured by intracellular 7AAD/PyroninY staining (Figure 5C). Strikingly, no differences were observed in the radioresistance of proliferating HSPCs compared to resting HSPCs with either clonogenic survival assay in methylcellulose (Figure 5D) or proliferation in liquid culture (Figure 5E). At the molecular level, we found that proliferating HSPCs had decreased basal levels of prosurvival genes, varied levels of proapoptotic genes, and constitutively higher apoptosis rates than quiescent HSPCs (Figure S5 and Figure 5F). However, like quiescent HSPCs, proliferating HSPCs did not show a significant IR-mediated apoptotic response (Figure 5F), but unlike quiescent HSPCs, they did not undergo IR-mediated growth arrest and displayed an attenuated p53-mediated response including limited induction of p21 expression (Figure 5G and Figure S5). Altogether, these results indicate a major rewiring of the DNA damage response in proliferating HSPCs to one that closely resembles the response observed in MPs. However, this does not result in an analogous loss of radioresistance suggesting that proliferative HSPCs still retain additional, yet unexplored, protective mechanism(s) that are not shared by their more differentiated progeny. Next, we investigated the type of DNA repair mechanisms that were used by 2 Gy-irradiated proliferating HSPCs. We observed similar kinetics of γH2AX IRIF induction and resolution in both resting and proliferating HSPCs, indicating that they are equally efficient at repairing IR-induced DSBs (Figure S5). However, in contrast to quiescent HSPCs, proliferating HSPCs immediately formed Rad51 IRIF, which reached maximum levels by 2–4 hr post-IR and remained elevated throughout the 24 hr experiment (Figure 6A ). 53BP1 recruitment to IRIF also occurred immediately in proliferating HSPCs but sharply declined thereafter and returned to basal levels by 12 hr post-IR, in contrast to the slow decline seen in resting HSPCs (Figure 6B). Consistent with the rewiring of the DNA damage response, we also found increased expression of HR genes and decreased expression of NHEJ components in proliferating HSPCs compared to quiescent HSPCs (Figure 6C). Although the basal levels of NHEJ activity were not significantly different in unirradiated cells (Figure S4), we observed a complete abrogation of IR-mediated induction of NHEJ activity in proliferating HSPCs compared to resting HSPCs (Figure 6D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that quiescence dramatically restricts HSPCs' ability to use the high-fidelity HR-mediated repair and instead forces them to rely on the more error-prone NHEJ mechanism to repair DSBs. NHEJ-mediated repair can be mutagenic in many ways, most commonly by causing deletion of microhomology sequences flanking the breakpoint or insertions at the DSB joint region. Given that IR can induce DSBs anywhere in the genome, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in an attempt to determine whether NHEJ-mediated mutagenic repair could result in molecular-level deletions within a fragile chromosomal region, leading to loss of hybridization signals. Unirradiated and 2 Gy-irradiated quiescent HSPCs were grown in culture for 4 to 5 days for maximal expansion, treated for 4 hr with Colcemid, and fixed for cytogenetic studies, and interphase cells were then hybridized with a probe for the mouse Fhit locus common fragile site. No significant difference in signal intensity could be observed between unirradiated and irradiated cells using this approach (Figure S6). More sensitive techniques will therefore be required to assess these particular forms of mutagenic NHEJ-mediated DSBs repair. NHEJ has also been shown to be very proficient at mediating chromosomal translocations, whereas HR-type repair are not because of crossover suppression (Weinstock et al., 2006Weinstock D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2046157151,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult hippocampus divide infrequently, and the molecules that modulate their quiescence are largely unknown. Here, we show that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is active in hippocampal NSCs, downstream of BMPR-IA. BMPs reversibly diminish proliferation of cultured NSCs while maintaining their undifferentiated state. In vivo, acute blockade of BMP signaling in the hippocampus by intracerebral infusion of Noggin first recruits quiescent NSCs into the cycle and increases neurogenesis; subsequently, it leads to decreased stem cell division and depletion of precursors and newborn neurons. Consistently, selective ablation of Bmpr1a in hippocampal NSCs, or inactivation of BMP canonical signaling in conditional Smad4 knockout mice, transiently enhances proliferation but later leads to a reduced number of precursors, thereby limiting neuronal birth. BMPs are therefore required to balance NSC quiescence/proliferation and to prevent loss of the stem cell activity that supports continuous neurogenesis in the mature hippocampus."

Until now, the most common source from which to derive human iPSCs has been skin fibroblasts (Lowry et al., 2008Lowry W.E. Richter L. Yachechko R. Pyle A.D. Tchieu J. Sridharan R. Clark A.T. Plath K.

Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for skin biopsies and the need to expand fibroblast cells for several passages in vitro represent a hurdle that must be overcome to make iPSC technology broadly applicable. Peripheral blood can be utilized as an easily accessible source of patient tissue for reprogramming. Here we derived iPSCs from frozen human peripheral blood samples. Some of the iPSCs had rearrangements of the T cell receptor (TCR), indicating that T cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency. Recently, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized CD34+ blood cells have been used as a source from which to derive iPSCs (Loh et al., 2009Loh Y.H. Agarwal S. Park I.H. Urbach A. Huo H. Heffner G.C. Kim K. Miller J.D. Ng K. Daley G.Q. Blood. 2009; 113: 5476-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, this requires the subcutaneous injection of G-CSF, a process that can be applied only if the donor is in good medical condition. Also, the negative effects of treatment of patients with growth factors such as erythropoietin (Miller et al., 2009Miller C.P. Lowe K.A. Valliant-Saunders K. Kaiser J.F. Mattern D. Urban N. Henke M. Blau C.A. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and G-CSF are still being investigated. Of concern is the use of G-CSF because this cytokine is a growth factor for myeloid cell precursors (Touw and van de Geijn, 2007Touw I.P. van de Geijn G.J. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 800-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and because G-CSF treatment of patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) can result in a truncated G-CSF receptor allele and acute myeloid leukemia transformation (Touw, 1997Touw I.P. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1997; 10: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Derivation of iPSCs from peripheral mononuclear blood cells would circumvent all these issues; in addition, peripheral blood is the most accessible adult tissue and permits access to numerous frozen samples already stored at blood banks. Such samples could be expanded in culture and reprogrammed to iPSCs, which in turn allows researchers to study the molecular mechanism underlying blood and other disorders. We show here the derivation of iPSC clones from mature peripheral blood T and myeloid cells. Mononuclear (MNC) blood cells were isolated from several donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Ferrante and Thong, 1980Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Vissers et al., 1988Vissers M.C. Jester S.A. Fantone J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 110: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Samples were frozen and thawed days to several months after freezing and expanded in IL-7 or in G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-3 for 5 days. In our initial experiments we used the FUW-M2rtTA and the individual doxycycline-inducible lentiviruses encoding Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, or Klf4 (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). However, in ten independent experiments we were not able to reprogram peripheral blood cells with this system. One possibility for failure to obtain iPSCs is that peripheral blood cells are difficult to infect, reducing the probability of obtaining cells carrying the four factors as well as the FUW-M2rtTA construct. Also, we find that the efficiency of blood reprogramming (0.001%–0.0002%) is approximately 10–50 times lower than that of human fibroblast reprogramming. To increase the infection efficiency, we used a doxycycline-inducible lentivirus encoding all four factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc from a polycistronic expression cassette (pHAGE2-TetOminiCMV-hSTEMCCA) (Sommer et al., 2010Sommer C.A. Sommer A.G. Longmire T.A. Christodoulou C. Thomas D.D. Gostissa M. Alt F.W. Murphy G.J. Kotton D.N. Mostoslavsky G. Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 64-74PubMed Google Scholar). Blood cells were simultaneously infected with a constitutively active lentivirus encoding the reverse tetracycline transactivator (FUW-M2rtTA) (Hockemeyer et al., 2008Hockemeyer D. Soldner F. Cook E.G. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) as well as the polycistronic vector. Infected blood cells were transferred onto feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and cultured in the presence of IL-7 or G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-3 and 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for an additional 4 days (Figure 1A ). At day 5 after Dox induction, the cells were transferred to human ESC medium containing 2 μg/ml Dox, and 25–40 days later colonies were picked and expanded. We obtained iPSC colonies from several donors of different age (25–65 years) (Table S1 available online). We found that cells cultured in the presence of IL-7 expanded and reprogrammed more efficiently than cells grown in the presence of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-6. Southern blot analyses probing for M2rtTA vector integrations indicated that several iPSC lines of donors 3 (Figure S1A) and 4 (and data not shown) were derived from independent cells. Colonies were expanded into stable, Dox-independent iPSC lines that were not dependent on exogenous factor expression (Figure S1B). iPSCs that displayed the morphology characteristic of human ESCs had a normal karyotype (Figure S1C) and stained positive for the pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Tra1-81 (Figure 1B). Blood-derived iPSCs were cultured up to 35 passages and had elongated telomeres as shown by Southern blot analyses via an 800 bp TTAGGG repeat probe (Figure 1C; de Lange, 1992de Lange T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To assess the in vitro differentiation capacity of the iPSC lines, the cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of mesodermal (Brachyury), endodermal (AFP), and ectodermal (NCAM) markers demonstrated that all three lineage markers were upregulated in the differentiated EBs as compared to the undifferentiated iPSC lines (Figure 1D). To evaluate their in vivo differentiation potential, the iPSCs were injected subcutaneously into NOD-SCID mice and tumors were removed after 6–8 weeks. Histological analyses revealed that cell types characteristic for all three germ layers including ectoderm (neural rosette, neural epithelium), mesoderm (cartilage, bone), and endoderm (intestinal epithelium) were present (Figure 1E), indicative of pluripotency. Reactivation of Oct4 locus through demethylation of its promoter during reprogramming is a hallmark of iPSCs. We therefore determined the methylation patterns of the Oct4 promoter region in iPSCs and peripheral blood cells. iPSCs had mostly nonmethylated promoter regions characteristic for the active Oct4 gene, whereas peripheral blood samples showed the expected highly methylated promoter (Figure 1F). The results shown in Figure 1 indicate that peripheral blood-derived iPSCs are pluripotent and show the molecular and morphological characteristics of human ESCs. T cell development involves sequential genetic DNA rearrangements of the T cell receptor (TCRD > TCRG > TCRB > TCRA) or immunoglobulin loci (IGH > IGL > IGK), respectively (Davis and Bjorkman, 1988Davis M.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar, Kisielow and von Boehmer, 1995Kisielow P. von Boehmer H. Adv.

Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). This allowed us to retrospectively assess whether the iPSCs were derived from mature T cells (TCR gene rearrangements), B cells (IG gene rearrangements), or myeloid cells (no TCR/IG gene rearrangements). During normal development, T cells mature in the thymus and migrate into the periphery as fully differentiated cells (Kisielow and von Boehmer, 1995Kisielow P. von Boehmer H. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 87-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Detection of any TCR gene rearrangement in iPSCs derived from peripheral blood of healthy donors is, therefore, indicative of a mature T cell. PCR analyses were performed to detect potential TCR delta (TCRD), TCR gamma (TCRG), or TCR beta (TCRB) rearrangements via TCR primer sets designed by the BIOMED-2 consortium (van Dongen et al., 2003van Dongen J.J. Langerak A.W. Bruggemann M. Evans P.A. Hummel M. Lavender F.L. Delabesse E. Davi F. Schuuring E. Garcia-Sanz R. et al.Leukemia. 2003; 17: 2257-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar) and purchased from InVivoScribe Technologies. The primer mixes target conserved regions within the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining regions (J) of the TCRB, TCRD, or the V and J regions of TCRG, respectively. In a clonal cell population, amplification of this region results in a PCR product within a predictable size range. We identified bands within the valid size range for TCRB (Figure 2A ; Figure S1D) and/or TCRG (Figure 2B; Figure S1E) gene rearrangements for all iPSC clones derived from donors 3 and 4. All clones analyzed tested negative for TCRD rearrangements (Figure 2C and data not shown). Sequencing analyses further identified the specific nature of productive TCRB and productive or unproductive TCRG gene rearrangements as shown in Figure 2D. Some PCR conditions led to amplification of additional bands inside and outside the valid size range. We cloned numerous PCR products that were in close proximity to the expected size range and confirmed that they reflect unspecific amplicons (data not shown). One iPSC line (D1MiPS #1) derived in IL-7 was negative in all TCR gene rearrangement assays (Figures S2A–S2C). We therefore investigated whether this clone originated from a B lymphocyte or a myeloid cell. With the framework 1-3 primer sets (van Dongen et al., 2003van Dongen J.J. Langerak A.W. Bruggemann M. Evans P.A. Hummel M. Lavender F.L. Delabesse E. Davi F. Schuuring E. Garcia-Sanz R. et al.Leukemia. 2003; 17: 2257-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar), we did not detect any IGH gene rearrangements (Figure S2D), suggesting that this clone may have originated from a myeloid cell. As expected, the two iPSC clones (D2MiPS #1 and #2) derived in the presence of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-6 tested negative in all TCR (Figures S2A–S2C) or IGH gene (Figure S2D) rearrangement assays, whereas one iPSC line (D2TiPS#1) derived from the same donor in IL-7 tested positive for TCRG gene rearrangement (Figure S2C). In summary, our results indicate that iPSCs can be derived from terminally differentiated adult peripheral T cells. Current protocols for reprogramming human cells are based on skin fibroblasts, keratinocytes, or G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells (Loh et al., 2009Loh Y.H. Agarwal S. Park I.H. Urbach A. Huo H.

Here, we show that human peripheral blood T and myeloid cells cultured in IL-7 or G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-6 can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state via a polycistronic vector encoding Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Because of sequential DNA rearrangements of TCR or IG genes during lymphocyte development (Kisielow and von Boehmer, 1995Kisielow P. von Boehmer H. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 87-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Rajewsky, 1996Rajewsky K. Nature. 1996; 381: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), we were able to retrospectively assess that the majority of iPSCs were derived from peripheral blood T cells. Two clones obtained in G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-6 and one clone derived in IL-7 tested negative for TCR and IG gene rearrangements, suggesting that these iPSCs originated from myeloid cells. Proliferation of somatic cells is an important parameter of reprogramming (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the higher reprogramming efficiency of T lymphoyctes as compared to myeloid cells because T cells have higher proliferation rates and better long-term growth potential in vitro than myeloid cells. Our study demonstrates that peripheral blood can be utilized as an easily accessible source of patient tissue for reprogramming without the need to extensively maintain cell cultures prior to reprogramming experiments. This is an important step to make the iPSC technology more broadly applicable. Importantly, reprogramming of peripheral blood samples will permit access to numerous frozen samples already stored at blood banks. These samples are often of restricted use for research, because limited cell numbers do not allow experimental manipulations. This is particularly relevant if the patient is deceased and new material cannot be obtained. Generation of iPSCs from such samples could provide cell numbers large enough to retrospectively screen for genetic factors and to study molecular mechanisms underlying myeloid and lymphoid blood disorders. The culture conditions used in the current study primarily expanded T lymphocytes and myeloid cells and are probably the reason why B lymphocyte iPSCs were not derived. To expand B lymphocytes more efficiently, prior to the reprogramming process cells would need to be cultured in IL-4/CD40 ligand in order to promote B cell survival and expansion (von Bergwelt-Baildon et al., 2002von Bergwelt-Baildon M.S.

Generation of iPSCs without genomic integration of extrinsic genes is highly desirable. Initially, human dermal fibroblasts were used to derive human iPSCs (hiPSCs) (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007). However, recent studies have shown that other human somatic stem cells can be used (Aasen et al., 2008; Eminli et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).

Dermal fibroblasts are frequently used for reprogramming, but require an invasive skin biopsy and a prolonged period of expansion in cell culture prior to use. Here, we report the derivation of iPSCs from multiple human blood sources including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) harvested by routine venipuncture. Peripheral blood-derived human iPSC lines are comparable to human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with respect to morphology, expression of surface antigens, activation of endogenous pluripotency genes, DNA methylation, and differentiation potential.

https://openalex.org/W2141392414,"The transcriptional regulation of neuroectoderm (NE) specification is unknown. Here we show that Pax6 is uniformly expressed in early NE cells of human fetuses and those differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This is in contrast to the later expression of Pax6 in restricted mouse brain regions. Knockdown of Pax6 blocks NE specification from hESCs. Overexpression of either Pax6a or Pax6b, but not Pax6▵PD, triggers hESC differentiation. However, only Pax6a converts hESCs to NE. In contrast, neither loss nor gain of function of Pax6 affects mouse NE specification. Both Pax6a and Pax6b bind to pluripotent gene promoters but only Pax6a binds to NE genes during human NE specification. These findings indicate that Pax6 is a transcriptional determinant of the human NE and suggest that Pax6a and Pax6b coordinate with each other in determining the transition from pluripotency to the NE fate in human by differentially targeting pluripotent and NE genes."

Overexpression of human MSI2 in a mouse model increases HSC cell cycle progression and cooperates with the chronic myeloid leukemia-associated BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to induce an aggressive leukemia. MSI2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemia cell lines, and its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Expression levels in human myeloid leukemia directly correlate with decreased survival in patients with the disease, thereby defining MSI2 expression as a new prognostic marker and as a new target for therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)."
https://openalex.org/W2030173131,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells of patients hold great promise for modeling human diseases. Dermal fibroblasts are frequently used for reprogramming, but require an invasive skin biopsy and a prolonged period of expansion in cell culture prior to use. Here, we report the derivation of iPSCs from multiple human blood sources including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) harvested by routine venipuncture. Peripheral blood-derived human iPSC lines are comparable to human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with respect to morphology, expression of surface antigens, activation of endogenous pluripotency genes, DNA methylation, and differentiation potential. Analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangement revealed that some of the PBMC iPSCs were derived from T cells, documenting derivation of iPSCs from terminally differentiated cell types. Importantly, peripheral blood cells can be isolated with minimal risk to the donor and can be obtained in sufficient numbers to enable reprogramming without the need for prolonged expansion in culture. Reprogramming from blood cells thus represents a fast, safe, and efficient way of generating patient-specific iPSCs. Somatic cells can be induced to the pluripotent state by the enforced expression of several transcription factors including OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC, NANOG, and LIN28 (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

Human iPSCs are commonly generated from dermal fibroblasts harvested by surgical skin biopsy (Park et al., 2008bPark I.H. Lerou P.H. Zhao R. Huo H. Daley G.Q. Nat.

Masuda T. Sakata H. Ono T. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2003; 41: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), raising concerns for whether iPSCs will reflect the patient's constitutional genotype. For routine clinical application, it would be desirable to reprogram cell types that are safe and can be collected noninvasively in large numbers. Blood is a cell source that can be easily obtained from patients. Mouse B and T cells are amenable to reprogramming by overexpressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc with the ectopic expression of Cepbα and p53 knockdown, respectively (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna J.

A recent study with peripheral blood from donors with myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) isolated iPSC colonies that contain the JAK2-V617F mutation (Ye et al., 2009Ye Z. Zhan H. Mali P. Dowey S. Williams D.M. Jang Y.Y. Dang C.V. Spivak J.L. Moliterno A.R. Cheng L. Blood. 2009; 114: 5473-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but MPD is characterized by abnormally high numbers of circulating CD34+ cells from the bone marrow. These previous studies demonstrating successful reprogramming of blood cells into iPSCs have relied on specialized blood cell sources with high proliferative potential. CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells mobilized into the donor's peripheral blood by pretreatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can be successfully reprogrammed to pluripotency (Loh et al., 2009Loh Y.H. Agarwal S. Park I.H. Urbach A. Huo H. Heffner G.C. Kim K. Miller J.D. Ng K. Daley G.Q. Blood. 2009; 113: 5476-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To test whether we can reprogram cells from routine peripheral blood (PB) sources, we obtained CD34+ purified blood samples from a healthy 49-year-old male donor who had undergone simple apheresis without cytokine priming. We also isolated mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the peripheral blood samples collected by venipuncture of four healthy donors (28- to 49-years-old) via Ficoll density centrifugation. To induce reprogramming of enriched CD34+ blood cells, we infected with lentiviruses expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC reprogramming factors (Figure 1A ). Colonies with well-defined hESC-like morphology were first observed 21 days after transduction (Figure 1B). For reprogramming of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we employed two rounds of lentiviral infection (day 0 and day 8) and isolated colonies with distinct flat and compact morphology with clear-cut round edges reminiscent of hESCs after a slightly longer latency of around 35 days (Figure 1C). Interestingly, a previous study with a single round of lentiviral infection of PBMCs failed to observe iPSC colony formation (Haase et al., 2009Haase A. Olmer R. Schwanke K. Wunderlich S. Merkert S. Hess C. Zweigerdt R. Gruh I. Meyer J. Wagner S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 434-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments, we tested the ability of retroviruses encoding the human reprogramming factors to generate iPSCs from human PBMCs, and despite low infection efficiency, we observed iPSC colonies after 25–35 days (Figure 1D). With immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we analyzed the iPSC lines for expression of markers shared with hESCs. Consistent with their hESC-like morphology, both PB34 iPSCs and PBMC iPSCs stained positive for Tra-1-81, NANOG, OCT4, Tra-1-60, SSEA4, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining (Figures 1B–1D; Figures S1A–S1C available online; Chan et al., 2009Chan E.M.

We routinely observed a reprogramming efficiency of 0.002% for PB CD34+ cells (Table S1), comparable to prior experience with primary fibroblasts, mobilized PBMCs, and cord blood cell reprogramming (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

For PBMCs, we obtained hESC-like colonies at the lower efficiency of 0.0008%–0.001% (Table S1). We further characterized the PB34 iPSC and PBMC iPSC lines for properties specific to hESCs. Efficient transgene silencing is essential for the derivation of pluripotent iPSC lines (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR via primers specific for endogenous and total transcripts of the reprogramming factors confirmed that OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC transgenes were efficiently silenced in the blood-derived iPSCs (Figure S1D). Additional analysis via quantitative PCR revealed the activation of pluripotency markers NANOG, hTERT, REX1, and GDF3 to a level similar to the expression in H1 hESCs (Figure 1E). We next performed global gene expression analysis of the peripheral blood-derived iPSCs comparing it to hESCs, fibroblast iPSCs, and somatic parental cells. Clustering analysis revealed a high degree of similarity among the reprogrammed iPSCs (dH1F-iPS, PBMC iPS1, PB34 iPS1, PB34 iPS2), which clustered together with the H1 and H9 ESCs and were distant from the parental somatic cells, as determined by a Euclidean distance metric (Figure S1E). Analysis of scatter plots similarly shows a tighter correlation among reprogrammed iPSCs (PB34 iPSCs, PBMC iPSCs) and human ESCs (H1 ESCs) than between differentiated parental cells and their reprogrammed derivatives (Figure 1F). Consistent with the activation of endogenous pluripotency-associated gene expression, reprogramming of the blood cells was accompanied by the demethylation of CpG dinucleotides at the NANOG promoters (Figure 1G). Moreover, cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyotypes for the iPSC lines (Figure S1F). Next, we evaluated the developmental potential of the iPSC lines by in vitro embryoid body differentiation, hematopoietic colony forming assays, and in vivo teratoma induction. The iPSCs readily formed embryoid bodies upon induction (Figure S2A). qRT-PCR of the differentiated cells showed strong suppression of the pluripotency genes and activation of lineage-specific genes representing the three germ layers (Figures S2B and S2C). Hematopoietic differentiation of iPSC lines resulted in erythroid, myeloid, and granulocytic colony formation (Figures 2A and 2B ). Interestingly, all PB CD34+-derived iPS lines we tested show greater hematopoietic colony forming activity than PBMC iPSCs (Figure 2A). The most rigorous test for pluripotency of human ESCs is the formation of teratomas in immunodeficient mouse hosts (Lensch et al., 2007Lensch M.W. Schlaeger T.M. Zon L.I. Daley G.Q. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon subcutaneous injection into immunodeficient Rag2−/−γc−/− mice, the iPSC lines generated well-differentiated cystic teratomas representing all three embryonic germ layers (Figures 2C and 2D). DNA fingerprinting analysis verified that these cells were indeed derived from the parental blood cells and not a result of contamination from existing hESC or iPSC lines (Table S2). The iPSC clones have been propagated for at least 20 passages as of this submission. Because peripheral blood mononuclear cells consist of both myeloid and lymphoid elements (Figure S2D), we were interested in determining the lineage of origin of the reprogrammed cells. We tested the iPSC clones for the presence of functionally rearranged immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes by using probes specific for IgH, TCR-δ, and TCR-β2. Among 12 independent clones from 3 separate individuals, we failed to detect IgH recombination, indicating that none of our lines arose from B lymphocytes (Figure S2E). As reported for the mouse, reprogramming human B lymphocytes may require additional factors like CEBPα (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Schorderet P. Carey B.W. Beard C. Wernig M. Creyghton M.P. Steine E.J. Cassady J.P. Foreman R. et al.Cell. 2008; 133: 250-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the iPSC lines for TCR-δ and TCR-β2 recombination (Figures 2E and 2F; Figure S2F). No PBMC iPSC lines demonstrated TCR-β2 recombination, whereas six of seven PBMC iPSC lines isolated from a single donor sample exhibited rearrangement of the TCR-δ locus, indicative of derivation from cells of the T lineage (Figure 2F). In contrast, PBMC iPSC lines from donors 34 and 76 lacked rearrangement of IgH, TCR-δ, and TCR-β2, indicating derivation from nonlymphoid lineages (Figure 2F; Figures S2E and S2F). Isolation of iPSCs from T lymphocytes represents definitive proof that even terminally differentiated human cells are susceptible to reprogramming to pluripotency. Distinct protocols of cytokine stimulation and viral infection of the PBMC cells may predispose to derivation from lymphoid versus nonlymphoid hematopoietic cells from peripheral blood sources, as can preselection of lymphoid target cells prior to reprogramming (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2009; 460: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). PBMCs from donor GH were grown in medium containing IL-3, which is known to stimulate the growth of subsets of CD4+ T cells (Figure S2D; Mueller et al., 1994Mueller D.L. Chen Z.M. Schwartz R.H. Gorman D.M. Kennedy M.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3014-3027PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PBMCs from donors 34 and 76 were cultured in medium promoting expansion of dendritic cells and yielded iPSCs with germline IgH and TCR alleles. For applications in regenerative medicine, iPSCs containing antibody or T cell receptor gene rearrangement may be undesirable (Serwold et al., 2007Serwold T. Hochedlinger K. Inlay M.A. Jaenisch R. Weissman I.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 928-938PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have successfully reprogrammed cells from peripheral blood sources including samples obtained through routine venipuncture. Our study provides a strategy for the reliable generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although the per-cell derivation efficiency is low, peripheral blood is an accessible source of a large number of primary cells (easily 105–106), thus enabling reliable iPSC isolation from only a few milliliters of whole blood.

Generation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Human Terminally Differentiated Circulating T CellsSeki et al.Cell Stem CellJuly 02, 2010In BriefThe direct reprogramming of somatic cells to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a prominent recent advance in stem cell biology (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). Generation of iPSCs without genomic integration of extrinsic genes is highly desirable. Initially, human dermal fibroblasts were used to derive human iPSCs (hiPSCs) (Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007). However, recent studies have shown that other human somatic stem cells can be used (Aasen et al., 2008; Eminli et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009).

The generation of patient-specific pluripotent cells is therefore an important goal of regenerative medicine. A major step to achieve this was the recent discovery that ectopic expression of defined transcription factors induces pluripotency in somatic cells (Lowry et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008b; Takahashi et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007).

https://openalex.org/W2097879198,"Highly regenerative tissues such as blood must possess effective DNA damage responses (DDR) that balance long-term regeneration with protection from leukemogenesis. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain life-long blood production, yet their response to DNA damage remains largely unexplored. We report that human HSCs exhibit delayed DNA double-strand break rejoining, persistent gammaH2AX foci, and enhanced p53- and ASPP1-dependent apoptosis after gamma-radiation compared to progenitors. p53 inactivation or Bcl-2 overexpression reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and preserved in vivo repopulating HSC function. Despite similar protection from irradiation-induced apoptosis, only Bcl-2-overexpressing HSCs showed higher self-renewal capacity, establishing that intact p53 positively regulates self-renewal independently from apoptosis. The reduced self-renewal of HSCs with inactivated p53 was associated with increased spontaneous gammaH2AX foci in secondary transplants of HSCs. Our data reveal distinct physiological roles of p53 that together ensure optimal HSC function: apoptosis regulation and prevention of gammaH2AX foci accumulation upon HSC self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2100980793,"Background Radiotherapy kills tumor-cells by inducing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, the efficient repair of tumors frequently prevents successful treatment. Therefore, identifying new practical sensitizers is an essential step towards successful radiotherapy. In this study, we tested the new hypothesis: identifying the miRNAs to target DNA DSB repair genes could be a new way for sensitizing tumors to ionizing radiation. Principal Findings Here, we chose two genes: DNA-PKcs (an essential factor for non-homologous end-joining repair) and ATM (an important checkpoint regulator for promoting homologous recombination repair) as the targets to search their regulating miRNAs. By combining the database search and the bench work, we picked out miR-101. We identified that miR-101 could efficiently target DNA-PKcs and ATM via binding to the 3′- UTR of DNA-PKcs or ATM mRNA. Up-regulating miR-101 efficiently reduced the protein levels of DNA-PKcs and ATM in these tumor cells and most importantly, sensitized the tumor cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions These data demonstrate for the first time that miRNAs could be used to target DNA repair genes and thus sensitize tumors to radiation. These results provide a new way for improving tumor radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2094813482,"Optimal function of neuronal networks requires interplay between rapid forms of Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms that adjust the threshold for plasticity, termed metaplasticity. Numerous forms of rapid synapse plasticity have been examined in detail. However, the rules that govern synaptic metaplasticity are much less clear. Here, we demonstrate a local subunit-specific switch in NMDA receptors that alternately primes or prevents potentiation at single synapses. Prolonged suppression of neurotransmitter release enhances NMDA receptor currents, increases the number of functional NMDA receptors containing NR2B, and augments calcium transients at single dendritic spines. This local switch in NMDA receptors requires spontaneous glutamate release but is independent of action potentials. Moreover, single inactivated synapses exhibit a lower induction threshold for both long-term synaptic potentiation and plasticity-induced spine growth. Thus, spontaneous glutamate release adjusts plasticity threshold at single synapses by local regulation of NMDA receptors, providing a novel spatially delimited form of synaptic metaplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2108774467,"Sensory systems are known to adapt their coding strategies to the statistics of their environment, but little is still known about the perceptual implications of such adjustments. We investigated how auditory spatial processing adapts to stimulus statistics by presenting human listeners and anesthetized ferrets with noise sequences in which interaural level differences (ILD) rapidly fluctuated according to a Gaussian distribution. The mean of the distribution biased the perceived laterality of a subsequent stimulus, whereas the distribution's variance changed the listeners' spatial sensitivity. The responses of neurons in the inferior colliculus changed in line with these perceptual phenomena. Their ILD preference adjusted to match the stimulus distribution mean, resulting in large shifts in rate-ILD functions, while their gain adapted to the stimulus variance, producing pronounced changes in neural sensitivity. Our findings suggest that processing of auditory space is geared toward emphasizing relative spatial differences rather than the accurate representation of absolute position."

The initial cleavage of APP can be mediated by α- or β-secretase (or BACE1). α-Secretase cleavage produces sAPPα and α C-terminal fragment (or C83); β-secretase cleavage produces sAPPβ and β C-terminal fragment (C99).

However, to date, the effects of curcumin on APP metabolism have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of curcumin on Aβ levels and APP processing in mouse primary cortical neurons and various cell lines. Curcumin potently lowered Aβ levels and hindered APP maturation. Curcumin also markedly attenuated the effects of brefeldin A (BFA), a specific Golgi-disrupting agent, on APP maturation and trafficking. Taken together, we have elucidated a novel curcumin-dependent mechanism for lowering Aβ levels via attenuation of APP maturation.DISCUSSIONWe have described a possible cellular mechanism underlying in vivo observations of decreased Aβ deposition and plaque burden in AD transgenic mice following treatment of curcumin (14Yang F.

Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We have shown that curcumin decreases Aβ levels by retarding APP maturation and possibly, impairing endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Immature APP (or N-APP) is N-glycosylated in the ER, and a fraction of these molecules exit the ER and undergo O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex to become mature APP (or N,O-APP) (35Xia W. Zhang J. Kholodenko D. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7977-7982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Mature APP is then sorted onto the plasma membrane after which it can undergo endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (36Small S.A. Gandy S.

Our data show that curcumin significantly alters the ratio of APPma/APPim and markedly decreases the level of intermediate APP induced by BFA, an agent that disrupts the Golgi complex. Additionally, curcumin has been shown to be an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (31Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glöckner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 32Egan M.E. Glöckner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that curcumin may affect APP metabolism at the level of the ER. Though the precise underlying mechanism requires further elucidation, curcumin may delay the exit of immature APP from the ER, thereby increasing the stability of immature APP at the ER. Curcumin also may affect the endocytosis of APP from the cell surface. The cumulative effect would be a significant decrease in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels.Curcumin has been reported to modulate trafficking and maturation of other proteins, MLC1 (megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts) (38Teijido O. Martínez A. Pusch M. Zorzano A. Soriano E. Del Río J.A. Palacín M. Estévez R. Human Molecular Genetics. 2004; 13: 2581-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and ΔF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (31Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glöckner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). MLC1 encodes a plasma membrane protein, MLC1, which is responsible for a severe autosomal recessive clinical disorder, MLC, characterized by macrocephaly, deterioration in motor functions, cerebellar ataxia, and mental decline. Levels of MLC1 have been shown to be significantly decreased in cells expressing the mutant form of the gene.Curcumin has been shown to target dozens of proteins (39Aggarwal B.B. Sundaram C. Malani N. Ichikawa H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 595: 1-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar), and it may act on different biological pathways with distinct mechanisms at different dosages. It has been shown that curcumin has a dose-dependent effect on Aβ levels and inflammatory reactions in vivo (14Yang F. Lim G.P. Begum A.N. Ubeda O.J. Simmons M.R. Ambegaokar S.S. Chen P.P. Kayed R.

Here, we treated mouse primary cortical neurons with different concentrations of curcumin (1–20 μm) for 24 h and found that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels significantly decreased compared with control.Collectively, our data suggest that the cellular mechanism by which curcumin decreases Aβ levels is via the modulation of APP levels in the secretory and, possibly, endocytic pathways. Curcumin treatment significantly increased the retention of immature APP in the ER and simultaneously attenuated APP endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Collectively, our data, together with the previously published in vivo data, suggest that curcumin and its derivatives may prove useful in the search for small molecule pharmacological agents for the effective treatment and prevention of AD-related β-amyloid pathology.

Four genes have been established to either cause early-onset familial AD with complete penetrance (amyloid-β (A4) protein precursor (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) or to increase susceptibility for late-onset AD with partial penetrance (APOE) (2Bertram L.

Despite its heterogeneous inheritance, the functional neuropathology of AD is represented commonly by disruption in neural circuits, such as loss of neurons and synapses primarily in the neocortex and hippocampus (5Selkoe D.J.

However, to date, the effects of curcumin on APP metabolism have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of curcumin on Aβ levels and APP processing in mouse primary cortical neurons and various cell lines. Curcumin potently lowered Aβ levels and hindered APP maturation. Curcumin also markedly attenuated the effects of brefeldin A (BFA), a specific Golgi-disrupting agent, on APP maturation and trafficking. Taken together, we have elucidated a novel curcumin-dependent mechanism for lowering Aβ levels via attenuation of APP maturation. Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAPPamyloid-β precursor proteinAβamyloid-β peptideAPPmamature APPAPPimimmature APPsAPPαα-secretase-soluble amyloid-β precursor protein. is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the primary cause of dementia in the elderly (1Cummings J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the disease have revealed a complex and strong genetic etiology. Four genes have been established to either cause early-onset familial AD with complete penetrance (amyloid-β (A4) protein precursor (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) or to increase susceptibility for late-onset AD with partial penetrance (APOE) (2Bertram L.

Despite its heterogeneous inheritance, the functional neuropathology of AD is represented commonly by disruption in neural circuits, such as loss of neurons and synapses primarily in the neocortex and hippocampus (5Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar, 6Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10788) Google Scholar). The pathophysiology of AD is characterized by two distinctive features: amyloid plaques comprised primarily of a small peptide named Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau (2Bertram L. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 6Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10788) Google Scholar, 7Gandy S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1121-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Aβ42 and Aβ40 are the two primary Aβ species, Aβ42 is more prevalent than Aβ40 in amyloid plaques. Mounting genetic, biochemical, and molecular biological evidence suggests that the excessive accumulation of Aβ is the primary pathological event leading to AD (3Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 6Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10788) Google Scholar, 7Gandy S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1121-1129PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ is produced by a sequential proteolytic cleavage of the type I transmembrane protein, amyloid-β (A4) precursor protein (APP) (8Zhang C. Saunders A.J. Discov. Med. 2007; 7: 113-117PubMed Google Scholar). The initial cleavage of APP can be mediated by α- or β-secretase (or BACE1). α-Secretase cleavage produces sAPPα and α C-terminal fragment (or C83); β-secretase cleavage produces sAPPβ and β C-terminal fragment (C99). C83 and C99 can be further cleaved by γ-secretase to produce P3 or Aβ (2Bertram L. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 7Gandy S. J. Clin.

For more than a decade after the discovery of Aβ and the establishment of the Aβ hypothesis, one essential strategy for AD therapeutics has focused on modulating APP processing and decreasing Aβ levels (2Bertram L. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 768-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 9Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). Recently, considerable effort has been concentrated on identifying natural dietary supplements that can prevent, inhibit, or reverse Aβ accumulation or aggregation (10Calabrese V. Scapagnini G. Colombrita C. Ravagna A. Pennisi G. Giuffrida Stella A.M. Galli F. Butterfield D.A. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence supports a use for curcumin in AD therapeutics. Curcumin (diferulomethane) is a yellow pigment in turmeric (or curcuma longa), the widely used spice, and a food additive used primarily in Indian culinary preparations (11Begum A.N. Jones M.R.

We have shown that curcumin decreases Aβ levels by retarding APP maturation and possibly, impairing endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Immature APP (or N-APP) is N-glycosylated in the ER, and a fraction of these molecules exit the ER and undergo O-glycosylation in the Golgi complex to become mature APP (or N,O-APP) (35Xia W.

Our data show that curcumin significantly alters the ratio of APPma/APPim and markedly decreases the level of intermediate APP induced by BFA, an agent that disrupts the Golgi complex. Additionally, curcumin has been shown to be an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (31Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glöckner-Pagel J.

Collectively, these findings suggest that curcumin may affect APP metabolism at the level of the ER. Though the precise underlying mechanism requires further elucidation, curcumin may delay the exit of immature APP from the ER, thereby increasing the stability of immature APP at the ER. Curcumin also may affect the endocytosis of APP from the cell surface. The cumulative effect would be a significant decrease in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels.Curcumin has been reported to modulate trafficking and maturation of other proteins, MLC1 (megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts) (38Teijido O.

Here, we treated mouse primary cortical neurons with different concentrations of curcumin (1–20 μm) for 24 h and found that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels significantly decreased compared with control.Collectively, our data suggest that the cellular mechanism by which curcumin decreases Aβ levels is via the modulation of APP levels in the secretory and, possibly, endocytic pathways. Curcumin treatment significantly increased the retention of immature APP in the ER and simultaneously attenuated APP endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Collectively, our data, together with the previously published in vivo data, suggest that curcumin and its derivatives may prove useful in the search for small molecule pharmacological agents for the effective treatment and prevention of AD-related β-amyloid pathology.

Here, we treated mouse primary cortical neurons with different concentrations of curcumin (1–20 μm) for 24 h and found that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels significantly decreased compared with control. Collectively, our data suggest that the cellular mechanism by which curcumin decreases Aβ levels is via the modulation of APP levels in the secretory and, possibly, endocytic pathways. Curcumin treatment significantly increased the retention of immature APP in the ER and simultaneously attenuated APP endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Collectively, our data, together with the previously published in vivo data, suggest that curcumin and its derivatives may prove useful in the search for small molecule pharmacological agents for the effective treatment and prevention of AD-related β-amyloid pathology.

https://openalex.org/W1971147333,"Neuronal migration leads to a highly organized laminar structure in the mammalian brain, and its misregulation causes lissencephaly and behavioral and cognitive defects. Reelin signaling, which is mediated in part by a key adaptor, disabled-1 (Dab1), plays a critical but incompletely understood role in this process. We found that the neuron-specific RNA-binding protein Nova2 regulates neuronal migration in late-generated cortical and Purkinje neurons. An unbiased HITS-CLIP and exon junction array search for Nova-dependent reelin-pathway RNAs at E14.5 revealed only one candidate-an alternatively spliced isoform of Dab1 (Dab1.7bc). In utero electroporation demonstrated that Dab1.7bc was sufficient to induce neuronal migration defects in wild-type mice and exacerbate defects when Dab1 levels were reduced, whereas Dab1 overexpression mitigates defects in Nova2 null mice. Thus, Nova2 regulates an RNA switch controlling the ability of Dab1 to mediate neuronal responsiveness to reelin signaling and neuronal migration, suggesting new links between splicing regulation, brain disease, and development."

Although great strides have been made toward a molecular understanding of self-renewal in ESCs, it has proven more challenging to pinpoint the genes directing this process in HSCs. Insight into the regulatory mechanisms of HSC self-renewal may be provided by examining its mode of division. During homeostasis, for example, the HSC must divide in such a way as to maintain its numbers while also producing all required mature cells. In other stem cell systems including those of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, where stem cells can be unambiguously identified as well as spatially located within their endogenous niche, the maintenance of appropriate numbers of primitive cells and diverse downstream cell types is known to occur through conserved mechanisms of asymmetric cell division (ACD). As such, ACDs represent one of the critical mechanisms of self-renewal regulation in these systems. One mode of ACD relies on signaling from a specialized niche to maintain the primitive cell state of only the daughter cell directly in contact with it (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an ACD can occur by the initial polarization of the primitive mother cell followed by the asymmetric segregation and acquisition of intracellular fate determinants upon division (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A. Mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell division.Cell. 2008; 132: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In this case, the loss or mutation of specific determinants normally acquired by the stem cell results in a depletion of stem cell numbers and the accumulation of differentiated cell types. Conversely, both daughter cells will maintain the stem cell state in situations where determinants of differentiation are depleted. Indeed, a connection between the maintenance of asymmetric divisions and tumor suppression has recently been provided in the fly system. In one example, depletion of any of four such determinants (lgl, mira, prospero, brat) in the Drosophila larval neuroblast (NB) leads to predominantly symmetric self-renewal divisions such that both daughter cells behave like NBs whose unchecked self-renewal often leads to the formation of larval brain tumors (Betschinger et al., 2006Betschinger J.

Although it is generally assumed that HSCs undergo asymmetric self-renewal divisions in order to facilitate the balance between primitive and differentiated cells at steady state, it has been difficult to conclusively validate this as the exclusive mode of division largely due to the absence of an antigen that unambiguously distinguishes HSCs from their immediate more committed daughter cells. Several groups have shown that single hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) cultured in vitro can give rise to daughters with different in vitro potentials/fates (Beckmann et al., 2007Beckmann J. Scheitza S. Wernet P. Fischer J.C. Giebel B.

Although these results are consistent with the expected outcome of an ACD, asymmetric fates could also have been postmitotically imposed after an initially symmetric division. More recently, the Reya group has utilized the approach of time-lapse imaging to track individual HPCs during division (Wu et al., 2007Wu M. Kwon H.Y. Rattis F. Blum J. Zhao C. Ashkenazi R. Jackson T.L. Gaiano N. Oliver T. Reya T. Imaging hematopoietic precursor division in real time.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 541-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). They made use of an EGFP transgene under the control of activated Notch to first demonstrate that, at a population level, expression of GFP on cells in culture corresponded with their primitive potential in vivo. By relying on decreased GFP expression as an indicator of differentiation, they were able to correlate differential cell fate of paired daughter cells in culture with the asymmetric acquisition of the Numb protein, a known ACD determinant in other cell types (Cayouette and Raff, 2002Cayouette M. Raff M. Asymmetric segregation of Numb: A mechanism for neural specification from Drosophila to mammals.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this study did not address the functional importance of the numb determinant in these cells and therefore could not conclude whether its presence or absence was a cause or consequence of differential fate specification. Because of the aforementioned difficulty in specifically pinpointing HSCs in culture, it remains difficult to rely solely on visualization of primitive hematopoietic cell divisions to determine whether a polarization and segregation of specific cell fate determinants underlies the asymmetric/symmetric self-renewal of these cells. The existence of markers that unequivocally define leukemic stem cells (LSC) are also lacking, making it equally as challenging to use this strategy in isolation to assess whether deregulation of fate determinants could contribute to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies by disrupting the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. As has been done for ACD determinants in other systems, we opted instead to utilize a functional approach that explores the consequences of the downregulation of potentially critical fate determinants in HSCs. Specifically, we developed a functional genetics approach taking advantage of systematic RNAi to interrogate the HSC-specific function of polarity proteins and cell fate determinants implicated in the ACD of other stem cell model systems. With this strategy, we identified three genes essential for proper HSC function and one gene as an HSC antagonist. A list of 71 candidates involved in different aspects of polarity establishment and cell fate specification was assembled through a literature review of model organisms and subsequent documented expression in stem cell and leukemia databases (Faubert et al., 2004Faubert A. Lessard J. Sauvageau G. Are genetic determinants of asymmetric stem cell division active in hematopoietic stem cells?.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (S.B.T., unpublished data). The selection of a smaller subset of these genes was facilitated by Q-RT-PCR evaluation of the expression level of each candidate in a subset of murine bone marrow highly enriched for HSCs (S.B.T., unpublished data). Genes were ranked based on their level of expression and the reproducibility of this expression over multiple experiments. Based on this data, 20 of the most highly expressed genes which had not previously been reported in loss-of-function studies were selected for downregulation (Table S1 available online). For the primary screening approach depicted in Figure 1A , a total of two to three shRNAs were designed per gene and subsequently introduced into a retroviral vector encoding GFP to permit tracking of transduced cells in vivo. HSC-enriched Lin−CD150+CD48− cells (representing ∼60 functional long-term repopulating HSC [LTR-HSC] or competitive repopulation units [CRU]) were infected over 5 days by coculture with the retroviral producer cells in an arrayed 96-well format, i.e., 1 shRNA per well. This infection protocol was optimized to yield an average of 59% gene transfer (Figure S1). Directly after infection, the in vivo reconstituting potential of 1/4th of each well was evaluated through duplicate competitive repopulating assays involving the cotransplantation of 1.5 × 105 congenic bone marrow competitor cells into irradiated recipients. HSC activity was next monitored by flow cytometric evaluation of the extent of GFP+ cells in the peripheral blood sampled at early (4 and 8 weeks) and late (16–20 weeks) posttransplant time points. The screen made use of the principle that when two distinctly marked but functionally equivalent HSC populations are cotransplanted, their resultant grafts will be present at levels directly proportional to their input numbers. In preliminary studies with a control shRNA vector (i.e., shLuciferase), we found that it is critical to take into account the initial gene transfer efficiency in order to accurately identify shRNAs that positively or negatively impact LTR-HSC activity (Figure S1). Based on these results, we excluded experiments in which shRNA gene transfer were below 25% and, in each case, repeated the given shRNA transduction until results were achieved with higher level transduction. Moreover, we had to adapt our selection criteria to maximize the identification of hits in experiments where gene transfer was between 25% and 75% (see Figure 1B, left) from those where it exceeded this value (above 75%: Figure 1B, right). Indeed, at the 20 week time point in the primary screen, significant fluctuations from the initial ratio of infected to noninfected cells were detectable when gene transductions ranged from 25% to 75% (Figure S1B, see dotted red and green lines in left panel of Figure 1B). In contrast, this ratio remained much more stable in experiments where higher gene transfer (>75%) was achieved, necessitating the measurement of GFP as a percentage of the total peripheral blood (Figure S1B, see dotted green line in Figure 1C). Based on these two distinct sets of criteria adjusted for the differences in gene transfer (summarized in Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we found that 12 shRNAs were associated with a perturbation in LTR-HSC activity (see asterisk in Figure 1B, right and left). Ten of these 12 shRNAs (namely 3-shPard6a, 1-shMapre3, 2-shCtnna1, 1-shMsi2, 1-shLgl1, 1-shNumb, 2-shNumb, 2-shPard6a, 3-shMapre3, and 1-shPrkcz) appeared to antagonize LTR-HSC repopulation activity. The remaining two shRNAs, 2-shProx1 and 3-shProx1, were associated with increased levels of repopulation. In total, these 12 hits targeted 8 different genes, with Numb, Mapre3, and Prox1 each identified by two different shRNA sequences (Figure 1D). To confirm that the observed effects of each shRNA hit were specific to knockdown of the target transcript, we first examined the residual mRNA levels. Flow-sorted GFP+ cells were harvested directly from the remaining material within wells used for transplantation. Importantly, for 8 of the 12 shRNAs, transcripts were reduced from 60% to 7% the levels present in either the corresponding GFP− fraction or in GFP+ cells from shLuciferase control wells (Figure 1C). The remaining shRNAs, directed against the Mapre3, Lgl1, and Ctnna1 genes, were removed from further consideration because they induced little to no appreciable knockdown, suggesting that their ability to decrease reconstitution may have been the result of off-target effects. Each shRNA hit was also retested in at least two independent validation experiments that resulted in the further elimination of hairpins against Numb because their effects were not reproducible (data not shown). It is important to note that this lack of reproducibility is not an artifact of insufficient shRNA levels as shown by the fact that gene transduction was in every case above 65%. We next tested whether the genes that were eliminated from further study were effectively knocked down by at least one of the shRNA sequences. The results from these experiments show that of eight excluded genes tested, seven were targeted by one or more hairpins with at least a 40% knockdown efficiency, signifying an overall low frequency of false negatives for the primary screen (Figure S1C). In summary, the primary screen and subsequent validation tests identified four hairpins to Msi2, Pard6a, and Prkcz as candidate suppressors and two additional shRNAs to Prox1 as potential enhancers of LTR-HSC activity. In independent experiments, cells infected with the control shRNA to luciferase were stably maintained to 20 weeks while few to no remaining cells with shRNAs against the candidate positive regulators were present at the end of the transplant (Figures 2A and 2B ). Moreover, at least two unique and effective (>45% knockdown) shRNAs, directed against Msi2, Pard6a, and Prkcz, were consistently able to substantially reduce and in some cases completely eliminate transduced cells from the donor graft (Figure 2B and Figure S2). Importantly, for Msi2 we were also able to generate shRNA constructs that gave a graded reduction in transcript levels. We show that at the 16 week time point posttransplant, the decrease in repopulation mediated by these is directly proportional to the level of Msi2 transcript knockdown (Figure 2C). Together, these results demonstrate that the observed loss in transduced cell-mediated reconstitution is specific to target transcript loss and is not due to off-target effects. Although the direct promotion of HSC commitment and differentiation would accurately explain the shRNA-induced defects in repopulation, these results could be accounted for by a number of alternate mechanisms: effects on downstream progenitor cells, increased apoptosis, altered cell cycle properties, or an inability to properly home to the bone marrow after intravenous transplantation. We explored each of these possibilities in turn. It should be noted that although we present below results of these experiments with one hairpin against each gene, similar results were observed in each case with a second, independent shRNA (data not shown). Colony-forming assays established immediately after the infection period indicated that the total colony output of GFP+ shRNA-transduced cells was the same as their untransduced counterparts and matched that of shluciferase-transduced cells (Figure 2D). Colonies generated by shRNA+ cells also showed no alteration in size with respect to controls. Moreover, control levels of high proliferative potential (HPP) colonies were also observed upon candidate knockdown, indicating that the proliferative capacity of progenitors was maintained (Figure 2D). In all cases there was no significant skewing in the lineages of shRNA-infected progenitors when colonies were scored by type (Figure 2E). These results show that proliferation and differentiation of myeloid and erythroid progenitors are unaffected by knockdown of the candidate genes. After a 10–12 day culture period, reduction of Msi2 and Prkcz (and less significantly Pard6a) induced a greater proportion of differentiated myeloid cells as measured by both size and granularity as well as presence of the antigens Gr-1 and CD11b, in comparison to control shLuciferase cultures (Figure 2F, left and middle). In accordance with this apparent skewing toward differentiation in culture, progenitor numbers were also decreased in shRNA-transduced cells relative to controls at this time point (Figure 2F, right). Despite their presence at low levels, mature cells of both the B and T cell lineages were also detectable in the bone marrow and thymus within residual RNAi grafts with knockdown of any of the three hits (data not shown). Together these data indicate that shRNA-infected lymphomyeloid progenitors are able to successfully differentiate into mature downstream cell types and further suggests that knockdown of Msi2, Pard6a, and Prkcz enhances the production of mature cells at the expense of progenitors. Hoechst staining carried out immediately after the infection of Lin−CD150+CD48− cells indicated that silencing of Msi2, Pard6a, or Prkcz elicited no change in the cell cycle profiles of gated Sca-1+Gr-1− cells when compared to those of control cultures. Similarly, no abnormalities were observed when cell cycle analysis was carried out on the bulk population of shRNA-transduced cells after an additional 5 days of culture (data not shown). In addition, for all candidate shRNAs as assessed by Annexin V staining, there was no increase in apoptosis in the transduced cell population in comparison to either nontransduced counterparts or shluciferase-transduced controls (Figure S3A). To test for a potential shRNA-induced defect in homing capacity, we transplanted 5-FU bone marrow cells infected with hairpins to each candidate-positive regulator. Twenty-four hours posttransplant, homing efficiency was determined by evaluating the total number of donor GFP+ cells as well as the number of donor GFP− and GFP+ colony-forming cells present in the bone marrow. This analysis indicated that knockdown of the candidates did not impair the absolute homing efficiency of bulk transduced cells (Figure S3C) nor did it inhibit the ability of GFP+ CFCs or more primitive HPPs to transit to the bone marrow (Figure 2G and Figure S3B). Cumulatively, these experiments serve to demonstrate that the GFP+ graft depletion observed with shRNA hits is not the result of overt inhibitory effects on progenitor cells, alteration of the cell cycle, promotion of cell death, or homing to the bone marrow. In line with the above data and in further support of a role for these factors in the regulation of very primitive cells, we observed in almost all cases a modest graft at the 4–6 week time point that was progressively depleted over time. Such transitory repopulation is consistent with early contribution by short-lived progenitors followed by the gradual loss of donor cells resulting from a lack of LTR-HSCs that would normally provide the reserve to supply stable donor hematopoiesis (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Mönch K. Astrand-Grundström I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

Murine hematopoietic stem cell characterization and its regulation in BM transplantation.Blood. 2000; 96: 3016-3022PubMed Google Scholar). This, in combination with an increased propensity toward in vitro differentiation after their knockdown, suggests that Msi2, Pard6a, and Prkcz could directly alter HSC or primitive cell fate choices toward more commitment/differentiation decisions; however, in vivo studies including direct measurements of LTR-HSC cycle status and apoptosis levels will be important in conclusively validating this potential mechanism. To confirm the positive effects of Prox1 knockdown on donor repopulation and to characterize the reconstitution kinetics, we carried out several independent experiments examining the contribution of shProx1 transduced cells to the recipient peripheral blood at multiple time points posttransplant. With 2-shProx1, which achieves more than 80% knockdown, we observed in all cases a steady increase in both the percentage of GFP+ cells within the Ly5.1+ graft as well as the GFP% within the peripheral blood. At the 20 week endpoint, peripheral blood sampling showed GFP+ cells comprised the majority of the graft, representing a proportional 1.6-fold increase over the percent GFP on the day of transplant. In contrast, control transduced GFP+ cells exhibited a slight decrease over time and at the transplant endpoint comprised approximately 50% less of the total peripheral blood than did shProx1+ cells (Figures 3A and 3B and data not shown). Similar results were observed with a second independent shRNA (3-shProx1, Figure S4B). Importantly, in vivo knockdown is restricted to the GFP+ as compared to GFP− donor cells when assessed at 35 weeks posttransplant, indicating that GFP expression is not silenced and continues to reliably mark shRNA transduced cells in mice at late transplant time points (Figure 3B, right). Despite the progressive accumulation of shProx1-infected cells, we observed no block in the differentiative capacity of these cells. The GFP+ portion of donor grafts appeared to be multilineage in nature, with mature erythroid, myeloid, B, and T lymphoid cells observed in similar proportions as shluciferase controls in the blood, bone marrow, and thymus (Figure 3C and data not shown). Surprisingly, however, we found that the phenotypically primitive compartment of Prox1 shRNA grafts was significantly expanded. The expression of CD150, Sca-1, and c-kit combined with an absence of surface CD48 and lineage antigens has been shown to be reliable in discriminating HSCs from more committed cell types in repopulated recipients (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Kiel M.J. Morrison S.J. SLAM family markers are conserved among hematopoietic stem cells from old and reconstituted mice and markedly increase their purity.Blood. 2006; 107: 924-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When tested for by flow cytometric evaluation of recipient bone marrow, the shRNA transduced GFP+ fraction of Ly5.1+ donor grafts exhibited a 4-fold expansion of this compartment. In contrast, shluciferase controls had a similar proportion of these primitive cells in both the GFP- and GFP+ fractions (Figures 3D and 3E). Preliminary secondary transplantations of BM harvested from single shLuciferase and shProx1 primary mice at limiting dilution indicated that Prox1 knockdown gives an in vivo fold expansion of repopulating cells approximately 2-logs greater than control transduced cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with the concept that the elevated levels of phenotypic HSCs after Prox1 RNAi is due to enhanced in vivo HSC self-renewal; however, conclusive validation of this hypothesis will require more detailed quantitative studies. The observed increase in HSC numbers in vivo by Prox1 knockdown prompted us to explore the possibility that reduction of Prox1 could also expand primitive cells in vitro. To address this, we kept cells in culture for an additional 7 days after the infection period. At this point, we observed an accumulation of shProx1+ cells that appear primitive or blast-like in nature, a finding similar to that seen after overexpression of the potent HSC expanding NupHD fusion protein or other agonists of HSC self-renewal (Deneault et al., 2009Deneault E. Cellot S. Faubert A. Laverdure J.P. Fréchette M. Chagraoui J. Mayotte N. Sauvageau M. Ting S.B. Sauvageau G. A functional screen to identify novel effectors of hematopoietic stem cell activity.Cell. 2009; 137: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, shLuciferase control cultures were comprised of predominantly more mature and differentiated myeloid cells (Figure 4A ). A similar assessment of primitiveness through immunophenotyping showed that Prox1 knockdown increased the proportion of Lin−Sca-1+ cells in D7-12 cultures (18.0% ± 1.7% for 3-shProx1 versus 9.0% ± 1.1% for shLuciferase controls, Figure 4A). Similar results were also observed for 2-shProx1 (data not shown). To directly test the in vivo output of Prox1 shRNA-transduced cells, we transplanted 1/8th of the contents of 7-day 96-well cultures in competition with 1.5 × 105 congenic bone marrow cells. Strikingly, we observed that the engraftment level was consistently and significantly enhanced with Prox1 knockdown cells relative to control shRNAs. It is important to note that in these experiments the percent gene transfer for shProx1 was significantly lower than for shLuciferase controls (63.0% versus 92.0%, Figure 4B). We therefore normalized the percent GFP cells in the peripheral blood to the amount of input GFP+ shluciferase cells to provide a better estimate of the actual difference in repopulating ability of shProx1+ cells in relation to controls. In fact, in relation to shLuciferase, Prox1 knockdown cells exhibit an impressive 5.1× more GFP+ cells per input GFP+ cell (data not shown). We then made use of the mean activity of stem cell (MAS) calculation, described by Ema and Nakauchi, to quantify the proliferative output per input LTR-HSC, taking into account the initial difference in gene transfer (Ema and Nakauchi, 2000Ema H. Nakauchi H. Expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in the developing liver of a mouse embryo.Blood. 2000; 95: 2284-2288PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, decreased levels of Prox1 by 2-shProx1 and 3-shProx1 mediated a remarkable 9.1- and 5.6-fold higher MAS, respectively, than controls, values similar to that achieved by cultured HOXB4-overexpressing cells (Figure 4B). We next quantified the actual HSC output mediated by Prox1 silencing through in vivo limiting dilution analyses. These results indicated that RNAi against the Prox1 gene yields a 6.9× greater frequency of HSC per equivalent proportion of control wells and a 5.2× greater frequency of HSCs per total cells (Figure 4C; Table S3). Interestingly, cells infected with either 2-shProx1 or 3-shProx1 do exhibit a slight increase in the proportion of cells in S and G2/M in vitro (Figure 4D and data not shown); however, as the frequency of HSCs also increase as a percentage of total cells in these cultures as compared to controls, we conclude that HSC expansion must be due in part to altered fate decisions toward more HSC renewal divisions.

However, few studies are prospective, and no study has evaluated the impact of the timing of ART when allocated randomly during an acute opportunistic infection (OI).A5164 randomized 282 subjects with AIDS-related OIs (tuberculosis excluded), to early or deferred ART. IRIS was identified prospectively using pre-defined criteria. We evaluated associations between IRIS and baseline variables in subjects with follow-up on ART using Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact tests, logistic regression, and Cox models with time-varying covariates. Twenty of 262 (7.6%) subjects developed IRIS after a median of 33 days on ART. Subjects with fungal infections (other than pneumocystis) developed IRIS somewhat more frequently (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.02, 7.2; p-value = 0.06 (using Fisher's exact test)). In Cox models, lower baseline and higher on-treatment CD4+ T-cell counts and percentage were associated with IRIS. Additionally, higher baseline and lower on-treatment HIV RNA levels were associated with IRIS. Corticosteroids during OI management and the timing of ART were not associated with the development of IRIS.In patients with advanced immunosuppression and non-tuberculous OIs, the presence of a fungal infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts and higher HIV RNA levels at baseline, and higher CD4+ T-cell counts and lower HIV RNA levels on treatment are associated with IRIS. Early initiation of ART does not increase the incidence of IRIS, and concern about IRIS should not prompt deferral of ART.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00055120."
https://openalex.org/W2018591615,"Successful cancer therapy requires the elimination or incapacitation of all tumor cells capable of regenerating a tumor. Therapeutic advances therefore necessitate the characterization of the cells that are able to propagate a tumor in vivo. We show an important link between tumor genotype and isolation of tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). Three mouse models of the most common form of human lung cancer each had TPCs with a unique cell-surface phenotype. The cell-surface marker Sca1 did not enrich for TPCs in tumors initiated with oncogenic Kras, and only Sca1-negative cells propagated EGFR mutant tumors. In contrast, Sca1-positive cells were enriched for tumor-propagating activity in Kras tumors with p53 deficiency. Primary tumors that differ in genotype at just one locus can therefore have tumor-propagating cell populations with distinct markers. Our studies show that the genotype of tumor samples must be considered in studies to identify, characterize, and target tumor-propagating cells."

https://openalex.org/W2163881043,"Gephyrin and collybistin are key components of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) clustering. Nonetheless, resolving the molecular interactions between the plethora of GABAAR subunits and these clustering proteins is a significant challenge. We report a direct interaction of GABAAR α2 and α3 subunit intracellular M3–M4 domain (but not α1, α4, α5, α6, β1–3, or γ1–3) with gephyrin. Curiously, GABAAR α2, but not α3, binds to both gephyrin and collybistin using overlapping sites. The reciprocal binding sites on gephyrin for collybistin and GABAAR α2 also overlap at the start of the gephyrin E domain. This suggests that although GABAAR α3 interacts with gephyrin, GABAAR α2, collybistin, and gephyrin form a trimeric complex. In support of this proposal, tri-hybrid interactions between GABAAR α2 and collybistin or GABAAR α2 and gephyrin are strengthened in the presence of gephyrin or collybistin, respectively. Collybistin and gephyrin also compete for binding to GABAAR α2 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-localize in transfected cells in both intracellular and submembrane aggregates. Interestingly, GABAAR α2 is capable of “activating ” collybistin isoforms harboring the regulatory SH3 domain, enabling targeting of gephyrin to the submembrane aggregates. The GABAAR α2-collybistin interaction was disrupted by a pathogenic mutation in the collybistin SH3 domain (p.G55A) that causes X-linked intellectual disability and seizures by disrupting GABAAR and gephyrin clustering. Because immunohistochemistry in retina revealed a preferential co-localization of collybistin with α2 subunit containing GABAARs, but not GlyRs or other GABAAR subtypes, we propose that the collybistin-gephyrin complex has an intimate role in the clustering of GABAARs containing the α2 subunit.

What is certain is that the subcellular localization of gephyrin is dependent on certain GABAAR subtypes. For example, targeted deletion of the GABAAR α1, α3, and γ2 subunit genes results in a loss of synaptic gephyrin and GABAAR clusters (11Schweizer C. Balsiger S. Bluethmann H. Mansuy I.M.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1356-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine interactions of GABAAR α, β, and γ subunits with gephyrin. We also explored the potential role of the RhoGEF collybistin because collybistin knock-out mice show defects in the clustering of selected GABAAR subtypes in the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala, but unexpectedly do not show a comparable loss of synaptic GlyRs (25Papadopoulos T.

Using a range of molecular, cell biology, and immunohistochemical techniques, we show that both GABAAR α2 and α3 subunits interact directly with gephyrin and define the molecular basis for the α2-gephyrin interaction by mapping the reciprocal binding sites. We also demonstrate that GABAAR α2 can “activate ” collybistin-mediated gephyrin clustering in recombinant systems via interactions with a distinct non-PXXP motif in the α2 subunit M3–M4 domain. This interaction is disrupted by a pathogenic mutation in collybistin (p.G55A) linked to X-linked intellectual disability and seizures (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lischer B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We confirm the intimate association of collybistin with the GABAAR α2 subtype in vivo using a novel collybistin antibody. Taken together, these data suggest that GABAAR α2 can trigger the synaptic clustering machinery via dual interactions with collybistin and gephyrin. GABAAR α2 subunit and gephyrin and collybistin cDNAs were amplified from rat spinal cord or human whole brain first-strand cDNA (Clontech) using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and were cloned into the yeast two- or three-hybrid vectors (pYTH15, pYTH16, or pACT2) (ref. 45Fuller K.J. Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or the mammalian expression vectors pRK5myc, pRK5FLAG, pHcRed1-C1, or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Cloning resulted in an in-frame fusion of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (vector pYTH16), GAL4 activation domain (vector pACT2), HcRed, EGFP, myc, or FLAG epitope tags to the N termini of all expressed proteins with the exception of pRK5-GABAAR α2-FLAG, where a C-terminal FLAG tag was engineered. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with pYTH16-GABAAR α, β, and γ or pYTH16-GlyR β subunit intracellular M3–M4 regions or pYTH16-gephyrin bait constructs together with pACT2-collybistin or pACT2-gephyrin prey constructs. pYTH16-GlyR β, pYTH16-gephyrin, pACT2-gephyrin deletions, alanine block mutants, and pACT2-collybistin constructs were described previously (3Harvey K.

Additional pACT2-gephyrin mutants, pYTH16-GABAAR baits, pYTH16-GABAAR α2 deletion mutants, and pYTH16-GABAAR α2/α1 chimeras were generated during this study. Transformations were plated on selective dropout media (either −LWH +30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole or −LW). After incubation at 30 °C for 3–6 days, LacZ reporter gene assays were performed as described (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R.

Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Integrated yeast strains were co-transformed with pYTH16-GABAAR α2, pYTH16-GlyR β, or pYTH16-gephyrin bait constructs with either pACT2-CB3SH3+ or pACT2-gephyrin P1 prey constructs. Transformations were plated on selective dropout media −LWM to induce expression of CB3SH3+ or gephyrin E domain, or supplemented with 2 mm l-methionine to suppress expression of these proteins. Cell pellets were resuspended in Z-buffer containing 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol followed by lysis in 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.1% (v/v) chloroform (46Sancho R.M. Law B.M. Harvey K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 15: 3955-3968Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All protein interactions were assayed in four to six independent experiments in triplicate. After addition of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside the color change was recorded at 540 nm, and readings were adjusted for turbidity of the yeast suspension at 620 nm. The background signal (co-transfected pACT2 negative control) was subtracted from each co-transformation reading. Established yeast two-hybrid interactions (gephyrin-collybistin and gephyrin-gephyrin) were set as 100%. Statistically significant differences in the interaction strength of two proteins in the presence or absence of a third protein were determined using a Student's two-tailed t test. HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were transfected with constructs encoding epitope-tagged gephyrin, collybistin, and GABAAR α subunit constructs using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies recognizing myc (Sigma) and FLAG (Sigma) and secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, or Cy5 fluorochromes (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META. All images were taken with a 63× objective. Fluorescence excited by the 488 nm, 543 nm, and 633 nm laser lines of argon and helium/neon lasers was detected separately using only one laser at the time (multitrack function) and a combination of band pass filters (BP 505–530, BP 560–615), long pass (LP 560) filters, and meta function (649–798) dependent on the combination of fluorochromes. HEK293 cells were transfected as above and harvested 48 h post-transfection, lysed in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.25% (v/v) Nonidet P-40/complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and homogenized using a tissue grinder. Following centrifugation (4 °C, 15 min, 16,000 × g), 1 ml of cell lysate containing ∼700 μg of protein was added to 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a turning disk. The affinity gel was subjected to centrifugation (4 °C, 3 min, 100 × g) followed by two washes in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, two washes in 150 mm NaCl, PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and two washes in PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The FLAG fusion proteins were eluted with 150 ng of 3 × FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Approximately 10 μg of protein was loaded into 4–12% (w/v) BisTris precast gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore) and nonspecific binding blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 or with 20% (v/v) horse serum in PBS. Anti-myc antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution, and anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:3,000 dilution at 4 °C overnight. For detection, a HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:2,000 dilution together with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Polyclonal antisera against collybistin were generated using the peptide sequence CFWQNFSRLTPFKK by Multiple Peptide Systems (NeoMPS, San Diego, CA). This peptide was purified to 97% purity by HPLC, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine and used to immunize three New Zealand White rabbits using standard procedures. This generated two high affinity collybistin antibodies, as assessed by ELISA results against the source peptide (B2652 pre-bleed <50, 3rd bleed 103,400; B2653 pre-bleed <50; 136,200). One of these antibodies (B2653) was affinity-purified (pABCB3; 0.98 mg/ml, titer 123,800). Immunohistochemistry on rat retina was performed using primary antibodies recognizing GABAAR α subunits (a generous gift from Prof. Jean-Marc Fritschy), GlyRs (mAb4a), collybistin, and gephyrin (mAb7a) as previously described (47Sassoè-Pognetto M.

Briefly, adult rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine-xylazine 1:1 (0.1 ml/kg) and decapitated. The posterior eyecups were fixed for 30 min in formaldehyde (4% (w/v) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)). The eyecups were then rinsed in phosphate buffer and cryoprotected in sucrose (10, 20, and 30% (w/v) in phosphate buffer). The retina was dissected and sectioned vertically with a cryostat. Details about the double immunofluorescence procedure are provided in Ref. 49Schneider Gasser E.M. Straub C.J. Panzanelli P. Weinmann O. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Fritschy J.M. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The sections were analyzed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM5 Pascal), using a sequential acquisition system (multitrack mode). For analysis of co-localization, confocal images were segmented manually and processed with the co-localization module of the software Imaris (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Single- and double-labeled clusters were then quantified by a particle detection algorithm using Image J (National Institutes of Health). We utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to test for direct interactions between M3–M4 intracellular loops of the GABAAR α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3 subunits with gephyrin and collybistin. Although all bait proteins were expressed in yeast (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1), only the GABAAR α2 and α3 baits interacted with full-length gephyrin as assessed by LacZ freeze-fracture assays (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). A fragment of gephyrin containing part of the C domain (collybistin binding motif) plus the entire E domain (Geph305–736) was sufficient for the interaction with GABAAR α2 or α3 baits (Fig. 1B). Curiously, the GABAAR α2 bait (but not the α3 bait) also interacted with a collybistin prey (CB3SH3+; Fig. 1B). Using deletion and domain swap mutations (Fig. 2A), we mapped the binding sites for gephyrin and collybistin in the GABAAR α2 M3–M4 loop. Deletion of a 10-amino acid motif in this region (α2SΔ, lacking AYAVAVANYA) abolished the interaction of the GABAAR α2 subunit with both gephyrin and collybistin (Fig. 2, B and C). However, inserting this motif into the GABAAR α1 bait (Sα2 in α1) allowed interaction with collybistin but not gephyrin (Fig. 2). To confer both collybistin and gephyrin binding to the GABAAR α1 bait, insertion of an 18-amino acid motif (Lα2 in α1; GSVMIQNNAYAVAVANYA) was necessary (Fig. 2, B and C). Hence, the binding sites for gephyrin and collybistin on GABAAR α2 are distinct but overlapping. It is also noteworthy that GABAAR α2-gephyrin and α3-gephyrin interactions are substantially weaker in LacZ freeze-fracture assays than the well characterized GlyR β-gephyrin interaction (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Overlapping binding sites for gephyrin and collybistin on GABAAR α2.

This sequence is not sufficient to mediate interactions between the Sα2 in α1 chimera and gephyrin. However, exchange of a longer GABAAR α2 motif (GSVMIQNNAYAVAVANYA) into the GABAAR α1 bait is sufficient to mediate interaction between the Lα2 in α1 chimera and gephyrin. C, GABAAR α2-collybistin interaction abolished by deletion of the AYAVAVANYA motif. This sequence is sufficient to mediate interaction between the Sα2 in α1 chimera and collybistin. The N-terminal collybistin SH3 domain is also necessary and sufficient for the GABAAR α2-collybistin interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, the GABAAR α2 bait did not interact with a prey for an alternatively spliced form of collybistin that lacks the N-terminal SH3 domain (CB3SH3−; Fig. 2C), although this prey did interact with gephyrin. We subsequently verified that a collybistin SH3 domain prey was capable of interacting with GABAAR α2, Sα2 in α1, and Lα2 in α1 baits, but not the α2 construct lacking the collybistin binding motif, α2SΔ (Fig. 3). These interactions were also disrupted by inserting a pathogenic mutation (p.G55A) (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J.

To confirm that this interaction also occurs in mammalian cells, we expressed HcRed1-tagged GABAAR α1 and α2 M3–M4 domain fusion proteins with myc-tagged collybistin isoforms (myc-CB3SH3− and myc-CB3SH3+) in HEK293 cells. As previously observed for GlyR α1 and α3 intracellular loops (28Melzer N. Villmann C. Becker K. Harvey K. Harvey R.J. Vogel N. Kluck C.J. Kneussel M. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3730-3739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) the HcRed-GABAAR α1, α2, and α3 fusion proteins show nuclear localization, due to cryptic nuclear localization sequences in the M3–M4 domain. This localization was supported by PSORTII analysis that predicts that the isolated GABAAR α1–3 M3–M4 domains should localize to the nucleus (calculated probabilities: α1, 74%; α2, 70%; α3, 61%). Despite this unusual subcellular compartmentalization, co-expression leads to redistribution of myc-CB3SH3+ (but not myc-CB3SH3−) to nuclear aggregates of HcRed-GABAAR α2 (Fig. 4, E–L). This effect was not observed for the equivalent HcRed-GABAAR α1 or α3 fusion proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that GABAAR α2 binds to the collybistin SH3 domain via a non-PXXP motif (AYAVAVANYA) and that this interaction is disrupted by a known pathogenic mutation in ARHGEF9.FIGURE 4Collybistin and GABAAR α2 co-localize in transfected cells. Confocal microscopy shows co-expression of myc-tagged collybistin isoforms with and without the N-terminal SH3 domain and HcRed1-tagged GABAAR α1-α3 M3–M4 fusion proteins in transfected HEK293 cells. A–D, M–P, HcRed-GABAAR α1 and α3 fusion proteins are localized in the nucleus, whereas myc-tagged collybistin (myc-CB3SH3+) localizes to the cytoplasm. E–H, co-expression of collybistin isoform lacking the SH3 domain (myc-CB3SH3−) has no apparent effect on HcRed-GABAAR α2 distribution. I–L, co-expression of HcRed-GABAAR α2 with SH3-containing collybistin (myc-CB3SH3+) results in redistribution of collybistin and HcRed-GABAAR α2 to nuclear aggregates. Scale bars: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping the GABAAR α2 binding site on gephyrin revealed that although the GABAAR α2 bait interacted with the Geph305–736 prey, shorter deletion constructs (Geph323–736, Geph336–736, Geph305–643, Geph305–674, and Geph305–704) did not mediate this interaction. Because similar findings were previously reported for collybistin binding to gephyrin (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lischer B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) we used alanine scanning mutagenesis to locate the GABAAR α2 binding site on gephyrin to a 19-amino acid stretch in the N-terminal part of the gephyrin E domain (SMDKAFITVLEMPTVLGTE; Fig. 5). Although 5 alanine block mutants (A5–A8) disrupted GABAAR α2-gephyrin interactions, they did not alter GlyR β-gephyrin interactions (Fig. 5). This newly identified GABAAR α2 binding site overlaps the previously determined collybistin binding site (PFPLTSMDKA) (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lischer B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) by 5 amino acids. To assess the possibility that GABAAR α2, collybistin, and gephyrin form a multimeric complex, we used the yeast tri-hybrid system to measure changes in apparent interaction strength between interacting proteins in the presence of a third polypeptide expressed under the control of an inducible methionine promoter (Fig. 6, A and B). For example, although the GABAAR α2-gephyrin P1 bait-prey interaction is weaker in yeast strain SDY151 in LacZ freeze-fracture assays (Fig. 6C), this interaction is dramatically strengthened by inducing expression of collybistin (CB3SH3+). Quantitative assays demonstrated that this effect was statistically significant and not observed for either GABAAR α3 or GlyR β baits (Fig. 6, C and E). Similarly, induction of the gephyrin fragment Geph305–736 strengthened collybistin-GABAAR α2 but not collybistin-GABAAR α3 interactions (Fig. 6, D and F). Note that the GlyR β-collybistin interaction mediated by induction of Geph305–736 (Fig. 6D) is also a genuine tri-hybrid interaction because these two proteins occupy separate binding sites on gephyrin (3Harvey K. Duguid I.C. Alldred M.J. Beatty S.E. Ward H. Keep N.H. Lingenfelter S.E. Pearce B.R. Lundgren J. Owen M.J. Smart T.G. Lischer B. Rees M.I. Harvey R.J. J.

We also confirmed the interaction of GABAAR α2 with gephyrin P1 and collybistin by co-immunoprecipitation of a full-length FLAG-tagged GABAAR α2 subunit with myc-CB3SH3+ and/or myc-gephyrin from HEK293 cells (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, GABAAR α2 preferentially co-immunoprecipitates myc-CB3SH3+ rather than myc-gephyrin when all three proteins are co-expressed (Fig. 7B), although this effect may reflect the ready availability of cytoplasmic myc-tagged collybistin versus myc-gephyrin, which typically occurs in large cytoplasmic aggregates when expressed in HEK293 cells (2Kins S.

Prevotella bryantii B14 is a rumen bacterium that efficiently degrades soluble xylan. To identify the genes harnessed by this bacterium to degrade xylan, the transcriptomes of P. bryantii cultured on either wheat arabinoxylan or a mixture of its monosaccharide components were compared by DNA microarray and RNA sequencing approaches. The most highly induced genes formed a cluster that contained putative outer membrane proteins analogous to the starch utilization system identified in the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The arrangement of genes in the cluster was highly conserved in other xylanolytic Bacteroidetes, suggesting that the mechanism employed by xylan utilizers in this phylum is conserved. A number of genes encoding proteins with unassigned function were also induced on wheat arabinoxylan. Among these proteins, a hypothetical protein with low similarity to glycoside hydrolases was shown to possess endoxylanase activity and subsequently assigned to glycoside hydrolase family 5.

This study therefore provides insights into capture of energy by xylanolytic Bacteroidetes and the application of their enzymes as a resource in the biofuel industry. The hydrolysis and fermentation of plant cell wall polysaccharides are important metabolic processes that occur within the gut ecosystem of ruminants as well as humans. Xylan is the most abundant plant polysaccharide after cellulose, and microbes within the bovine rumen have evolved to efficiently degrade this hemicellulosic substrate. The depolymerization of xylan requires the coordinated action of a number of enzymes, including endoxylanases, β-xylosidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases, acetylxylan esterases, and ferulic acid esterases (1Dodd D. Cann I.O. GCB Bioenergy. 2009; 1: 2-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prevotella spp. are the most numerically dominant xylanolytic bacteria in the rumen (2Stevenson D.M. Weimer P.J. Appl.

The genome of P. bryantii B14 has recently been partially sequenced (11Morrison M. Daugherty S.C. Nelson W.C. Davidsen T. Nelson K.E. Microb. Ecol. 2010; 59: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and this bacterium harbors at least 109 genes predicted to encode either glycoside hydrolases or carbohydrate esterases. In this study, a transcriptional approach was employed to identify the genes harnessed by P. bryantii B14 to degrade xylan. Because it has been reported that endoxylanase activity of P. bryantii B14 is induced by medium to large sized xylo-oligosaccharides and not by monosaccharides (12Miyazaki K. Hirase T. Kojima Y. Flint H.J. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 4121-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the transcriptional profile of P. bryantii B14 cultured either with soluble wheat arabinoxylan (WAX) or with a mixture of xylose and arabinose (XA) was investigated. The studies allowed us to assemble the enzymes that likely constitute the xylan-degrading machinery of P. bryantii B14. In addition, we have assigned biochemical function to two hypothetical proteins that were up-regulated in cells metabolizing wheat arabinoxylan compared with a mixture of its monosaccharide components. Genes encoding similar polypeptides, which invariably exhibited endoxylanase activity, were identified in several members of the Bacteroidetes, suggesting that this group of enzymes is critical to the capture of energy from xylan in this phylum. More importantly, our analyses have led to the discovery of a gene cluster, composed of an invariant core of six genes flanked by either biochemically characterized or putative glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases in P. bryantii B14. The genes within the cluster and their collective response during wheat arabinoxylan utilization suggest that the cluster is critical to xylan utilization in this bacterium. Furthermore, the conservation of the gene cluster in other xylanolytic Prevotella and Bacteroides spp. derived from the bovine rumen and the human colonic microbiomes suggests a conserved mechanism for xylan utilization by xylanolytic Bacteroidetes. P. bryantii B14 (DSM 11371) was initially isolated by Bryant et al. (13Bryant M.P. Small N. Bouma C. Chu H. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 76: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained from our culture collection in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Bacteroides intestinalis 341 (DSM 17393) was a kind gift from Jeffrey I. Gordon (Washington University, St. Louis) and was originally obtained from the DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany). Escherichia coli JM109 and E. coli BL21-CodonPlusTM (DE3) RIL competent cells and the PicoMaxx high fidelity DNA polymerase were acquired from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pET-46 Ek/LIC vector kit was obtained from Novagen (San Diego). The RNAprotect bacteria reagent, RNeasy mini kit, RNase-free DNase set, DNeasy blood and tissue DNA purification kit, and QIAprep spin miniprep kit were all obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Xylo-oligosaccharides and wheat arabinoxylan (medium viscosity, 20 centistokes) were obtained from Megazyme (Bray, Ireland). The Superscript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit and the RiboMinus transcriptome isolation kit were obtained from Invitrogen. The One-Color DNA labeling kit, hybridization kit, Sample Tracking control kit, and Wash Buffer kit were all obtained from Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI). All other reagents were of the highest possible purity and were purchased from Sigma. P. bryantii B14 was grown anaerobically in a modified chemically defined medium (4Dodd D. Kiyonari S. Mackie R.I. Cann I.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with either wheat arabinoxylan (0.15% w/v) or a mixture containing both xylose (0.0885% w/v) and arabinose (0.0615% w/v) as the sole carbohydrate sources. The concentrations of XA in the mixture were equivalent to that in the WAX polysaccharide (59:41, xylose/arabinose). Cells were subcultured two times consecutively in triplicate with the respective growth media to ensure complete adaptation to the carbohydrate growth source. At mid-log phase of growth (A600 nm = 0.2), 30 ml of each culture was removed and immediately combined with 60 ml of RNAprotect bacteria reagent, and RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit with the optional on-column DNase treatment step. The quality of the RNA was assessed by using a Bioanalyzer 2100 with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay reagent kit from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). DNA microarray slides were fabricated by Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI) using the partial genome sequence of P. bryantii B14. Four arrays were printed on each slide, with each array containing 68,877 total probes. For each array, a total of 2551 open reading frames (ORFs) were analyzed each with nine individual probes and with three replicates per probe. The estimated genome size for P. bryantii B14 is 3.6 megabases, and the total number of identified features (RNAs and ORFs) is 2710. Thus, the microarrays covered ∼94% of the genome features for P. bryantii B14. The purified RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA by using the Superscript cDNA synthesis kit. The cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 by using the One-Color DNA labeling kit, which employs Cy3-labeled random nonamer primers. Sample tracking controls were added to each of the labeled cDNA samples, and hybridization was performed at 42 °C using the hybridization kit and a MAUI® 4-bay hybridization system from BioMicro Systems (Salt Lake City, UT). After 18 h, the slides were removed, washed using the Wash Buffer kit, and scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner with the laser tuned to a wavelength of 532 nm and a photomultiplier tube gain of 680. The files were then analyzed using the NimbleScan version 2.5 software. The gene expression values were determined using ArrayStar version 3.0 from DNASTAR, Inc. (Madison, WI). For RNA-Seq analyses, the RNAs isolated from two individual experiments were used for each growth condition. Bacterial 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs were subtracted from ∼10 μg of total RNA with the RiboMinusTM bacteria transcriptome isolation kit. The enriched mRNA fraction was converted to an RNA-Seq library using the mRNA-Seq kit from Illumina Inc. (San Diego) with multiplexing adaptors that tag each library with a unique identifier. Fragments 200–400 bp long were size-selected for the final library. Each library was hybridized onto a single lane of an eight-lane flow cell and sequenced with a Genome Analyzer IIx according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, Inc.). The sequences derived from each library were 73 bp long, and the overall error rate of the control lane was 0.83%. Each library yielded the following number of reads: WAX1, 11.2 million reads; WAX2, 7.1 million reads; XA1, 8.8 million reads; and XA2, 6.8 million reads. The RNA-Seq data were analyzed using CLC genomics workbench version 3.7 from CLC Bio (Cambridge, MA). The partial genome sequence for P. bryantii B14 was uploaded onto the Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) server (14Aziz R.K. Bartels D. Best A.A. DeJongh M. Disz T. Edwards R.A. Formsma K. Gerdes S. Glass E.M. Kubal M. Meyer F. Olsen G.J. Olson R. Osterman A.L. Overbeek R.A. McNeil L.K. Paarmann D. Paczian T. Parrello B. Pusch G.D. Reich C. Stevens R. Vassieva O. Vonstein V. Wilke A. Zagnitko O. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (7820) Google Scholar), and the annotated genome was exported as a GenBank file (.gbk). The P. bryantii B14 GenBank file was then uploaded onto the CLC software and used as a reference genome for RNA-Seq analyses for each of the four samples. Reads were only assembled if the fraction of the read that aligned with the reference genome was greater than 0.9 and if the read matched other regions of the reference genome at less than 10 nucleotide positions. The RNA-Seq output files were then analyzed for statistical significance by using the proportion-based test of Baggerly et al. (15Baggerly K.A. Deng L. Morris J.S. Aldaz C.M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To analyze the entire transcriptome of P. bryantii B14, a de novo assembly of the RNA-Seq data was performed with 82 million 60-bp single end, nucleotide reads from a total of seven illumina lanes. These data included the four illumina libraries previously mentioned and included three additional illumina libraries. These three additional libraries were constructed with a mixture of RNA from WAX- and XA-grown cultures, in which the multiplexing adaptor reaction had failed, and the individual RNA populations could not be separated based upon the cognate growth substrate. Thus, these libraries were not useful for analyzing differential gene expression, but they did contain information on transcript coverage and were included in the transcriptome assembly. The reads were filtered for adaptor sequences and assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs) using ABySS version 1.0.12 with k-mer lengths of 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50. Twenty five 2.83-GHz cores, on a cluster with 200 processors with 16 gigabytes per 8 cores, were used for each k-mer assembly. The six different k-mer assemblies were merged, and any contig that shared 100% identity to a larger contig and was completely contained within the larger contig was filtered out. The merged Abyss assembly was reassembled using the 64-bit phrap version 1.080721 with the revise greedy option on a 16-core Intel Xeon 2.93 GHz server with 128 gigabytes DDR2 RAM. The phrap assembly resulted in a total of 1927 contigs with a median length of 2340 bp, and maximum and minimum lengths of 47,199 and 100 bp, respectively. The N50 contig length was 6593 bp, and 292 contigs were larger than this size. The contigs were matched to the reference P. bryantii genomic sequence using BLAT (16Kent W.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar) at 99% identity. Transcriptome contigs, which matched more than one contig from the reference genome, were considered as potentially closing gaps in the partial genome sequence and were confirmed by PCR. Genomic DNA was isolated from P. bryantii B14 (13Bryant M.P. Small N. Bouma C. Chu H. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 76: 15-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and B. intestinalis DSM 17393 (17Bakir M.A. Kitahara M. Sakamoto M. Matsumoto M. Benno Y. Int. J. Syst. Evol.

Salyers (Department of Microbiology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign). The DNA sequences for the five genes were amplified from genomic DNA using the PicoMaxx high fidelity PCR system with the oligonucleotide primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Putative signal sequences with corresponding cleavage sites were predicted for each of the five genes (PbORF0150, MNKKIIIVCLACAISLSSMA; PbORF0336, MKKILAFIGSLLLLPMAALA; BeORF1299, MKNMKNTVSILLFLFVFLSACS; BiORF4213, MKNNMRKIIYLLTLLLGVSLAACS; and BiORF1125, MKNITNVFYEFLIALCCLMSSSTLWA) with the SignalP version 3.0 on-line server (18Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). To ensure that proteins accumulated within the cytoplasm of E. coli cells, the primers were engineered to clone the respective gene beginning with the amino acid just downstream of the predicted cleavage site. The five genes were cloned into pET-46b by ligation-independent cloning as described previously (4Dodd D. Kiyonari S. Mackie R.I. Cann I.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The recombinant hexahistidine proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) RIL cells, and different purification schemes were used for each protein. For PbORF0150, the recombinant protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography using an ÄKTAxpress instrument equipped with a HisTrap FF nickel column and a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column as described previously (4Dodd D.

For BeORF1299 and BiORF4213, the proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography (HisTrap FF) followed by size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column) with protein storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) as the mobile phase. For PbORF0336 and BiORF1125, the proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography using Talon resin from Clontech as described by the manufacturer followed by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q XL) using the following binding and elution buffer pairs: PbORF0336, binding buffer, 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), and elution buffer, 50 mm, Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, (pH 8.0); BiORF1125, binding buffer, 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) and elution buffer, 50 mm, Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.0). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue G-250. The purified protein concentrations were calculated using the method of Gill and von Hippel (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) with the following extinction coefficients: PbORF0150, 152.53 cm−1 mm−1; PbORF0336, 192.52 cm−1 mm−1; BeORF1299, 137.17 cm−1 mm−1; BiORF4213, 137.17 cm−1 mm−1; and BiORF1125, 294.17 cm−1 mm−1. The hydrolytic activity of PbXyn5A with plant polysaccharides as substrate was assessed by using a Congo red-based assay adapted from Teather and Wood (20Teather R.M. Wood P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 43: 777-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates were WAX, carboxymethyl cellulose, locust bean gum, or lichenan, each at 1% w/v. PbXyn5A (2 μm, final concentration) was incubated with xylohexaose (1% w/v, final concentration) in citrate buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl (pH 5.5)) at 37 °C. At regular time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min). 1-μl aliquots were removed, and the products of hydrolysis were analyzed by TLC as described below. To evaluate the capacity of PbXyn5A, BeXyn5A, and BiXyn5A to hydrolyze a longer polysaccharide chain such as xylan, each enzyme (0.5 μm, final concentration) was incubated with soluble wheat arabinoxylan (1% w/v) in citrate buffer (500 μl, final volume) at 37 °C. After 15 h, the concentration of reducing ends was estimated using the para-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide assay with glucose as the standard (21Lever M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). For qualitative identification of the hydrolysis products, the reactions were resolved by TLC as described previously (9Dodd D.

For more quantitative analysis of the products of hydrolysis, the wheat arabinoxylan hydrolysates were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as described earlier (4Dodd D. Kiyonari S. Mackie R.I. Cann I.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed by use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All the methods were as described in our earlier report (4Dodd D. Kiyonari S. Mackie R.I. Cann I.K. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Correspondingly, two amino acid identity values are provided that correspond to alignment with P. bryantii ORF0150 at the N and C termini, respectively. To assess the reproducibility of the microarray and RNA-Seq analyses, the expression levels for all annotated genes in the partial genome sequence of P. bryantii B14 were compared for the two biological replicates using both technologies. These analyses revealed a high correlation in the expression level for each gene in the two biological replicates derived from either DNA microarray or RNA-Seq technologies (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that the biological reproducibility in the gene expression levels was very high for both the microarray (WAX, R2 = 0.969; XA, R2 = 0.977) and RNA-Seq (WAX, R2 = 0.972; XA, R2 = 0.932) analyses. To evaluate how well data derived from DNA microarrays and RNA-Seq analyses agree, the expression level for each gene was compared for each sample using both technologies. These results revealed that there was a positive correlation in the expression of genes identified using the two different techniques (supplemental Fig. S2); however, this correlation was moderate (WAX1, R2 = 0.649; WAX2, R2 = 0.662; XA1, R2 = 0.663; and XA2, R2 = 0.568). The moderate correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq analyses has been reported before, and it is predicted that this may arise due to the fact that microarrays lack sensitivity for genes expressed at low and high levels (22Wang Z. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8345) Google Scholar). Because of the reported higher dynamic range for gene expression using RNA-Seq, the subsequent analyses of transcriptional regulation focused on the results from the RNA-Seq experiments rather than the DNA microarray data. The Illumina reads were assembled onto the reference genome for P. bryantii B14, and a transcriptome map was generated for the bacterium during growth with each carbohydrate source. A representative transcriptome map is shown in supplemental Fig. S3 where the number of assembled reads for each nucleotide position within the genome is plotted on the inner circle. The most abundant reads mapped onto ribosomal RNA genes (16S and 23S), indicated by the most prominent peak on the transcriptome map and five of the smaller peaks. The high abundance of reads aligning to rRNA genes demonstrates that the removal of ribosomal RNA from the sample using the RiboMinusTM kit was incomplete. In addition to the ribosomal RNA genes, the other most highly expressed genes included genes important for housekeeping functions in the cell such as fatty acid biosynthesis (acyl carrier protein, ORF0076; FabF, ORF0077), ribosome biogenesis (small and large subunit ribosomal proteins as follows: ORF2542, ORF2216, ORF1370, ORF1137, ORF1214, ORF1368, ORF0740, ORF2553, ORF0177, ORF1421, and ORF1369), and glycolysis (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, ORF2552; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ORF2095) (supplemental Table S2). During growth with WAX relative to XA, ∼57 genes were induced greater than 4-fold, and 32 genes were repressed greater than 4-fold (Baggerly's test (15Baggerly K.A. Deng L. Morris J.S. Aldaz C.M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), p < 0.05) using RNA-Seq analysis (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Annotation, based on predicted function, of the induced genes revealed that the majority code for hypothetical proteins, although GHs and membrane transporters, including starch utilization system (Sus) homologues, were also highly enriched. Additionally, a few genes with predicted functions in conjugative transposition, protein degradation, and carbohydrate ester hydrolysis were also identified (Table 1). The GH genes that were highly induced had predicted functions associated with the hydrolysis of xylan, including endoxylanases (five genes), β-xylosidases (four genes), and arabinofuranosidases (two genes). These results suggest that P. bryantii B14 elaborates a specific transcriptional response in the presence of xylan leading to induced expression of a subset of genes related to xylan degradation and utilization. Of the 57 induced genes, 77% code for proteins with putative signal sequences as predicted by using the SignalP server (Table 1) (18Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2096167103,"Ca2+-activated BK channels modulate neuronal activities, including spike frequency adaptation and synaptic transmission. Previous studies found that Ca2+-binding sites and the activation gate are spatially separated in the channel protein, but the mechanism by which Ca2+ binding opens the gate over this distance remains unknown. By studying an Asp-to-Gly mutation (D434G) associated with human syndrome of generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia (GEPD), we show that a cytosolic motif immediately following the activation gate S6 helix, known as the AC region, mediates the allosteric coupling between Ca2+ binding and channel opening. The GEPD mutation inside the AC region increases BK channel activity by enhancing this allosteric coupling. We found that Ca2+ sensitivity is enhanced by increases in solution viscosity that reduce protein dynamics. The GEPD mutation alters such a response, suggesting that a less flexible AC region may be more effective in coupling Ca2+ binding to channel opening."

Despite their critical role in nervous system health, the function of SV2 proteins is far from clear. While some researchers have suggested that SV2 proteins govern synaptic plasticity by regulating residual calcium (Chang and Südhof, 2009Chang W.P. Südhof T.C. SV2 renders primed synaptic vesicles competent for Ca2+ -induced exocytosis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Janz et al., 1999Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M.

Austin N.S. Sullivan J.M. Bajjalieh S.M. Synaptic vesicle protein 2 enhances release probability at quiescent synapses.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Xu and Bajjalieh, 2001Xu T. Bajjalieh S.M. SV2 modulates the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); evidence for both viewpoints is largely indirect. In addition, SV2 proteins have been suggested to act either before or after a priming step in the secretory pathway (Chang and Südhof, 2009Chang W.P. Südhof T.C. SV2 renders primed synaptic vesicles competent for Ca2+ -induced exocytosis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Xu and Bajjalieh, 2001Xu T. Bajjalieh S.M. SV2 modulates the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, precise elucidation of the function of SV2 proteins has been hindered by several factors, including the severe seizures and early lethality associated with the absence of the major brain isoform of SV2, SV2A. In addition, biochemical approaches have been hampered by the fact that SV2 proteins are heavily glycosylated, polytopic membrane proteins that are difficult to express functionally in recombinant systems. Physiological approaches have been hampered by the lack of a neuronal preparation that permits quantitative and simultaneous measurement of presynaptic calcium and synaptic vesicle dynamics in neurons with SV2 deficiency. In this study, we took advantage of a neuronal preparation recently developed for the direct, biophysical study of exocytosis and presynaptic calcium in the mammalian central nervous system: the mouse rod bipolar cell (Wan et al., 2008Wan Q.F. Vila A. Zhou Z.Y. Heidelberger R. Synaptic vesicle dynamics in mouse rod bipolar cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2008; 25: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou Z.Y. Wan Q.F. Thakur P. Heidelberger R. Capacitance measurements in the mouse rod bipolar cell identify a pool of releasable synaptic vesicles.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2539-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we took advantage of the fact that SV2B is the major SV2 isoform expressed in these neurons (Wang et al., 2003Wang M.M. Janz R. Belizaire R. Frishman L.J. Sherry D.M. Differential distribution and developmental expression of synaptic vesicle protein 2 isoforms in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 460: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that SV2B knockout mice are viable and do not suffer from seizures (Janz et al., 1999Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C. SV2A and SV2B function as redundant Ca2+ regulators in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 1999; 24: 1003-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This allowed us to investigate SV2 function in neurons isolated from mature, healthy animals. The only known deficit in SV2B knockout animals resides in the retina, consistent with a major role for SV2B in ribbon synapses of the rod visual pathway (Lazzell et al., 2004Lazzell D.R. Belizaire R. Thakur P. Sherry D.M. Janz R. SV2B regulates synaptotagmin 1 by direct interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52124-52131Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Morgans et al., 2009Morgans C.W. Kensel-Hammes P. Hurley J.B. Burton K. Idzerda R. McKnight G.S. Bajjalieh S.M. Loss of the Synaptic Vesicle Protein SV2B results in reduced neurotransmission and altered synaptic vesicle protein expression in the retina.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We compared the presynaptic Ca2+ and secretory responses of rod bipolar cells acutely isolated from the retinae of adult SV2B−/− and wild-type mice using quantitative fluorescence measurements of presynaptic Ca2+ in combination with time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements (Wan et al., 2008Wan Q.F. Vila A. Zhou Z.Y. Heidelberger R. Synaptic vesicle dynamics in mouse rod bipolar cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2008; 25: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou Z.Y. Wan Q.F. Thakur P. Heidelberger R. Capacitance measurements in the mouse rod bipolar cell identify a pool of releasable synaptic vesicles.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2539-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data provide direct evidence that SV2B is important for the regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ levels and, consequently, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle dynamics. In addition, we identified a role for SV2B that is independent of short-term changes in presynaptic Ca2+ and is reminiscent of the previously described peri-priming defect (Chang and Südhof, 2009Chang W.P. Südhof T.C. SV2 renders primed synaptic vesicles competent for Ca2+ -induced exocytosis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Custer et al., 2006Custer K.L.

Strikingly, every aspect of the SV2B knockout secretory phenotype, including the functional reduction in the rapidly releasing pool, was relieved by the restoration of presynaptic Ca2+ signaling to wild-type levels. Thus, not only does this SV2 protein play a key role in regulating presynaptic Ca2+, but presynaptic Ca2+ signaling plays a key role in the expression of the SV2-deficiency phenotype. Previous ultrastructural analysis of conventional synapses from SV2A/B double-knockout mice has shown that the lack of SV2 proteins does not affect the formation of morphologically normal synapses or synaptic vesicles (Crowder et al., 1999Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M. Abnormal neurotransmission in mice lacking synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Janz and Südhof, 1999Janz R. Südhof T.C. SV2C is a synaptic vesicle protein with an unusually restricted localization: anatomy of a synaptic vesicle protein family.Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the absence of SV2B did not alter the structure and size of synaptic vesicles or the number or length of synaptic ribbons at the ribbon-style synapses of the mouse rod bipolar cell (Figure 1 and Table S1). Neither did the absence of SV2B disrupt formation of normal synaptic connections by bipolar cells (Figure 1). To ascertain whether SV2 proteins regulate the resting presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, we performed quantitative measurements of spatially averaged presynaptic Ca2+ in bis-fura-2-loaded terminal boutons of isolated, mature rod bipolar neurons from SV2B knockout mice (SV2B−/−) and wild-type littermates (Figure 2). To control for changes in membrane potential that could alter calcium signaling, neurons were held under voltage-clamp control at −70 mV. Under these conditions, the mean spatially averaged intraterminal Ca2+ concentration of neurons obtained from SV2B−/− mice was 88 ± 14 nM (n = 27), compared with 35 ± 5 nM (n = 34) in wild-type (WT) littermates (p = 0.00028) (Figure 2B). To establish whether or not SV2 proteins influence evoked Ca2+ signals, we applied a brief 4 Hz stimulus train to bipolar neurons from SV2B−/− and WT mice. Each pulse in the train was of a magnitude and duration sufficient to deplete the rapidly releasing pool of vesicles (Wan et al., 2008Wan Q.F. Vila A. Zhou Z.Y. Heidelberger R. Synaptic vesicle dynamics in mouse rod bipolar cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2008; 25: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We simultaneously monitored the spatially averaged presynaptic Ca2+ concentration and changes in membrane capacitance as an index of synaptic vesicle fusion (Figure 3; see also Figure S1). The average cumulative increase in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration was greater in SV2B−/− terminals than in WT terminals for each pulse in the train (Figure 3A). In general, the rise in presynaptic free Ca2+ evoked by each pulse was approximately double in SV2B−/− terminals relative to WT (Pulse 1: WT: 58 ± 16 nM, n = 13; SV2B−/−: 124 ± 21 nM, n = 14; p = 0.018; Pulse 10: WT: 219 ± 50; SV2B−/−: 555 ± 94 nM, p = 0.0046; Figure 3A). Taken with results from the previous section, our results provide strong evidence for a role for SV2 proteins in the regulation of both resting and evoked Ca2+ signaling in nerve terminals. We next examined the extent of exocytosis evoked by the stimulus train in neurons with and without SV2B. Figure 3B presents our analysis of the cumulative capacitance change as a function of pulse number (see also Figure S1). In SV2B−/− neurons, there was a dramatic decrease in the magnitude of the first exocytotic response relative to WT neurons (SV2B−/−: 2.8 ± 0.8 fF, n = 12; WT: 9.2 ± 1.5 fF, n = 13; p = 0.0015), suggesting that there is a decrease in the fusion of rapidly releasing vesicles in the absence of SV2B. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in the slope of the cumulative capacitance increase early in the pulse train (Slopepulses1-3 SV2B−/−: 3.1 ± 0.4; Slopepulses1-3 WT: 1.2 ± 0.2; PROC Mixed analysis, p = 0.0393). This enhancement briefly converts depression in the WT to facilitation in the SV2B−/− neurons (Figures 3B and 3C). However, the maximum cumulative release was essentially identical (SV2B−/−: 20.5 ± 3.8 fF, n = 12; WT: 19.9 ± 1.9 fF, n = 13; p = 0.9), indicating that the total number of vesicles released by the whole train was similar between SV2B−/− and WT neurons. Comparison of Figures 3A and 3B raised the possibility that the extent of exocytosis in SV2B−/− neurons began to approximate that of WT neurons as the relative change in cumulative Ca2+ concentration exceeded that of WT neurons. To evaluate this possibility, for each pulse in the train, we graphed the cumulative change in membrane capacitance as a function of the cumulative increase in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration. Figure 3D demonstrates that relative to WT neurons, the curve for SV2B−/− neurons was shifted to the right by ∼7 fF (PROC Mixed analysis, p < 0.0001, estimated shift 7 fF). This finding could indicate that the absence of SV2B is associated with a decrease in the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of release, assuming that the spatially averaged presynaptic Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+ concentration at the release site are correlated (Naraghi and Neher, 1997Naraghi M. Neher E. Linearized buffered Ca2+ diffusion in microdomains and its implications for calculation of [Ca2+] at the mouth of a calcium channel.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course for the restoration of membrane capacitance following a stimulus train also differed between SV2B−/− and WT neurons (Figure 4). SV2B−/− terminals displayed a slower average time constant for membrane recovery than WT terminals (SV2B−/−: 9.5 ± 0.8 s, n = 8; WT: 4.5 ± 0.9 s, n = 12; p = 0.0015). This may reflect either a decrease in the rate of endocytosis, an increase in asynchronous release, or a combination of both. By contrast, Ca2+ concentration recovered to the prestimulus baseline with a time constant of a few seconds in both neurons (Figure 4: SV2B−/−: 1.9 ± 0.1 s, n = 17; WT: 2.0 ± 0.2 s; n = 16; p = 0.59), indicating that other presynaptic Ca2+ handling mechanisms remained intact (Zenisek and Matthews, 2000Zenisek D. Matthews G. The role of mitochondria in presynaptic calcium handling at a ribbon synapse.Neuron. 2000; 25: 229-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data demonstrate that SV2 deficiency gives rise to both a Ca2+ phenotype and a secretory phenotype. The former is characterized by elevated spatially averaged resting Ca2+ concentration and an enhanced evoked Ca2+ response in nerve terminals. The latter is characterized by a decrease in the number of rapidly releasing vesicles, a decrease in the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis, an early enhancement of the secretory response evoked by a stimulus train, and a prolongation of membrane recovery. Several aspects of secretory vesicle dynamics are regulated by intraterminal Ca2+ (Heidelberger, 2001Heidelberger R. Electrophysiological approaches to the study of neuronal exocytosis and synaptic vesicle dynamics.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 143: 1-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether we could rescue the SV2B−/− secretory phenotype by restoring resting intraterminal Ca2+ levels to near WT values. To this end, we clamped the resting intraterminal Ca2+ concentration in SV2B−/− and WT terminals via the use of a Ca2+-buffered internal recording solution (solution B; Table 1). Following 2 min of dialysis with solution B, the mean intraterminal free-Ca2+ concentration in SV2B−/− terminals held at −70 mV was 52 ± 4 nM (n = 16), representing an ≈40% decrease from what was measured for SV2B−/− terminals using our standard recording solution (solution A; Figure 5A ; 112 ± 27 nM, n = 14; p = 0.037). The mean intraterminal free-Ca2+ concentration in SV2B−/− neurons dialyzed with solution B was indistinguishable from that of WT terminals dialyzed with solution B (Figure 5A; WTsolutionB: 57 ± 6 nM, n = 17). With solution B, the rise in cumulative intraterminal Ca2+ concentration in SV2B−/− neurons evoked by the pulse train was essentially identical to that of WT neurons (Figure 6A ), and the total cumulative Ca2+ concentration rise was reduced to 312 ± 70 nM (n = 16), representing an ≈40% decrease from what was measured using our standard solution (solution A; Figure 3A). The time constant of Ca2+ recovery was similar between SV2B−/− and WT terminals (data not shown), as expected from our earlier findings (i.e., Figure 4D).Table 1Table of Intracellular SolutionsSolution (mM)ABCDCaCl200.050.30.15EGTA0.50.550.50.2Calculated free EGTA0.50.480.250.1Calculated free Ca2+ (nM)014173163Measured free Ca2+ (nM)012241225 Open table in a new tab Figure 6Restoration of Presynaptic Ca2+ Concentration to WT Levels Rescues the Secretory Phenotype of SV2B−/− NeuronsShow full caption(A) Restoration of presynaptic Ca2+ concentration to WT levels for ≈2 min in SV2B−/− neurons with solution B [KO(B), open triangles] was sufficient to rescue the cumulative Ca2+ concentration response evoked by the pulse train.(B) When resting Ca2+ concentration was lowered in SV2B−/− neurons with solution B [KO(B), open triangles], the magnitude of the first Cm response became identical to that of WT littermates [WT(B), filled circles; one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparisons Test; ∗∗p < 0.01].(C) Upon restoration of presynaptic Ca2+ concentration in SV2B−/− neurons to WT levels [KO(B), open triangles], the mean cumulative ΔCa2+ concentration as a function of the mean cumulative ΔCm became superimposable onto that of WT neurons.Error bars represent SEM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Restoration of presynaptic Ca2+ concentration to WT levels for ≈2 min in SV2B−/− neurons with solution B [KO(B), open triangles] was sufficient to rescue the cumulative Ca2+ concentration response evoked by the pulse train.

Error bars represent SEM. What happens to exocytosis in SV2B−/− terminals with a WT Ca2+ phenotype? We addressed this question in SV2B−/− and WT neurons dialyzed with the Ca2+-defined internal recording solution described above (solution B). In contrast to what was observed previously in response to the pulse train, the average magnitude of the first capacitance jump in SV2B−/− neurons dialyzed with solution B was no longer suppressed (Figure 6B). Rather, it was indistinguishable from that of WT terminals (Figure 6B; SV2B−/−solutionB: 11.7 ± 1.8 fF, n = 16; WTsolutionB: 12.1 ± 1.8 fF, n = 17) and significantly different from SV2B−/− neurons dialyzed with solution A. In addition, there was no longer a difference in the slope of the cumulative capacitance increase as a function of pulse number for the first three points in the train (Figure 6B; Slope SV2B−/−solutionB: 3.2 ± 1.4; Slope WTsolutionB: 1.8 ± 1.0, PROC Mixed analysis, p = 0.1574), indicating that the early enhancement seen in Figure 3B may represent a Ca2+-dependent process. Furthermore, with solution B, the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of release for SV2B−/− neurons was no longer shifted to the right, but rather was superimposable upon that of WT neurons (Figure 6C, PROC Mixed analysis, WTsolutionB versus KOsolutionB, p = 0.4). Thus, restoration of presynaptic Ca2+ signaling to wild-type patterns relieves the SV2B−/− secretory phenotype. If the loss of SV2 proteins indirectly alters the time course of membrane recovery following exocytosis via an increase in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, then mimicking the WT Ca2+ phenotype in an SV2B−/− neuron should restore the time constant of membrane recovery of SV2B−/− terminals to control values. This is precisely what we observed (Figure 5B). For example, following the pulse train, the average time constant of membrane recovery for SV2B−/− neurons was 5.4 ± 1.0 s (solution B; n = 9) compared with 5.3 ± 0.9 s for WT neurons (solution B; n = 10). Given previous results indicating that larger rises in spatially averaged Ca2+ concentration are associated with longer time constants of membrane recovery in bipolar neurons (von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994von Gersdorff H. Matthews G. Inhibition of endocytosis by elevated internal calcium in a synaptic terminal.Nature. 1994; 370: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Wan et al., 2008Wan Q.F. Vila A. Zhou Z.Y. Heidelberger R. Synaptic vesicle dynamics in mouse rod bipolar cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2008; 25: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the prolonged time course of membrane recovery in SV2B−/− neurons dialyzed with our standard recording solution (solution A) may be directly attributed to the SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype. If the secretory phenotype of SV2B−/− neurons is a direct consequence of the SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype, then WT neurons with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype should display the SV2B−/− secretory phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the Ca2+ profile in WT and SV2B−/− neurons by internal dialysis with either high Ca2+ solution C or D; these solutions differ in the amount of free EGTA (Table 1). With either solution, ∼2 min after achieving the whole-cell recording configuration, the resting Ca2+ in WT terminals was increased to a level similar to SV2B−/− terminals (Figure 5C; SV2B−/− solutionA: 112 ± 27 nM, n = 14; WTsolutionC: 117 ± 16 nM, n = 20; WTsolution D: 113 ± 16 nM, n = 5) and significantly higher than WT control (32 ± 6 nM, n = 12, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett Multiple Comparisons Test, p = 0.011). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 7A , dialysis with solution D fully mimicked the elevated train-evoked Ca2+ response of SV2B−/− neurons, while dialysis with solution C, which had a higher concentration of free EGTA (Table 1), had a Ca2+ profile that was intermediary between the WT and SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype. What happens to exocytosis in WT terminals with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype? Figure 7B demonstrates that there was no difference in the amplitude of the first capacitance jump between WT neurons with a SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype (WTsolutionC: 9.3 ± 1.3fF, n = 21; WTsolutionD: 9.4 ± 0.5 fF, n = 5) and our standard solution A (WTsolutionA: 9.2 ± 1.5 fF, n = 13). All three differed from the amplitude of the first Cm jump in SV2B−/− neurons dialyzed with standard solution A (Figure 7B; 2.8 ± 0.8 fF, n = 12; one way ANOVA with Dunnett Multiple Comparisons Test, p = 0.0035). In addition, WT neurons with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype did not exhibit an apparent decrease in the calcium sensitivity of release (Figure 7C, PROC Mixed analysis, WTsolutionC-WTsolutionA: p = 0.21; WTsolutionD-WTsolutionA: p = 0.34; WTsolutionC-KOsolutionA: p < 0.0001; WTsolutionD-KOsolutionA: p < 0.0001). Thus, while elevated resting and evoked presynaptic Ca2+ reveals both the early secretory defect and the decrease in the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of release, short-term elevation of presynaptic Ca2+ of the type tested here is insufficient to trigger these changes. Two aspects of the SV2B−/− secretory phenotype, however, were reproduced in WT neurons with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype. First, similar to what was observed in SV2B−/− neurons (Figure 7B), WT neurons with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype showed a significant early enhancement in the cumulative capacitance response that was reminiscent of SV2B−/− neurons (Slope WTsolutionD: 4.3 ± 0.02) and different from control WT neurons (Figure 3B; PROC Mixed analysis, slope WTsolutionA versus slope WTsolutionD, p = 0.05). Second, following the stimulus train, the time constants of membrane recovery in WT neurons with an SV2B−/− Ca2+ phenotype were prolonged relative to WT controls (Figure 5D; WTsolutionA 4.5 ± 0.9 s, n = 12; WTsolutionC: 9.1 ± 1.6 s, n = 11; WTsolutionD: 7.6 ± 2.1 s, n = 5), and approached values observed in SV2B−/− neurons (SV2B−/−solutionA: 9.5 ± 0.8 s, n = 8).

https://openalex.org/W2087566580,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in the production of lipids and secretory proteins. Because the ER cannot be generated de novo, it must be faithfully transmitted or divided at each cell division. Little is known of how cells monitor the functionality of the ER during the cell cycle or how this regulates inheritance. We report here that ER stress in S. cerevisiae activates the MAP kinase Slt2 in a new ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway, independent of the unfolded protein response. Upon ER stress, ERSU alters the septin complex to delay ER inheritance and cytokinesis. In the absence of Slt2 kinase, the stressed ER is transmitted to the daughter cell, causing the death of both mother and daughter cells. Furthermore, Slt2 is activated via the cell surface receptor Wsc1 by a previously undescribed mechanism. We conclude that the ERSU pathway ensures inheritance of a functional ER."
https://openalex.org/W1964964279,"Previous work has shown that several nucleoporins, including Nup62 are degraded in cells infected with human rhinovirus (HRV) and poliovirus (PV) and that this contributes to the disruption of certain nuclear transport pathways. In this study, the mechanisms underlying proteolysis of Nup62 have been investigated. Analysis of Nup62 in lysates from HRV-infected cells revealed that Nup62 was cleaved at multiple sites during viral infection. The addition of purified HRV2 2A protease (2A(pro)) to uninfected HeLa whole cell lysates resulted in the cleavage of Nup62, suggesting that 2A(pro) is a major contributor to Nup62 processing. The ability of purified 2A(pro) to cleave bacterially expressed and purified Nup62 demonstrated that 2A(pro) directly cleaves Nup62 in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative cleavage sites in Nup62 identified six different positions that are cleaved by 2A(pro) in vitro. This analysis revealed that 2A(pro) cleavage sites were located between amino acids 103 and 298 in Nup62 and suggested that the N-terminal FG-rich region of Nup62 was released from the nuclear pore complex in infected cells. Analysis of HRV- and PV-infected cells using domain-specific antibodies confirmed that this was indeed the case. These results are consistent with a model whereby PV and HRV disrupt nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking by selectively removing FG repeat domains from a subset of nuclear pore complex proteins."

In this study, volunteers who fear snakes had to bring a live snake into close proximity with their heads while their brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Bringing the snake closer was associated with a dissociation between subjective fear and somatic arousal. Activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and the right temporal pole was positively correlated with such action. Further, activity in the sgACC was positively correlated with the level of fear upon choosing to overcome fear but not upon succumbing to it. Conversely, activity in a set of interrelated temporal lobe structures, including the amygdala, was attenuated as the level of fear increased when choosing to overcome fear. We propose how the internally reinforced fast representational shift, in which the courageous-response representation gains control over behavior, takes place.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzN2RkYmQwZTA1OTViOWJhZGQ1ZWY5ZTczNGEwMDAxNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0NDUxNDM3fQ.BsmNt4K-E3XepfPxesB9zzH1UoUasRXwFQhOIHa9eBrVKMH1tsQALt58w721YwT9A8PhAdaKRpyewaM-oGuwCH9nnUdaRnlaWpP9LiVGrVXpOv_ee4AWmWeNta4F3LtSeT12eSl9Ye4Gu3fjvcWHl7uoPafSUEyhgB14yYRdL2NPH0GESIyJtZ-GKZX_S9bgMkINEXPNBAk0FfZ3pSthuIde__xucTL0IRIT4o2e8XCljYcpH1DCpzRZsigGBATpCXr28_wBbTmWv2Pk_uXDy6__AdDbzd05nUdeQvyXmFNcRoocnOb3CKThNmjO6ydEW3jR0V0dg9JmTeFa-BQ_Jg(mp4, (25.74 MB) Download video"

However, it is unclear how these marks are targeted in ESCs and maintained during differentiation. Here, we show that the ESC factor Sox2 targets H3K4 methylation to monovalent and bivalent domains. In ESCs, Sox2 contributes to the formation of a monovalent mark at an enhancer in the pro/pre-B cell-specific λ5-VpreB1 locus. Binding of Foxd3 suppresses intergenic transcription of the enhancer and surrounding sequences. In pro-B cells, enhancer activity is dependent on the Sox and Fox binding sites, and the enhancer is bound by Sox4, which is required for efficient expression of λ5. Our results lead us to propose a factor relay model whereby ESC factors establish active epigenetic marks at tissue specific elements before being replaced by cell type-specific factors as cells differentiate."

We also found that Pab2 plays a role in the RNA decay pathway orchestrated by Mmi1, a previously described factor that functions in the post-transcriptional elimination of meiotic transcripts. Our results support a model in which Mmi1 selectively targets meiotic transcripts for degradation via Pab2 and the exosome.

Here we explore the idea that these dysautonomias results, in part, from a defect in synaptic transmission. To test this idea, we investigated cultured sympathetic neurons and show that hyperglycemia inactivates nAChRs through a mechanism involving an elevation in reactive oxygen species and an interaction with highly conserved cysteine residues located near the intracellular mouth of the nAChR channel. Consistent with this, we show that diabetic mice have depressed ganglionic transmission and reduced sympathetic reflexes, whereas diabetic mice expressing mutant postsynaptic nAChRs that lack the conserved cysteine residues on the α3 subunit have normal synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia and normal sympathetic reflexes. Our work suggests a new model for diabetic-induced dysautonomias and identifies ganglionic nAChRs as targets of hyperglycemia-induced downstream signals."

The converging point in activities of these two classes of molecules is transcriptional activation of retinoid X receptors (Rxr). We show here that ablation of Rxrgamma in mice leads to depressive-like behaviors including increased despair and anhedonia, which were accompanied by reduced expression of dopamine D2 receptor in the shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and altered serotonin signaling. While abnormal serotonin signaling is not sufficient to generate the depressive behaviors, increasing D2r expression by chronic fluoxetine (Prozac) treatment or adenoassociated virus type2 (AAV2) mediated expression of Rxrgamma or D2r in the NAc of Rxrgamma(-/-) mice normalizes depressive-like behaviors in Rxrgamma(-/-) animals. Conversely, NAc infusion of raclopride, a D2r antagonist prevents AAV2-Rxrgamma-mediated rescue of despair behaviors in Rxrgamma(-/-) mice. Combined, our data argue that control of NAc D2r expression is critical for Rxrgamma-mediated modulation of affective behaviors."

To determine the contribution of PIPKIα and PIPKIβ to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis in brain, we investigated the impact of disrupting multiple PIPKI genes. Our results show that a single allele of PIPKIγ, in the absence of both PIPKIα and PIPKIβ, can support life to adulthood. In addition, PIPKIα alone, but not PIPKIβ alone, can support prenatal development, indicating an essential and partially overlapping function of PIPKIα and PIPKIγ during embryogenesis. This is consistent with early embryonic expression of PIPKIα and PIPKIγ but not of PIPKIβ. PIPKIβ expression in brain correlates with neuronal differentiation. The absence of PIPKIβ does not impact embryonic development in the PIPKIγ knock-out (KO) background but worsens the early postnatal phenotype of the PIPKIγ KO (death occurs within minutes rather than hours). Analysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> in brain reveals that only the absence of PIPKIγ significantly impacts its levels. Collectively, our results provide new evidence for the dominant importance of PIPKIγ in mammals and imply that PIPKIα and PIPKIβ function in the generation of specific PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> pools that, at least in brain, do not have a major impact on overall PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels."
https://openalex.org/W2035055610,"A report by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR)'s Task Force on Unproven Stem Cell Treatments outlines development of resources for patients, their families, and physicians seeking information on stem cell treatments. A report by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR)'s Task Force on Unproven Stem Cell Treatments outlines development of resources for patients, their families, and physicians seeking information on stem cell treatments. The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) is concerned that stem cell treatments are being marketed to consumers around the world without safeguards in place to ensure the safety or likely effectiveness of experimental treatments or truthfulness of claims about so-called proven therapies. These practices could place individual patients at risk and also jeopardize the progress of legitimate stem cell clinical translation. The ISSCR seeks to alert patients and their caregivers to these potential concerns and to answer the numerous enquiries received from patients and their advocates about clinics that claim to offer stem cell therapies. The ISSCR Task Force on Unproven Stem Cell Treatments (hereafter the Task Force) was convened by the 2009–2010 President of the ISSCR, Dr. Irving Weissman, to formulate recommendations for the development of a web-based resource for patients, their advocates, clinicians, and associations in evaluating claims of benefit from advertised stem cell treatments. In particular, the Task Force was asked to propose a process for listing clinics or programs and whether they meet what the ISSCR deems to be minimum standards of assessing safety and efficacy and to define criteria to systematically evaluate clinics or programs for inclusion on such a list (Weissman, 2009Weissman I. The ISSCR: who are we and where are we going?.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 151-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The members of the Task Force are listed in Table S1. Here, we summarize the discussion and recommendations of the Task Force for the development of a web-based resource that includes: (1) listing of individuals, clinics, or other entities offering asserted stem cell therapies and whether they provide information showing that appropriate safeguards are in place; (2) resources that explain fundamental scientific principles of stem cell biology and the implications for stem cell treatments and outline the widely accepted process of clinical translation; and (3) a list of questions patients and caregivers should ask purveyors to aid them in making treatment decisions. The extraordinary promise of stem cells for future treatments of otherwise intractable diseases and conditions has raised great hope and expectations in patients, advocates, physicians, and researchers alike. Yet this excitement has led to unacceptable exploitation of patients' hopes and fears. Through literature, clinician reports, patient questions, and patient complaints, the problem of misleading direct-to-consumer advertisement of stem cell therapies has become all too familiar to members of the Task Force, the ISSCR, local stem cell networks, and patient advocate organizations dedicated to disease-specific cures. Advertisements that claim to offer proven and effective therapies for many diseases have sprung up in various forms relying on doubtful theories that neither peer nor public review, nor regulatory authorities, have verified. Indeed, a study of advertising on widely accessed websites demonstrated that the portrayal of likely clinical benefit is optimistic, overpromising results and underestimating the potential risks, and is unsubstantiated by peer-reviewed literature available to all scientists, medical professionals, and laypeople (Lau et al., 2008Lau D. Ogbogu U. Taylor B. Stafinski T. Menon D. Caulfield T. Stem cell clinics online: the direct-to-consumer portrayal of stem cell medicine.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Clinical outcome may be selectively displayed, methods kept secret and not subjected to independent scientific and clinical examination, and treatment offered outside of regulatory oversight. These so-called therapies therefore fail to meet minimum ethical, scientific, and medical standards that such oversight entails, including appropriate support through preclinical data; commensurability of risks and benefits; phased, structured assessment of safety, efficacy, dosing, or appropriate administration; and independently assessed and approved informed consent. Furthermore, in some situations, large amounts of money are being charged for apparently unsubstantiated therapies, a further departure from widely accepted norms. Authorization to market a medicinal product is typically sought from a national or supranational regulatory agency only after rigorous testing through a formal process of clinical trials has established safety and efficacy. In a formal clinical trial setting, it is not common practice for the provider to charge for the experimental treatment, rather costs of the experimental treatment and trial monitoring is often defrayed by the company developing the treatment or by local or national government funding. A problem of these dimensions calls for more than the actions of any one organization or agency, and certainly more than the actions of one scientific society such as the ISSCR. Yet, the ISSCR recognizes the essential relationship that exists between scientific progress and public responsibility. In previous reports (“Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research” and the “Guidelines for the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells”), the ISSCR addressed the broader social, ethical, and legal implications in addition to setting professional standards for research conduct and clinical application (Daley et al., 2007Daley G.Q.

The latter guidelines include a stand-alone appendix, a “Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies” to directly address the concerns of patients (International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), 2008bInternational Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR). (2008b). Patient handbook on stem cell therapies. http://www.isscr.org/clinical_trans/pdfs/ISSCRPatientHandbook.pdf. Accessed March 17, 2010.Google Scholar). This current effort therefore grows out of the long-standing commitment of the ISSCR to ethical and scientific self-regulation through globally representative consensus on standards that distinguish sound and ethical stem cell science from practices that would be unethical or unsound. The Task Force believes the ISSCR plays a catalytic role in engaging with other organizations and the public to address social, ethical, and legal implications of scientific progress. The ISSCR's aspirations for public benefit through increasing knowledge entail this commitment: to avoid overstating what is currently known, whether in the scientific domain, the clinical domain, or the commercial domain. In fact, clinics and suppliers making unproven or exaggerated claims may endanger patients, and through poor or reckless practice they potentially discredit the field itself and threaten to impede the progress of legitimate clinical translation. The Task Force believes that the ISSCR has an appropriate role in working with others to address such clinics and suppliers and to educate professionals and patients as to responsible pathways of clinical translation. We therefore endorse the President's initiative and commend the ISSCR for its willingness to undertake such a step. The ISSCR is a scientific and medical society with unique knowledge of a still-developing scientific frontier and specialized expertise in the necessarily careful pathway from basic scientific knowledge to patient benefits through responsible clinical translation. The Task Force members reflect this expertise and have brought to this effort a great diversity of perspectives—researchers, clinicians, ethicists, jurists, and patient advocates. The Task Force provides the recommendations within this report after much discussion and consideration, for the establishment of a feasible methodology for ISSCR action while maximizing the value of information made available to patients and their advocates. The ISSCR published “Guidelines for the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells,” which define a pathway for the responsible development of safe and effective stem cell therapies (ISSCR 2008a). In that report, the Task Force on the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells recommended that development of stem cell therapies occur primarily through structured clinical research trials, which, under internationally accepted standards, are subject to independent and ongoing assessment of their scientific and ethical soundness by ethical review boards and government agencies. These guidelines recognized that progress, especially in surgical treatment, has occurred through innovation outside clinical research trials (Section 7: Stem Cell-Based Medical Innovation). However, respect for innovation has never meant that patients' urgent needs justify scientifically reckless or unethical acts. Innovation outside research requires, among other things, that the scientific and clinical plausibility for an innovative approach is demonstrable; that patients can weigh known and possible risks against realistic descriptions of potential benefits; that alternative treatments are clearly communicated; that there is independent review and oversight; and that clinical supports are in place to address known and unanticipated risks. The guidelines also noted that certain characteristics of stem cells required that their development as medical interventions called for special care and “underscore the need for independent expert peer review prior to clinical investigation to ensure the integrity of the research and informed consent processes” (Section 1: Introduction). The Task Force on the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells felt strongly that the innovation exception does not justify the commercialization of stem cell-based interventions without credible rationale or oversight or without a commitment by practitioners to use this experience to contribute to a general body of knowledge through the communication of outcomes, including negative outcome or adverse events, to the scientific community for critical review and by moving to a formal clinical trial in a timely manner. Indeed, the guidelines “recognize[d] a distinction between the commercial purveyance of unproven stem cell interventions and legitimate attempts at medical innovation outside the context of a formal clinical trial. Responsible clinician-scientists may have an interest in providing medically innovative care to a few patients using stem cells or their derivatives prior to proceeding to a formal clinical trial,” and the peer-reviewed scientific and medical case, together with the patient's informed choice among limited alternatives, may justify it in certain cases. The Task Force on the Clinical Translation of Stem Cells therefore concluded, and the ISSCR Board of Directors agreed, that the primary pathway for translating scientific advances into therapies ought to be the well-established route from peer-reviewed science to ethically and scientifically reviewed clinical research trials under appropriate regulatory oversight. To establish which aspects of medical practice might be assessed by objective review and examination of publicly available materials and direct contact, and what kind of information might be useful to those seeking treatments, the Task Force first discussed concerns about the commercial practice of unproven stem cell interventions. We eliminated aspects of practice that do not represent the primary problem. First, we noted that the concern is not about medical tourism in which citizens of one country travel to another country for treatments offered uniquely or more cheaply. The problem of unproven stem cell treatments occurs in many countries, and whether abroad or at home, the absence of essential clinical supports and follow-through can expose patients to serious health risks. Thus, although some medical tourism raises special concerns, and some issues with questionable clinics and suppliers involve medical tourism, the problems are not identical nor necessarily coincident (Cohen, 2010Cohen, I.G. (2010). Protecting patients with passports: medical tourism and the patient protective-argument. Iowa L. Rev. 95, No. 5, Harvard Public Law Working Paper No. 10-08.Google Scholar). The concern is also not simply the attempt to treat diseases for which there is no scientifically proven stem cell-based therapeutic solution. This view of the problem is too broad, for it would treat legitimate clinical research as being identical to the sale of unproven treatments. Furthermore, to simply define treatable and untreatable conditions and to use this as a criterion for listing a given entity would require the ISSCR to be omniscient with respect to all new developments, including proprietary ones. A fundamental principle espoused by previous ISSCR guidelines and reiterated by this Task Force is transparency: a willingness to communicate openly with the scientific and medical community, with regulators and with patients. This task force had enormous concern about medical practices where evidence of this communication was missing—where there was a lack of openness concerning methods and results, lack of peer review, inaccurate portrayal of scientific plausibility, unclear expertise of practitioners, and lack of independent oversight. These issues are also of direct relevance to patients and families, not just to those who would base their choice on scientific and ethical soundness, but also those who, less persuaded by such factors given the failure of existing therapies, would nonetheless be concerned with the truthfulness of solicitations with their own medical vulnerability to matters becoming even greater through unknown risks and unaddressed adverse events. We see a widely accepted imperative to report research and clinical findings and to subject results, methodologies, and conclusions to the scrutiny of independent experts in the field. The practice of external peer review has long been held as the foundation of biomedical publication and used as a method to assess the rigor of scientific enquiry and to minimize unwarranted claims or overinterpretation of data prior to broad circulation. Replication of data by independent groups is a key indicator that the data are robust— that the findings and conclusions are likely to be valid and that the technology can be repeated in someone else's hands. Thus, robustness of data might be evaluated by (1) direct relevance of the data to the specific disease and treatment in question; (2) publication by groups working independently of each other; (3) publication of results, methodologies, and conclusions; and, (4) as an indication of peer review and basic scientific quality, inclusion in the MEDLINE database, a freely available and well-recognized database of articles from journals that observe prescribed publication procedures compiled by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2007U.S. National Library of Medicine (2007). Fact Sheet: Medline Journal Selection. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/jsel.html. Accessed March 17, 2010.Google Scholar). The Task Force also affirmed previous statements and reports from the ISSCR and other international bodies that only when compelling preclinical data are available is careful and incremental testing in patients justified, and then such testing is always subject to rigorous and independent scientific and ethical oversight. Through these deliberations, the Task Force identified core elements that reflect a commitment to transparency in operations and a commitment to the widely recognized translational trajectory noted above. These elements do not incorporate all criteria identified as important by the Task Force for assessing safety and likely efficacy. They do, however, provide an objective minimum level of transparency of practice and independent scientific, ethical, and regulatory oversight.1.The clinical investigations from the early trials to commercialization have been conducted under the guidance and authority of an independent oversight body that adheres to internationally accepted ethical guidelines for the protection of human subjects, including assessment that the risk to patients was not greater than the possible benefits and that the patient or the patient's parents or legal guardians understood and gave informed consent for the medical procedure to take place.2.The clinical investigations from the beginning to commercialization have been overseen and authorized by a national or supranational regulatory body or bodies for safety and efficacy. The Task Force recommends that the ISSCR establish an inquiry and review process to look into clinics and suppliers promising therapeutic benefits from the administration of preparations claimed to contain or be constituted of stem cells and/or their induced derivatives. The guiding principles for the development of the recommended process were that (1) the standards for identifying and reviewing clinics and suppliers should be objective and clear; (2) the inquiry and review process should be publicly transparent and relatively straightforward for any clinic or practitioner to comply with; (3) conflicts of interest, if any, of the declarant ought to be disclosed to the ISSCR; (4) there should be no actual or apparent conflicts of interest of staff or others involved in the inquiry or review process for any particular matter; and (5) any findings that a clinic fails to meet standards should be communicated in a specific factual way, rather than with broad conclusions of fraudulent practices. Four main steps are outlined for the inquiry process:1.Identification of the clinics to be contacted about their practices. The process should be open to identification of entities for examination from a broad and unbiased range of sources, such as patients and external groups and requests by ISSCR members. Inquiry should be pursuant to a standardized online intake process, such as that on the draft intake form (Figure S1 available online).2.Preliminary review of advertising and solicitation materials of the clinic or supplier, such as Web materials, to determine whether the entity is involved in or claims to be involved in the purveyance of stem cell therapy, or the supply of stem cells or other stem cell-related service where there is claim/implication of therapeutic benefit.3.Contact with the clinic or supplier to request information aligned with the elements of inquiry discussed below (see Figure 1). The entity will be subjected to scrutiny for each disease encountered on the advertising or solicitation materials. At the time of this publication, entities will be excluded from the search in which the information available is not provided in English or lacks a translation into English. The Task Force recommends translations of advertising materials to English be incorporated into the inquiry process over time. Entities will also be excluded from the search in which the only clinical applications cited are (1) bone marrow, cord blood, or other blood stem cell populations used to treat diseases/conditions of the blood-forming or immune systems (including the treatment for compromised hematopoiesis secondary to high dose chemotherapy for cancers) or (2) epidermal stem cell therapies for burn trauma or limbal stem cells for corneal replacement.4.Review and results publication. Materials received will be reviewed as objectively as possible against the inquiry elements, discussed below. The meaning of the results ought to be self-evident from a clear description on the ISSCR Web site of the precise processes and criteria used. Interpretation and subjective conclusions should be avoided in any presentation of the data. The Task Force recommends that the inquiry and review process ask for evidence that the entity under review adheres to the widely accepted translational pathway from basic science to clinical applications. The following elements do not incorporate all of the important criteria identified by the Task Force for assessing safety and likely efficacy, nor do they allow the judgment of relative anticipated effectiveness. They do, however, provide an objective minimum level of transparency of practice and independent review. Determining Elements of Inquiry. Clinics and suppliers should be asked to provide evidence of the following for a given treatment for a given disease or condition offered in the context of a research study (clinical trial), experimental therapy, or claimed proven therapy:1.Evidence of review and approval for human subjects protection by an independent committee or agency such as an Institutional Review Board or Ethics Review Committee established under internationally accepted ethical guidelines; including at a minimum:•Name of applicant/principal investigator•Title of protocol/project•Committee name and/or identifying number•Date of approval•Name of signing individual•Contact information for signing individual The ISSCR may contact the signing individual identified in an effort to confirm that the applicant, protocol/project, and approval are asserted accurately.2.Review and authorization or approval by relevant supranational or national regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trial or, where applicable, reimbursed therapies/commercial use based on data provided by the clinic or others under supervised trials; or evidence of exemption from review. The ISSCR may contact the relevant regulatory authority in an effort to confirm that the information provided is complete and accurate. These determining elements of inquiry stated above—review for human subjects protection and regulatory oversight—should direct the ISSCR in listing clinics. Informational Elements of Inquiry. Clinics and suppliers should be invited to submit to the ISSCR examples of preclinical and clinical research published in the peer-reviewed literature:1.Up to two published articles from groups, ideally working independently of each other, demonstrating the scientific principles for use of a given cell product for the specific disease.2.Up to two published articles demonstrating the outcome of human clinical trials for both safety and efficacy. Articles should be peer reviewed, include data of direct relevance to the specific disease in question, include results, methodologies, and conclusions, be written in English, and be included in the MEDLINE database. The entire article should be provided to the ISSCR. The Task Force recommends a web-based resource that includes the parts outlined below. Together, these should allow a patient on their own, or in consultation with their health care provider, to consider whether the approach taken by a clinic of interest might lack the scientific rigor, transparency, and independent oversight and regulation the ISSCR and others advocate.1.An online intake mechanism. A brief form that can be used by any individual to submit an entity to the ISSCR for formal inquiry.2.Results of inquiry. The Task Force recommends two listings be developed that separately include those entities that do and do not provide upon request evidence of both of the above determining criteria (review for human subjects protection and regulatory oversight) in a timely manner and on a disease-by-disease basis. A review will be made for each disease encountered on the advertising or solicitation materials, except where excluded as outlined in the inquiry process. Thus, an entity may be included on a given list multiple times or for only a subset of the diseases for which they claim a stem cell-based treatment. The names of clinics currently under review will not be disclosed. The information used for the inclusion of an entity on one or the other of these lists is provided by that entity. The ISSCR will not be responsible for the accuracy of claims.A.Listing of clinics that do not provide evidence of both human subjects and regulatory oversight (the determining inquiry elements): “undocumented.” Those entities that do not provide the information pertaining to human subjects and regulatory oversight requested of them should be listed as “undocumented.” The listing will be prefaced with an explanatory statement that describes the process and clearly indicates that:i.The listing of an entity does not imply either ISSCR approval or disapproval, rather that specific elements of inquiry have not been adequately addressed.ii.Similarly, absence of an entity or removal of an entity from listing does not imply ISSCR approval.iii.No conclusion can be drawn from the absence of an entity/disease from this listing as the process is such that if an entity is not listed it may mean one of three very different things: no inquiry has been made; the inquiry is still in process; or the clinic has addressed each of the elements of inquiry. If an entity is listed here and then subsequently provides information that addresses missing required elements, its name will be removed from this listing. Where the entity responds that they no longer offer treatment for a disease that has been previously advertised or offered, its name will be removed from this listing but a footnote will be included that the clinic no longer treats this disease. Entities that do provide evidence of both of the determining elements of inquiry requested will be included on an independent listing as outlined below.B.Listing of clinics that do provide evidence of the determining inquiry elements: “documented.” Where evidence is provided that both human subjects and regulatory oversight are in place, clinics will be listed as “documented.” Again, this listing should in no way imply either ISSCR approval or disapproval, rather that the information requested has been provided. Thus, as for the previous listing, no conclusion can be drawn from the absence of an entity/disease from this listing as the process is such that if an entity is not listed it may mean one of three very different things: no inquiry has been made, the inquiry is still in process, or the clinic did not provide evidence to satisfy that both elements were addressed. Approval by the appropriate independent human subjects oversight body and regulatory agency reflects only that certain ethical and legal obligations, respectively, have been met in the given locale. There is significant global diversity in what circumstances a regulatory agency may grant approval or provide exemption of review for a given product and what processes and standards are applied during review. Assessment of when a particular therapy is ready to move into clinical trials or from clinical trials to a more widely available treatment outside of trials may take into account a range of factors not necessarily applicable to other regions including the current standard of care treatment or prevalence of a disease or condition in the local population. To provide additional information for caregivers or others interested, the listing will document relevant publications provided by the entity as outlined above (“Informational Elements of Inquiry”). Citations will be provided or, where the paper may be freely disseminated without breach of copyright, a pdf copy may be attached. The ISSCR may also supply up to two references subject to the same publishing qualifications outlined above that may provide either a supportive or counter argument. There is necessarily a significant period of time from when the intake sheet is filled out requesting the ISSCR investigate a specific clinic until a final determination is made, estimated at 4–5 months. The Task Force recognizes that, particularly at the beginning before they are well established, the data listings will not address the concerns of an individual patient or their advocates looking to make immediate decisions. In addition, the criteria assessed do not address the complexities of information needed for an individual medical decision, although their absence portends a failure to respect known, widely accepted, fundamental standards. Therefore, we recommend that the following resources be included on the Web site.3.Resources that explain fundamental scientific principles of stem cell biology and the implications for stem cell treatments and outline the widely accepted process of clinical translation. Understanding key aspects of stem cell biology and what is realistic to expect from stem cell treatment might aid a patient and their caregiver in determining where claims of efficacy may be exaggerated. For example, tissue-specific stem cells are limited in their potential and largely form the cell types found in the tissue from which they are derived. Thus, it is unlikely that a single cell type could be used to treat a multitude of unrelated diseases that involve different tissues or organs, and a patient should be wary of a clinic that makes such claims. Likewise, understanding the implementation of clinical trials and ultimately the commercial availability of a medicinal product, and the provisions for patient protection demanded by ethical oversight committees and regulatory bodies throughout this process, might make clear where there are concerning departures from widely accepted practice. For example, high cost of an experimental treatment might raise an immediate red flag to consumers that very careful investigation is required.4.Further questions a patient, if possible working with their caregiver, should ask the provider as part of evaluating the clinic and treatment they are considering. Transparency and forthrightness are owed to any patient considering a potential therapy; indeed without it there can be no actual informed consent. A potential patient ought to be able to consult their own personal caregiver before making a choice and involve their own local caregiver in after-care if they wish. Furthermore, for any patient, even a patient undergoing well-accepted therapy, the clinical environment is critical. The list of questions provided by this document should assist a patient in evaluating such parameters. The Task Force on Unproven Stem Cell Treatments agreed with the recommendations for practicing innovative medicine made by the ISSCR's Task Force on Clinical Translation of Stem Cells that application of medical innovation in the stem cell field should be confined to a very limited number of cases, should be subjected to external review and stringent oversight, and should move quickly toward a formal research study. Indeed, this Task Force argued that medical innovation be limited to no more than two participants. Therefore, we recommend that if the entity advertises an experimental or innovative medicine, the same inquiry process be applied. Whether in advertising or solicitation materials, or in response to the ISSCR's inquiry, if an entity states that a therapy being offered is experimental or innovative and therefore does not need to have been tested in clinical trials or does not need the human subjects protection or regulatory oversight, the clinic will be listed with the following annotation:The position of the ISSCR Task Force is that the provision of an untested experimental or innovative therapy to more than two participants is a departure from recommended practice and should be tested in a regulated and authorized clinical trial prior to being offered for sale. The Task Force recommends that its report be publicly presented. Posting of this report on the ISSCR Web site and through the ISSCR pages of affiliated journal Cell Stem Cell have both been useful devices in the past, and we endorse them here. In addition, we recommend active engagement of other stem cell networks and consortiums and patient advocacy groups that could play a key and complementary role in disseminating information on this and other work that addresses fraudulent clinics or suppliers of stem cells and in framing the combined set of actions in a way that is understandable and useful to patients and to those who will receive their queries and requests for help. The ISSCR should offer the educational resources and information offered on the Web site in additional languages wherever possible. To date, working with stem cell network partners, the ISSCR offers the “Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies” in English, German, Italian, and French. Japanese and Spanish translations are planned. We also strongly support working with the press in various countries to explain the problem, the approach we take, the potential role of other partners, and, indeed, the potential role the press itself could play in helping all of us avoid hyped discussion of stem cell “therapies.” This concludes the recommendations of the Task Force. The ISSCR Task Force would like to acknowledge insightful discussions with Christopher T. Scott and Hans-Willem Snoeck during deliberations. We thank the ISSCR Clinical Translation and Executive Committees for their critical review. Based on the recommendations in this report, the ISSCR has developed a Web site, “A Closer Look at Stem Cell Treatments” (www.closerlookatstemcells.org).

https://openalex.org/W2042339093,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by multiple mutagenic events that affect proliferation, survival, as well as differentiation. Recently, gain-of-function mutations in the α helical structure within the linker sequence of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL have been associated with AML. We identified four novel CBL mutations, including a point mutation (Y371H) and a putative splice site mutation in AML specimens. Characterization of these two CBL mutants revealed that coexpression with the receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) or KIT-induced ligand independent growth or ligand hyperresponsiveness, respectively. Growth of cells expressing mutant CBL required expression and kinase activity of FLT3. In addition to the CBL-dependent phosphorylation of FLT3 and CBL itself, transformation was associated with activation of Akt and STAT5 and required functional expression of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Furthermore, the mutations led to constitutively elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, which is commonly linked to increased glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Inhibition of hexokinase with 2-deoxyglucose blocked the transforming activity of CBL mutants and reduced activation of signaling mechanisms. Overall, our data demonstrate that mutations of CBL alter cellular biology at multiple levels and require not only the activation of receptor proximal signaling events but also an increase in cellular glucose metabolism. Pathways that are activated by CBL gain-of-function mutations can be efficiently targeted by small molecule drugs.

Activating mutations in the FLT3 and KIT RTKs are found in about one-third or one-tenth of AML cases, respectively (1Banerji L. Sattler M. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2004; 8: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deregulation of RTK pathways is likely a late event in leukemia development and may contribute to the severity of the disease rather than as a disease-initiating event (2Ley T.J. Mardis E.R. Ding L.

The role of cellular forms of FLT3, KIT, or other RTKs in AML is not known. Normally, RTKs are transiently activated through ligand binding, which can trigger signaling pathways that stimulate, for example, growth and survival. Ligand-induced activation of these RTKs will also trigger negative regulatory mechanisms that lead to the termination of the signaling mechanism. In cells expressing oncogenic RTKs, this process is likely disrupted, leading to prolonged or aberrant activation. acute myeloid leukemia 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose reactive oxygen species receptor-tyrosine kinase Src homology ubiquitin-associated three-helix bundle domain hematopoietic stem cell stem cell factor N-acetylcysteine. RTKs are negatively regulated in vivo in part by CBL (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which belongs to a family of related proteins that also include CBL-b and CBL-c (4Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Keane M.M. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). All CBL family members contain ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CBL shares the closest homology to CBL-b and both proteins contain a tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain, which in turn is composed of a four-helix bundle, an EF-hand, and an SH2-like phosphotyrosine-binding domain; a RING finger domain; a ubiquitin-associated three-helix bundle domain (UBA); and tyrosine residues that can be inducibly phosphorylated as well as a proline-rich domain known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CBL-b appears to be transcriptionally regulated and its expression is increased during myeloid differentiation (5Keane M.M. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their similar structure and function, CBL and CBL-b can be associated with distinct signaling pathways in the same cellular context (6Sattler M. Pride Y.B. Quinnan L.R. Verma S. Malouf N.A. Husson H. Salgia R. Lipkowitz S. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CBL-c is about half the size of CBL and does not contain the C-terminal proline-rich domain, the UBA domain, and lacks several phosphorylation sites as well (4Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The TKB domain in CBL proteins enables them to recognize phosphorylated target proteins, typically tyrosine kinases. Also, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are recruited through the RING finger domain for mono- or polyubiquitination of CBL-associated partners, thus effectively regulating their stability or function (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal regions of CBL and CBL-b are also postulated to participate in RTK endocytosis through the interaction with CIN85 and related proteins (7Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K.

Mutations in this region lead to a loss of the E3 activity of CBL (11Sargin B. Choudhary C. Crosetto N. Schmidt M.H. Grundler R. Rensinghoff M. Thiessen C. Tickenbrock L. Schwäble J. Brandts C. August B. Koschmieder S. Bandi S.R. Duyster J. Berdel W.E. Müller-Tidow C. Dikic I. Serve H. Blood. 2007; 110: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, this altered function has not been directly linked to the transforming activity of CBL and it has not been excluded whether it constitutes a potential epiphenomenon. In mice, disruption of the Cbl gene has not been reported to lead to myeloid malignancies but Cbl-regulated pathways are hyperresponsive to stimuli, leading to phenotypes including lymphoid hyperplasia and primary splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis (18Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular mechanisms that lead to transformation by oncogenic Cbl may either affect pathways different from its E3 activity or complement the loss of its enzymatic activity. We sought to identify CBL mutations in AML and identify receptor proximal events that regulate their transforming activity. In this study, we have identified four novel mutations in the CBL sequence from AML patient specimens. Two mutations in the linker region of CBL (hereafter referred to as mutant CBL) between the TKB and RING finger domains were further characterized. Expression of mutant CBL in FLT3 expressing BaF3 cells was found to lead to factor-independent growth, which correlated with the activation of growth and survival pathways, involving STAT5, Akt, and Rho family GTPases. In addition, CBL-transformed cells showed elevated levels of intracellular ROS and increased glucose uptake. Inhibiting the active glucose metabolism in mutant CBL-transformed cells reduced dependent growth and activation of signaling pathways, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic approaches. To identify novel CBL mutations, cDNAs from 43 AML patients and 10 healthy individuals were used to amplify the linker sequence. For the analysis of genomic mutations, exons 2 to 16 of CBL were amplified by PCR using Qiagen PCR reagent, as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The mutational status was identified by sequencing using a standard fluorescent dye method. Sequencing results were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor version 2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA) and confirmed by sequencing of the reverse coding strand. cDNA samples were obtained from the University of Mannheim, and patient specimens for the preparation of genomic DNA from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago with informed consent and approval by the respective Institutional Review Boards. The parental murine pro-B cell line BaF3 was used to co-express FLT3 or KIT RTKs with various forms of CBL. Plasmids containing the CBL.Ins(SK366) (contains a 6-bp insertion after codon 365 in the CBL sequence), CBL.Y371H, or CBL.ΔY371 mutations were generated in the pMSCV-puro-HA-CBLWT expression vector (20Reddi A.L. Ying G. Duan L. Chen G. Dimri M. Douillard P. Druker B.J. Naramura M. Band V. Band H. J. Biol.

Transformed cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech/Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), supplemented with 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of murine interleukin-3 (IL-3). BaF3.FLT3-ITD cells were cultured in medium supplemented with G418 (1.5 mg/ml). For experiments, cells were deprived of growth factor-containing medium unless stated otherwise. In some experiments, cells were treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma), Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Sigma), and CDC42 inhibitor, Secramine A (21Pelish H.E.

The compound was synthesized by Dr. Xu and Dr. Hammond at the University of Louisville. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously using a standard chemiluminescence technique (22Walz C. Crowley B.J. Hudon H.E. Gramlich J.L. Neuberg D.S. Podar K. Griffin J.D. Sattler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18177-18183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin epitope (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CBL (C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLT3 (S-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-FLT3 (Tyr842,955,969; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), phospho-CBL (Tyr674, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; Tyr700 and Tyr744, Cell Signaling), AKT1 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-AKT (Ser473, Cell Signaling), STAT5, phospho-STAT5 (Tyr694, Cell Signaling), Rac1/2/3 (Cell Signaling) and Cdc42 (SC-87; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit monoclonal antibody against RhoA (67B9; Cell Signaling) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against β-actin (12H8; Sigma) or KIT (Ab 81; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to detect protein expression. The relative intracellular levels of ROS were determined by flow cytometry using the cell-permeable redox-sensitive fluorochrome DCF-DA (2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; Calbiochem) similar to previously described methods (23Wernig G. Gonneville J.R. Crowley B.J. Rodrigues M.S. Reddy M.M. Hudon H.E. Walz C. Reiter A. Podar K. Royer Y. Constantinescu S.N. Tomasson M.H. Griffin J.D. Gilliland D.G. Sattler M. Blood. 2008; 111: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106) were incubated with DCF-DA (20 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Mediatech, Manassas, VA) for 5 min at 37 °C, and subsequently washed twice in cold PBS. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer and the FACSDiva cytometry analysis software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). BaF3.FLT3 cells expressing CBL wild-type were growth factor-deprived for 24 h and compared with cells expressing mutant forms of CBL maintained in the absence of growth factors. Cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol in PBS, incubated on ice for 30 min, and subsequently treated with RNase (10 μg of RNase/ml; Qiagen) for 20 min at 37 °C and stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml; Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry and analyzed using the ModFit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) software. The induction of apoptosis was determined in growth factor-deprived cells using the Annexin-V-Fluos staining kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's directions. Annexin V-positive staining was determined by flow cytometry with the FACSDiva analysis software. Activity of the pro-apoptotic caspases 3/7 was determined in growth factor-deprived cells using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and quantified on a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). BaF3.FLT3 cells expressing CBL mutants were transiently transfected with 5 μg of SmartPool siRNA against Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and compared with cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA (Dharmacon). The siRNA was transfected using the Nucleofector device with 100 μl of Nucleofector solution V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting 24 h after transfection and cell growth was determined by trypan blue exclusion 48 h after transfection. The relative uptake of glucose was determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent glucose analogue 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBD-glucose) (Invitrogen). Cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 2-NBD-glucose (100 μm) in PBS (Mediatech) for 20 min at 37 °C, subsequently washed twice in cold PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Gain-of-function mutations in the linker sequence of CBL have been first described in AML patient specimens (10Caligiuri M.A. Briesewitz R. Yu J. Wang L. Wei M. Arnoczky K.J. Marburger T.B. Wen J. Perrotti D. Bloomfield C.D. Whitman S.P. Blood. 2007; 110: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Sargin B. Choudhary C. Crosetto N. Schmidt M.H. Grundler R. Rensinghoff M. Thiessen C. Tickenbrock L. Schwäble J. Brandts C. August B. Koschmieder S. Bandi S.R. Duyster J. Berdel W.E. Müller-Tidow C. Dikic I. Serve H. Blood. 2007; 110: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify novel CBL mutations we performed DNA sequencing on AML patient specimens. An initial screen identified two novel CBL mutations in the linker sequence out of 43 AML cDNA samples, suggesting a mutation rate of 5% (2/43). The first mutation included a putative heterozygous splice site mutation (intron 7/exon 8) resulting in a 6-bp insertion (TCAAAG), predicting the insertion of serine and lysine (SK) at positions 366/367 of the coding sequence (Ins(SK366)). The second mutation was a homozygous single base substitution, resulting in a tyrosine to histidine substitution at position 371 of the coding sequence (Y371H) (Fig. 1A). Both mutations were located in the α helical structure within the linker sequence of CBL, upstream of the RING finger, which is required for its E3 function (Fig. 1B). These variations were not found in samples from normal donors or in GenBankTM and other searchable databases. Next, genomic DNA sequencing was performed to identify potential mutations outside of the linker sequence in 37 AML specimens, an approach that does not allow the identification of putative splice site mutations. Two additional single base mutations were identified, suggesting a mutation rate of 5% (2/37). One mutation was a homozygous K287R substitution (exon 5) in close proximity to the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of the SH2-like domain and the other a heterozygous R499L mutation (exon 10) adjacent to the GRB2 SH3 domain binding site (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Activating mutations in the linker sequence of CBL have been associated with factor-independent growth in cell line models, when co-expressed with RTKs (10Caligiuri M.A. Briesewitz R. Yu J. Wang L. Wei M. Arnoczky K.J. Marburger T.B. Wen J. Perrotti D. Bloomfield C.D. Whitman S.P. Blood. 2007; 110: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Sargin B. Choudhary C. Crosetto N. Schmidt M.H. Grundler R. Rensinghoff M. Thiessen C. Tickenbrock L. Schwäble J. Brandts C. August B. Koschmieder S. Bandi S.R. Duyster J. Berdel W.E. Müller-Tidow C. Dikic I. Serve H. Blood. 2007; 110: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transforming activity of mutant CBL was tested using the IL-3-dependent BaF3 cell line, engineered to express the functional FLT3 receptor. BaF3.FLT3 cells expressing CBL mutants were compared with wild-type (WT) CBL-expressing cells. As a positive control, BaF3.FLT3 cells with a transforming mutant of CBL, harboring a deletion of Tyr371 in the linker sequence (CBL.ΔY371), were used (24Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The growth of these cells was determined in a 4-day culture in the absence of IL-3. Consistent with this model, we did not find factor-independent growth of cells expressing the CBL mutants in the absence of FLT3 in BaF3 cells (not shown). Whereas BaF3.FLT3 cells expressing WT CBL did not grow, the cell number increased 26-fold for CBL.Ins(SK366) and 17-fold for the CBL.Y371H-expressing cells. This was comparable with the 22-fold increase of the CBL.ΔY371-expressing BaF3.FLT3 cells (Fig. 2A, left panel). To further confirm whether FLT3 kinase activity is required for the transforming activity of mutant CBL, we treated cells with the FLT3 kinase inhibitor midostaurin (25Weisberg E. Boulton C. Kelly L.M. Manley P. Fabbro D. Meyer T. Gilliland D.G. Griffin J.D. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). This small molecule drug led to a dose-dependent reduction of cell growth in a 3-day culture of BaF3 cells expressing the constitutively active FLT3 with an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), with an IC50 of 50 nm (not shown). Midostaurin (50 nm) also led to a reduction in cell growth in BaF3.FLT3 cells expressing CBL.Ins(SK366) (46.1 ± 10.0%), CBL.Y371H (45.1 ± 8.5%), or CBL.ΔY371 (54.1 ± 6.7%), relative to untreated cells. The reduction in cell growth could be significantly alleviated in the presence of IL-3, and was comparable with growth of cells expressing WT CBL in the presence of midostaurin (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the transforming activity of mutant CBL can be induced by RTKs other than FLT3, we also expressed mutant CBL with the KIT RTK in BaF3 cells. Unlike BaF3 cells co-expressing CBL mutants with FLT3, the coexpression of CBL mutants with KIT did not result in a growth factor-independent phenotype. However, in the presence of the KIT ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), mutant CBL-expressing cells displayed hyper-responsiveness to the growth factor in a dose-dependent manner, when compared with WT CBL-expressing cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). At 10 ng/ml of SCF the growth of CBL.Ins(SK366) and CBL.Y371H cells was increased 6.8- and 5.0-fold, respectively, when compared with cells expressing WT CBL. Cells expressing the ΔY371 mutant displayed hyper-responsiveness as well, with a 5.4-fold increase in cell growth compared with WT CBL cells in response to 10 ng/ml of SCF. In control experiments the protein expression of KIT, CBL, HA-tagged CBL, and actin was determined and compared with untransfected BaF3 cells (Fig. 2, A and C, right panels). To determine the effect of IL-3 withdrawal on apoptosis in mutant CBL-expressing cells, we measured the total percentage of Annexin V-positive cells in response to growth factor withdrawal. BaF3 cells co-expressing FLT3 and CBL mutants were grown in the absence of IL-3 and compared with WT CBL-expressing cells that were IL-3 deprived for 24 h. Whereas in WT CBL-expressing BaF3.FLT3 cells the levels of Annexin V-positive cells were 5.7 ± 1.1% of the total population, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased in the presence of CBL.Ins(SK366) (1.4 ± 0.4%) and CBL.Y371H (1.5 ± 0.5%) as well as CBL.ΔY371 (1.3 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 3A, left panel). We further confirmed reduced apoptosis by measuring relative activities of caspases 3/7, which are involved in the apoptotic pathway. Similar to the above data, reduced caspase 3/7 activity (fold-change relative to WT CBL-expressing cells) was observed in the CBL.Ins(SK366) (0.12 ± 0.01) and CBL.Y371H (0.20 ± 0.02) as well as CBL.ΔY371 (0.14 ± 0.02) expressing cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). Next, cell cycle distribution was determined in BaF3.FLT3 cells in response to mutant CBL. Cells expressing WT CBL were compared with cells expressing CBL mutants in the absence of IL-3. The majority of cells expressing WT CBL accumulated in the G1 phase (69.2 ± 9.3%), consistent with a G1 cell cycle arrest. The proportion of cells in the G1 phase was reduced in CBL.Ins(SK366) (52.4 ± 1.9%), CBL.Y371H (53.9 ± 2.3%), or CBL.ΔY371 (50.2 ± 5.9%) cell lines, and consequently the relative number of cells in S increased (Fig. 3B). Also, an additional 5.0 ± 2.8% of WT CBL-expressing cells were in the sub-G1 phase, which is consistent with increased apoptosis, compared with mutant CBL-expressing cells that had a lower percentage of additional cells in sub-G1 (<0.5%). These data demonstrate that the mutated forms of CBL examined here promote cell growth through reduced apoptosis and increased cell cycle progression. We and others have previously shown that transforming tyrosine kinase activity leads to an increase of ROS in hematopoietic cells and this effect was shown to be crucial for cell growth and tyrosine kinase activity itself. We therefore sought to determine whether mutant CBL could increase ROS in BaF3.FLT3 cells (Fig. 3C). A significant increase in ROS was found in CBL.Ins(SK366) (59.9 ± 23.9%), CBL.Y371H (71.6 ± 13.2%), and CBL.ΔY371 (67.6 ± 11.5%) expressing cells compared with WT CBL-expressing cells (p < 0.05, n = 3). Interestingly, comparable changes were found in cells transformed by the FLT3 oncogene with internal tandem duplication (not shown). Overall, these results are consistent with a role of ROS in transformation of hematopoietic cells. The above data implied that FLT3 kinase activity is required for transforming activity of mutant forms of CBL. We therefore initially asked whether the FLT3 receptor is phosphorylated at its activation site (Tyr842) and other phosphorylation sites (Tyr955 and Tyr969). We also determined the activation of common growt"
https://openalex.org/W2044193792,"Co-amplification and co-overexpression of ErbB2 and Grb7 are frequently found in various cancers, including breast cancer. Biochemical and functional correlations of the two molecules have identified Grb7 to be a pivotal mediator downstream of ErbB2-mediated oncogenesis. However, it remains largely unknown how Grb7 is involve in the ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that Grb7-mediated cell proliferation and growth are essential for the tumorigenesis that occurs in ErbB2-Grb7-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Intrinsically, EGF-induced de novo Grb7 tyrosine phosphorylation/activation recruits and activates Ras-GTPases and subsequently promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby stimulating tumor growth. Furthermore, we also found the anti-tumor effect could be synergized by co-treatment with Herceptin plus Grb7 knockdown in Sk-Br3 breast cancer cells. Our findings illustrate an underlying mechanism by which Grb7 promotes tumorigenesis through the formation of a novel EGFR-Grb7-Ras signaling complex, thereby highlighting the potential strategy of targeting Grb7 as an anti-breast cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2077878765,"The cell surface glycoprotein γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was isolated from healthy human kidney and liver to characterize its glycosylation in normal human tissue in vivo. GGT is expressed by a single cell type in the kidney. The spectrum of N-glycans released from kidney GGT constituted a subset of the N-glycans identified from renal membrane glycoproteins. Recent advances in mass spectrometry enabled us to identify the microheterogeneity and relative abundance of glycans on specific glycopeptides and revealed a broader spectrum of glycans than was observed among glycans enzymatically released from isolated GGT. A total of 36 glycan compositions, with 40 unique structures, were identified by site-specific glycan analysis. Up to 15 different glycans were observed at a single site, with site-specific variation in glycan composition. N-Glycans released from liver membrane glycoproteins included many glycans also identified in the kidney. However, analysis of hepatic GGT glycopeptides revealed 11 glycan compositions, with 12 unique structures, none of which were observed on kidney GGT. No variation in glycosylation was observed among multiple kidney and liver donors. Two glycosylation sites on renal GGT were modified exclusively by neutral glycans. In silico modeling of GGT predicts that these two glycans are located in clefts on the surface of the protein facing the cell membrane, and their synthesis may be subject to steric constraints. This is the first analysis at the level of individual glycopeptides of a human glycoprotein produced by two different tissues in vivo and provides novel insights into tissue-specific and site-specific glycosylation in normal human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2035550923,"The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse is a recessive model of neurodegeneration, involving cerebellum and retina. Purkinje cell death in pcd is dramatic, as >99% of Purkinje neurons are lost in 3 weeks. Loss of function of Nna1 causes pcd, and Nna1 is a highly conserved zinc carboxypeptidase. To determine the basis of pcd, we implemented a two-pronged approach, combining characterization of loss-of-function phenotypes of the Drosophila Nna1 ortholog (NnaD) with proteomics analysis of pcd mice. Reduced NnaD function yielded larval lethality, with survivors displaying phenotypes that mirror disease in pcd. Quantitative proteomics revealed expression alterations for glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. Nna proteins localize to mitochondria, loss of NnaD/Nna1 produces mitochondrial abnormalities, and pcd mice display altered proteolytic processing of Nna1 interacting proteins. Our studies indicate that Nna1 loss of function results in altered bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction."

DivIVA is considered a scaffolding protein able to recruit other proteins and enzymes involved in polar peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Partial depletion of DivIVA induced overexpression of cg3264, a previously uncharacterized gene that encodes a novel coiled coil-rich protein specific for corynebacteria and a few other actinomycetes. By partial depletion and overexpression of Cg3264, we demonstrated that this protein is an essential cytoskeletal element needed for maintenance of the rod-shaped morphology of Corynebacterium glutamicum, and it was therefore renamed RsmP (rod-shaped morphology protein). RsmP forms long polymers in vitro in the absence of any cofactors, thus resembling eukaryotic intermediate filaments. We also investigated whether RsmP could be regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation, like eukaryotic intermediate filaments. RsmP was phosphorylated in vitro by the PknA protein kinase and to a lesser extent by PknL. A mass spectrometric analysis indicated that phosphorylation exclusively occurred on a serine (Ser-6) and two threonine (Thr-168 and Thr-211) residues. We confirmed that mutagenesis to alanine (phosphoablative protein) totally abolished PknA-dependent phosphorylation of RsmP. Interestingly, when the three residues were converted to aspartic acid, the phosphomimetic protein accumulated at the cell poles instead of making filaments along the cell, as observed for the native or phosphoablative RsmP proteins, indicating that phosphorylation of RsmP is necessary for directing cell growth at the cell poles.

https://openalex.org/W2061647809,"The transcription of tissue-specific and inducible genes is usually subject to the dynamic control of multiple activators. Dedifferentiated hepatic cell lines lose the expression of tissue-specific activators and many characteristic hepatic genes, such as drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450. Here we demonstrate that by combining adenoviral vectors for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and constitutive androstane receptor, the CYP2B6 expression and inducibility by CITCO are restored in human hepatoma HepG2 cells at levels similar to those in cultured human hepatocytes. Moreover, several other phase I and II genes are simultaneously activated, which suggests that this is an effective approach to endow dedifferentiated human hepatoma cells with a particular metabolic competence and response to inducers. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanism, we examined the cooperation of these three transcription factors on the CYP2B6 5'-flanking region. We show new CYP2B6-responsive sequences for C/EBPalpha and HNF4alpha and a novel synergistic regulatory mechanism whereby C/EBPalpha, HNF4alpha, and constitutive androstane receptor bind and cooperate through proximal and distal response elements to confer a maximal level of expression. The results obtained from human liver also suggest that important differences in the expression and binding of C/EBPalpha and HNF4alpha could account for the large interindividual variability of the hepatic CYP2B6 enzyme, which metabolizes commonly used drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2047525230,"The HIV protein Nef is thought to mediate immune evasion and promote viral persistence in part by down-regulating major histocompatibility complex class I protein (MHC-I or HLA-I) from the cell surface. Two different models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon as follows: 1) stimulation of MHC-I retrograde trafficking from and aberrant recycling to the plasma membrane, and 2) inhibition of anterograde trafficking of newly synthesized HLA-I from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. We show here that Nef simultaneously uses both mechanisms to down-regulate HLA-I in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or HeLa cells. Consistent with this, we found by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy that a third of diffusing HLA-I at the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi/trans-Golgi network, and the plasma membrane (PM) was associated with Nef. The binding of Nef was similarly avid for native HLA-I and recombinant HLA-I A2 at the PM. Nef binding to HLA-I at the PM was sensitive to specific inhibition of endocytosis. It was also attenuated by cyclodextrin disruption of PM lipid micro-domain architecture, a change that also retarded lateral diffusion and induced large clusters of HLA-I. In all, our data support a model for Nef down-regulation of HLA-I that involves both major trafficking itineraries and persistent protein-protein interactions throughout the cell."

These methods are illustrated by the Canadian Stem Cell Network, which fosters high-profile multidisciplinary, collaborative, international research. However, patenting negatively impacts collaboration patterns in published research. Policies directed at collaboration and commercialization may be in conflict, depending on the degree to which one activity is emphasized over the other. Advances in bibliometrics present new methods for analyzing emerging collaborative innovation models. These methods are illustrated by the Canadian Stem Cell Network, which fosters high-profile multidisciplinary, collaborative, international research. However, patenting negatively impacts collaboration patterns in published research. Policies directed at collaboration and commercialization may be in conflict, depending on the degree to which one activity is emphasized over the other. Commercialization has become a dominant theme in the innovation strategies of industrialized countries, particularly in the context of stem cell (SC) research in which economic benefit resulting from commercialization is used to justify funding and political support (Winickoff et al., 2009Winickoff D.E. Saha K. Graff G.D. Yale J. Health Policy Law Ethics. 2009; 9: 54-126Google Scholar). The priority placed on commercialization exists against a background of funding programs designed to encourage research networks and collaborations. Such programs bring researchers in multiple fields together, with the expectation of promoting basic and applied research and the translation of that research into products and therapies (Lee and Bozeman, 2005Lee S.S. Bozeman B. Social Studies of Science. 2005; 35: 673-702Crossref Scopus (909) Google Scholar, Munos, 2009Munos B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). However, an increasing body of evidence suggests that commercial activities of academic scientists undermine academic collaborations, resulting in secrecy and withholding of materials and data (Walsh et al., 2005Walsh J.P. Cho C. Cohen W.M. Science. 2005; 309: 2002-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Hong and Walsh, 2009Hong W. Walsh J.P. Sociological Quarterly. 2009; 50: 145-171Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Such negative impacts on multidisciplinary academic collaborations are particularly concerning for SC research, which Giebel, 2005Giebel L.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar argues, “needs to be incubated in academia much longer before it is ready to graduate into a business that can commercialize the technology and deliver real products.” Advances in the field of bibliometrics allow for new objective analyses of research networks and the impact of policies on such networks (Strandbourg et al., 2006Strandbourg K.J. Csardi G. Tabochnik J. Erdi P. Zalanyi L. Berkeley Technol. Law J. 2006; 21: 1293-1362Google Scholar, Moed, 2005Moed H.F. Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar). Our case study of a Canadian Network of Centers of Excellence (NCE), the Stem Cell Network (SCN), illustrates both the utility of a bibliometric approach and addresses how key variables, including commercialization activity, impact on academic research collaborations. Commercialization activity in the form of patenting has been shown to have a negative impact on scientific knowledge in the public domain (Huang and Murray, 2009Huang K.G. Murray F.R. Acad. Manage. J. 2009; 52: 1193-1221Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, the number of citations of key academic articles on human genes decreases after the gene identified in the article is claimed in a published patent application. The publication of the patent application, 18 months after it was filed, is when the patent application becomes public knowledge. Here, we question whether there is also a negative impact of patenting and other commercialization activities on academic collaborations measured through coauthorship. The NCE program was established in 1989 and marked a change in science funding models in Canada. Instead of being directed toward individual or small groups of investigators, it was designed to create networks of primarily academic researchers in specific fields, such as SC research (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2005Atkinson-Grosjean A. Public Science Private Interests: Culture and Commerce in Canada's Networks of Centres of Excellence. University of Toronto Press, Toronto2005Google Scholar). Most importantly, however, the NCE brought in a new philosophy for inclusion of individuals within partnerships, requiring network researchers to seek cofunding from the private sector and to focus development on commercializable outputs. This requirement constituted a significant policy shift imposed from the top down to change research culture to focus more on application rather than investigator-driven inquiry (Atkinson-Grosjean, 2005Atkinson-Grosjean A. Public Science Private Interests: Culture and Commerce in Canada's Networks of Centres of Excellence. University of Toronto Press, Toronto2005Google Scholar). Funded since 2000 and till 2011, the SCN is directed at translating SC research into clinical applications, commercial products, and public policy (http://www.stemcellnetwork.ca/). It is a nonprofit corporation comprising academic researchers, clinicians, and bioengineers, as well as ethicists, lawyers, and social scientists, the latter three fields collectively known as ELSI. Its program is assessed by external peer review for research excellence and its ability to bring together most of Canada's SC community to facilitate networking, research excellence, and commercialization of network funded research. However, although the SCN at the time of data collection had contributed funding to two projects that moved into phase I and IIb clinical trials, the majority of SCN-funded research prior to 2008 used animal models and cell-based research. This was so despite the creation, and now dissolution, of Aggregate Therapeutics, Inc. (ATI), a company created to pool and manage the intellectual property and know-how of 37 SCN researchers (Herder and Brian, 2008Herder M. Brian J.D. J. Bus. Ethics. 2008; 77: 73-84Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) who voluntarily agreed to participate. ATI failed to attract private sector investment, probably because of issues commonly identified as barriers to the commercialization of cell-based therapies, including: (1) the early stage of much of the research; (2) questions about the development of exploitable intellectual property, definable products, and profitable business models, and (3) a host of regulatory and ethical challenges (Giebel, 2005Giebel L.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Little et al., 2006Little M. Hall W. Orlandi A. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, Plagnol et al., 2009Plagnol A.C. Rowley E. Martin P. Livesay F. Future Medicine. 2009; 4: 549-559Google Scholar). At present, new innovation models are emerging in the life sciences in which the emphasis is placed on collaboration and partnerships (Gold et al., 2008Gold, E.R., Adams, W., Bernier, L., Bubela, T., Cassivi, L., Castle, D., Cleret de Langavant, G., Cloutier, L.M., Daar, A.S., Delerue, H., et al. (2008) online: The Innovation Partnership (http://www.theinnovationpartnership.org/en/ieg/report/)Google Scholar, Edwards et al., 2009Edwards A.M. Bountra C. Kerr D.J. Willson T.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There is a recognition that no one entity can itself do most of the research and development given increasing technological complexities and enhanced understanding of the complexity of living systems. Indeed, even pharmaceutical companies that traditionally have relied on a vertical integration of research through product development and marketing activities now recognize that new drugs will only be developed through innovative partnerships with public research institutions and biotechnology companies (Munos, 2009Munos B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Bibliometrics enables an exploration of these complex collaborative systems. Bibliometric analyses are based on the wealth of data available on the Internet or from other digital records in, for example, publications, patents, citation, sequence, and chemical databases. The main difference between these analyses and traditional metrics for innovation is that instead of merely counting indicators of success along a linear innovation pathway, such as number of publications, patents, or funding, bibliometric analyses can measure networking activities such as researchers who publish, patent, or seek funding together. Further, when combined with statistical modeling, they can assess the significance of factors such as geography, institutional affiliation, and personal or group attributes. Other bibliometric tools illustrate the structure of a field of research (cocitation analysis) or how the field changes over time (citation trail analysis). Citation trail analysis tracks citations through generations of publications in a field and may be used to track or identify seminal research publications, technologies, or patents. Further, bibliometrics can also be used to explore the influence or the activities of specific groups of researchers in a global research environment. For example, tracking key publications both over time and geography allows for visualization of uptake and diffusion of new technologies, methods, or knowledge. Geographic information software (GIS) such as Google Earth (http://earth.google.com) can help track the movement of researchers and their students around the world. Collectively, these tools allow for a more nuanced understanding of the benefits flowing from innovation networks. In this Synthesis article, we overlay the attributes of individual researchers on a network of researchers who coauthor academic articles (coauthorship network) in the field of SC research. This approach enables us to explore, when combined with statistical modeling, whether individuals who engage in commercialization activities, such as patenting and company formation or participation, collaborate in the academic realm as much as individuals who do not. We ask this question while controlling for other attributes of individual authors such as institutional affiliation, geography, seniority, impact of research, and research field, among others. We show that, while there are limitations in the available data and analytical tools, network visualization combined with statistical modeling of attributes of individuals within the network may be a powerful tool for policy analysis. Collaboration networks, in general, may be used for visualizing patterns of linkages between individuals or research groups, including coauthorship of scientific or other publications, copatenting, patentee-assignee relationships, licensing and cofunding relationships, materials exchange, and training. Network Statistics can indicate how central or important an actor is within the network. Here, we only visualized a coauthorship network for SCN Principal Investigators (PIs). A second bibliometric analysis tool we used was author cocitation analysis. Author cocitation analysis uses information on how authors are cited together in the literature to define fields of interest (i.e., whether two authors have been cited together in a third, fourth, and multiple articles is an indication that they are in the same field). Taken together over a large number of publications, author cocitation analysis can be used for visualizing the subfields within a field of research such as stem cell research (Figure S1 available online). We used cocitation analysis to identify subfields and to objectively assign SCN PIs to those subfields (e.g., hematopoietic SC), which then became an attribute used in the statistical model. Our approach involves six steps, which are fully described in the Supplemental Information: (1) data collection (publications, patents, and attributes of individual SCN PIs), (2) data cleaning (for example, ensuring that individual authors could be indentified from multiple versions of their names such as John Smith, J Smith, JA Smith, John A Smith or that “J Smith” was in fact two individuals), (3) constructing and visualizing the coauthorship network (where each individual author appears as a node and the lines connecting the nodes are based on the number of times two individuals have coauthored a paper), (4) analyzing the coauthorship network (deriving two network statistics from the full network based on the number of coauthors for each SCN PI), (5) performing the cocitation analysis so that each SCN-PI could be assigned to a subfield of research, and (6) developing a series of generalized linear models (GLMs), a type of regression analysis, to explore, for each of the two network variables (from step 4), if commercialization activity had an effect on coauthorship after taking into account the other attributes of individual SCN PIs. The initial data were provided by the SCN, including: a list of 83 science PIs, publications funded by the SCN, the names of PIs involved in independent start-up companies, and the names of PIs involved in the SCN commercialization company ATI. In our statistical model, we excluded four honorary PIs and all ELSI PIs because of different publication and citation patterns in the social sciences (Moed, 2005Moed H.F. Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar) and because these researchers were minimally linked through coauthorship with science PIs (Figure 1). All statistics are calculated with data on the 79 active science PIs. We identified institutional affiliations of PIs by using Google and/or PubMed searches and created PI citation reports with the ISI Web of Knowledge. The main attributes of PIs, namely the number of publications, number of citations, average number of citations per publication, H-index, and years since first publication, are shown in Table 1. The H-index is a measure of research impact based on publications and citations. We used PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus citation databases to collect four types of publications: (1) the unique Medline indexed scientific publications funded by the SCN (n = 507), (2) publications cited by and (3) citing those publications, and (4) all publications cited in the citing publications. We collected the PIs' international filed and granted patents by using the Canadian Intellectual Property Office database and Delphion (Table 1). Three measures of commercialization used were: (1) patents (applications and granted), (2) involvement in ATI, and (3) involvement in other start-up companies (Figure 1).Table 1Impact of Patenting and Publications on Coauthorship PatternsVariable (n = 79 PIs)Average ± SE (Range)Model OneaCalculated on log-transformed data for patents, publications, and citations so that these variables better approximated a normal distribution.: Coauthors Beta Coefficient ± SE (Pr (>|z|))Model TwoaCalculated on log-transformed data for patents, publications, and citations so that these variables better approximated a normal distribution.: Neighborhood Size Beta Coefficient ± SE (Pr (>|z|))Dependent Network VariablesNumber of coauthorsbNumber of distinct coauthors of a PI in the coauthorship network.114 ± 134 (11–828)Neighborhood sizecNumber of authors who collaborated either with the PI or with one of the PI's collaborators.3779 ± 546 (75–23,151)Independent or Predictor VariablesNumber of patents11 ± 1.8 (0–99)−0.189 ± 0.082 (0.021)−0.308 ± 0.102 (0.003)Total number of publications128 ± 14.4 (16–591)1.051 ± 0.202 (0.001)1.178 ± 0.255 (0.001)Total number of citations5590.4 ± 699.3 (153–29935)2.406 ± 0.741 (0.001)3.161 ± 0.918 (0.001)Average number of citations per publication40.9 ± 3.5 (9–149)–dThese independent variables were not included because they were highly correlated with other variables included in the top model (Table S1).–H-index29 ± 1.9 (7–81)––Years since first publication21.5 ± 0.9 (9–43)––Attributes of SCN science PIs used as dependent and independent variables in generalized linear models to assess which independent or predictor variables explained variance in the two dependent variables.

After data cleaning to eliminate duplicate publications and to correctly identify authors and the links between them (Supplemental Information), we built a computational model of the full coauthorship network on the basis of individual author nodes and the number of coauthored papers (links) between them. The full coauthorship network was based on 162,555 unique PubMed publications with close to a million author name occurrences and 361,064 individual author nodes. There were 2.77 million links between coauthors, weighted by the number of times the two linked individuals appear as coauthors of a publication. For comparison, up to December 2007, there were 157,122 PubMed records with “stem cell” as a MeSH Term, indicating that our search strategy, despite using the interdisciplinary SCN publications as a starting point, captured a significant percentage of research publications in this field. Network PIs exhibited a wide range of collaborative behaviors, patenting activity, and other characteristics (Table 1). The PIs belonged to 22 Canadian universities and other publicly funded research institutions in 12 cities across the country. All PIs were linked in some way to the overall international coauthorship network of SC researchers, and many had large numbers of international coauthors, ranging from 11 to 828 (Table 1). The SCN classified the 79 active science researchers as basic (54), clinical (14), and bioengineering (11). To assign SCN PIs to research areas, we performed an all-author cocitation analysis (see Supplemental Information; Figure S1) of the most highly cited researchers in the dataset along with the SCN PIs; 17% of SCN PIs were included in this category of most highly cited researchers. This result indicates the profile of SCN researchers with 14 PIs among the one hundred most highly cited researchers in this field. All-author cocitation analysis identified seven subfields—hematopoietic SCs; SCs and the nervous system; SC growth and cancer; SCs and early development; SCs and muscles (including cardiac); genetic vectors; and ELSI. We then categorized SCN PIs accordingly by identifying the research areas most closely related to their research publications (Figure S1). This label became another attribute of the SCN PIs to use as a categorical variable for the statistical analysis. Our approach goes beyond a descriptive analysis of a visualized network by combining the coauthorship network with further statistical analyses. We used GLMs to examine the influence of a series of independent variables on two measures of a PI's collaboration intensity (network variables). Note that additional attribute data were collected only for the SCN PIs who were embedded within the complete coauthorship network. GLMs allowed us to determine, for each network variable, whether commercialization activity had an effect after correcting for other statistically significant variables in the model. The network variables were: (1) the number of distinct coauthors of a PI in the collaboration network (“coauthors”) and (2) the number of authors who collaborated either with the PI or with one of the PI's collaborators (“neighborhood”) (Table 1). The independent variables were those hypothesized to have a significant statistical influence on collaboration: (1) commercialization activity (patents); (2) research quantity (number of publications); (3) research quality (total number of citations, average number of citations received per publication, and H-index); (4) seniority (years since first ISI-indexed publication) (Table 1). In addition, we included (5) type of PI (basic researcher, bioengineer, or clinician); (6) field of research; (7) the year in which a PI joined the SCN to distinguish SCN founders from more recent arrivals; and (8) institutional affiliation (Table S2). Other attributes collected, but not included in the final models, were city and patent to publication ratio. These were not included because statistical variables were separated into sets of mutually highly correlated variables (Pearson's |r| > 0.7; Table S1), and only one variable from each set was used for any given GLM to avoid multicollinearity of variables. For example, no statistical model included both city and institution because these are highly correlated. The H-index was highly correlated with both number of publications and number of years since the first publication. A PI's patents/publications ratio was almost perfectly correlated with the natural logarithm of his/her number of patents. The analysis was run multiple times with different combinations of independent variables. The selection of the top model followed an “information-theoretic approach” that balanced the model fit against minimizing the number of variables within the model. Table 1 and Table S2 provide the beta coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for the top models. The beta coefficients can be used to calculate the effect size because they indicate the proportional increase (+) or decrease (−) in the dependent variable for every one unit increase in the independent network variable. We used natural logarithms of publication, citation and patent numbers so that these variables better approximated a normal distribution. Categorical variables (e.g., city, institution) were automatically converted into a set of “dummy variables,” such that for each combination of a category (e.g., city) and a possible value of that category (e.g., Toronto or Edmonton), one dummy variable is introduced into the statistical model, with value 1 if that value applies to a PI in this category. This is a standard method for using categorical variables in regression analysis. For the first dependent network variable, “coauthors,” the top model (R2 = 0.852, indicating a very strong fit for the model) showed that institutional affiliation affected coauthorship much more strongly than geographical location (in this case, city) —possibly an indication that institutional culture or policy influences researchers more than mere proximity. We are able to make this distinction because each run of the analysis includes only one of the highly correlated variables at a time (e.g., institution or city). In this case, the top model containing institution was a better fit with the data than another run of the model containing city. The three most collaborative institutions were the Lawson Health Research Institute, BC Cancer Agency, and the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto (Figure S2). Not surprisingly, more senior PIs tended to coauthor with more individuals, and more productive researchers also tended to exhibit higher levels of coauthorship. Both research quantity (number of publications) and quality (number of citations) predicted coauthorship (Table 1). In addition, bioengineers had fewer coauthors than basic and clinical researchers (ANOVA: F2,76 = 3.52, p = 0.034), but this was not significant in the model. Tukey posthoc tests indicated bioengineers had fewer coauthors than basic researchers but clinicians did not differ from either group. In terms of commercialization activity, the 15 PIs known to be involved in independent start-ups had, on average, five times as many patents as those not involved (Figure S3), and the 15 individuals involved in start-ups had an average 90 ± 18 coauthors compared to an average of 120 ± 14 for those not involved, a nonsignificant difference. Thus increased patenting captures researchers actively engaged in commercialization as opposed to incidental patenters, for whom patents are a metric increasingly valued by institutions and funders. Indeed, the pressure to patent may be inferred from the fact that 76% of science PIs had at least one patent. There was no difference in patents or coauthors for PIs involved in ATI. This is not surprising because approximately half of PIs agreed to participate, whether they in fact commercialized research or not. Therefore, there was no statistical reason to include either start-up or ATI in the model, especially since patenting captured involvement in start-ups. Patenting had a statistically significant negative impact on coauthors even after taking into account the other variables that are highly predictive of collaborative behavior (Table 1). The effect size (Supplemental Information) was a 17% decrease in the number of coauthors from a one unit change in the number of patents (log transformed). Figure 1 illustrates these effects: the top 20 patenters and those involved in start-up companies are less well connected to the central coauthorship network, and many are peripheral. The second dependent network variable, “neighborhood,” showed a similar pattern (R2 = 0.844, also a very good fit for the model), but research field was also significant. Researchers in the field of SCs and early development collaborated more than those in other fields, probably because it contained the highest number of PIs (24) and a few highly productive individuals. Patenting also had a statistically significant negative impact on neighborhood (Table 1). Again, there was a 26.5% decrease in neighborhood size from a one unit increase in patenting (log transformed). Thus, our study demonstrates that bibliometric methods, combined with statistical modeling, have great potential for evaluating science funding policies (Moed, 2005Moed H.F. Citation Analysis in Research Evaluation. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar). Here, we assessed whether policies directed at commercialization are compatible with policies directed at enhancing academic networking through research collaborations and the functioning of virtual networks, such as the SCN. Our objective analysis of all SCN PIs showed that individuals actively engaged in commercialization activities had fewer coauthors. This finding is in contrast to the subjective evaluation of a third of SCN PIs in responding to a survey on the impact of commercialization pressure on research activities in which the majority found the overall impact to be positive (11 PIs) or neutral (13 PIs), rather than negative (2 PIs) (Caulfield et al., 2008Caulfield T. Ogbogu U. Murdoch C. Einsiedel E. Regen. Med. 2008; 3: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The main limitation of our analysis was the use of proxy measures for commercialization and collaboration. Coauthorship incompletely captures the full extent of collaborative research activities, which include training and tacit knowledge exchange (Katz and Martin, 1997Katz J.S. Martin B.R. Res. Policy. 1997; 26: 1-18Crossref Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). However, it is the most commonly used indicator for academic research activity, and especially appropriate for research that contributes knowledge promptly to the public domain. Similarly, patents were an appropriate proxy for commercialization activity because the filing of a patent application is an early and essential step in the commercialization process, and researchers involved in start-up companies had more patents. This study focuses solely on academic collaborations and future research is required to determine whether PIs involved in commercialization activities developed greater industry collaborations, which, in the long term, could lead to the more socially beneficial outcomes of clinical trials and therapies. However, SCN research, although moving toward those objectives, is still largely academic in cases where the major metrics for success are publications and strong research collaborations. Finally, our case study uses a Canadian SC research network. Nevertheless, given the well-characterized barriers to commercialization of cell-based therapies internationally (Giebel, 2005Giebel L.B. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Little et al., 2006Little M. Hall W. Orlandi A. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1188-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, Plagnol et al., 2009Plagnol A.C. Rowley E. Martin P. Livesay F. Future Medicine. 2009; 4: 549-559Google Scholar), and mid-sized economies with strong, networked, publicly funded stem cell research programs such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, our results may be applicable in other contexts, with the degree requiring further exploration. In conclusion, science researchers in the SCN exhibit a high degree of collaboration both nationally and internationally and many have significant international profiles. Collaboration patterns were best explained by institutional affiliation rather than broader geography; research quality (average number of citations) and quantity (number of publications); research area; and, not surprisingly, seniority. Most importantly, however, commercialization activity, measured by the number of patents, negatively impacted the degree of collaboration that results in published research. Thus, policies directed at enhancing collaborative networks and policies directed at commercialization are moderately antagonistic. The extent of this effect will depend on the degree to which one activity is emphasized over the other. Our finding has significant implications for the evolving field of SC research in which commercialization pressures and patenting activity are high (Bergman and Graff, 2007Bergman K. Graff G.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but future clinical application will depend on highly collaborative interdisciplinary research. Our findings speak to the importance of appropriate policies that balance incentives for interdisciplinary collaboration with commercialization and that enable a culture of sharing for data and bioresources in precompetitive research (Winickoff et al., 2009Winickoff D.E. Saha K. Graff G.D. Yale J. Health Policy Law Ethics. 2009; 9: 54-126Google Scholar, Schofield et al., 2009Schofield P.N. Bubela T. Weaver T. Portilla L. Brown S.D. Hancock J.M. Einhorn D.

We assessed this intervention's cost-effectiveness.A life-time Markov model was developed to estimate HIV cases prevented, changes in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs per additional quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY), comparing (in US$2,009) no intervention to a once-only and annual intervention. Future costs and health benefits were discounted annually at 3%. Sensitivity analyses evaluated model robustness. We found that for a hypothetical 1,000 FSWs receiving the once-only intervention, there were 33 HIV cases prevented and 5.7 months of QALE gained compared to no intervention. The additional cost per QALY gained was US$183. For FSWs receiving the intervention annually, there were 29 additional HIV cases prevented and 4.5 additional months of QALE compared to the once-only intervention. The additional cost per QALY was US$1,075. When highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was included in the model, the annual intervention strategy resulted in net savings and dominated both once-only and no intervention strategies, and remained robust across extensive sensitivity analyses. Even when considering clinical benefits from HAART, ignoring added costs, the cost per QALY gained remained below three times the Mexican GDP per capita, and below established cost-effectiveness thresholds.This brief intervention was shown to be cost-effective among FSWs in two Mexico-US border cities and may have application for FSWs in other resource-limited settings.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00338845."
https://openalex.org/W2005575818,"The multiprotein Mediator complex is an important regulator of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes in eukaryotic cells. In contrast to the situation in many other eukaryotes, the conserved Med15 protein is not a stable component of Mediator isolated from fission yeast. We here demonstrate that Med15 exists in a protein complex together with Hrp1, a CHD1 ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling protein. The Med15-Hrp1 subcomplex is not a component of the core Mediator complex but can interact with the L-Mediator conformation. Deletion of med15(+) and hrp1(+) causes very similar effects on global steady-state levels of mRNA, and genome-wide analyses demonstrate that Med15 associates with a distinct subset of Hrp1-bound gene promoters. Our findings therefore indicate that Mediator may directly influence histone density at regulated promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2019858400,"A conserved family of eukaryotic RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) initiates or amplifies the production of small RNAs to provide sequence specificity for gene regulation by Argonaute/Piwi proteins. RDR-dependent silencing processes affect the genotype-phenotype relationship in many eukaryotes, but the principles that underlie the specificity of RDR template selection and product synthesis are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the initiation specificity of the Tetrahymena RDR, Rdr1, as a heterologously expressed single subunit and in the context of its biologically assembled multisubunit complexes (RDRCs). Truncation analysis of recombinant Rdr1 revealed domain requirements different from those of the only other similarly characterized RDR, suggesting that there are subfamilies of the RDR enzyme with distinct structural requirements for activity. We demonstrate an apparently obligate Rdr1 mechanism of initiation in which the template end is looped to provide the hydroxyl group priming the synthesis of dsRNA. RDRC subunits with poly(U) polymerase activity can act on the template end prior to looping to increase the duplex length of product, thus impacting the small RNA sequences generated by the RDRC-coupled Dicer. Overall, our findings give new perspective on mechanisms of RDR initiation and demonstrate that non-RDR subunits of an RDRC can affect the specificity of product synthesis."
