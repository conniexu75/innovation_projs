https://openalex.org/W1525066480,"Abstract In experiments on isolated human erythrocyte membranes, cross-links between protein components have been produced both by the catalyzed oxidation of intrinsic sulfhydryl groups with the o-phenanthroline cupric ion complex and by reaction with dimethyl dithiobispropionimidate, a bisalkylimidate containing a disulfide linkage between the two reactive groups. The mixture of molecular species has been analyzed by a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis procedure in which the cross-links are split by reductive cleavage during an initial phase of the separation in the second dimension. Cross-linked complexes are recognized by the positions of the off-diagonal elements in the final pattern. Complexes apparently derived from stable oligomers of peptides of the same molecular weight have been found corresponding to many of the bands in the standard sodium dodecyl sulfate gel pattern. Heterocomplexes formed from peptides of different molecular weight have been tentatively identified in a few instances but are less common than oligomers from single bands. In addition cross-linking yields very high molecular weight complexes of spectrin and many of the lower molecular weight protein components of the membrane. The observed cross-linking patterns are consistent with the picture of transmembrane and cytoplasmic surface components anchored to the submembrane network of spectrin fibers. The cross-linking patterns of broken ghosts and intact cells treated with these membrane-permeable reagents are almost identical except for the addition of hemoglobin complexes in the latter."

https://openalex.org/W2019460535,"The mechanism of autogenous regulation, whereby a protein directly controls the expression of its own structural gene, is compared on the basis of function with the classical mechanism, in which the structural gene of the regulator is itself unregulated. The autogenous mechanism is superior to the classical one in inducible catabolic systems governed by a repressor; the opposite is true if the regulator is an activator."
https://openalex.org/W2036956674,"FEVER is considered to be a universal response of warm-blooded animals to endotoxins1. Although during a fever a mammal uses behavioural as well as physiological means to increase its body temperature2, it is not known whether fever develops in an animal such as a lizard which regulates its body temperature largely by behaviour. For example, the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) regulates its body temperature close to 38.5° C if placed in a chamber with a temperature gradient3. If this lizard is placed in a temperature chamber in which one end is heated to above the animal's lethal body temperature (50° C) and the other end is maintained at room temperature, the lizard regulates its temperature by moving back and forth between the two sides4. Under these conditions, one can determine its high and low set-points (Fig. 1). The central nervous control of temperature in an ectotherm, such as a lizard, and an endotherm, such as the rabbit, appears to be quite similar. For example, both possess a hypothalamus which is thermally sensitive5,6, and lesions in the posterior hypothalamus in both lizards4 and mammals7 lead to an inability to maintain a high body temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1527401893,"Abstract Prothrombin activation either by activated Factor X alone or by activated Factor X, Factor V, Phospholipid, and calcium ions results in the formation of the protease thrombin and, when thrombin proteolysis is prevented with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (iPr2P-F), a single activation fragment (Fragment 1.2) (Esmon, C. T., Owen, W. G., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 606–611). Of the two pathways which were proposed to account for these and other intermediate activation products, it is established by this report that the principal, if not exclusive, route of prothrombin conversion to thrombin by Factor Xa alone is [see PDF for equation] If thrombin action is permitted to occur, Fragment 1·2 is cleaved into two products, Fragment 1 and Fragment 2 as shown by Esmon et al. That this particular pathway is not in some unknown way dependent upon the presence of iPr2P-F was demonstrated by measuring the formation of Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 directly in the absence of iPr2P-F. These experiments were carried out by activating tritium-labeled prothrombin and determining the product distributions in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis gels under conditions in which thrombin action could be independently assessed. The necessary requirement for Intermediate 2 being on the direct pathway from prothrombin to thrombin, i.e. that the rate of Intermediate 2 activation be greater than or equal to that of prothrombin activation, was shown to be met. An attempt to demonstrate the existence of the alternative pathway which can account for Fragment 1·2, although not Intermediate 2, was also made but no evidence for its existence or contribution to the Factor Xa-catalyzed activation process was found."

https://openalex.org/W1581909905,"Abstract The binding affinity to hemoglobin of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, ATP, and some other phosphorylated red cell metabolites has been measured at pH 7.2 in 0.12 m KCl to simulate physiological conditions. The dissociation constant with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is independent of hemoglobin concentration in the range 0.06 to 4 mm. There is one binding site per deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Phosphorylated compounds bind weakly to one site per tetramer of oxyhemoglobin. Dissociation constants determined for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate are 4.22 x 10-5 m at 22° and 1.03 x 10-4 m at 37° with deoxyhemoglobin and ∼2.5 x 10-3 m at 22° and 4.75 x 10-3 m at 37° with oxyhemoglobin. Dissociation constants for ATP are 8.54 x 10-5 m at 25° with deoxyhemoglobin and 2.55 x 10-3 m for oxyhemoglobin at 25°. Binding to ADP, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glucose-1,6-P2 was measured. The dissociation constant for magnesium complexes of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to deoxyhemoglobin was too weak to measure (g 10-3 m at 37°); magnesium complexes of ATP have an apparent dissociation constant of 1.15 x 10-3 m at 25°. The effects of the differential binding of cellular intermediates on red cell glycolysis and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1568839463,"Abstract As shown previously for activated Factor X and Ca2+ alone, (Esmon, C. T., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 7782–7790) prothrombin activation by activated Factor X and Ca2+ in the presence of phospholipid also proceeds via Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2, i.e. [see PDF for equation] Unless rapidly inactivated, thrombin cleaves Fragment 1·2 into two smaller activation products, i.e. Fragment 1·2 (Thrombin)/→ Fragment 1 + Fragment 2 2) The direct and concomitant formation of Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 was demonstrated by activating prothrombin in the presence of iPr2P-F. In the absence of this inhibitor, thrombin, in addition to catalyzing the reaction of Equation 2, cleaves Fragment 1 from prothrombin and in so doing eliminates the possibility of observing phospholipid catalysis from all but the earliest stages of reaction (Gitel, S. N., Owen, W. G., Esmon, C. T., and Jackson, C. M. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1344–1348). The reaction of Equation 1 was shown to occur independent of any special effect of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (iPr2P-F) by a direct demonstration of Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 formation from tritium-labeled prothrombin. Both the formation of Intermediate 2 and its conversion to thrombin are accelerated by phospholipid. However, in the presence of phospholipid, Intermediate 2 was found to satisfy the necessary condition for an intermediate on a sequential activation path, i.e. that its rate of conversion to thrombin be greater than or equal to the rate of prothrombin conversion to thrombin, if and only if, Fragment 1·2 were also present in the activation mixture. In view of this observation, the true activation intermediate of the phospholipid-catalyzed pathway must consist of both Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2. Fragment 1 plus Fragment 2 was not able to substitute for Fragment 1·2. Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 were demonstrated to associate noncovalently to form a product with gel electrophoretic properties indistinguishable from those of prothrombin. This association of Fragment 1·2 with Intermediate 2 apparently provides the mechanism by which Intermediate 2 can be retained on the phospholipid surface and thus be readily accessible to the activated Factor X for the final proteolysis which is required to form thrombin. An alternative prothrombin activation pathway which maintains the integrity of the Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 portions of the prothrombin molecule during the two-step activation process was proposed previously (Esmon, C. T., Owen, W. G., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 606–611). No unambiguous evidence for the existence of the alternative activation route could be demonstrated and thus the reactions of Equation 1 appear to describe the principal, if not exclusive, pathway of prothrombin activation by Factor Xa, phospholipid, and Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1505007136,"Abstract Human erythrocyte ghosts were chemically cross-linked with a family of bifunctional cross-linking reagents, imidoesters. Since the reagents are identical in their chemical structures, except for the number of methylene groups, they differ by that distance between the functional groups. The maximum distance is 4.9 A in dimethyl malonimidate, 6.1 A in dimethyl succinimidate, 8.6 A in dimethyl adipimidate, and 11 A in dimethyl suberimidate. Cross-linked membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids were solubilized in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and analyzed by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. After cross-linking, two prominent new bands of cross-linked products, GP-A and GP-B, appeared. Cross-linking of the new bands was dependent on the length of the reagents. GP-A could be produced by all of the reagents, but GP-B only by dimethyl adipimidate (8.6 A) and dimethyl suberimidate (11 A). In our previous report, GP-A was shown to be a complex of two species of the glycoproteins. In this study, it is shown that the glycolipids and proteins are components of GP-B. The conclusion is based on the following observations. (a) The GP-B formation was dependent on the distance between the functional groups of the reagents. (b) GP-B could not be produced by reacting the ghosts with methyl butyroimidate, a monofunctional analogue of dimethyl adipimidate. (c) GP-B could be stained by periodate-Schiff's reagent and by Coomassie brilliant blue. (d) Cleavage of the cross-links in GP-B by ammonolysis produced three protein bands and a lipid band which was positive to periodate-Schiff's reagent. (e) The cleaved protein bands could be stained by Coomassie brilliant blue and not by periodate-Schiff's reagent. (f) Synthetic aminophospholipids and trilinolein could not be stained by periodate-Schiff's reagent. (g) When ghosts were prepared from erythrocytes which were labeled with tritium (catalyzed by galactose oxidase), GP-B also appeared to be labeled. (h) Upon cleavage of labeled GP-B, most of the label was found in the lipids and not in the proteins. (i) GP-B was not labeled when erythrocytes were labeled without galactose oxidase treatment. The cross-links of the glycolipids and the proteins suggest possible specific association between them. The following observations substantiate the premise. (a) The glycolipids and the proteins always exhibited an identical electrophoretic mobility, regardless of the acrylamide concentration in the gel. Two different molecules having an identical electrophoretic mobility on a gel can be separated on another gel of a different acrylamide concentration. In particular, this has been successful in the case of one molecule which has a significantly higher carbohydrate content than the other. (b) Purified bovine glycolipids could be cross-linked with one another but the apparent particle size was significantly smaller than that of GP-B. (c) Diphenyl succinimidate (6.1 A) could cross-link the glycolipids but not the proteins in the membrane. (d) The relative surface charge density of the glycolipids and the proteins in GP-B was the same, which was distinctively different from that of the cleaved proteins Such specific associations may be a possible way to control lateral movement of the glycolipids which carry the blood group-specific antigens and are receptors for other extrinsic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1534283098,"Abstract Previous studies from our laboratory have resulted in the separation of two major forms of plasminogen from rabbit plasma. These two forms differ in their affinity characteristics for antifibrinolytic amino acids, metabolic survival times in the circulation, charge characteristics of the subforms resolved from each major form, and sialic acid content. In order to investigate the role of sialic acid in determining these distinct properties of the plasminogen forms, we have studied these same properties of the asialo rabbit plasminogen forms. We find that the charge differences between the two forms are essentially abolished upon removal of the sialic acid. The number of subforms resolved from each major form is decreased as an effect of removal of the sialic acid, but the remaining subforms possess greatly increased isoelectric points. Contrarily, the binding of each plasminogen to antifibrinolytic amino acids appears no different from normal. The metabolic survival times of the asialoplasminogen forms are not greatly different from each other but are significantly lower than normal, a phenomena also found for many other circulating proteins. These studies suggest that the charge differences between the two forms of rabbit plasminogen are incidental to their functional differences."

During a scanning electron microscope study of the sporogonic cycle of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in the vector Anopheles stephensi, evidence has been obtained which suggests that excystment of the sporozoite may occur by a method differing from both those described above."

https://openalex.org/W1484351571,"Abstract An artificial hybrid hemoglobin, α(Meso)β(Proto), the α and β subunits of which contain meso- and protohemes, respectively, and its complementary hybrid, α(Proto)β(Meso), were prepared. These hybrid hemoglobins are indistinguishable from native protohemoglobin and artificial mesohemoglobin in terms of electrophoretic and molecular sieving characteristics. The visible absorption spectra of the hybrid hemoglobins show minor differences between them as well as from those of an equimolar mixture of proto- and mesohemoglobins. The Hill plot of the absorbance changes upon oxygenation of α(Proto)β(Meso) are independent of measuring wavelengths and give identical oxygenation parameters for the protoheme-containing α subunits and the mesoheme-containing β subunits. On the other hand, the Hill plot of the absorbance changes upon oxygenation of α(Meso)β(Proto) is dependent on measuring wavelengths as that of an equimolar mixture of proto- and mesohemoglobins. A method has been devised to calculate individual oxygenation parameters for the mesoheme-containing α subunits and the protoheme-containing β subunits in α(Meso)β(Proto). The comparison of the oxygenation parameters of the hybrids with those of proto- and mesohemoglobins suggests that the intricate intersubunit contacts which exist in the highly cooperative protohemoglobin may have been perturbed by the partial and complete substitutions of the prosthetic groups with mesoheme for protoheme."

https://openalex.org/W1670649069,"Abstract When cells of Acanthamoeba castellanii (Neff) are placed on a salts medium the amoebas encyst with the formation of a cellulose-containing cyst wall and an in vitro system synthesizing cellulose from UDP-glucose becomes detectable after about 12 hours of encystment. In the present study cellular levels of UDP-glucose were observed to increase 5-fold within 5 hours of the induction of encystment and to remain at elevated levels for 5 to 10 hours, apparently making UDP-glucose available to the cells at the time of cellulose synthesis. The increased level of UDP-glucose during encystment is not the reflection of an increase in uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase activity detectable in vitro. The specific activity and the activity per cell were examined as a function of development in cell extracts. The specific activity was constant for the first 20 hours of encystment while the activity per cell decreased almost from the beginning of encystment. The uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9) from trophozoites was purified to homogeneity as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme (final specific activity 15,833 units per mg) was highly specific for both UTP and UDP-glucose. The divalent cation requirement was most readily satisfied by magnesium and the pH optimum was 8 to 9 in the direction of UDP-glucose synthesis and 7.5 to 7.6 in the direction of pyrophosphorolysis. The enzyme was characterized kinetically as having an ordered mechanism of catalysis. Pyrophosphorylase was subject to product inhibition by UTP and pyrophosphate. The following Km values were obtained: UTP, 5.8 x 10-5 m; glucose 1-phosphate, 1.4 x 10-4 m; UDP-glucose, 5.0 x 10-5 m; pyrophosphate, 2.4 x 10-3 m."

https://openalex.org/W1500017623,"Abstract As part of an ongoing survey, the early time region of hemoglobin's hydrogen exchange curve was studied to find hydrogens that respond to allosteric structure change. A difference hydrogen exchange method, previously designed for this kind of study, was used. Among the approximately 25 hydrogens per subunit studied, 7 respond to ligand binding by accelerating 14-fold in exchange rate; the remainder are ligand-indifferent. The responsive hydrogens form a first order kinetic class in both liganded and deoxyhemoglobin, and this gives further support to the breathing picture of hydrogen exchange. The increase in exchange rate observed indicates that the segment holding these hydrogens experiences a net structural free energy change worth +1.5 Cal in the allosteric transition."
