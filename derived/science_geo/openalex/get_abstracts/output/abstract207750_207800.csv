This product is believed to be a C-4,5-unsaturated oli-gouronide. The preferred substrate is polygalacturonic acid rather than pectin; the enzyme, provisionally named polygalacturonic-trans-eliminase, is activated by calcium."

These investigations have been facilitated by the introduction of autoradiographic techniques and the use of tritium-labelled thymidine. This is incorporated specifically by the nuclei of cells in pre-mitosis, at which time synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is occurring3."

https://openalex.org/W1994350379,"When measured simultaneously, selenium-75 selenomethionine accumulated identically with sulfur-35 methionine across everted hamster intestinal sacs in the presence of carrier methionine. The apparent Km for L-methionine transport was 0.8 × 10-3 M, as calculated from the beta emissions of S35-methionine or the gamma emissions of Se75-selenomethionine. Absorption of Se75-selenomethionine from the gastrointestinal tract of man also occurred, with peak blood levels being reached in about 3 hours. Because of the 122-day half-life of selenium-75 and its multiple gamma emissions, Se75-selenomethionine may serve as a tool in evaluating amino-acid absorption."

Because of the possible implication of oxidative metabolism, in resistance phenomena, the nature of the enzymes involved was examined. Our attention was directed to the pentose phosphate cycle enzymes as alterations in their activities were recently reported to occur in host tissues infected by fungal pathogens2,3. Isotope investigations also suggested an increased in vivo role of the pentose phosphate cycle in these hosts4,5. Virus diseases have not been investigated from this point of view so far, although the host–virus systems offer distinct advantages; the direct contribution of the pathogen to the enzymatic changes occurring in the host was in this way excluded."

https://openalex.org/W2084429507,"MITOCHONDRIA of the intestinal mucosa of the following vertebrates have been examined by electron microscopy: the rat (Rattus norvegicus), guinea pig (Cavia percellus), chicken (Gallus domesticus), lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), toad (Bufo marinus) and carp (Carassius auratus) (Fig. 1). The mitochondria in the intestinal cells of these species showed no major differences in structure from the other mitochondria that have already been described1,2. The intestinal mitochondria from all these species swelled when they were isolated by differential centrifugation in 0.25 M sucrose (Fig. 2), but all except those from the rat exhibited considerable succinoxidase activity as measured manometrically (Table 1). The oxygen uptake of homogenates of the intestinal mucosa of rats was also low and variable compared with that of homogenates of intestinal mucosa prepared from guinea pigs. In contrast, the oxygen uptake (per mgm. dry weight) of whole intestinal cells of both the rat and the guinea pig was similar."

This difference is seen only with certain group O sera, it is independent of complement, and it may be eliminated by absorption of the serum with A or B erythrocytes. The phenomenon is most likely the result of steric inhibition of smaller, cross-reactive antibodies in the aggregative system."

With the brighter white surround there appeared peaks at 550, and 570 and a shoulder at 600 mμ. These were selectively eliminated by the spectral surrounds."

The methods used have been described in our previous publications. Table 1 gives the results obtained in nine experiments on nine different prostatic fluids. The results are expressed as a percentage of a calculated initial value of 100. As compared with the original values, incubation in the absence of calcium ions resulted in little inactivation (mean 11.4) while, in the presence of calcium ions, inactivation amounted to a mean value of 52.6 per cent. When the concentration of calcium ions was increased to 12–18 mgm. per cent, inactivation was increased to a mean value of 81.9 per cent."

In addition to modifying a morphogenetic system responsible for the formation of ocelli and bristles, it also modifies another morphogenetic system determining the positions of these structures, at the extreme range of the mutant expression."
