https://openalex.org/W2091626713,"Two generalizations of the simple binomial distribution are common in statistical text-books, one due to W. Lexis and the other to S. D. Poisson. Lexis considered the case in which the probability of an event occurring, p, is constant in the N trials of one experiment, but varies among several such experiments. He showed that the mean and variance of the resulting binomial distribution are Np̄ and N(p̄ q̄ + N(N–1) V (p, where p̄ = 1–q̄ is the mean, and V(p) the variance, of p between experiments. The variance thus exceeds that of the simple binomial distribution with the same mean. Poisson considered the case in which p takes the value p i at the ith trial in each experiment, and showed that the mean and variance of the resulting distribution are N p̄ and N p̄ q̄ – NV′(p), where V′(p) is the variance of p within experiments."

The interiors of cells of Avena, Pisum, and Zea seedling tissues all have potentials of about -80 to -115 mv relative to that of an external solution of 0.1 mmole of KCl per liter, bathing the tissue. The potential difference of Avena coleoptiles varies with the concentration of external KCl and is depressed by 2,4-dinitrophenol. The potential difference occurs between the cytoplasmic layer and the exterior; the potential of the vacuole does not appear to be significantly different from that of the cytoplasm. Obviously a relatively large cation accumulation ratio could be accounted for in plant cells by this large potential without invoking a chemical cation transport scheme."

In this situation longterm regulation of water intake occurs in normal rats and in the rat with diabetes insipidus. Under special circumstances, a remarkable degree of excess intake can be produced."

https://openalex.org/W2420372004,"The products of the metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine are of interest not only because of their possible physiological importance but also because of their pathological potentialities. Although the oxidation of the ethylamine portion of the molecule has been extensively investigated (1) only suggestions have been made concerning oxidation of the indole nucleus: Dalgliesh (2) has proposed that 5-hydroxytryptamine may be metabolized to a substance of enhanced physiological activity, e.g. 5,6or 4,5-dihydroxytryptamine; and Udenfriend et al. (1) have suggested that melanin-like pigments may be derived from tryptophan by way of a 5,6-dihydroxyindole. McIsaac and Page (3) have found in the urine of rabbits and rats given radioactive 5-hydroxytryptamine a minor metabolite, provisionally identified as an oxidation product and diagrammatically represented as an o-dihydroxytryptamine; apparently the same compound, referred to only as a hydroxyindole, was found in liver tumor tissue and in the urine of a patient who had the carcinoid syndrome associated with a malignant bronchial adenoma (4). As a part of a general investigation of the properties of 5-hydroxytryptamine related to its histochemistry (5) and its participation in some pathologic processes (6) we have studied the oxidation products formed from this substance by a serum enzyme, by molecular oxygen, and by silver ion. The latter was used because it readily oxidizes 5-hydroxytryptamine histochemically. The following is a report of our studies of the oxidation products formed by the two inorganic reagents, and includes the isolation and partial characterization of a dimer of 5-hydroxytryptamine identical in chromatographic mobility and color reactions with one of the products observed in the oxidation of 5-hydroxytryptamine by the action of a human serum oxidase (7) .I"

It has been established in some cases that coenzymes and prosthetic groups have a protecting and stabilizing effect on the protein molecule. It is known that the large molecule of D-glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGAD) (molecular weight 140,000) is labile, and does not contain disulphide linkages as stabilizing bonds1."

https://openalex.org/W2039680785,"THE observation by Aiyar et al. 1 that thyrotoxicosis in the rat is accompanied by an increase in liver ubiquinone prompts us to record our own related findings. We have investigated the effect of thyroxine and 2,4-dinitrophenol on both ubiquinone and ubichromenol-levels in the rat, using animals from a stock colony and also from a vitamin-E deficient colony. Female rats were used, aged 3–4 months in one experiment and aged 15 months in another. The animals were divided into groups of six, and test groups received thyroxine, thyroxine and α-tocopheryl acetate, or 2,4-dinitrophenol. After three weeks on test, the rats were killed, and their hearts and livers (each organ pooled with others from the same group) were analysed for ubiquinone and ubichromenol by the method of Diplock et al. 2. The results are given in Table 1, the figures for ubiquinone and ubichromenol representing the total isoprenologue content3 in each case."

Erythrocytes coupled to penicillin T by means of bis-diazotized-benzidine constitute the ""antigen"" used to measure the antipenicillin antibody. The hemagglutination reaction is highly specific. as indicated by hemagglutination-inhibition studies. The clinical significance of these antibodies remains to be elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1978360104,"Three acyclic decapeptide analogs of gramicidin S, although found to possess antibacterial activity, apparently have modes of action which differ from that of the naturally occurring cyclic antibiotic. In contrast to the immediate action of gramicidin S, one of the decapeptides produced complete bacteriostasis only after several cell divisions had occurred. Furthermore, mixtures of gramicidin S with either of two of the acyclic peptides were synergistic. Some implications of these findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2033940038,"DURING desalting in an electrolytic desalter (Shandon Scientific Co. Ltd., London) of urines from kwashiorkor patients, it was observed that a considerable amount of a black mercury amalgam was invariably formed. Estimation of the concentration of ammonia in these urines confirmed that the amalgam formation was due to a high ammonia content. This was in agreement with a report made earlier by Platt and Heard that ammonia excretion was increased in protein malnutrition. It was suspected at the time that this increased ammonia output may be the result of an acidification defect due to reduced hydrogen ion excretion by the renal tubules or else to the excretion of increased amounts of organic acids. Afterwards, while measuring serum transaminase-levels by the spectrophotometric method1 it was noted that on the addition of malic or lactic dehydrogenase and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide to the buffered serum, the specimens from cases of kwashiorkor consumed more reduced diphosphopydrine nuleotide than normal serum. In many instances more than 30 min. were required to produce equilibrium conditions and in most cases extra reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide would have to be added in order to produce a steady state and a high enough initial spectrophotometric reading. With normal serum on the other hand, equilibrium was usually attained in less than 10 min. and it is unusual for extra reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide to be required. This observation pointed to the probability that ketoacids which are substrates for malic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase must accumulate in the blood in kwashiorkor."

Seedling mutations were induced in high amounts with all doses, but other biological effects in the treated generation including delayed germination, chlorophyll-deficiency sectoring in the first true leaves, and failure of plants to bear fruit, were found only with the highest concentration. Neither a lethal nor a partially lethal dose was applied."

https://openalex.org/W1990364471,"IN the course of the isolation of aldosterone from adrenal gland extracts (‘Eucortone’, Allen and Hanbury), the English authors detected a compound with properties similar to aldosterone in certain paper and column partition systems. This compound had ultra-violet absorption peaks at about 230 mµ and 280 mµ, and gave a positive reaction with the FeCl3–K3Fe(CN)6reagent. It therefore seemed probable that it was phenolic1. It also gave a blue fluorescence on irradiation with ultra-violet (compound X)2 and reduced blue tetrazolium at about the same rate as steroids having an α-ketol side chain. The compound ran as though slightly more polar than aldosterone in the Bush B5 paper system3 and could be completely separated from the steroid by column chromatography using the same solvent system2."
