https://openalex.org/W2013239605,"A discrete, ascending fiber system that supplies the hypothalamus with most of its noradrenergic terminals was destroyed at midbrain level, both electrolytically and with local injections of 6-hydroxydopamine, a destructive agent specific for catecholaminergic neurons. The result was hyperphagia leading to obesity. Fluorescence histochemical analysis showed that loss of noradrenergic terminals in ventral bundle termination areas such as the hypothalamus was necessary for hyperphagia. Damage to dorsal bundle or dopaminergic projections was not. Prior treatment with desmethylimipramine to selectively block uptake of 6-hydroxydopamine into noradrenergic neurons prevented both hyperphagia and loss of norepinephrine fluorescence. The lesions that produced hyperphagia also reduced the potency of d-amphetamine as an appetite suppressant. It is concluded that this noradrenergic bundle normally mediates suppression of feeding, thereby influences body weight, and serves as a substrate for d-amphetamine-induced loss of appetite."

https://openalex.org/W2070899432,"Bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate is an allosteric inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, and bromodeoxyuridine can therefore kill cells by starving them for deoxycytidine nucleotides. The toxicity of bromodeoxyuridine for some cell lines is reduced many fold when deoxycytidine is also present. For example, wild type 3T6 cells can be grown serially in 1.5 × 10−4 Molar bromodeoxyuridine and 2 × 10−4 Molar deoxycytidine, remain healthy, and incorporate bromodeoxyuridine extensively into cellular DNA. Some of the numerous effects of this drug on the behavior of cells and viruses may be due to a deoxycytidineless state, rather than to the incorporation of the bromodeoxyuridine into DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2087583196,The intracellular translocation of melanin granules within both epidermal and dermal melanocytes of Rana pipiens is influenced by cytochalasin B. Cytochalasin B prevents dispersion of pigment granules by melanocytestimulating hormone (MSH) and causes centripetal movement of pigment granules that have been dispersed by MSH. Microfilaments are abundant in the dendritic processes of epidermal melanocytes in which pigment granules have been dispersed by MSH. Microfilaments are dramatically reduced in number in the processes of melanocytes that have been lightened by cytochalasin B. These observations suggest that microfilaments mediate dispersion of pigment granules.
https://openalex.org/W2011056764,"Rabbit antiserums were produced against the procollagen molecule secreted into the medium of cultured human skin fibroblasts. The isolated antigenic, amino terminal portion of the procollagen molecule was purified, labeled with iodine-125, and used in a radioimmunoassay which detected nanogram quantities of the same antigen. With the assay, immunologically identical molecules were detected in the culture mediumn of different strains of human fibroblasts and in normal human serums. Serumns from human cord blood contained a 12-fold higher concentration of the antigen than serums from adults, while serums other vertebrates gave reactions to incomplete cross-reactivity or non-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2071285660,"The responsiveness of the pineal beta-adrenergic receptor that regulates serotonin-N-acetyltransferase activity is nearly ten times greater at the end of the light period (0600 to 1800 hours) than at the end of the dark period (1800 to 0600 hours). These changes in sensitivity of the postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor are related to diurnal changes in the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves innervating the pineal. Supersensitivity of the receptor appears to result from decreased release of the neurotransmitter during daytime, and subsensitivity from increased release at night."
https://openalex.org/W1576691581,"Abstract Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was isolated and partially purified from nuclei from white blood cells of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The terminal transferase has a sedimentation value of 3.4 S, a pH optimum of 7.5, a Mn2+ optimum of 0.1 mm, and a Mg2+ optimum of 5 to 7 mm. The purified enzyme efficiently utilizes a number of DNA primers but not RNA primers. The presence of this enzyme in human myelogenous leukemic cells suggests that its presence may be associated with a particular stage of the disease rather than being specific for a particular form of leukemia or for thymic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006176193,"The sexual behavior of mice of various genotypes has been studied in our stock in which X-linked genes, Tfm and (Ohv), as well as an autosomal dominant gene, Sxr, are maintained. Since the absence of neonatal imprinting in Tfm (Ohv)/Y leads to no sexual behavior, we conclude that neonatal imprinting is the prerequisite for feminization as well as masculinization of the central nervous system. Since individual components of sexual behavior may become feminine or absent instead of being masculine in sex-reversed Tfm (Ohv)/+(O+, Sxr/+♂ with mosaic brains, we conclude that neonatal imprinting directly involves individual neurons, and that different degrees of imprinting by the same agent lead to masculinization or feminization. In accordance with recent views, we believe estradiol to be this imprinting agent. We envisage the role of the Tfm locus in the central nervous system as follows: within individual neurons for sexual behavior, the synthesis of aromatizing enzymes is normally inducible by androgens; these enzymes are therefore noninducible in Tfm (Ohv)/Y. In normal neonates, exposure to testosterone leads to the induced intracellular conversion of testosterone to estradiol, self imprinting by estradiol causing masculinization. Feminization may normally be due to the direct exposure of these neurons to a low circulating concentration of estradiol. An alternative explanation might be that the estradiol-receptor protein in these neurons also is normally inducible by testosterone. In this case, neonatally testosterone-exposed neurons would become inherently more responsive to estradiol than neonatally estradiol-exposed neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1659574653,"A vitamin B12-binding protein has been isolated from human granulocytes derived from patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Utilizing affinity chromatography as the sole purification technique, the protein was purified 9,860-fold with a yield of over 90% and was homogeneous based on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein binds 34.9 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein and has a single vitamin B12-binding site. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was 56,000, whereas that determined by amino acid and carbohydrate analysis was 58,200. The protein contains 33% carbohydrate which accounts for the elevated molecular weight values (121,000 to 138,000) obtained using gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1984660815,"Mammalian cells can grow in culture at very low glucose concentrations. They can also grow using starch or maltose as secondary sources of glucose if hydrolytic enzymes (amylase and/or maltase) are available to release the glucose. The serum supplement in the culture medium provides these enzymes in amount adequate to permit growth at as rapid a rate as when free glucose is added. Owing to the relatively slow liberation of glucose from the secondary sources, the cells produce less lactic acid, and the culture medium does not become acidic. If the amount of hydrolytic enzyme in the serum supplement is reduced by heat inactivation, the rate of glucose liberation is further reduced. As a result, glucose continues to be released into the medium even at high cell densities, when all glucose added directly to control cultures has been consumed at a time. For this reason, the cells survive longer at high density on secondary glucose sources than on free glucose. Use of such a culture system should have important practical advantages in maintaining dense cultures of any mammalian cell type. Medium containing secondary glucose sources and serum whose hydrolytic enzymes have been completely inactivated should be a selective medium for the corresponding cellular enzymes. Attempts to select for cell lines able to grow using their own amylase or maltase were not successful, but calculations based on embryonic pancreatic cells, known to synthesize amylase, showed that the amount of enzyme required should be quite low in comparison with that present in the differentiated state. The possibilities of selection for a differentiated function in cell culture have been very little explored, and such an approach may be fruitful if applied to the right cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2007044579,"Studies on the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities present in Chinese Hamster Kidney Cells have revealed an enzyme inhibited only by high concentrations of α-amanitin that corresponds to the previously described RNA polymerase C. Although primarily isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction derived from these cells, evidence is presented which strongly suggests that RNA polymerase C and the nuclear RNA polymerase III are one and the same enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2011055457,"Soluble antigen was extracted with hypertonic (3 molar) potassium chloride from the malignant cells of seven patients with acute leukemia. The antigen and leukemia cells were used to stimulate autologous patients' and allogeneic normal donors' lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The lymphocytes of six patients showed significant blastogenic responses to autologous antigen. In contrast, the lymphocytes of only one of seven normal donors responded to the soluble antigens. Both patients' and normal subjects' lymphocytes responded to the intact leukemia cells. The use of these antigens should facilitate the study of specific tumor immunity in human leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2048406598,"Fresh frozen sections of mature skeletal muscle fibers from patients with genetically determined ""absence"" of skeletal muscle phosphorylase (McArdle's disease) have no histochemical phosphorylase activity. That regenerating muscle fibers, in vitro and in vivo, from such patients do have histochemical phosphorylase activity present suggests a loss of enzyme activity with fiber maturity."

This enzyme system, which metabolizes cholesterol-5alpha,6alpha-epoxide (a known carcinogen), appears to be substrateinducible and is apparently responsible for the concomitant reduction of the sterol carcinogen that occurs prior to tumor induction."

https://openalex.org/W1485265521,"Tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides were isolated from reduced and S-carboxymethylated bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and maleylated tryptic peptides were isolated from the individual cyanogen bromide fragments. Based upon end group analyses of the intact protein and the yields and partial sequence analyses of these peptides, a partial sequence of the enzyme was deduced. From these data it was concluded that the 2 subunits of bovine dismutase appear to be chemically identical. Each subunit is acetylated at the NH2 terminus, has lysine at the COOH terminus, and contains no tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1489654068,"Abstract DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was determined in isolated tadpole liver nuclei. RNA polymerase I and II activities could be differentiated in situ by the use of α-amanitin. The nuclear RNA polymerases were shown to respond to Mn2+ and Mg2+ in a manner similar to that reported for the same enzymes from other eukaryotes and revealed a biphasic activity curve in the presence of increased ammonium sulfate concentration. It was shown that the two peaks of activity were the result of different optimal activities in the presence of ammonium sulfate of RNA polymerase I (50 mm) and of RNA polymerase II (300 mm). The nearest neighbor and base composition analyses revealed a marked change in the ratio of AMP + UMP: GMP + CMP when the isolated nuclei were assayed in the presence of α-amanitin. While the rate of RNA synthesis with isolated nuclei was nonlinear, this appeared not to be the result of RNA polymerase inactivation or of degradation of the product by ribonuclease. Thyroxine administration, either by injection or immersion of tadpoles, caused marked stimulation of both RNA polymerases I and II. The increases in activities of both enzymes were not detectable until at least 4 days after tadpole immersion in 2.0 x 10-8m thyroxine. An increase in mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthetase paralleled that of the RNA polymerases. There was no significant time lag between the increase in RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, and carbamyl phosphate synthetase activities. The increase in RNA polymerase activities was also observed during natural metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W1563405220,"Abstract The synthesis of the duplex block polymer d(C15A15)· d(T15G15) is described. The synthesis was achieved by a series of enzymatic steps utilizing pancreatic DNase, calf thymus terminal transferase and T4 DNA polymerase. Analytical and preparative gel electrophoresis techniques, which resolved individual oligonucleotides according to chain length up to the 50 mer, were indispensable for the synthesis. The molecule was synthesized with [14C]dAMP in the d(C15A15) strand and [3H]dGMP in the d(T15G15) strand. In conjunction with gel electrophoresis, this permitted evaluation of product size and homogeneity. The ultraviolet absorbance and circular dichroism of the block polymer were in agreement with the averaged and additive spectra of d(A)n·d(T)n and d(G)n·d(C)n. The block polymer also was characterized by sedimentation in analytical and preparative centrifugation studies."

This enzyme closely resembles that extracted from the thymus of mice with lymphoma or lymphatic leukemia, both in its electrophoretic mobility and its substrate specificity. The phosphatase N activity was related to the clinical state of patients with lymphatic leukemia and disappeared with recovery from infectious mononucleosis."

These results suggest that (i) anemia is an effective stress for triggering myelogenous leukemia in animals that are predisposed to the disease, (ii) the RF mouse is ""naturally"" prone to the development of myelogenous leukemia, and (iii) the concept of two-step de novo induction of myelogenous leukemia appears to be applicable in this animal."

The increase is not, induced by adenosine triphosphate, it appears to be hormone-specific, and it is sensitive to puromycin and actinomycin D. These data suggest that the mitochondrial DNA may be involved in mediating the action of luteinizing hormone in amphibian steroidogenesis."

This phase of haemoglobin formation seems4,6 to reflect a previous covert differentiation of erythroid-progenitor cells distinct from pre-existing erythropoietic cells which form small quantities of haemoglobin as early as the primitive streak stage of development—after about 20 h incubation5."

https://openalex.org/W1483741797,"Pyridoxal-PO4 binds to pepsinogen in a reaction in which the stoichiometry is highly dependent on the conformation of the protein. When pepsinogen is in its native conformation, pyridoxal-PO4 forms Schiff bases with the α-NH2 group of Leu1 and the e-NH2 group of Lys358. When the protein is mildly denatured and assumes a more extended conformation, pyridoxal-PO4 can react with the e-NH2 groups of approximately 3 other lysine residues present in the NH2-terminal region of the pepsinogen molecule. Pepsinogen with pyridoxal-PO4 covalently attached at Leu1 and Lys358 by reduction of the protein-pyridoxal-PO4 Schiff bases can be activated to pepsin. This modified pepsin, which has a pyridoxal-PO4 molecule covalently attached to the e-NH2 group of its sole lysine residue, cannot be distinguished catalytically from the unmodified enzyme. As soon as 1 or 2 of the lysine residues in the NH2-terminal region of pepsinogen become modified with pyridoxal-PO4, the zymogen can no longer be activated, possibly because the protein cannot assume the proper conformation required for activation. No pattern to the sequence of pyridoxal-PO4 incorporation into pepsinogen was observed after the first 2 pyridoxal-PO4 molecules were incorporated. The lysine residues showing the greatest reactivity toward pyridoxal-PO4 other than Lys358 were found in regions of the NH2 terminus in which the density of basic amino acids was highest."
