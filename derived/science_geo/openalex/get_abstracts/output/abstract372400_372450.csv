Most past calculations of this type have considered only the radiative forcing of the specific emission and its atmospheric lifetime. Shindell et al. (p. 716 ; see the Perspectives by Arneth et al. and by Parrish and Zhu ) use sophisticated atmospheric chemical and climate modeling to determine how gas-aerosol interactions affect the radiative properties of the atmosphere, finding significant departures from the standard method for emissions of methane, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. These findings should help to optimize strategies for mitigating global warming by reducing anthropogenic emissions."

To understand this phenomenon, we passaged virus in mice immunized with influenza vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies selected mutants with single-amino acid hemagglutinin substitutions that increased virus binding to cell surface glycan receptors. Passaging these high-avidity binding mutants in naïve mice, but not immune mice, selected for additional hemagglutinin substitutions that decreased cellular receptor binding avidity. Analyzing a panel of monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin escape mutants revealed a positive correlation between receptor binding avidity and escape from polyclonal antibodies. We propose that in response to variation in neutralizing antibody pressure between individuals, influenza A virus evolves by adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid substitutions throughout the hemagglutinin globular domain, many of which simultaneously alter antigenicity."

Borgerhoff Mulder et al. (p. 682 ; see the Perspective by Acemoglu and Robinson ) build a bare-bones model describing the intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth—based on social networks, land and livestock, and physical and cognitive capacity—in four types of small-scale societies in which livelihoods depended primarily on hunting, herding, farming, or horticulture. Parameter estimates from a large-scale analysis of historical and ethnographic data were added to the model to reveal that the four types of societies display distinctive patterns of wealth transmission and that these patterns are associated with different extents of inequality."
https://openalex.org/W1969079562,"Of Ancient Iron and Oxygen Finding clues to understand the early evolution of ocean and atmospheric chemistry and its links to the evolution of life remains a daunting task. Often just a few rock samples provide our only evidence of what conditions on Earth were like long ago. Reinhard et al. (p. 713 ) combined iron speciation data from a 2.5-billion-year-old shale from Australia with sulfur isotope data from this and nearby formations to conclude that oxygen chemistry predominanty consisted of an anoxic sulfide–rich water column, instead of iron-rich oceans, as previously speculated. Thus, brief pulses of reduced iron from hydrothermal vents may have been responsible for the formation of nearby banded iron formations and may have provided enough buffering to prolong the appearance of atmospheric oxygen generated by the expansion of newly evolved cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2086469250,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent anti-tumor drug known to cause heart failure. The transcription factor GATA4 antagonizes DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the protective mechanism remains obscure. Autophagy is the primary cellular pathway for lysosomal degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, and its activation could be either protective or detrimental depending on specific pathophysiological conditions. Here we investigated the ability of GATA4 to inhibit autophagy as a potential mechanism underlying its protection against DOX toxicity in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. DOX markedly increased autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes as indicated by the difference in protein levels of LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 form 2) or numbers of autophagic vacuoles in the absence and presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1. DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death determined by multiple assays was aggravated by a drug or genetic approach that activates autophagy, but it was attenuated by manipulations that inhibit autophagy, suggesting that autophagy contributes to DOX cardiotoxicity. DOX treatment depleted GATA4 protein levels, which predisposed cardiomyocytes to DOX toxicity. Indeed, GATA4 gene silencing triggered autophagy that rendered DOX more toxic, whereas GATA4 overexpression inhibited DOX-induced autophagy, reducing cardiomyocyte death. Mechanistically, GATA4 up-regulated gene expression of the survival factor Bcl2 and suppressed DOX-induced activation of autophagy-related genes, which may likely be responsible for the anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic effects of GATA4. Together, these findings suggest that activation of autophagy mediates DOX cardiotoxicity, and preservation of GATA4 attenuates DOX cardiotoxicity by inhibiting autophagy through modulation of the expression of Bcl2 and autophagy-related genes."

The observation of superconductivity at interfaces of metallic oxides and insulators provides a route to addressing this question. Logvenov et al. (p. 699 ) describe a method for layer-by-layer synthesis of alternating oxides of metal and insulators based on La and Cu. Layers three unit cells thick supported superconductivity with a transition temperature of 32 kelvin. When selected layers were then doped with Zn atoms to suppress superconductivity, the interface superconductivity was shown to arise from a single copper-oxide plane."

By searching bacterial genomes, we identified a family of DHH/DHHA1 domain proteins (COG3387) that co-occur with a subset of the diadenylate cyclase domain proteins. Here we report that the B. subtilis protein YybT, a member of the COG3387 family proteins, exhibits phosphodiesterase activity toward cyclic dinucleotides. The DHH/DHHA1 domain hydrolyzes c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP to generate the linear dinucleotides 5′-pApA and 5′-pGpG. The data suggest that c-di-AMP could be the physiological substrate for YybT given the physiologically relevant Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the presence of YybT family proteins in the bacteria lacking c-di-GMP signaling network. The bacterial regulator ppGpp was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor of the DHH/DHHA1 domain, suggesting that YybT is under tight control during stringent response. In addition, the atypical GGDEF domain of YybT exhibits unexpected ATPase activity, distinct from the common diguanylate cyclase activity for GGDEF domains. We further demonstrate the participation of YybT in DNA damage and acid resistance by characterizing the phenotypes of the ΔyybT mutant. The novel enzymatic activity and stress resistance together point toward a role for YybT in stress signaling and response.

https://openalex.org/W2082848009,"Androgens are functionally required for the normal growth of the prostate gland and in prostate tumor development and progression. Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is an important process during normal development and in cancer cell metastasis induced by factors within the microenvironment, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). This study examined the ability of androgens to influence EMT of prostate cancer epithelial cells. The EMT pattern was evaluated on the basis of expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin/beta-catenin, and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization in response to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 1 nM) and/or TGF-beta (5 ng/ml). Overexpressing and silencing approaches to regulate androgen receptor (AR) expression were conducted to determine the involvement of AR in EMT in the presence or absence of an AR antagonist. Our results demonstrate that androgens induce the EMT pattern in prostate tumor epithelial cell with Snail activation and lead to significant changes in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion potential. Expression levels of AR inversely correlated with androgen-mediated EMT in prostate tumor epithelial cells, pointing to a low AR content required for the EMT phenotype. These findings indicate the ability of androgens to induce EMT by potentially bypassing the functional involvement of TGF-beta, thus contributing to metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells.-Zhum, M.-L., Kyprianou, N.

https://openalex.org/W2032499947,"Sugars play indispensable roles in biological reactions and are distributed into various tissues or organelles via transporters in plants. Under abiotic stress conditions, plants accumulate sugars as a means to increase stress tolerance. Here, we report an abiotic stress-inducible transporter for monosaccharides from Arabidopsis thaliana that is termed ESL1 (ERD six-like 1). Expression of ESL1 was induced under drought and high salinity conditions and with exogenous application of abscisic acid. Promoter analyses using beta-glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporters revealed that ESL1 is mainly expressed in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells. The fluorescence of ESL1-green fluorescent protein-fused protein was detected at tonoplast in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and tobacco BY-2 cells. Furthermore, alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that an N-terminal LXXXLL motif in ESL1 was essential for its localization at the tonoplast. Transgenic BY-2 cells expressing mutated ESL1, which was localized at the plasma membrane, showed an uptake ability for monosaccharides. Moreover, the value of K(m) for glucose uptake activity of mutated ESL1 in the transgenic BY-2 cells was extraordinarily high, and the transport activity was independent from a proton gradient. These results indicate that ESL1 is a low affinity facilitated diffusion transporter. Finally, we detected that vacuolar invertase activity was increased under abiotic stress conditions, and the expression patterns of vacuolar invertase genes were similar to that of ESL1. Under abiotic stress conditions, ESL1 might function coordinately with the vacuolar invertase to regulate osmotic pressure by affecting the accumulation of sugar in plant cells."

In certain cases, however, this preliminary product falls apart before it can be used for further constructive synthetic purposes. Kennedy et al. (p. 706 ; see the Perspective by Marek ) show that in such cases, zinc ions can act as potent stabilizers. Specifically, a bimetallic base incorporating both sodium and zinc ions was used to deprotonate the common cyclic ethers tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran. Zinc coordination to the carbanion inhibited an otherwise rapid ring-opening decomposition pathway. Similarly, a zinc-potassium combination facilitated deprotonation of ethylene to a stabilized product."
https://openalex.org/W2060895401,"Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a soft tissue tumor with a significant degree of morphologic and molecular heterogeneity. We used integrative molecular profiling to discover and characterize molecular subtypes of LMS. Gene expression profiling was performed on 51 LMS samples. Unsupervised clustering showed three reproducible LMS clusters. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on 20 LMS samples and showed that the molecular subtypes defined by gene expression showed distinct genomic changes. Tumors from the 'muscle-enriched' cluster showed significantly increased copy number changes (P=0.04). A majority of the muscle-enriched cases showed loss at 16q24, which contains Fanconi anemia, complementation group A, known to have an important role in DNA repair, and loss at 1p36, which contains PRDM16, of which loss promotes muscle differentiation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on LMS tissue microarrays (n=377) for five markers with high levels of messenger RNA in the muscle-enriched cluster (ACTG2, CASQ2, SLMAP, CFL2 and MYLK) and showed significantly correlated expression of the five proteins (all pairwise P<0.005). Expression of the five markers was associated with improved disease-specific survival in a multivariate Cox regression analysis (P<0.04). In this analysis that combined gene expression profiling, aCGH and IHC, we characterized distinct molecular LMS subtypes, provided insight into their pathogenesis, and identified prognostic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2039418629,"Cell–cell adhesion is an elementary process in normal epithelial cellular architecture. Several studies have shown the role mediated by cadherins in this process, besides their role in the maintenance of cell polarity, differentiation and cell growth. However, during tumour progression, these molecules are frequently altered. In breast cancer, tumours that overexpress P-cadherin usually present a high histological grade, show decreased cell polarity and are associated with worse patient survival. However, little is known about how this protein dictates the very aggressive behaviour of these tumours. To achieve this goal, we set up two breast cancer cell models, where P-cadherin expression was differently modulated and analysed in terms of cell invasion, motility and migration. We show that P-cadherin overexpression, in breast cancer cells with wild-type E-cadherin, promotes cell invasion, motility and migration. Moreover, we found that the overexpression of P-cadherin induces the secretion of matrix metalloproteases, specifically MMP-1 and MMP-2, which then lead to P-cadherin ectodomain cleavage. Further, we showed that soluble P-cadherin fragment is able to induce in vitro invasion of breast cancer cells. Overall, our results contribute to elucidate the mechanism underlying the invasive behaviour of P-cadherin expressing breast tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2065944445,"Flu's Tricky Tricks After vaccination against influenza A virus, single-point mutations are selected in hemagglutinin (the virus molecule that binds to sialic acid molecules on the surface of host cells) that escape neutralization by polyclonal antibody responses. Hensley et al. (p. 734 ) have discovered that in mice these mutations increased the virus's avidity for sialic acid. Amino acid substitutions that occur during reiterations of immune escape and avidity modulation can thus drive antigenic variation. This constant evolution of influenza viruses requires us to change vaccine components annually, and, for equine influenza, Park et al. (p. 726 ) show that as the match between virus and vaccine strains drifts apart with time, the probability of becoming infected and the length of the infectious period increase to the point where outbreaks occur. Nevertheless, even imperfect vaccines may be of benefit to a population because increasing the proportion of vaccinated individuals can supply enough herd immunity to offset a poor antigenic match, especially if used in conjunction with antiviral drugs. For humans, Yang et al. (p. 729 , published online 10 September) estimate that the rate of transmission within U.S. households puts influenza A 2009 H1N1 (the current pandemic “swine flu”) in the higher range of transmissibility, compared to past seasonal and pandemic strains. Thus, to achieve mitigation this fall, children should be the first recipients of vaccine, followed by adults—aiming overall for 70% coverage of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2053726642,"Numerous intracellular pathogens exploit cell surface glycoconjugates for host cell recognition and entry. Unlike bacteria and viruses, Toxoplasma gondii and other parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa actively invade host cells, and this process critically depends on adhesins (microneme proteins) released onto the parasite surface from intracellular organelles called micronemes (MIC). The microneme adhesive repeat (MAR) domain of T. gondii MIC1 (TgMIC1) recognizes sialic acid (Sia), a key determinant on the host cell surface for invasion by this pathogen. By complementation and invasion assays, we demonstrate that TgMIC1 is one important player in Sia-dependent invasion and that another novel Sia-binding lectin, designated TgMIC13, is also involved. Using BLAST searches, we identify a family of MAR-containing proteins in enteroparasitic coccidians, a subclass of apicomplexans, including T. gondii, suggesting that all these parasites exploit sialylated glycoconjugates on host cells as determinants for enteric invasion. Furthermore, this protein family might provide a basis for the broad host cell range observed for coccidians that form tissue cysts during chronic infection. Carbohydrate microarray analyses, corroborated by structural considerations, show that TgMIC13, TgMIC1, and its homologue Neospora caninum MIC1 (NcMIC1) share a preference for alpha2-3- over alpha2-6-linked sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine sequences. However, the three lectins also display differences in binding preferences. Intense binding of TgMIC13 to alpha2-9-linked disialyl sequence reported on embryonal cells and relatively strong binding to 4-O-acetylated-Sia found on gut epithelium and binding of NcMIC1 to 6'sulfo-sialyl Lewis(x) might have implications for tissue tropism."

Here, we report four-dimensional (4D) nanoscale diffraction, probing specific site dynamics with 10 orders of magnitude improvement in time resolution, in convergent-beam ultrafast electron microscopy (CB-UEM). As an application, we measured the change of diffraction intensities in laser-heated crystalline silicon as a function of time and fluence. The structural dynamics (change in 7.3 +/- 3.5 picoseconds), the temperatures (up to 366 kelvin), and the amplitudes of atomic vibrations (up to 0.084 angstroms) are determined for atoms strictly localized within the confined probe area (10 to 300 nanometers in diameter). We anticipate a broad range of applications for CB-UEM and its variants, especially in the studies of single particles and heterogeneous structures."
https://openalex.org/W1996299245,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas without effective therapeutics. Bioinformatics was used to identify potential therapeutic targets. Paired Box (PAX), Eyes Absent (EYA), Dachsund (DACH) and Sine Oculis (SIX) genes, which form a regulatory interactive network in Drosophila, were found to be dysregulated in human MPNST cell lines and solid tumors. We identified a decrease in DACH1 expression, and increases in the expressions of PAX6, EYA1, EYA2, EYA4, and SIX1-4 genes. Consistent with the observation that half of MPNSTs develop in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, subsequent to NF1 mutation, we found that exogenous expression of the NF1-GTPase activating protein-related domain normalized DACH1 expression. EYA4 mRNA was elevated more than 100-fold as estimated by quantitative real-time PCR in most MPNST cell lines. In vitro, suppression of EYA4 expression using short hairpin RNA reduced cell adhesion and migration and caused cellular necrosis without affecting cell proliferation or apoptotic cell death. MPNST cells expressing shEYA4 either failed to form tumors in nude mice or formed very small tumors, with extensive necrosis but similar levels of proliferation and apoptosis as control cells. Our findings identify a role of EYA4 and possibly interacting SIX and DACH proteins in MPNSTs and suggest the EYA4 pathway as a rational therapeutic target."

These are CDK1, CDK2, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, Erk1/2, and DNA-dependent protein kinase. CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate preferentially Ser-5 of the CTD (7Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S.

CDK9 is thought to release RNAPII that is paused by negative inhibitory factors 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor and negative elongation factor some 30–40 base pairs downstream of the transcription start sites. RNAPII then resumes elongation of transcription, during which it becomes further phosphorylated at Ser-2. A marked increase of Ser-2 phosphorylation is often seen near the 3′ end of genes (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D.

It is unclear whether this phosphorylation of the CTD near the polyadenylation site is necessary for efficient elongation by RNAPII per se (17Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A.

CDK7 associates with the cyclin H and MAT1 to form an active kinase module, which then functions as an activator of CDK1 during mitosis (CAK function). The kinase module is also part of the general factor TFIIH (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the PIC CDK7, phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII at Ser-5 (23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ser-5 phosphorylation by CDK7 is tightly linked to PIC formation, it is not required for RNAPII to clear the promoter and resume elongation (25Kanin E.I. Kipp R.T. Kung C. Slattery M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar).CDK7 kinase activity at the CTD is subject to control by the cofactor complex Mediator (PC2).

Mediator then recruits the limiting general factor TFIIB, ultimately leading to efficient preinitiation complex formation (31Baek H.J. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

In other investigations Mediator was shown to help to recruit TFIIH and a free CDK7 module (34Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D.

In mammals Ser-7 phosphorylation has been linked to protein-coding and -noncoding small nuclear RNA genes (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism and the responsible kinases are unknown. In agreement with the finding in yeast, we identify human CDK7 as a CTD Ser-7 kinase. Beyond it we characterize the molecular requirements for and investigate the steps during which it is introduced during transcription. We also present evidence for other kinases that target Ser-7.DISCUSSIONIn this study we explore the molecular process of phosphorylation of the Ser-7 residue within the heptarepeat of the CTD of RNAPII at promoter regions in human cells. Despite limited similarity of the environment of the Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation sites in the heptarepeat YSPTS5PS7, CDK7 is identified as one responsible enzyme. This conclusion is based on direct phosphorylation of isolated GST-CTD by purified CDK7 and the dependence of Ser-7 phosphorylation on CDK7 in crude and highly purified systems. Tests for copurifying kinases in CDK7 IPs were negative. Especially, the known targets of CDK7 (CDK1 and CDK2) were absent in CDK7 IPs. These kinases elute on P11 columns in the 0.3 m elution step and are absent already in the semipurified system (P11 C-fraction based). Clearly, this does not rule out that residual concentrations of an unknown kinase are present. However, we consider it unlikely that minor concentrations suffice in these in vitro systems to mediate efficient CTD phosphorylation. This is best exemplified with CDK7 itself, whose function is concentration-dependent. Mediator functions at least in part via enrichment of CDK7. Furthermore, strong effects indeed require enrichment of the enzyme.The conclusion that CDK7 can phosphorylate Ser-7 is entirely consistent with the recent identification of yeast CDK7 (Kin28) as the major Ser-7 kinase (37Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Beyond it we characterize the process in which the CTD is modified at residue Ser-7. CDK7 can phosphorylate Ser-7 directly in the absence of a functional preinitiation complex. However, in the physiological context of a nuclear extract, phosphorylation by CDK7 is strictly dependent on a series of structural constraints. CDK7 functions dependent on a promoter-bound preinitiation complex that minimally consists of TBP, TFIIB, and RNAPII (we have not tested TFIIF but expect it to be part of it). This is not a trivial finding because CDK7 is found on promoters in the absence of other general factors but in the presence of RNAPII. Indeed, promoter association of CDK7 is fully dependent on Mediator. In line with a recent genetic study in yeast, our data further suggest that Mediator complex recruits a free CDK7 CAK module (36Esnault C. Ghavi-Helm Y. Brun S. Soutourina J. Van Berkum N. Boschiero C. Holstege F. Werner M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is well established that Mediator binds RNAPII at enhancer regions (29Blazek E. Mittler G. Meisterernst M. Chromosoma. 2005; 113: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The presence of a Mediator-associated RNAPII is closely linked to transcription activity in vitro (39Uhlmann T. Boeing S. Lehmbacher M. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2163-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, extracts also contain RNAPII that is not associated with Mediator. In purified systems free RNAPII is fully functional in basal transcription. In a more physiological context RNAPII requires Mediator for efficient incorporation into preinitiation complexes and for both basal and activated transcription (31Baek H.J. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15172-15181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Importantly, here we demonstrate for the first time that an isolated Mediator-RNAPII complex suffices to recruit both TFIIB and CDK7 and facilitates the incorporation of RNAPII into preinitiation complexes. Mediator-RNAPII and TBP-TATA complexes form independently of each other. In a reverse stepwise process Mediator-RNAPII recruits TFIIB even in the absence of TBP. Although present, nearby CDK7 does not phosphorylate RNAPII bound to Mediator in the absence of either TFIIB or TBP. This indicates that kinase-substrate interaction relates to or may even require prior relocation of RNAPII to preinitiation complexes. Notably, we never observed Ser-7 phosphorylation in the absence of Ser-5 phosphorylation.A general conclusion of these findings is that Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation is tightly controlled during initiation of transcription. Interestingly, core TFIIH is not necessary to initiate Ser-7 phosphorylation by CDK7. These and other data clearly suggested that Ser-7 phosphorylation begins before initiation of transcription. Previous analyses demonstrated that CDK7-mediated phosphorylation is not generally required for transcription (25Kanin E.I. Kipp R.T. Kung C. Slattery M. Viale A. Hahn S. Shokat K.M. Ansari A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, a requirement of Ser-7 phosphorylation for transcription has not been reported. Nevertheless, our recent and previous ChIP data (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) suggest that Ser-7 occurs coupled to transcription in vivo, therefore, minimally reasoning for a function that is coupled to transcription. ChIP-ing, a conditional model gene, revealed the highest Ser-7-P signals downstream of the start site of transcription. Substantial steady-state levels were also detected further downstream within coding regions.Last but not least, we have clear evidence for additional Ser-7 kinases. Notably, the latter also require DNA templates and Mediator, but they operate at a higher Km for ATP. Contrary to the molecular constraints observed for CDK7, our unpublished data suggest that at least one kinase functions independently of transcription complex formation.2 IntroductionIn mammalian cells the C-terminal domain of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPIIRNA polymerase IIPICpreinitiation complexCAKCDK-activating kinaseTBPTATA-binding proteinMLmajor-lateIPimmunoprecipitationGSTglutathione S-transferaseCDKcyclin-dependent kinasehTFhuman TFIIBChIPchromatin IPCTDC-terminal heptarepeat domainErkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideBSAbovine serum albuminATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). consists of 52 heptarepeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS (for review, see Refs. 1Meinhart A.

Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 289-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When RNAPII enters the preinitiation complex (PIC) the CTD becomes phosphorylated at least on three serine residues, Ser-2, Ser-5, and Ser-7 (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), at a yet unknown number of repeat elements. In theory, combinations of modifications could generate a complex pattern sometimes referred to as CTD code hypothesis (5Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), in analogy to the modifications occurring on lysine, arginine, and serine residues within N-terminal tails of histones (6Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar).Several kinases have been identified that modify the CTD. These are CDK1, CDK2, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, Erk1/2, and DNA-dependent protein kinase. CDK1 and CDK2 phosphorylate preferentially Ser-5 of the CTD (7Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S.

Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the case of CDK1 this has been associated with repression of transcription during mitosis (9Long J.J. Leresche A. Kriwacki R.W. Gottesfeld J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The signaling kinases Erk1/2 phosphorylate the RNAPII CTD in response to oxidative and osmotic stress (10Bonnet F. Vigneron M. Bensaude O. Dubois M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4399-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The promoter-associated kinase DNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates the CTD at Ser-7 in vitro, although it remains unclear whether this process is relevant to transcription (11Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

CDK8 and the paralogue CDC2L6 are associated with the Mediator complex (13Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 14Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). CDK8 has mostly been associated with repression of transcription, yet there are also reports that specific genes are activated by it (15Furumoto T. Tanaka A. Ito M. Malik S. Hirose Y. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Donner A.J. Szostek S. Hoover J.M. Espinosa J.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CDK9 is thought to release RNAPII that is paused by negative inhibitory factors 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor and negative elongation factor some 30–40 base pairs downstream of the transcription start sites. RNAPII then resumes elongation of transcription, during which it becomes further phosphorylated at Ser-2. A marked increase of Ser-2 phosphorylation is often seen near the 3′ end of genes (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A. Emerson B.M. Espinosa J.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this phosphorylation of the CTD near the polyadenylation site is necessary for efficient elongation by RNAPII per se (17Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A. Emerson B.M. Espinosa J.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18Buratowski S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Instead it may introduce signals for the binding of factors that alter CTD conformation and facilitate the interactions of RNA processing machineries (19Kim M. Krogan N.J. Vasiljeva L. Rando O.J. Nedea E. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. Nature. 2004; 432: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Meinhart A. Cramer P.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).The kinase CDK7 is involved in both transcription and cell cycle control. CDK7 associates with the cyclin H and MAT1 to form an active kinase module, which then functions as an activator of CDK1 during mitosis (CAK function). The kinase module is also part of the general factor TFIIH (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the PIC CDK7, phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII at Ser-5 (23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ser-5 phosphorylation by CDK7 is tightly linked to PIC formation, it is not required for RNAPII to clear the promoter and resume elongation (25Kanin E.I. Kipp R.T. Kung C. Slattery M. Viale A. Hahn S. Shokat K.M. Ansari A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Instead Ser-5 phosphorylation seems critical for cap formation at 5′ ends of the newly synthesized mRNA (26Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this phosphorylation of the CTD near the polyadenylation site is necessary for efficient elongation by RNAPII per se (17Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Instead it may introduce signals for the binding of factors that alter CTD conformation and facilitate the interactions of RNA processing machineries (19Kim M. Krogan N.J. Vasiljeva L. Rando O.J.

CDK7 associates with the cyclin H and MAT1 to form an active kinase module, which then functions as an activator of CDK1 during mitosis (CAK function). The kinase module is also part of the general factor TFIIH (22Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the PIC CDK7, phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII at Ser-5 (23Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ser-5 phosphorylation by CDK7 is tightly linked to PIC formation, it is not required for RNAPII to clear the promoter and resume elongation (25Kanin E.I. Kipp R.T. Kung C. Slattery M. Viale A. Hahn S. Shokat K.M. Ansari A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Instead Ser-5 phosphorylation seems critical for cap formation at 5′ ends of the newly synthesized mRNA (26Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It has further been suggested that RNAPII modified at Ser-5 attracts histone modifying factors such as the trithorax group protein family (28Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). CDK7 kinase activity at the CTD is subject to control by the cofactor complex Mediator (PC2). Mediator binds to activators in a complex with RNAPII (29Blazek E. Mittler G. Meisterernst M. Chromosoma. 2005; 113: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mediator then recruits the limiting general factor TFIIB, ultimately leading to efficient preinitiation complex formation (31Baek H.J. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15172-15181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In yeast, Mediator enhances the activity of the CDK7 kinase module by a yet unknown mechanism (33Kim Y.J. Björklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In other investigations Mediator was shown to help to recruit TFIIH and a free CDK7 module (34Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 2008; 31: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In a recent publication the yeast homologue of CDK7 (termed KIN28) was shown to be responsible for phosphorylation of the CTD at Ser-7 at the 5′ end of many yeast genes (37Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In mammals Ser-7 phosphorylation has been linked to protein-coding and -noncoding small nuclear RNA genes (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 38Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism and the responsible kinases are unknown. In agreement with the finding in yeast, we identify human CDK7 as a CTD Ser-7 kinase. Beyond it we characterize the molecular requirements for and investigate the steps during which it is introduced during transcription. We also present evidence for other kinases that target Ser-7. DISCUSSIONIn this study we explore the molecular process of phosphorylation of the Ser-7 residue within the heptarepeat of the CTD of RNAPII at promoter regions in human cells. Despite limited similarity of the environment of the Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation sites in the heptarepeat YSPTS5PS7, CDK7 is identified as one responsible enzyme. This conclusion is based on direct phosphorylation of isolated GST-CTD by purified CDK7 and the dependence of Ser-7 phosphorylation on CDK7 in crude and highly purified systems. Tests for copurifying kinases in CDK7 IPs were negative. Especially, the known targets of CDK7 (CDK1 and CDK2) were absent in CDK7 IPs. These kinases elute on P11 columns in the 0.3 m elution step and are absent already in the semipurified system (P11 C-fraction based). Clearly, this does not rule out that residual concentrations of an unknown kinase are present. However, we consider it unlikely that minor concentrations suffice in these in vitro systems to mediate efficient CTD phosphorylation. This is best exemplified with CDK7 itself, whose function is concentration-dependent. Mediator functions at least in part via enrichment of CDK7. Furthermore, strong effects indeed require enrichment of the enzyme.The conclusion that CDK7 can phosphorylate Ser-7 is entirely consistent with the recent identification of yeast CDK7 (Kin28) as the major Ser-7 kinase (37Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Beyond it we characterize the process in which the CTD is modified at residue Ser-7. CDK7 can phosphorylate Ser-7 directly in the absence of a functional preinitiation complex. However, in the physiological context of a nuclear extract, phosphorylation by CDK7 is strictly dependent on a series of structural constraints. CDK7 functions dependent on a promoter-bound preinitiation complex that minimally consists of TBP, TFIIB, and RNAPII (we have not tested TFIIF but expect it to be part of it). This is not a trivial finding because CDK7 is found on promoters in the absence of other general factors but in the presence of RNAPII. Indeed, promoter association of CDK7 is fully dependent on Mediator. In line with a recent genetic study in yeast, our data further suggest that Mediator complex recruits a free CDK7 CAK module (36Esnault C. Ghavi-Helm Y. Brun S. Soutourina J. Van Berkum N. Boschiero C. Holstege F. Werner M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is well established that Mediator binds RNAPII at enhancer regions (29Blazek E. Mittler G. Meisterernst M. Chromosoma. 2005; 113: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The presence of a Mediator-associated RNAPII is closely linked to transcription activity in vitro (39Uhlmann T. Boeing S. Lehmbacher M. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2163-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, extracts also contain RNAPII that is not associated with Mediator. In purified systems free RNAPII is fully functional in basal transcription. In a more physiological context RNAPII requires Mediator for efficient incorporation into preinitiation complexes and for both basal and activated transcription (31Baek H.J. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15172-15181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Mittler G. Kremmer E. Timmers H.T. Meisterernst M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Importantly, here we demonstrate for the first time that an isolated Mediator-RNAPII complex suffices to recruit both TFIIB and CDK7 and facilitates the incorporation of RNAPII into preinitiation complexes. Mediator-RNAPII and TBP-TATA complexes form independently of each other. In a reverse stepwise process Mediator-RNAPII recruits TFIIB even in the absence of TBP. Although present, nearby CDK7 does not phosphorylate RNAPII bound to Mediator in the absence of either TFIIB or TBP. This indicates that kinase-substrate interaction relates to or may even require prior relocation of RNAPII to preinitiation complexes. Notably, we never observed Ser-7 phosphorylation in the absence of Ser-5 phosphorylation.A general conclusion of these findings is that Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation is tightly controlled during initiation of transcription. Interestingly, core TFIIH is not necessary to initiate Ser-7 phosphorylation by CDK7. These and other data clearly suggested that Ser-7 phosphorylation begins before initiation of transcription. Previous analyses demonstrated that CDK7-mediated phosphorylation is not generally required for transcription (25Kanin E.I. Kipp R.T. Kung C. Slattery M. Viale A. Hahn S. Shokat K.M. Ansari A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, a requirement of Ser-7 phosphorylation for transcription has not been reported. Nevertheless, our recent and previous ChIP data (4Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) suggest that Ser-7 occurs coupled to transcription in vivo, therefore, minimally reasoning for a function that is coupled to transcription. ChIP-ing, a conditional model gene, revealed the highest Ser-7-P signals downstream of the start site of transcription. Substantial steady-state levels were also detected further downstream within coding regions.Last but not least, we have clear evidence for additional Ser-7 kinases. Notably, the latter also require DNA templates and Mediator, but they operate at a higher Km for ATP. Contrary to the molecular constraints observed for CDK7, our unpublished data suggest that at least one kinase functions independently of transcription complex formation.2 In this study we explore the molecular process of phosphorylation of the Ser-7 residue within the heptarepeat of the CTD of RNAPII at promoter regions in human cells.

https://openalex.org/W2045675192,"In order for neurons to perform their function, they must establish a highly polarized morphology characterized, in most of the cases, by a single axon and multiple dendrites. Herein we find that the evolutionarily conserved protein Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220-kDa), also known as ARMS (ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning), a downstream effector of protein kinase D and neurotrophin and ephrin receptors, regulates the establishment of neuronal polarity and development of dendrites. Kidins220/ARMS gain and loss of function experiments render severe phenotypic changes in the processes extended by hippocampal neurons in culture. Although Kidins220/ARMS early overexpression hinders neuronal development, its down-regulation by RNA interference results in the appearance of multiple longer axon-like extensions as well as aberrant dendritic arbors. We also find that Kidins220/ARMS interacts with tubulin and microtubule-regulating molecules whose role in neuronal morphogenesis is well established (microtubule-associated proteins 1b, 1a, and 2 and two members of the stathmin family). Importantly, neurons where Kidins220/ARMS has been knocked down register changes in the phosphorylation activity of MAP1b and stathmins. Altogether, our results indicate that Kidins220/ARMS is a key modulator of the activity of microtubule-regulating proteins known to actively regulate neuronal morphogenesis and suggest a mechanism by which it contributes to control neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2103585077,"Aptamers are useful molecular recognition tools in research, diagnostics, and therapy. Despite promising results in other fields, aptamer use has remained scarce in amyloid research, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease believed to be caused by neurotoxic amyloid β-protein (Aβ) oligomers. Aβ oligomers therefore are an attractive target for development of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents. We used covalently-stabilized oligomers of the 40-residue form of Aβ (Aβ40) for aptamer selection. Despite gradually increasing the stringency of selection conditions, the selected aptamers did not recognize Aβ40 oligomers but reacted with fibrils of Aβ40, Aβ42, and several other amyloidogenic proteins. Aptamer reactivity with amyloid fibrils showed some degree of protein-sequence dependency. Significant fibril binding also was found for the naïve library and could not be eliminated by counter-selection using Aβ40 fibrils, suggesting that aptamer binding to amyloid fibrils was RNA-sequence-independent. Aptamer binding depended on fibrillogenesis and showed a lag phase. Interestingly, aptamers detected fibril formation with ≥15-fold higher sensitivity than thioflavin T (ThT), revealing substantial β-sheet and fibril formation undetected by ThT. The data suggest that under physiologic conditions, aptamers for oligomeric forms of amyloidogenic proteins cannot be selected due to high, non-specific affinity of oligonucleotides for amyloid fibrils. Nevertheless, the high sensitivity, whereby aptamers detect β-sheet formation, suggests that they can serve as superior amyloid recognition tools."

The repression/silencing phase occurs in blood leukocytes of animals and humans following the initiation of systemic inflammation due to developing endotoxin tolerance. We previously reported that NF-κB transcription factor RelB and histone H3 lysine methyltransferase G9a directly interact to induce facultative heterochromatin assembly and regulate epigenetic silencing during endotoxin tolerance, which is a major feature of sepsis. The general objective of this study was to assess whether dynamic temporal, structural, and positional changes of nucleosomes influence the sepsis phenotype. We used the THP-1 sepsis cell model to isolate mononucleosomes by rapid cell permeabilization and digestion of chromatin with micrococcal nuclease and then compared tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) proximal promoter nucleosome alignment in endotoxin-responsive and -tolerant phenotypes. We found differential and dynamic repositioning of nucleosomes from permissive to repressive locations during the activation and silencing phases of transcription reprogramming and identified the following mechanisms that may participate in the process. 1) Two proximal nucleosomes repositioned to expose the primary NF-κB DNA binding site in endotoxin-responsive cells, and this “promoter opening” required the ATP-independent chaperone NAP1 to replace the core histone H2A with the H2A.Z variant. 2) During RelB-dependent endotoxin tolerance, the two nucleosomes repositioned and masked the primary NF-κB DNA binding site. 3) Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of RelB expression prevented repressive nucleosome repositioning and tolerance induction, but the “open” promoter required endotoxin-induced NF-κB p65 promoter binding to initiate transcription, supporting the known requirement of p65 posttranslational modifications for transactivation. 4) Sustaining the permissive promoter state after RelB knockdown required ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler BAF complex. Moreover, we found that forced expression of RelB in responsive cells induced repressive nucleosome positioning and silenced TNFα transcription, demonstrating the plasticity of nucleosome remodeling and its dependence on RelB. Our data suggest that nucleosome repositioning controls both the induction and epigenetic silencing phases of TNFα transcription associated with sepsis.

Nucleosomes are dynamically and constantly remodeled to allow or prevent access to regulatory factors and cofactors. Each nucleosome, the fundamental building unit of chromatin, is composed of ∼147 bp of genomic DNA wrapped 1.65 times around an octamer of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Gottesfeld J.M.

Because transcription factor binding sites often cluster in linker DNA between nucleosomes, the precise locations of nucleosomes and the accessible linker DNA may play a role in transcriptional control. Recent studies showed that promoter nucleosomes frequently adopt selective positions to functionally regulate transcription factor binding (3Schnitzler G.R. Cell Biochem.

Because nucleosomal positioning is often associated with discrete changes within regulatory regions (14Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), remodeling of promoter nucleosomes is a key mechanism of gene activation or silencing (15Kadonaga J.T.

Posttranslational modifications on histone components of nucleosomes play a role in changing chromatin structure by altering histone-DNA interactions and help in the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes (17Berger S.L.

These complexes alter chromatin configuration by nucleosomal sliding or eviction, thereby promoting access to transcription factors (3Schnitzler G.R. Cell Biochem.

The mammalian ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes are tumor suppressors and function as transcriptional coactivators or corepressors (19Chen J. Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Mol.

Because nucleosome assembly by histone chaperones tends to place nucleosomes over low energy nucleosome-positioning sequences, these remodeling complexes use ATP energy to move nucleosome away from complex-preferred positions, depending on the DNA regulatory sequence and histone modifications (3Schnitzler G.R.

Thus, recruitment of a remodeling complex could invert the normal accessibility pattern at a promoter and therefore act as an on-off switch for transcription (3Schnitzler G.R. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 51: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Other chromatin remodelers like the ATP-independent nucleosome assembly protein NAP1 bind and sequester histone complexes through exchanging histone dimers, resulting in nucleosomal sliding (24Park Y.J.

This gene reprogramming event can be remodeled in vitro by generating a state of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance in cultured cell lines by the prolonged stimulation with LPS (28McCall C.E.

The transcription silencing phase is initiated and maintained through a combinatorial silencing mechanism that involves interactions between the transcription repressor RelB and chromatin-associated proteins (26Chen X.

The silencing mechanism requires dimethylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) by G9a, increased binding of heterochromatin protein HP1, and formation of silent facultative heterochromatin structure (26Chen X.

This process correlates with diminished binding of the active NF-κB factor p65 and increased binding of feedback repressor transcription factor RelB to the proximal promoters. RelB is essential initiator of silencing by directly interacting with and recruiting G9a to promote and maintain a silent heterochromatin structure (27El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L.

Our finding that inhibiting RelB expression in tolerant cells reactivated TNFα and IL-1β transcription (26Chen X. El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. McCall C.E. J. Biol.

In this study, we examined nucleosomal organization around the TNFα promoter and analyzed its contribution to the induction and silencing of the TNFα promoter, using micrococcal nuclease digestion combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. The results revealed two positioned nucleosomes encompassing the promoter element required for TNFα induction as well as silencing. We report that nucleosome occupancy and positioning around the promoter displays a strikingly different profile that correlates with the level of expression. Upon activation of THP-1-responsive cells by LPS, two proximal nucleosomes are rapidly remodeled to open the promoter, suggesting that selective remodeling is essential for TNFα induction. In tolerant cells, one nucleosome is repositioned to a repressive location, covering the κB site. This differential nucleosome positioning was dependent on the presence of RelB at the promoter sequence in tolerant cells. We also show that nucleosome positioning in responsive cells is mediated by the ATP-independent chromatin remodeler NAP1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1), whereas the ATP-dependent remodeler BAF complex is required to reposition nucleosomes and open the promoter DNA in tolerant cells. The results suggest that nucleosomal occupancy and positioning at the TNFα promoter correlates with the level of expression, and that chromatin remodeling is an intrinsic and dynamic mechanism that controls proinflammatory gene expression during the course of development and maintenance of severe systemic inflammation. The human monocytic cell line, THP-1, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, was maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For induction of LPS tolerance (29LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), cells were incubated overnight with 1 μg/ml Gram-negative bacterial LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma). LPS-tolerant and LPS-responsive (normal) cells were washed with incomplete medium and cultured at 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml and stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated times. Cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml 1 day before transfection. Transfection with pools of control or RelB-, NAP1-, or BAF47-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was performed by electroporation using 5 μl (0.5 μm final concentration) of siRNA in 100 μl of transfection medium (Nucleofector; Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Immediately after transfection, cells were transferred to culture medium at 0.5 × 106 cell/ml and left unstimulated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS to induce tolerance. After 36 h, cells were harvested, washed with incomplete medium, and then stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated times. Wild-type and mutant RelB constructs (truncated RelB with amino acids 264–379 deleted) were generated by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). DNA was transfected by electroporation as described above. This truncation disrupts the Rel homology domain of RelB and therefore affects its dimerization and interaction with G9a (26Chen X. El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27857-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of TNFα was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the STAT-60 extraction kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a 25-μl volume containing 0.2 μm dNTPs, 2.5 μm oligo(dT), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 units/μl murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reverse transcription reaction was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C and 5 min at 99 °C. The PCR was performed using 5 μl of cDNA product and TNFα predesigned TaqMan primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C (combined annealing and extension), using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Sample data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and are presented as -fold change. Cells grown to 70–80% confluence were harvested and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link chromatin. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine at 125 mm. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT), followed by Dounce homogenization. The nuclear suspension was then centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm. Nuclei were collected, and a portion (1:20) were used to isolate input DNA using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The remainder of the nuclei was resuspended in micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 60 mm KCl), to which 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm spermidine were added immediately prior to use. For preparation of mononucleosomes, we used an optimized MNase digestion protocol (34Chen C. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7682-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Five hundred microliters of nuclei suspension (at 2 × 106 nuclei/ml) were incubated with 5–25 units of MNase (stock solution, 20 units/μl; EMD Calbiochem), gently mixed, and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The digestion was stopped by adding 1 ml of MNase stop buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 100 μl of 10% SDS. The lysate was incubated overnight at 37 °C. DNA was then extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (with glycogen). For chromatin immunoprecipitation, immediately after digestion with MNase, nuclei lysis buffer (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) and protease inhibitor mixture were added for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm, chromatin solution was precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose beads and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against H3K9me2, H3K4me3 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), H2A.Z (Active Motif), H2A, NAP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or BAF47 (BD Biosciences). Chromatin was decross-linked, and DNA was extracted as described previously (27El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 5 μl of mononucleosomal, input, or immunoprecipitated (chromatin-immunoprecipitated) DNA, 1 μm each primer, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm dNTPs, and 0.04 unit/μl AmpliTag Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each, and a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were run on 1.2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, and images were captured using a Quantity One imager (Bio-Rad). The primers used in PCR were designed to amplify sequences in the human TNFα regulatory region from −800 to +200 bp relative to the transcription start site (35Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted by incubating cells on ice for 15 min in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined. Whole cell extracts were prepared using the same nuclei lysis buffer. Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce). Membranes were blocked and probed overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies against RelB, NAP1, or BAF47. After washing, blots were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins were visualized using an ECL detection system (Pierce). Blots were stripped and reprobed with control antibody. Data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Student's t test was used to determine significant differences, with p values of ≤0.05 being significant. TNFα transcription is significantly induced after LPS activation of THP-1 cells but is silenced once cells become LPS-tolerant despite a second dose of LPS (27El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the chromatin structure contributes to TNFα induction or silencing by comparing the nucleosomal organization across a 1-kb promoter fragment in the different cellular phenotypes. LPS-responsive (normal) THP-1 cells were made tolerant (T) by pretreatment with LPS overnight and then washed and restimulated, together with the responsive (R) cells, for 1 h. We chose the 1 h time point because our previous work demonstrated that after 1 h, TNFα mRNA is significantly increased in responsive cells but was not expressed in tolerant cells (27El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We consider resting, responsive cells (R0) as the base-line response; therefore, nucleosome positions in these cells will be identified as “in native/default positions.” Because TNFα mRNA is restored in tolerant cells in which RelB expression is inhibited by siRNA, we included this phenotype in our analysis. MNase preferentially digests protein-free DNA, including linker regions between nucleosomes. We first digested nucleosomal DNA with varying concentrations of MNase and then choose the conditions that produced mononucleosome particles (∼180 bp). DNA was purified and separated on 3% agarose gel. The optimal digestion conditions were determined by detecting the purified DNA as one main band of ∼180 bp (not shown). Conditions that produced several bands were indicative of partial digestion and were excluded. Optimal digestion conditions were not changed throughout our analyses. The extent of nucleosome occupancy was analyzed by comparing the abundance of the promoter DNA in total mononucleosomal DNA relative to genomic DNA by PCR. We elected not to digest genomic DNA extracted before MNase digestion because MNase may cut randomly and generate several bands, which makes it difficult to quantitate the level of DNA abundance. These measurements provide an assessment of the extent of DNA protection via packaging into nucleosomes. We employed a reductive approach by designing a series of PCR primers, namely primer set A–C (see Fig. 1A). Each primer pair encompass ∼200-bp sequence. Using primer set A, we observed one nucleosome between −200 and −400 that was detected with primer pair 3F-R in unstimulated responsive (R0) cells only (Fig. 1B). The experiment also revealed the presence of two nucleosomes, one close to −400 (using primer pair 4F-R) and one between −600 and −800 (using primer pair 6F-R). These two nucleosomes were uniformly positioned in all of the cell phenotypes examined. The faint bands shown with T0 cells using primer pairs 1F-R, 2F-R, and 3F-R may result from the incomplete digestion with MNase, meaning that the corresponding DNA is not occupied by nucleosomes. We next used primer pairs (primer set B) that encompass longer sequences (∼300 bp), which is longer than the mononucleosomal DNA (∼180 bp). As shown in Fig. 2, we did not detect any nucleosome in all of the cell phenotypes. Although this result may suggest that these sequences are nucleosome-free, it also suggests that they contain nucleosomes, but because MNase cuts DNA at the nucleosomal edges, they may not be amplified by PCR if the cut falls in the middle of the sequence the primers cover. In order to narrow down the locations of the three nucleosomes identified in Fig. 1, we designed a primer set C that overlaps primer set A (Fig. 3A). Using these primers, we located one nucleosome between +1 and −200 in R0, T0, and T1 cells with primer pair 7F-R (Fig. 3B). Primer 8F-R detected one nucleosome in R1 cells and also in T1 cells after RelB knockdown, whereas primer 9F-R detected one nucleosome in R0 cells only. In addition, primer SF-R detected one nucleosome between +1 and +200 in all cell phenotypes except R0 cells. Based on the results presented in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, we tentatively mapped four nucleosomes (namely nucleosomes 1–4) within the 1-kb TNFα regulatory region (Fig. 4"
https://openalex.org/W1975483221,"The Capillary Morphogenesis Gene 2 (CMG2) gene encodes an Anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR2), but the normal physiological function is not known. ANTXR2/CMG2 was originally identified as a result of up-regulation during capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells (ECs) cultured in vitro. We explored the hypothesis that key steps of the angiogenic process are either dependent or are influenced by ANTXR2/CMG2 activity. We describe the expression pattern of ANTXR2/CMG2 in several murine tissues and in normal breast and breast tumors. Endothelial expression was found in all of the tissues analyzed, in cultured ECs and in breast tumor vessels; however, ANTXR2/CMG2 expression was not restricted to this cell type. To assess potential angiogenic function, we used RNA interference to achieve significant reduction of ANTXR2/CMG2 expression in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). Reduced ANTXR2/CMG2 expression resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation and reduced capacity of ECs to form capillary-like networks in vitro, whereas overexpression of ANTXR2/CMG2 in HUVEC increased proliferation and capillary-like network formation. Little change in migration of ECs was observed on knockdown or overexpression. We conclude that ANTXR2/CMG2 functions to promote endothelial proliferation and morphogenesis during sprouting angiogenesis, consistent with the endothelial expression of ANTXR2/CMG2 in several vascular beds."
https://openalex.org/W2050094937,"Although the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits occurs predominantly in the nucleus, final remodeling steps take place in the cytosol. One cytosolic step has two components: 1) the removal of the maturation factor Arx1, which transits from the nucleus to the cytosol with the pre-60 S subunit, and 2) its subsequent transport back into the nucleus. Two cytosolic proteins, Rei1 and Jjj1, are required, but their individual contributions to this step are not understood. Here we report that Rei1 and Jjj1 directly interact. This interaction is mediated by a C-terminal segment of Jjj1 encompassing a region rich in charged residues, flanked by C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers. Deletion of the charged region results in defects in 60 S subunit biogenesis in vivo. In addition, we report resolution of an apparent contradiction in the literature regarding the association of Arx1 with the pre-60 S subunit in the absence of Rei1. The association of Arx1 with ribosomes is sensitive to the concentration of magnesium ions when Rei1 is absent. At near physiological concentrations, Arx1 remains associated with the pre-60 S particle, as it does in the absence of Jjj1; at higher concentrations, Arx1 dissociates in the absence of Rei1 but not in the absence of Jjj1. As both Rei1 and Jjj1 are required for dissociation of Arx1 from the pre-60 S subunit, and the region of Jjj1 that mediates interaction with Rei1 is required in vivo for 60 S subunit biogenesis, our data support the idea that the primary role of both Rei1 and Jjj1 is the first step of the Arx1 removal/recycling process."
https://openalex.org/W1991142954,"Herein we describe a mutant of the two-exon HIV-1 Tat protein, termed Nullbasic, that potently inhibits multiple steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Nullbasic was created by replacing the entire arginine-rich basic domain of wild type Tat with glycine/alanine residues. Like similarly mutated one-exon Tat mutants, Nullbasic exhibited transdominant negative effects on Tat-dependent transactivation. However, unlike previously reported mutants, we discovered that Nullbasic also strongly suppressed the expression of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNA, an activity likely caused by redistribution and thus functional inhibition of HIV-1 Rev. Furthermore, HIV-1 virion particles produced by cells expressing Nullbasic had severely reduced infectivity, a defect attributable to a reduced ability of the virions to undergo reverse transcription. Combination of these inhibitory effects on transactivation, Rev-dependent mRNA transport and reverse transcription meant that permissive cells constitutively expressing Nullbasic were highly resistant to a spreading infection by HIV-1. Nullbasic and its activities thus provide potential insights into the development of potent antiviral therapeutics that target multiple stages of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2128931040,"Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNTA) causes a life-threatening neuroparalytic disease known as botulism. Current treatment for post exposure of BoNTA uses antibodies that are effective in neutralizing the extracellular toxin to prevent further intoxication but generally cannot rescue already intoxicated neurons. Effective small-molecule inhibitors of BoNTA endopeptidase (BoNTAe) are desirable because such inhibitors potentially can neutralize the intracellular BoNTA and offer complementary treatment for botulism. Previously we reported a serotype-selective, small-molecule BoNTAe inhibitor with a K(i) (app) value of 3.8+/-0.8 microM. This inhibitor was developed by lead identification using virtual screening followed by computer-aided optimization of a lead with an IC(50) value of 100 microM. However, it was difficult to further improve the lead from micromolar to even high nanomolar potency due to the unusually large enzyme-substrate interface of BoNTAe. The enzyme-substrate interface area of 4,840 A(2) for BoNTAe is about four times larger than the typical protein-protein interface area of 750-1,500 A(2). Inhibitors must carry several functional groups to block the unusually large interface of BoNTAe, and syntheses of such inhibitors are therefore time-consuming and expensive. Herein we report the development of a serotype-selective, small-molecule, and competitive inhibitor of BoNTAe with a K(i) value of 760+/-170 nM using synthesis-based computer-aided molecular design (SBCAMD). This new approach accounts the practicality and efficiency of inhibitor synthesis in addition to binding affinity and selectivity. We also report a three-dimensional model of BoNTAe in complex with the new inhibitor and the dynamics of the complex predicted by multiple molecular dynamics simulations, and discuss further structural optimization to achieve better in vivo efficacy in neutralizing BoNTA than those of our early micromolar leads. This work provides new insight into structural modification of known small-molecule BoNTAe inhibitors. It also demonstrates that SBCAMD is capable of improving potency of an inhibitor lead by nearly one order of magnitude, even for BoNTAe as one of the most challenging protein targets. The results are insightful for developing effective small-molecule inhibitors of protein targets with large active sites."

https://openalex.org/W2053267300,"Stimulating naïve CD8+ T cells with specific antigens and costimulatory signals is insufficient to induce optimal clonal expansion and effector functions. In this study, we show that the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells require IL-2 provided by activated CD4+ T cells at the initial priming stage within 0–2.5 hours after stimulation. This critical IL-2 signal from CD4+ cells is mediated through the IL-2Rβγ of CD8+ cells, which is independent of IL-2Rα. The activation of IL-2 signaling advances the restriction point of the cell cycle, and thereby expedites the entry of antigen-stimulated CD8+ T-cell into the S phase. Besides promoting cell proliferation, IL-2 stimulation increases the amount of IFNγ and granzyme B produced by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, IL-2 at priming enhances the ability of P14 effector cells generated by antigen activation to eradicate B16.gp33 tumors in vivo. Therefore, our studies demonstrate that a full CD8+ T-cell response is elicited by a critical temporal function of IL-2 released from CD4+ T cells, providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of CD8+ T cell activation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2001917210,"Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) is a highly conserved protein present in all eukaryotic organisms. Various cellular functions and molecular interactions have been ascribed to this protein, many related to its growth-promoting and antiapoptotic properties. TCTP levels are highly regulated in response to various cellular stimuli and stresses. We have shown recently that the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, is involved in translational regulation of TCTP. Here we extend these studies by demonstrating that TCTP is downregulated in response to various proapoptotic treatments, in particular agents that induce Ca++ stress, in a PKR-dependent manner. This regulation requires phosphorylation of protein synthesis factor eIF2α. Since TCTP has been characterized as an antiapoptotic and Ca++-binding protein, we asked whether it is involved in protecting cells from Ca++-stress-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of TCTP partially protects cells against thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, as measured using caspase-3 activation assays, a nuclear fragmentation assay, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and time-lapse video microscopy. TCTP also protects cells against the proapoptotic effects of tunicamycin and etoposide, but not against those of arsenite. Our results imply that cellular TCTP levels influence sensitivity to apoptosis and that PKR may exert its proapoptotic effects at least in part through downregulation of TCTP via eIF2α phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2044790426,"alpha-Conotoxins are peptide neurotoxins isolated from venomous cone snails that display exquisite selectivity for different subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). They are valuable research tools that have profound implications in the discovery of new drugs for a myriad of neuropharmacological conditions. They are characterized by a conserved two-disulfide bond framework, which gives rise to two intervening loops of extensively mutated amino acids that determine their selectivity for different nAChR subtypes. We have used a multistep synthetic combinatorial approach using alpha-conotoxin ImI to develop potent and selective alpha(7) nAChR antagonists. A positional scan synthetic combinatorial library was constructed based on the three residues of the n-loop of alpha-conotoxin ImI to give a total of 10,648 possible combinations that were screened for functional activity in an alpha(7) nAChR Fluo-4/Ca2+ assay, allowing amino acids that confer antagonistic activity for this receptor to be identified. A second series of individual alpha-conotoxin analogs based on the combinations of defined active amino acid residues from positional scan synthetic combinatorial library screening data were synthesized. Several analogs exhibited significantly improved antagonist activity for the alpha(7) nAChR compared with WT-ImI. Binding interactions between the analogs and the alpha(7) nAChR were explored using a homology model of the amino-terminal domain based on a crystal structure of an acetylcholine-binding protein. Finally, a third series of refined analogs was synthesized based on modeling studies, which led to several analogs with refined pharmacological properties. Of the 96 individual alpha-conotoxin analogs synthesized, three displayed > or =10-fold increases in antagonist potency compared with WT-ImI."
https://openalex.org/W1981315894,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein of the pentraxin family that binds ligands in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and activates complement. Knowledge of its oligomeric state in solution and at surfaces is essential for functional studies. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that CRP in 2 mm Ca2+ exhibits a rapid pentamer-decamer equilibrium. The proportion of decamer decreased with an increase in NaCl concentration. The sedimentation coefficients s20,w0 of pentameric and decameric CRP were 6.4 S and in excess of 7.6 S, respectively. In the absence of Ca2+, CRP partially dissociates into its protomers and the NaCl concentration dependence of the pentamer-decamer equilibrium is much reduced. By x-ray scattering, the radius of gyration RG values ranged from 3.7 nm for the pentamer to above 4.0 nm for the decamer. An averaged KD value of 21 μm in solution (140 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+) was determined by x-ray scattering and modeling based on crystal structures for the pentamer and decamer. Surface plasmon resonance showed that CRP self-associates on a surface with immobilized CRP with a similar KD value of 23 μm (140 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+), whereas CRP aggregates in low salt.

However, once CRP is denatured, it is rapidly catabolized in normal conditions, and there is no firm evidence for the persistence of monomeric, denatured, or aggregated CRP in vivo (1Pepys M.B.

C-reactive protein modified CRP analytical ultracentrifugation response/resonance unit Protein Data Bank surface plasmon resonance. Native CRP is unglycosylated and consists of five identical subunits arranged non-covalently as a cyclic pentamer with a central pore. When co-crystallized with Ca2+ and phosphorylcholine, each subunit has a phosphocholine ligand-binding site proximate to two bound Ca2+ ions held 0.4 nm apart by acidic side chains on the B (B = binding) face of the pentamer (1Pepys M.B.

The B face of the pentamer is negatively charged, whereas the A face showed a more varied charge distribution with a ring of negative charge at the central pore (18Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P.

However, in the presence of Ca2+, CRP shows a marked concentration dependence in its scattering and sedimentation properties, showing that self-association had occurred (24Perkins S.J. Pepys M.B. Protides Biol. Fluids Proc. Colloq. 1986; 34: 323-326Google Scholar, 25Blizniukov O.P. Kozmin L.D. Falikova V.V. Martynov A.I. Tischenko V.M. Mol.

In contradiction to this, crystallographic studies in 100 mm NaCl in the absence of Ca2+ suggested that CRP formed a decamer through an A face-A face association of two pentamers (20Ramadan M.A. Shrive A.K. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Volanakis J.E. DeLucas L.J. Greenhough T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the unfolding of a large Ca2+-binding loop on the B face after Ca2+ depletion may explain the Ca2+-dependent affinity of CRP for lipids, this Ca2+ site is neither located at the protomer interface nor at the A face. Thus the effect of Ca2+ removal on CRP stability is unclear. Even though Ca2+ is present in at least 2 mm in plasma (28Hurwitz S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 41-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), there is much emphasis in structural literature on the effect of Ca2+ depletion on CRP, even though Ca2+ depletion appears unlikely to occur in vivo. A critical knowledge of the oligomeric state of CRP is essential for understanding its function. Accordingly, a multidisciplinary strategy based on analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and x-ray scattering in solution, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on surfaces established the self-association state of CRP in a concentration range of 0.1–5.4 mg/ml in 2 mm Ca2+. CRP normally circulates in blood at a median value of 0.0008 mg/ml, which can be as low as 50 ng/ml, but this increases to over 0.5 mg/ml following an acute phase stimulus (a range of 0.4 nm to 4.4 μm) (1Pepys M.B. Hirschfield G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). Using previously established methods (29Bonner A. Perrier C. Corthésy B. Perkins S.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 5077-5087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we show from AUC size distribution analyses c(s) that pentamers and decamers of CRP are readily identified, whereas constrained x-ray scattering modeling quantified the amounts of pentamers and decamers in solution. We show that SPR observes a similar degree of CRP self-association with immobilized CRP at surfaces in 140 mm NaCl (31Tanious F.A. Nguyen B. Wilson W.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This joint application of AUC, scattering, and SPR methods shows that CRP with 2 mm Ca2+ exists in what was previously an unidentified rapid pentamer-decamer equilibrium that is NaCl-concentration dependent. Molecular modeling accounted for the formation of decamers in terms of salt bridges between the pentamers. To clarify previous CRP studies without Ca2+, we show that Ca2+ removal leads to the reduced formation of decamers and the partial dissociation of pentamers into monomers. Our study resolves the outcome of previous studies of CRP and its ligands, and emphasizes the importance of physiological 2 mm Ca2+ and 140 mm NaCl when studying the complex between CRP and complement factor H (see accompanying manuscript (51Okemefuna A.I. Nan R. Miller A. Gor J. Perkins S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1053-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). Human CRP was isolated and purified as described previously (32De Beer F.C. Pepys M.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 50: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Samples were extensively dialyzed into 10 mm Tris buffers (with or without 2 mm CaCl2) containing 50 mm NaCl, 140 mm NaCl, or 250 mm NaCl, all at pH 8.0, for AUC and x-ray scattering data acquisition. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), with or without 2 mm CaCl2. Samples were routinely analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after experiments to confirm their integrity. CRP concentrations were determined using an absorption coefficient of 17.5 (1%, 280 nm, 1-cm path length), which is consistent with a value of 19.2 calculated from its composition (33Nelson S.R.

Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). CRP is unglycosylated and its composition resulted in a calculated molecular mass of 115.0 kDa, an unhydrated volume of 150.3 nm3, a hydrated volume of 197.3 nm3, and a partial specific volume v̄ of 0.7408 ml/g (34Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The buffer densities for AUC were measured at 20 °C using an Anton-Paar DMA5000 density meter to be 1.00096 or 1.00092 g/ml (50 mm NaCl), 1.00482 or 1.00455 g/ml (140 mm NaCl), with or without 2 mm CaCl2 in that order, and 1.00934 g/ml (250 mm NaCl). AUC data for CRP were obtained on two Beckman XL-I instruments equipped with AnTi50 and AnTi60 rotors. Sedimentation velocity data were acquired at 20 °C at a rotor speed of 50,000 × g in two-sector cells with column heights of 12 mm. Sedimentation analysis was performed using direct boundary Lamm fits of up to 300 scans using SEDFIT (version 11.0) (35Schuck P. Biophys.

SEDFIT resulted in size-distribution analyses c(s) that assume that all macromolecular species have the same frictional ratio, f/fo. The final SEDFIT analyses used a fixed resolution of 200 and optimized the c(s) fit by floating f/fo and the baseline until the overall root mean square deviations and visual appearance of the fits were satisfactory (see Fig. 2). The percentage fraction of pentamers, decamers, or lower oligomers in the total loading concentration was derived using the c(s) integration function (see Fig. 3).FIGURE 3NaCl concentration and Ca2+ dependence of the pentamer-decamer equilibrium by AUC. At each CRP concentration, the relative percentage of pentamer and decamer corresponds to data obtained at 50,000 r.p.m. The apparent KD value (KD-app) in 50 mm NaCl is estimated as the point of intersection of the two data sets when fitted to a non-linear regression for an exponential rise (decamer: y = y0 + a(1-bx)) or decay (pentamer: y = y0 + a(10)−bx) as appropriate. A, data correspond to 50 mm NaCl (●), 140 mm NaCl (○), and 250 mm NaCl (Δ) in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. B, data correspond to 50 and 140 mm NaCl in the absence of Ca2+.

Storage ring currents ranged from 68 to 77 mA (session 1) and from 70 to 92 mA (session 2). Data were acquired using a recently installed fiber optically coupled high sensitivity and dynamic range CCD detector (FReLoN). Together with a smaller beamstop, this allowed a shorter sample-to-detector distance of 2.0 m to be used and resulted in higher signal-to-noise ratios (38Li K. Okemefuna A.I. Gor J. Hannan J.P. Asokan R. Holers V.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CRP was studied at concentrations between 0.3 and 5.4 mg/ml (with 2 mm Ca2+) or between 0.1 and 2.5 mg/ml (without Ca2+). Sample volumes of 100 μl were measured in flow cells to reduce radiation damage by moving the sample continuously during beam exposure. Sets of 10 frames, with frame durations of 0.2, 0.3, or 0.5 s each were acquired. Buffers were measured using the same exposure times in alternation with the samples to eliminate background subtraction errors. On-line checks during data acquisition confirmed the absence of radiation damage, after which the 10 frames were averaged. Sample temperatures corresponded to ambient conditions at 20 °C. Other details including the data reduction procedure are described elsewhere (39Gilbert H.E. Eaton J.T. Hannan J.P. Holers V.M. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

In a given solute-solvent contrast, the radius of gyration (RG) is a measure of structural elongation if the internal inhomogeneity of scattering densities within the protein has no effect. Guinier analyses at low Q (Q = 4π sin θ/λ; 2θ = scattering angle; λ = wavelength) gives the RG and the forward scattering at zero angle I(0) (40Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering.

Indirect transformation of the scattering data I(Q) in reciprocal space into real space to give the distance distribution function P(r) was carried out using the program GNOM (41Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). P(r)=12π2∫0∞I(Q) Qr sin (Qr)dQ(Eq. 2) P(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances r between volume elements. For this, the x-ray I(Q) curve utilized up to 562 data points in the Q range between 0.05 and 1.9 nm−1. All CRP modeling was based on the crystal structure for the pentamer in the presence of Ca2+ (Protein Data Bank code 1b09) (18Thompson D. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The CRP decamer was formed by superimposition of two pentamers face-to-face upon the Ca2+-depleted decamer structure (PDB code 1lj7) (20Ramadan M.A. Shrive A.K. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Volanakis J.E. DeLucas L.J. Greenhough T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The superimposition resulted in a root mean square deviation of 0.460 nm in α-carbon atoms, and overcame the issue of missing residues in the Ca2+-depleted crystal structure. Insight II 98.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) software on Silicon Graphics OCTANE workstations was used for manipulations. A cube side length of 0.532 nm in combination with a cutoff of 4 atoms was used to convert the coordinates into Debye sphere models with 998 and 1997 spheres that corresponded to the unhydrated pentamer and decamer structures, respectively. The hydration shell was created using HYPRO (42Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Gallimore J.R. Pepys M.B. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), where the optimal total of hydrated spheres in the CRP models were 1310 (pentamer) and 2620 (decamer) (Table 1). The x-ray scattering curves I(Q) for CRP were calculated using the Debye equation adapted to spheres (43Perkins S.J. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 847-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other details are given elsewhere (44Perkins S.J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pentamer and decamer curves were merged in increments of 1% from 0 to 100% of the decamer for comparison with nine x-ray curves in 140 mm NaCl buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+, and six (50 mm NaCl) or four (140 mm NaCl) curves in buffers without Ca2+. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated from the x-ray hydrated sphere models using the HYDRO program (42Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Gallimore J.R. Pepys M.B. Perkins S.J. J. Mol.

To generate a putative decamer with the B faces now in contact with each other, one pentamer in the decamer model was translated by 7.4 nm relative to the other along its central symmetry axis.TABLE 1X-ray scattering and sedimentation coefficient data and modeling of CRPSpheresRGR-factors20,w0KDPentamerDecameraThe experimental value corresponds to the decamer reaction boundary (Fig. 2).nm%SExperimental buffer 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+6.5 ± 0.17.7–8.419 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+3.8–4.5; 3.8–4.3bThe first value is from the Guinier RG analyses (Fig. 4, A and B); the second is from the GNOM P(r) analyses (Fig. 5).6.4 ± 0.27.6–8.222 ± 5 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+6.4 ± 0.37.5–7.7NAcNA, not available. 50 mm NaCl buffer, no Ca2+3.8–4.1; 3.7–4.1bThe first value is from the Guinier RG analyses (Fig. 4, A and B); the second is from the GNOM P(r) analyses (Fig. 5).6.4 ± 0.17.5–8.9NA 140 mm NaCl buffer, no Ca2+3.6–4.1; 3.6–4.0bThe first value is from the Guinier RG analyses (Fig. 4, A and B); the second is from the GNOM P(r) analyses (Fig. 5).6.3 ± 0.17.3–7.7NAScattering modeling CRP pentamer1256dThe optimum number of hydrated spheres predicted from the sequence are 1310 and 2620 for pentamer and decamer, respectively.3.76.0–6.2 CRP decamer2492dThe optimum number of hydrated spheres predicted from the sequence are 1310 and 2620 for pentamer and decamer, respectively.4.29.8 Best fit scattering curves (2 mm Ca2+)2.0–3.723 Best fit scattering curves (no Ca2+)1.8–3.5; 1.7–2.8eThe first value is for 50 mm NaCl; the second is for 140 mm NaCl.a The experimental value corresponds to the decamer reaction boundary (Fig. 2).b The first value is from the Guinier RG analyses (Fig. 4, A and B); the second is from the GNOM P(r) analyses (Fig. 5).c NA, not available.d The optimum number of hydrated spheres predicted from the sequence are 1310 and 2620 for pentamer and decamer, respectively.e The first value is for 50 mm NaCl; the second is for 140 mm NaCl. Open table in a new tab The self-association of CRP was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore X100 instrument and version 1.1 of its evaluation software (GE Healthcare). Native CRP stored in 140 mm NaCl buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+ was coupled to the flow cell of a carboxylated dextran (CM5) research grade sensor chip via a standard amine coupling procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg/ml of CRP in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.3) in the presence of at least 20 μm Ca2+ was injected over flow cell 2 for 45 min until 150 response units (RU) was attained. Between experiments, the CRP-immobilized chip was stored in a buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+. A control surface was prepared identically on flow cell 1 but without protein immobilization. Binding and equilibrium analyses using these CRP-immobilized chips were performed at 25 °C in duplicate or triplicate runs using the appropriate Biacore X100 wizards at flow rates of 10–30 μl/min. Regeneration after each run was achieved by pulsing 10 mm acetate buffer, 2 m NaCl (pH 4.6) across both flow cells once for 30 s. Running buffer was either Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20 surfactant, pH 8.0) or HBS (HEPES-buffered saline, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20 surfactant, pH 8.0), with or without 2 mm CaCl2. Size exclusion chromatography is a qualitative method that measures the effective hydrodynamic volume of a protein (47Mori S. Barth H.G. Size Exclusion Chromatography. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999Crossref Google Scholar). CRP may self-associate into decamers (20Ramadan M.A. Shrive A.K. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Volanakis J.E. DeLucas L.J. Greenhough T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and/or dissociate into protomers when stored in the absence of Ca2+ (26Motie M. Brockmeier S. Potempa L.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4435-4441PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wu Y. Li S.R. Wang H.W. Sui S.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 67: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar). This was reinvestigated by size exclusion chromatography of CRP in 140 mm NaCl buffer. CRP stored at 1.0 mg/ml at 4 °C in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ eluted as a single clean peak in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1). Molecular weight standards indicated that this peak corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of 80–94 kDa, and was therefore assigned to the pentamer. There was no evidence of a decamer. However, when CRP was stored at 4 °C in a buffer lacking Ca2+ for 12 weeks, a second peak was observed at a later elution volume (Fig. 1), in agreement with earlier observations (27Wu Y. Li S.R. Wang H.W. Sui S.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 67: 1377-1382PubMed Google Scholar). This second peak had an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa and corresponded to ∼10% of the total eluted protein. It was concluded that partial dissociation into CRP monomers and other lower molecular weight forms occurred slowly in the absence of Ca2+. Small shifts in the elution position of CRP to earlier elution positions were observed with increased storage periods in Ca2+-depleted buffer (Fig. 1). This is attributed to small increases in the amounts of aggregated forms of CRP. AUC studies macromolecular structures in solution by following their sedimentation behavior in a high centrifugal force (48Cole J.L. Lary J.W. Moody T.P. Laue T.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 84: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The much improved resolution of sedimentation coefficient distribution analyses c(s) from sedimentation velocity experiments using Beckman Proteomelab XL-I instruments compared with older technology was used to monitor CRP self-association. The observed sedimentation boundaries in sedimentation velocity experiments were fitted to yield a c(s) plot according to the Lamm equation using SEDFIT (“Experimental Procedures”). This takes into account all the species present in the sample, although the algorithm assumes that the same frictional ratio applies for all the sedimenting species. The number of species is determined from the peaks observed in the c(s) plot. Macromolecular elongation is monitored through the sedimentation coefficient s20,w0 values. The effect of NaCl concentration on CRP was studied in the concentration range of 0.2 to 2.5 mg/ml in 50, 140, and 250 mm NaCl buffers, all containing 2 mm Ca2+. The c(s) analyses of interference optics data using SEDFIT resulted in good sedimentation boundary fits (top of Fig. 2, A–C). In all three buffers, a single species was observed at the lowest concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, whereas two species were observed above 1 mg/ml. The c(M) mass distribution plot showed a molecular mass of 118 ± 23 kDa for the single species. This was accordingly assigned to pentameric CRP, which has a sequence-calculated molecular mass of 115.0 kDa. The pentamer was consistently observed at s20,w0 values of 6.5 ± 0.1, 6.4 ± 0.2, and 6.4 ± 0.3 S at all concentrations in 50, 140, and 250 mm NaCl buffers, respectively, indicating that the NaCl concentration has no major effect on the CRP co"
https://openalex.org/W1600357478,"Nuclear expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), which supports tissue differentiation through several antiproliferative protein–protein interactions, augurs terminal differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. C/EBPα is also a tumor suppressor, but in many tumors its antiproliferative interactions may be attenuated by de-phosphorylation. C/EBPα acts as a corepressor of the classical androgen response element (ARE)-mediated gene activation by the androgen receptor (AR), but this is paradoxical as the genotropic actions of AR are crucial not only for the growth of the prostate but also for its maintenance and function. We show that DNA-bound C/EPBα recruits AR to activate transcription. C/EBPα-dependent trans-activation by AR also overrode suppression of AREs by C/EBPα elsewhere in a promoter. This mechanism was remarkable in that its androgen dependence was apparently for nuclear translocation of AR; it was otherwise androgen independent, flutamide insensitive and tolerant to disruption of AR dimerization. Gene response profiles and global chromatin associations in situ supported the direct bimodal regulation of AR transcriptional signaling by C/EBPα. This unique mechanism explains the functional coordination between AR and C/EPBα in the prostate and also shows that hormone-refractory AR signaling in prostate cancer could occur through receptor tethering."
https://openalex.org/W1999160345,"We identified a sequence homologous to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of Bcl-2 proteins in SOUL. Tissues expressed the protein to different extents. It was predominantly located in the cytoplasm, although a fraction of SOUL was associated with the mitochondria that increased upon oxidative stress. Recombinant SOUL protein facilitated mitochondrial permeability transition and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and facilitated the release of proapoptotic mitochondrial intermembrane proteins (PMIP) at low calcium and phosphate concentrations in a cyclosporine A-dependent manner in vitro in isolated mitochondria. Suppression of endogenous SOUL by diced small interfering RNA in HeLa cells increased their viability in oxidative stress. Overexpression of SOUL in NIH3T3 cells promoted hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and stimulated the release of PMIP but did not enhance caspase-3 activation. Despite the release of PMIP, SOUL facilitated predominantly necrotic cell death, as revealed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining. This necrotic death could be the result of SOUL-facilitated collapse of MMP demonstrated by JC-1 fluorescence. Deletion of the putative BH3 domain sequence prevented all of these effects of SOUL. Suppression of cyclophilin D prevented these effects too, indicating that SOUL facilitated mitochondrial permeability transition in vivo. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), which can counteract the mitochondria-permeabilizing effect of BH3 domain proteins, also prevented SOUL-facilitated collapse of MMP and cell death. These data indicate that SOUL can be a novel member of the BH3 domain-only proteins that cannot induce cell death alone but can facilitate both outer and inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and predominantly necrotic cell death in oxidative stress."

In this model, the position of the first transcribed guanosine residue of the cap structure overlaps with the position of the penultimate adenosine residue of the poly(A) substrate, suggesting that the guanosine residue of the cap structure and the penultimate nucleotide of the poly(A) tail to some extent are recognized by the same set of amino acid residues. Here, we have investigated the mechanisms behind the recognition of adenosine residues by PARN. Most importantly, we demonstrate that PARN has specificity for recognition of adenosine residues in its active site and that the nucleotides surrounding the scissile bond are critical for adenosine recognition.

Virtanen A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2006; 39: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of purified PARN or mutants thereof were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and the purity was analyzed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie staining. Purified polypeptides were either snap-frozen directly in TALON elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm imidazole) or dialyzed overnight against Buffer A (32 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) or Buffer B (125 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl) and subsequently aliquoted and snap-frozen. Aliquots were stored at −70 °C until used. The RNA substrates A5 to A20, G20, C20, U20, AAA, GGG, CCC, UUU, AXX, XXA, XAX, AXA, AAX, and XAA (where X denotes G, C, or U) were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Before use, the RNA oligonucleotides were deprotected according to the instructions from the manufacturer. 10 pmol of RNA substrate was 5′-labeled with 20 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare or PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by 10–15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (United States Biochemical Corp. or Fermentas) in 30-μl reactions at 37 °C for 45 min. Reaction conditions were as follows: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (when using T4 polynucleotide kinase purchased from United States Biochemical Corp.) or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermidine, and 1 mm EDTA (when using T4 polynucleotide kinase purchased from Fermentas). The labeled nucleotides were then fractionated by electrophoresis in 25% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), and bands were cut out and eluted in water. Poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), and poly(C) were purchased from Sigma. The 44-nucleotide heteropolymeric RNA (5′-CCA UCU CAU CCC UGC GUG UCC CAU CUG UUC CCU CCC UGU CUC AG-3′) was purchased from Metabion. 10-μl reactions were performed in Buffer A using 10 nm U20 RNA-oligo and 2.5–40 μm PARN, respectively. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 5 μl of loading dye (8% glycerol, 0.15% bromphenol blue/xylene cyanol) was added to the reaction prior to loading the samples to nondenaturing gels (0.5× TBE, 6% 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, v/v) pre-run at 200 V, 10 watts for 30 min at 4 °C. The gels were run for 1 h, 30 min at 10 watts at 4 °C and dried in a Bio-Rad gel dryer for 1 h and finally exposed and scanned by a 400S PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Reactions using 32P-labeled oligo(A), varying in length between A5 and A20 or U20 RNA were performed as described under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” The RNA was titrated between 1 and 30 nm when U20 was used and between 2.5 and 1000 nm when oligo(A) substrates of different lengths were used. The concentration of PARN (between 1 and 7 nm) was experimentally determined for each complex and was kept fixed during each titration series. After 15 min of incubation, the reaction was applied to a Protran BA 85 cellulose nitrate membrane (catalogue no. 10 401191, Schleicher & Schuell) preincubated in Buffer A and mounted on a filter device with no vacuum applied. The membrane was washed with 0.75 ml of Buffer A with vacuum applied and dried, and finally the amount of bound protein-RNA complex was quantified in a Beckman Coulter LC6500 scintillation counter. The dissociation constant, KD, was obtained by plotting experimental data and fitting curves with nonlinear regression (Origin 7 software, OriginLab Corp.) using binding Equation 1[PL]=12([L0]+[P0]+KD−([L0]+[P0]+KD)2−4⋅[L0][P0])(Eq. 1) when oligo(A) substrates of different lengths were used or the binding Equation 2[PL]=[L][P0]KD+[L](Eq. 2) when U20 was used. [P0] is the active concentration of PARN polypeptides. Conditions for the activity assays were as follows: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 nm to 20 μm RNA substrate (A20, U20, G20, C20, A3, U3, C3, G3, AXA, XAX, XXA, AXX, AAX, or XAA (where X denotes G, C, or U)) as indicated and 0.88–256 nm PARN as indicated. When 20-nucleotide-long substrates were used, the reaction volume was 10 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of stop solution (83% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 80 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). For time course assays, reaction volume was 120 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for the indicated times. For each time point, 10 μl of the reaction volume was removed and mixed with 10 μl of stop solution. The resulting products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 25% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The gels were run at 7.5 watts for 2 h, 15 min at room temperature and visualized using a 400S PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). When trinucleotides were used as substrates, the same reaction conditions, as described above, were used. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA to the reaction. Subsequently, 1 μl of the reaction was applied to a 20 × 20-cm TLC plate using 0.5 m LiCl as solvent. The plate was dried before being exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). The screen was scanned, and the result was analyzed using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Data were plotted using the Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corp.). For time course assays, the reaction volume was 40–90 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for the indicated time. For each time point, 5–10 μl of the reaction volume was removed and stopped by adding 1–2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The reaction products were then separated by TLC (20 × 30 cm for ACC and AAC, 20 × 20 cm for the rest of the substrates) and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis as described above. Reaction conditions were as described above. The concentrations of the substrate and PARN or mutants thereof were adjusted so multiple turnover conditions were valid. AAA, UUU, CCC, GGG, ACA, CAC, CCA, ACC, AAC, and CAA were titrated between 0.5 and 400, 20 and 1000, 20 and 1000, 25 and 1000, 20 and 400, 20 and 400, 20 and 400, 3 and 300, 10 and 400, and 2–40 μm, respectively. The concentrations of PARN, PARN(L291A), or PARN(M425A) were between 4 and 209 nm depending on the substrate. The reaction volume was 10 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C for 1–30 min depending on the substrate, ensuring that the quantification was done in the linear range of the reaction. For AAA, UUU, GGG, ACA, CCA, CAA, and CCC, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA to the reaction mixture before applying 1 μl of the solution onto a 20 × 20-cm plate for TLC and proceeded as described above. For CAC, ACC, and AAC, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (83% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 80 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). The resulting products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 25% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The gels were run at 10 watts for 1 h, 30 min at room temperature and visualized using a 400S PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The kinetic constants were calculated by curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten Equation 3,V=Vmax[S]Km+[S](Eq. 3) using the Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). To investigate molecular mechanisms behind the high specificity for PARN in degrading poly(A), we compared the hydrolytic activity when using 20-nucleotide-long homopolymeric RNA substrates, i.e. A20, U20, C20, or G20 in the presence of increasing amounts of PARN (Fig. 1). In keeping with earlier studies (3Aström J. Aström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Aström J. Aström A. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

At higher concentrations of PARN and when using A20 as the substrate, we detected reaction products corresponding to A4 and A2 in addition to the final mononucleotide product A1 (Fig. 1A). Short oligonucleotide products were also observed when we used the polypyrimidine substrates U20 and C20 (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, the length of the short oligopyrimidine reaction products differed compared with the oligonucleotide reaction products that were generated when we used A20 as the substrate. In the case of U20, we could observe three oligonucleotide products being five, four, and two nucleotides in lengths (Fig. 1B), although only the C5 and C4 products were detected when the C20 substrate was used at the two highest tested concentrations of PARN (Fig. 1C). The reason for not detecting the C2 product was probably due to the poorer performance of this substrate relative to the A20 and U20 substrates (see also Table 1). To investigate if the detected oligonucleotide reaction products behaved as true reaction intermediates, we followed the hydrolysis of A20 and U20 during time course experiments. Fig. 1 shows that the oligonucleotide reaction products for both substrates appeared and turned over during the duration of the reaction (Fig. 1, E and F), just as predicted for bona fide reaction intermediates.TABLE 1Summary of kinetic parametersPARN polypeptideaPARN mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.SubstrateKmVmaxbThe given Vmax values are normalized to the used amount of PARN polypeptide or mutant thereof and represent the measured maximum reaction rate for the conversion of the trinucleotide substrate into a dinucleotide product.Vmax/KmRelative Vmax/KmRatiocThe values represent the calculated ratios between the Vmax/Km values for the AAA and ACA substrates for each of the investigated PARN polypeptides.

Open table in a new tab The hydrolysis of A20 and U20 implies that PARN can interact with and form complexes with poly(A) and poly(U). It has previously been demonstrated that PARN interacts with poly(A) (11Nilsson P. Henriksson N. Niedzwiecka A. Balatsos N.A. Kokkoris K. Eriksson J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32902-32911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate if PARN also could interact with poly(U), we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using U20 as the probe. Fig. 2 (lanes 1–6) shows that PARN forms a stable complex with U20. The addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled poly(U), poly(G), poly(C), and heteropolymeric single-stranded RNA showed that the complex was competed efficiently by the addition of poly(U) (Fig. 2, lanes 7–11) or heteropolymeric RNA (lanes 22–26), to some extent by poly(G) (lanes 12–16), and very poorly by poly(C) (lanes 17–21). Subsequently, we determined, using a filter binding assay (see under “Experimental Procedures”), the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the PARN-U20 complex and found it to be 4.3 ± 0.8 nm, in the same range as the KD value for the PARN-A20 complex (11Nilsson P. Henriksson N. Niedzwiecka A. Balatsos N.A. Kokkoris K. Eriksson J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32902-32911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taken together, these sets of analyses confirmed earlier studies (for example Ref. 10Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that poly(A) is the preferred substrate for PARN and that poly(U) is a reasonable good substrate. The analyses also revealed that PARN degraded long and short substrates with different efficiencies, as reaction intermediates were detected during the course of the hydrolytic reaction. In the case of A20, we could detect two size classes of oligonucleotide intermediates, and we could detect three size classes of intermediates when we used U20 as the substrate. One obvious explanation for the appearance of short reaction intermediates could be that short substrates bind less efficiently to PARN than longer substrates. To investigate this possibility, we investigated if the KD value for the PARN-oligo(A) complex was dependent on the length of oligo(A). The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and show that the KD values increased sharply when the substrates were six residues or shorter. We were not able to establish KD values for oligonucleotides being four residues or shorter. Thus, the appearance of the reaction intermediates is in keeping with the proposal that the short intermediates accumulated, at least to some extent, because of their poor interaction with PARN. The appearance of the short reaction intermediates suggests that A20 and U20 are degraded through at least three and four kinetically distinct reaction phases, respectively. The presence of kinetically distinct reaction phases that depend on the length of the substrate will undoubtedly affect a kinetic analysis with the aim to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the interaction and the specificity for recognition of adenosine residues in the active site of PARN. It is, for example, very likely that substrate-binding properties outside the active site will affect the overall catalytic performance of PARN when long substrates are used relative shorter substrates, as a long substrate besides interacting with the active site also very likely will interact with either or both of the RNA binding regions, i.e. the RRM or the R3H, that are present in PARN. To avoid this particular problem, we therefore used trinucleotides as the substrates in our kinetic analysis of PARN specificity. Typical results from PARN titration assays, where homotrinucleotides A3, G3, U3, and C3 were used as the substrates, are shown in Fig. 4 and indicate that A3 is the preferred substrate relative to the other three homotrinucleotide substrates. To quantify this observation, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters for the four homotrinucleotides. The results are summarized in Table 1 and show that the adenosine-containing trinucleotide substrate was the preferred substrate for PARN. Furthermore, and in accordance with the hydrolytic performance when using 20-nucleotide-long homopolymeric substrates (Fig. 1), U3 was hydrolyzed quite efficiently, whereas the C3 trinucleotide was a poor substrate for PARN. However, and in contrast to the homopolymeric G20 substrate, which was left almost untouched by PARN (Fig. 1D), the G3 substrate was almost as efficiently hydrolyzed by PARN as the U3 substrate. This shows that the active site of PARN has the capacity to accept and hydrolyze guanosine-containing substrates and suggests that the inability of PARN to digest G20 was not caused by properties within the active site. We have not investigated any further the reasons behind the inability to degrade G20, but it seems likely that the formation of G-quartets, which are quadruplex structures formed by guanosine-containing oligonucleotides (reviewed in Ref. 24Davis J.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 668-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), could be the main cause for the inability of PARN to degrade the G20 homopolymer. Taken together, the kinetic analysis of the homotrinucleotide substrates revealed that the adenosine trinucleotide substrate was ∼10-fold more efficiently hydrolyzed than the guanosine or uridine trinucleotide substrates and ∼30-fold more efficiently used than the C3 substrates. Thus, we conclude that the active site of PARN per se harbors specificity for recognition of adenosine. To further characterize the mechanisms behind adenosine recognition in the active site of PARN, we compared the catalytic performance of PARN when using trinucleotide substrates containing either one or two adenosine residues, i.e. the trinucleotides AXX, XAX, XXA, AAX, AXA, and XAA, where X denotes G, U, or C. Results from such analyses are shown in supplemental Fig. S1 and indicate the following. (i) The two nucleotides surrounding the scissile bond are primary determinants for adenosine specificity in the active site of PARN. (ii) Substrates containing at least one cytosine residue either at the penultimate or 3′-terminal positions in general are poorer substrates than the corresponding substrates containing at least one guanosine or uridine residue at these positions. (iii) The 5′ end-located nucleotide of the trinucleotide substrate does not appear to play any critical role for adenosine recognition by the active site of PARN. To investigate in greater detail if these proposals are correct, we focused our studies on the eight adenosine/cytosine-containing trinucleotides, because our initial screening analysis presented in supplemental Fig. S1 revealed larger differences in catalytic performance among such substrates than among the corresponding adenine/guanosine or adenine/uridine containing trinucleotide substrates. First, we investigated the degradation of the eight substrates during a time course experiment (Fig. 5), and subsequently we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters for the eight selected substrates (Table 1). Based on these two analyses, we could identify three categories of substrates as follows: an efficient group consisting of the CAA and AAA trinucleotides; an intermediate group wherein all the members contained one adenosine residue either at the penultimate or at the terminal 3′ end position; and finally a very inefficient group of substrates wherein neither of the two trinucleotides, i.e. ACC and CCC, contained an adenosine residue at the penultimate or the terminal 3′ end position. An analysis of the kinetic parameters in Table 1 revealed that the poorer performance of the intermediate group relative to AAA and CAA was primarily due to an increased Km value and that the poorer performance of the inefficient group, i.e. ACC and CCC, relative to the intermediate group was caused by a drop in the Vmax value. Taken together, the kinetic analysis confirmed that the two nucleotides located at the penultimate and at the terminal 3′ end positions, i.e. the two nucleotides surrounding the scissile bond, play an important role as key residues required for the high specificity of PARN in degrading adenosine-containing substrates. Two amino acid residues, i.e. Phe-115 and Ile-34, located in the active site of PARN have recently been shown to participate both structurally and functionally in the recognition of adenosine residues (15Wu M. Reuter M. Lilie H. Liu Y. Wahle E. Song H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The residue Phe-115 stacks against the 3′ end-located adenosine base, whereas the residue Ile-34 stacks against the base of the penultimate nucleotide. Furthermore, it was observed in the structure of PARN in complex with the cap analogue m7GpppG (16Wu M. Nilsson P. Henriksson N. Niedzwiecka A. Lim M.K. Cheng Z. Kokkoris K. Virtanen A. Song H. Structure. 2009; 17: 276-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that the first transcribed guanosine nucleotide of the cap structure was located in a hydrophobic pocket comprising amino acid residues Ile-34, Leu-57, Leu-290, Leu-291, and Met-425 and that the guanosine base in the closed conformation of the active site co-localized with the adenosine base of the penultimate nucleotide when poly(A) is bound to the active site. Of these residues, Leu-291 and Met-425 clamp the base of the first transcribed guanosine residue and thus must contribute significantly to the interaction between PARN and the guanosine base. Because of this, we decided to investigate if any of these two amino acid residues, in addition to the previously identified Ile-34 residue, could play a role in the recognition of the penultimate adenosine base. For this purpose, we investigated the catalytic performance of the two mutant polypeptides, PARN(L291A) and PARN(M425A), using three different substrates, i.e. AAA, ACA, and AAC. The reason for using these three substrates was that we would expect a smaller relative difference in catalytic performance between the two substrates AAA and ACA if any of the two residues Leu-291 and Met-425 played a role in the recognition of the adenosine base at the penultimate position, whereas a correspondingly smaller relative difference would not be observed between the two substrates AAA and AAC unless any of the two amino acid residues Leu-291 or Met-425 played a role in the recognition of the 3′ end-located adenosine base. The results from these comparisons are shown in Table 1, and it can be concluded that both mutant polypeptides were defective in their catalytic performance relative to the wild type PARN polypeptide. Interestingly, both mutant polypeptides showed a defect in their specificity toward the ACA substrate as they could not select as well as the wild type PARN polypeptide could against the presence of a cytosine residue located at the penultimate position of the substrate, i.e. wild type PARN showed a 5-fold preference for the AAA substrate versus ACA, whereas both mutants showed a 2-fold preference for AAA versus ACA. In contrast, both mutant PARN polypeptides could still select against a cytosine residue at the terminal 3′ end position. Taken together, we conclude that both amino acid residues Leu-291 and Met-425 most likely participate in providing specificity toward the recognition of an adenosine residue at the penultimate position. In this study, we have investigated molecular mechanisms behind the high specificity by PARN to degrade poly(A). Most importantly, our study revealed that the active site of PARN per se harbors specificity for the recognition of adenosine residues (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Table 1). We also found that the two nucleotides surrounding the scissile bond were critical residues behind the high specificity (Table 1, Fig. 5, and supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that both these two residues are specifically recognized by amino acid residues in the active site of PARN. Two amino acid residues of PARN, i.e. Phe-115 and Ile-34, have previously been identified as critical residues required for efficient hydrolysis of poly(A) and recognition of the 3′ end-located adenosine residue (15Wu M. Reuter M. Lilie H. Liu Y. Wahle E. Song H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to these two amino acid residues, we identified two residues, i.e. Leu-291 and Met-425 (Table 1), that were required for efficient hydrolysis and very likely also participated in the recognition of the penultimate adenosine residue of the substrate. Thus, four amino acid residues have so far experimentally been identified as candidate residues that participate in the recognition of adenosine residues in the active site of PARN. At present, it is not obvious how these four residues would discriminate an adenosine base from the other nucleotide bases because none of them appears to form base-specific hydrogen bonds with the adenosine base. This implies that other amino acid residues beside the four that have been identified so far must play a role in the recognition of adenosine residues by the active site of PARN. Despite this uncertainty, this study has nevertheless revealed the presence of two nucleotide binding pockets in the active site of PARN that interact and recognize the bases of the two nucleotides surrounding the scissile phosphodiester bond that PARN hydrolyzes. It is obvious that further studies, and in particular a crystal structure of the binary PARN-poly(A) complex wherein amino acid residues that interact with the adenosine bases in the active site are visualized, are required to fully understand how the active site of PARN specifically recognizes adenosine residues. We have recently reported that the position of the penultimate base of the poly(A) substrate partially overlaps with the binding site of the first transcribed nucleotide of the cap structure (16Wu M. Nilsson P. Henriksson N. Niedzwiecka A. Lim M.K. Cheng Z. Kokkoris K. Virtanen A. Song H. Structure. 2009; 17: 276-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggests and is in agreement with our current study that this binding pocket can accommodate other bases than adenosine and yet provide enough specificity to preferentially hydrolyze adenosine-containing substrates. In light of this, it is interesting to note that a recent structural study of the related Schizosaccharomyces pombe DEDDh deadenylase Pop2p (25Andersen K.R. Jonstrup A.T. Van L.B. Brodersen D.E. RNA. 2009; 15: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Jonstrup A.T. Andersen K.R. Van L.B. Brodersen D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3153-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has revealed the presence of a highly dynamic active site that participates in providing both specificity for substrate recognition and movements required for catalytic action. The dynamic nature of the Pop2p active site could very well be a property that is shared by the active site of PARN and thereby provides a possibility for the PARN active site on one subunit to accommodate nucleotides belonging to one end of the mRNA, i.e. either the cap structure or the poly(A) tail, whereas the other subunit at the same time could accommodate the other end of the mRNA substrate. One interesting observation in this study was the identification of the three kinetically distinct reaction phases by which PARN degraded an oligonucleotide consisting of 20 adenosine residues (Fig. 1). The fast phase resulted in the accumulation of an intermediate product being 4 nucleotides long. The accumulation of such an intermediate could be due to the presence of an RNA-binding domain located 5 nucleotides away from the active site. In the most recently determined structure of PARN (16Wu M. Nilsson P. Henriksson N. Niedzwiecka A. Lim M.K. Cheng Z. Kokkoris K. Virtanen A. Song H. Structure. 2009; 17: 276-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the RRM was located at approximately a distance from the active site of PARN that corresponds to the length of a 5-nucleotide-long oligonucleotide. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the RRM of PARN fulfills the role as an RNA-binding site that docks and even participates in pushing the poly(A) substrate into the active site of PARN. It is worthwhile to mention that a similar scenario has been proposed and supported by structural evidence for RNase II (27Amblar M. Barbas A. Fialho A.M. Arraiano C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the intermediate being two adenosine residues in length is most likely due to differences in substrate binding properties within the active site per se. Recently, several poly(U) polymerases that add short oligo(U) tails to the 3′ end of RNA have been discovered in eukaryotic cells (29Kwak J.E. Wickens M. RNA. 2007; 13: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the presence of oligo(U) tails at the 3′ ends of histone mRNA (30Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and to polyadenylated actin mRNA (31Rissland O.S. Mikulasova A. Norbury C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3612-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) has been obtained. The functional significance of the addition of oligo(U) tails is not yet fully understood, although it appears likely that the oligo(U) tails could play a role in both RNA stabilization and destabilization (reviewed in Refs. 32Rissland O.S. Norbury C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been shown that the 3′-terminal oligo(U) tract mediates stimulation of decapping (34Song M.G. Kiledjian M. RNA. 2007; 13: 2356-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In a novel pathway of bulk mRNA turnover in S. pombe, adding uridines to the poly(A) tail of mRNA (3′-uridylation) has been shown to initiate the degradation pathway by stimulating decapping (35Rissland O.S. Norbury C.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the oligo(U) tails at the 3′ end of mRNA play an important role in mRNA decay. Exonucleolytic degradation of poly(U) suggests that poly(U)-degrading enzymes are present in eukaryotic cells. In view of this, it will be interesting in the future to investigate if the poly(U) degrading activity of PARN could play a role in mRNA decay involving oligo(U) tails.

https://openalex.org/W1986454252,"The scaffold attachment factors SAFB1 and SAFB2 are paralogs, which are involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress response. They have been shown to function as estrogen receptor corepressors, and there is evidence for a role in breast tumorigenesis. To identify their endogenous target genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we utilized a combined approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip and gene expression array studies. By performing ChIP-on-chip on microarrays containing 24,000 promoters, we identified 541 SAFB1/SAFB2-binding sites in promoters of known genes, with significant enrichment on chromosomes 1 and 6. Gene expression analysis revealed that the majority of target genes were induced in the absence of SAFB1 or SAFB2 and less were repressed. Interestingly, there was no significant overlap between the genes identified by ChIP-on-chip and gene expression array analysis, suggesting regulation through regions outside the proximal promoters. In contrast to SAFB2, which shared most of its target genes with SAFB1, SAFB1 had many unique target genes, most of them involved in the regulation of the immune system. A subsequent analysis of the estrogen treatment group revealed that 12% of estrogen-regulated genes were dependent on SAFB1, with the majority being estrogen-repressed genes. These were primarily genes involved in apoptosis, such as BBC3, NEDD9, and OPG. Thus, this study confirms the primary role of SAFB1/SAFB2 as corepressors and also uncovers a previously unknown role for SAFB1 in the regulation of immune genes and in estrogen-mediated repression of genes."
https://openalex.org/W2014158703,"Avian influenza viruses (AIV) of the H5N1 subtype have caused morbidity and mortality in humans. Although some migratory birds constitute the natural reservoir for this virus, chickens may play a role in transmission of the virus to humans. Despite the importance of avian species in transmission of AIV H5N1 to humans, very little is known about host immune system interactions with this virus in these species. The objective of the present study was to identify putative T cell epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of an H5 AIV in chickens. Using an overlapping peptide library covering the HA protein, we identified a 15-mer peptide, H5246–260, within the HA1 domain which induced activation of T cells in chickens immunized against the HA antigen of an H5 virus. Furthermore, H5246–260 epitope was found to be presented by both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, leading to activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, marked by proliferation and expression of interferon (IFN)-γ by both of these cell subsets as well as the expression of granzyme A by CD8+ T cells. This is the first report of a T cell epitope of AIV recognized by chicken T cells. Furthermore, this study extends the previous finding of the existence of dual-specific epitopes in other species to chickens. Taken together, these results elucidate some of the mechanisms of immune response to AIV in chickens and provide a platform for creation of rational vaccines against AIV in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2044306455,"Nogo-A, a member of the reticulon family, is present in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Nogo-A in central nervous system (CNS) myelin prevents axonal regeneration through interaction with Nogo receptor 1, but the function of Nogo-A in neurons is less known. We found that after axonal injury, Nogo-A is increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons unable to regenerate following a dorsal root injury or a sciatic nerve ligation-cut injury and that exposure in vitro to CNS myelin dramatically enhanced neuronal Nogo-A mRNA and protein through activation of RhoA while inhibiting neurite growth. Knocking down neuronal Nogo-A by small interfering RNA results in a marked increase of neurite outgrowth. We constructed a nonreplicating herpes simplex virus vector (QHNgSR) to express a truncated soluble fragment of Nogo receptor 1 (NgSR). NgSR released from QHNgSR prevented myelin inhibition of neurite extension by hippocampal and DRG neurons in vitro. NgSR prevents RhoA activation by myelin and decreases neuronal Nogo-A. Subcutaneous inoculation of QHNgSR to transduce DRG neurons resulted in improved regeneration of myelinated fibers in both the dorsal root and the spinal dorsal root entry zone, with concomitant improvement in sensory behavior. The results indicate that neuronal Nogo-A is an important intermediate in neurite growth dynamics and its expression is regulated by signals related to axonal injury and regeneration, that CNS myelin appears to activate signaling events that mimic axonal injury, and that NgSR released from QHNgSR may be used to improve recovery after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2015239357,"Imbalances in chromosome 11q occur in approximately 30% of primary neuroblastoma and are associated with poor outcome. It has been suggested that 11q loss constitutes a distinct clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroup by affecting expression levels of corresponding genes. This study analysed the relationship of 11q loss, clinical phenotype and global transcriptomic profiles in four clinico-genetic subgroups (11q alteration/favourable outcome, n=7; 11q alteration/unfavourable outcome, n=14; no 11q alteration/favourable outcome, n=81; no 11q alteration/unfavourable outcome, n=8; tumours with MYCN amplification and/or 1p loss were excluded). Unsupervised and supervised comparisons of gene expression profiles consistently showed significantly different mRNA patterns between favourable and unfavourable neuroblastomas, both in the subgroups with and without 11q loss. In contrast, favourable tumours with and without 11q loss showed highly similar transcriptomic profiles. Disproportionate downregulation of 11q genes was observed only in unfavourable tumours with 11q loss. The diverging molecular profiles were neither caused by considerable differences in the size of the deleted regions nor by differential methylation patterns of 11q genes. Together, this study shows that neuroblastoma with 11q loss comprises two biological subgroups that differ both in their clinical phenotype and gene expression patterns, indicating that 11q loss is not a primary determinant of neuroblastoma tumour behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2003190622,"Although Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein-1 (Miz-1) is known to be a poxvirus and zinc-finger (POZ) transcription factor required for Myc transcriptional repression, additional regulatory function of Miz-1 is less well understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified human alternate reading frame (ARF) protein as a novel interaction partner of Miz-1. The zinc-finger domain of Miz-1 is involved in its binding to ARF. In addition, we found that Miz-1 was able to interact with p53 through its DNA-binding domain, thus to diminish the binding of p53 to its target promoter and inhibit p53-mediated gene transcription. Interestingly, the Miz-1-regulated p53 transcriptional suppression does not require the presence of ARF or Mdm2. Importantly, ARF and p53 were found to competitively bind to Miz-1 in regulating p53-mediated transcription, and this conclusion was verified by both in vitro binding assay and competitive chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using a bona fide p53 endogenous Bax and Puma promoters. Thus, our study reveals that Miz-1 acts as a p53 suppressor by interfering with p53 DNA-binding ability, and ARF is able to counteract the suppression of Miz-1 on p53 by direct binding to Miz-1, suggesting that Miz-1 is a novel mediator in the ARF-p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086697621,"Osteopontin is a secreted, integrin-binding and phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein, which has an important role in tumour progression. We have shown that Wnt, Ets, AP-1, c-jun and beta-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf-1 stimulates OPN transcription in rat mammary carcinoma cells by binding to a specific promoter sequence. However, co-repressors of OPN have not been identified. In this study, we have used the bacterial two-hybrid system to isolate cDNA-encoding proteins that bind to OPN and modulate its role in malignant transformation. Using this approach we isolated interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 gene (IFITM3) as a potential protein partner. We show that IFITM3 and OPN interact in vitro and in vivo and that IFITM3 reduces osteopontin (OPN) mRNA expression, possibly by affecting OPN mRNA stability. Stable transfection of IFITM3 inhibits OPN, which mediates anchorage-independent growth, cell adhesion and cell invasion. Northern blot analysis revealed an inverse mRNA expression pattern of IFITM3 and OPN in human mammary cell lines. Inhibition of IFITM3 by antisense RNA promoted OPN protein expression, enhanced cell invasion by parental benign non-invasive Rama 37 cells, indicating that the two proteins interact functionally as well. We also identified an IFITM3 DNA-binding domain, which interacts with OPN, deletion of which abolished its inhibitive effect on OPN. This work has shown for the first time that IFITM3 physically interacts with OPN and reduces OPN mRNA expression, which mediates cell adhesion, cell invasion, colony formation in soft agar and metastasis in a rat model system."

Upon photoactivation, the second messenger of phototransduction, cyclic GMP, is rapidly degraded and must be replenished during the recovery phase of phototransduction by photoreceptor guanylate cyclases (GCs) GC1 (or GC-E) and GC2 (or GC-F) to maintain vision. Here, we present data that address the role of the GC kinase homology (KH) domain in cyclic GMP production by GC1, the major cyclase in photoreceptors. First, experiments were done to test which GC1 residues undergo phosphorylation and whether such phosphorylation affects cyclase activity. Using mass spectrometry, we showed that GC1 residues Ser-530, Ser-532, Ser-533, and Ser-538, located within the KH domain, undergo light- and signal transduction-independent phosphorylation in vivo. Mutations in the putative Mg2+ binding site of the KH domain abolished phosphorylation, indicating that GC1 undergoes autophosphorylation. The dramatically reduced GC activity of these mutants suggests that a functional KH domain is essential for cyclic GMP production.

GC1 is critical for human vision because mutations in its gene result in Leber congenital amaurosis, a cause of early onset blindness (7Perrault I. Rozet J.M. Calvas P. Gerber S. Camuzat A. Dollfus H. Châtelin S. Souied E. Ghazi I. Leowski C. Bonnemaison M. Le Paslier D. Frézal J. Dufier J.L. Pittler S. Munnich A. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor GCs belong to a family of membrane-bound GCs composed of an extracellular (EC), transmembrane (TM), kinase homology (KH), dimerization (DIM), and catalytic (CAT) domain (Fig. 1A). How these domains cooperate to achieve precisely regulated cGMP synthesis was proposed for a homolog of GC1, the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A). According to this model based on extensive data (reviewed in Ref. 8Potter L.R. Abbey-Hosch S. Dickey D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), NPR-A exists as a constitutive homodimer. In the peptide-unliganded state, the KH domains inhibit the CAT domains, a conclusion drawn from results demonstrating that the KH domain deletion mutant is constitutively active (9Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Koller K.J. de Sauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Binding of a single peptide ligand between the two EC domains results in their relative reorientation, relieving the inhibitory effect of the KH domains (11Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Huang L. Tam-Chang S.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consequently, the repositioned CAT domains form two active sites per dimer with both monomers contributing critical residues to each active site (13Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Lamers M.H. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. BMC Struct. Biol. 2008; 8: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Ramamurthy V. Tucker C. Wilkie S.E. Daggett V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26218-26229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which KH domains mediate communication between the EC and the CAT domains is not fully understood; however, the contributions of both phosphorylation and direct binding of ATP are evident. The KH domain of NPR-A undergoes phosphorylation on four Ser and two Thr residues within a stretch of 15 residues near its intracellular N terminus. Importantly, phosphorylation of these sites is obligatory for peptide ligand-dependent activation, but it does not affect the activity of the unliganded receptor (15Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). No protein kinase responsible for this activity has been identified. Surprisingly, ATP, besides being used for this phosphorylation, also directly binds to this domain, enhancing the peptide ligand-dependent cyclase activity (16Joubert S. Jossart C. McNicoll N. De Léan A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5572-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Burczynska B. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 301: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether ATP is absolutely required for such ligand-induced activation or just potentiates it is still controversial (17Burczynska B. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell.

The degree of sequence similarity between GC1 and NPR-A differs for various domains. The extracellular domains have a low sequence identity of only 15%, whereas the intracellular portions of the receptors are more similar, with the KH, DIM, and CAT domains, respectively, sharing 32, 49, and 53% sequence identity, as calculated for mouse enzymes. Because GC1 and NPR-A are predicted to have a similar domain organization and their intracellular portions share considerable sequence identity, it seems reasonable to expect that both enzymes are regulated similarly. However, no evidence of extracellular ligand binding to the EC domain of GC1 has yet been demonstrated. Such ligand regulation is presumably replaced by guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). GCAPs are small (∼23 kDa), soluble, N-terminally myristoylated proteins (20Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. Methods. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Dizhoor A. Adv. Exp. Med.

GCAPs activate photoreceptor GCs when intracellular Ca2+ levels are low (supplemental Fig. S1A) by interacting with their intracellular domains (23Gorczyca W.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4014-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczyca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J.

Structure. 2007; 15: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is possible that extracellular ligands, in the case of NPRs, and intracellular GCAPs, in the case of photoreceptor GCs, both activate the catalytic domains of their target enzymes by inducing structural changes. However, currently no structural or biophysical data exist that address this point. GC1 and NPR-A are both activated by ATP binding to their KH domains (17Burczynska B. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 301: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this ATP binding effect is at least in part direct, without involving phosphorylation, as both enzymes can be activated by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (26Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Gorczyca W.A. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3217-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ATP activates GC1 up to 2-fold (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas activation of NPR-A by ATP is more substantial but requires peptide ligand binding as well. In the absence of the peptide ligand, stimulation of NPR-A by ATP was reported to be between 0 and 20% (16Joubert S. Jossart C. McNicoll N. De Léan A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5572-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Both NPR-A and GC1 are phosphoproteins (15Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to NPR-A, phosphorylation sites in GC1 have not been identified. Curiously, the KH domain of GC1 might undergo autophosphorylation, a surprising finding considering that the invariable “catalytic” Asp residue required for efficient kinase activity is absent in this enzyme (26Aparicio J.G. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The function of this phosphorylation is also unknown. In NPR-A both phosphorylation and binding of peptide ligand to the EC domain clearly constitute a common regulatory mechanism, with phosphorylation alone having no effect but being required for peptide ligand activation (reviewed in Ref. 8Potter L.R. Abbey-Hosch S. Dickey D.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Hence, because GC1 presumably does not have a peptide ligand, the role of its phosphorylation is unclear. Studies demonstrating that NPRs, which are homologs of GC1, are regulated by phosphorylation (15Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and that photoreceptor GCs are phosphoproteins (15Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27083-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) suggest that phosphorylation of GC1 constitutes an important but unappreciated regulatory mechanism, which prompted us to study its function. Furthermore, technological advances, mainly in the field of mass spectrometry (29Bodenmiller B. Mueller L.N. Mueller M. Domon B. Aebersold R. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and specific staining of phosphoproteins (30Steinberg T.H. Agnew B.J. Gee K.R. Leung W.Y. Goodman T. Schulenberg B.

Lohmann S. Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) allowed us to examine phosphorylation of GC1 more precisely. Here we report the identification of phospho-Ser residues in GC1 purified from bovine and mouse rod outer segments (ROS). We demonstrate that mutations in the putative Mg2+ binding site within the KH domain located in the primary sequence far away from the phosphorylation site are crucial for GC1 and protein kinase activities, suggesting regulation of cGMP production and autophosphorylation by the KH domain. In contrast to findings in other cyclases, however, our results suggest that autophosphorylation does not regulate the guanylate cyclase activity of GC1. Finally, our data from studies of wild-type (WT) and knock-out mice provide evidence that phosphorylation of photoreceptor GCs is independent of GCAPs and either direct or indirect activation by light. C57BL/6 mice were purchased either from Taconic or The Jackson Laboratory; BALB/c mice were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory. Gnat1−/− mice, characterized previously (32Calvert P.D.

All mice were maintained on a normal diet in a 12-h light/12-h dark cyclic environment. Experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committee and conformed to the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. A protocol for rapid isolation of mouse ROS from 8–20 retinas was developed to minimize changes in protein phosphorylation during this procedure. All buffers used were ice-cold. Following cervical dislocation, the retina was removed from the eye through an incision in the cornea and immediately immersed in 0.5 ml of phosphatase/kinase stop buffer (7.6 mm Na2HPO4, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm EDTA) in a microtube. Retinas then were fragmented by pipetting five times through a 1-ml tip, and ROS were detached from cell bodies by vigorous shaking for 1 min. Cells and larger photoreceptor fragments were pelleted by a 1-min centrifugation at 300 × g at 4 °C, and the ROS-containing supernatant was transferred into a fresh microtube. To maximize the yield, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphatase/kinase stop buffer and subjected to one more round of pipetting, shaking, and low speed centrifugation. Finally, ROS were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To remove soluble proteins, ROS pellets were resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of wash buffer (7.6 mm Na2HPO4, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm EDTA), sonicated for 10 s with a Sonifier Model 150D set at a power level of 3, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The collected ROS membrane pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen stored at −80 °C. In experiments comparing phosphorylation level of GC1 in dark-adapted and light-exposed mice, the wash buffer was supplemented with 1 μm microcystin-LR (a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A). ROS membranes obtained from 20 retinas were resuspended in 0.8 ml of PB-RIPA buffer (7.6 mm Na2HPO4, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1% ANAPOE-NID-P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 30 min to solubilize membrane proteins. Next, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25 °C to remove insoluble debris, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microtube. To immunoprecipitate GC1/GC2, 20 μg of anti-GC polyclonal antibody UW28 (purified by protein A-Sepharose) was added followed by a 1-h incubation with mixing at room temperature. The protein A-Sepharose resin (50 μl) was washed three times with 150 μl of PB-RIPA buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of PB-RIPA buffer to obtain a 1:1 slurry. Between washes, the resin was pelleted by 2-min centrifugations at 3,000 × g. Twenty-five μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry was added to the sample followed by a 40-min incubation with vortexing at 25 °C to prevent resin sedimentation. Then, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was discarded. To remove nonspecifically bound proteins, the resin was resuspended in 0.5 ml of PB-RIPA buffer, gently vortexed for 2 min, and than pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 3 min. This wash cycle was performed three times. After removal of the last supernatant, GC was released from the resin by the addition of 30 μl of gel loading buffer (90 mm Tris, pH 6.85, 3% SDS, 18% (w/v) glycerol, and 7.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and a 5-min incubation at 100 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min to pellet the resin, and the supernatant was loaded (15 μl/lane) onto an 8% Laemmli minigel and resolved at a current of 80 V for 20 min followed by 120 V for 100 min. GC was then visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. A typical high purity immunoprecipitate is shown in Fig. 1B. All solutions were freshly prepared, and all tubes were washed with methanol. GC was purified from 80 mouse retinas by immunoprecipitation and resolved on SDS-PAGE as described above. Coomassie Blue-stained bands corresponding to GC were excised from eight gel lanes, chopped into 1-mm2 cubes, and transferred into a microtube. To remove the Coomassie stain, the gel was incubated sequentially with 200 μl water for 15 min, 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile for 15 min, 50 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 15 min, and 50 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 5 min. Next, 50 μl of 100% acetonitrile was added to obtain final concentrations of 50% acetonitrile and 50 mm NH4HCO3. After 15 min of incubation, the solution was replaced with 100% acetonitrile to dehydrate the gel, and the sample was incubated for 3 min. Following aspiration of acetonitrile, the sample was dried by SpeedVac. To reduce and alkylate GC, 50 μl of 20 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm NH4HCO3 was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the dithiothreitol solution was replaced with 50 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm NH4HCO3, and the sample was alkylated for 30 min in the dark. Following aspiration of the iodoacetamide solution, the sample was sequentially treated with 200 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 5 min, 200 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 for 5 min, and 200 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and, after removal of the acetonitrile, dried by SpeedVac. GC was usually digested with 0.4 μg of trypsin in 60 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, overnight at 37 °C. In some experiments, GC was digested with both Lys-C and Asp-N endoproteinases. The sample was initially incubated with 0.4 μg of Lys-C endoproteinase in 60 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 or 50 mm Tris overnight at 37 °C followed by protease inactivation by boiling for 3 min and rapid cooling on ice. Next, 0.4 μg of Asp-N endoproteinase in 60 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was added, and the digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. To recover peptides, the supernatant was transferred to a new microtube, and 30 μl of extraction solution composed of 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid was added to the gel fragments followed by a 10-min incubation with intermittent mixing at room temperature. The sample then was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant containing GC peptides was collected. This extraction was repeated three more times with 5-min incubations at room temperature. In some experiments, one of the incubations was carried out in a water bath sonicator. All supernatants were combined and concentrated to 5–10 μl by SpeedVac. MonoTip TiO2 pipette tips were employed to enrich phosphopeptides. These tips are filled with silica monolith coated with TiO2 that selectively traps phosphopeptides. The sample in 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid (v/v) was loaded onto the TiO2 resin, processed according to the supplier's protocol, eluted with 50 μl of 5% ammonia in water, concentrated to near dryness, resuspended in 30 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (36Singh P.

HEK-293-GC cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells/75 cm2 bottle and grown for 24 h at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed once with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (5.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.1, and 154 mm NaCl) and once with 5 ml of phosphatase/kinase stop buffer (7.6 mm Na2HPO4, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm EDTA) with 1 μm leupeptin, collected by scraping in 5 ml of phosphatase/kinase stop buffer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. After aspiration of the supernatant, cell pellets were frozen and stored at −80 °C. To purify GC, cell pellets were processed similarly to ROS pellets as described under “Isolation of ROS and ROS Membranes” and “Purification of GC from ROS Membranes by Immunoprecipitation,” with the following two modifications to address the higher protease activity in cells as compared with ROS. Leupeptin (protease inhibitor) was added to PB-RIPA buffer to a 1 μm final concentration, and the solubilization temperature was decreased to 25 °C. Following SDS-PAGE, phosphoproteins were stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain according to the manufacturer's manual. The gel was imaged with either a Molecular Imager FX with a 532-nm laser and 555-nm long pass filter or a Typhoon 9410 scanner with a 532-nm laser and a 580 ± 30-nm filter. For visualization of all proteins, the gel was then stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain following instructions in the manufacturer's manual and imaged with a Molecular Imager FX with a 532-nm laser and 640 ± 35-nm filter or a Typhoon 9410 with a 532-nm laser and 610 ± 30-nm filter. Protein quantification was performed with Quantity One or ImageQuant TL software. The full-length murine GC1 cDNA clone was obtained from mouse photoreceptor cDNA by PCR amplification with primers 5′-CTGCCAGGGGAGACCGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGACAGAAGCCTTGGGCCTTA-3′ followed by ligation into a pGEM-T-Easy vector to generate plasmid pGTE-mGC1. To construct the GC1 retroviral expression vector (pMiLG3), EcoRI and NotI sites were introduced at the ends of the GC1 coding sequence by PCR with pGTE-mGC1 as the template and with primers 5′-CCCCGGAATTCCCGAAGAAGGCAATGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATACTCGCGGCCGCAGTAGAGCTTCACTTCCCAG-3′. The GC1 coding sequence was then cloned into the pMXs-IG3 retroviral vector between the EcoRI and NotI sites. The insert was sequenced and confirmed to be identical to the GC1 reference sequence from Ensembl Genome Browser (ID: ENSMUST00000021259) except for a silent, single nucleotide polymorphism, 1386A > G (relative to the initiation ATG). Mutations within the KH domain were introduced by PCR amplification of the entire plasmid with the Phusion high fidelity polymerase. The fragment encompassing the GC1-IRES-EGFP cassette (where IRES is the internal ribosome entry site) was sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutations were introduced. HEK-293 cells and Phoenix Ampho cells were cultured in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium with 4 mml-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate stable cell lines, the WT or mutant GC1 transgene was delivered to HEK-293 cells by a retrovirus produced with Phoenix Ampho cells. To generate this retrovirus, 1.6 × 106 Phoenix Amphocells in 6 ml of growth medium were seeded into a 6-cm dish. Twenty-four h later and 5 min prior to transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh, warm growth medium with 25 μm chloroquine. Transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate method in a manner similar to that described previously (37Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Fifteen μg of DNA in 938 μl of water was combined with 62 μl of 2 m CaCl2 in a 2-ml microtube. One ml of room temperature buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, 10 mm KCl, 12 mm dextrose, 280 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm Na2HPO4 (molecular weight 141.96)) was then added, and the solution was immediately mixed several times by rapid inversion of the tube. After a 1-min incubation, this solution was added dropwise to the Phoenix Ampho cells. The medium was replaced with fresh growth medium at 10 h and then again at 24 h after transfection. To harvest the virus (48 h post-transfection), the medium was transferred to 15-ml conical tubes, spun at 450 × g for 5 min to remove detached cells, aliquoted (0.5 ml) into cryovials, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The target HEK-293 cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/6-cm dish in 4 ml of growth medium 24 h prior to transduction. To transduce the target cells, 3 ml of growth medium collected from target cells was combined with 0.5 ml of viral supernatant and 3.5 μl of Polybrene (final concentration 5 μg/ml). This was added back to the target cells after removal of residual medium. Transduction was carried out for 24 h at 32 °C (to extend retroviral half-life) in 5% CO2 with intermittent swirling. Twenty-four h after transduction, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. After another 24–48 h, cells were split 1:5, and this transduction protocol was repeated to increase the expression level. After recovery, cells were separated with a cell sorter to ensure similar EGFP fluorescence intensity profiles that corresponded to similar levels of mRNA encoding WT and mutant GCs. The GC activity was measured in HEK-293 cells stably expressing GC1. Cells were seeded at 6 × 106 cells/60-cm2 dish and grown for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with 4 ml of protein buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mm KCl, and 10 mm NaCl), collected by scraping in 4 ml of the same buffer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. After removal of the supernatant, cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Just before assaying, cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of the protein buffer with 2 μm leupeptin and sonicated for 5 s with a Sonifier Model 150D set at a power level of 3. For experiments that required washed cell membranes, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of water with 2 μm leupeptin and sonicated for 5 s with a Sonifier Model 150D set to power level 3, and membranes were collected by a 20-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g. After the supernatant was removed, washed membranes were resuspended in 150 μl of prot"
https://openalex.org/W2104509137,"Venus is a yellow fluorescent protein that has been developed for its fast chromophore maturation rate and bright yellow fluorescence that is relatively insensitive to changes in pH and ion concentrations. Here, we present a detailed study of the stability and folding of Venus in the pH range from 6.0 to 8.0 using chemical denaturants and a variety of spectroscopic probes. By following hydrogen-deuterium exchange of (15)N-labeled Venus using NMR spectroscopy over 13 months, residue-specific free energies of unfolding of some highly protected amide groups have been determined. Exchange rates of less than one per year are observed for some amide groups. A super-stable core is identified for Venus and compared with that previously reported for green fluorescent protein. These results are discussed in terms of the stability and folding of fluorescent proteins. Under mildly acidic conditions, we show that Venus undergoes a drastic decrease in yellow fluorescence at relatively low concentrations of guanidinium chloride. A detailed study of this effect establishes that it is due to pH-dependent, nonspecific interactions of ions with the protein. In contrast to previous studies on enhanced green fluorescence protein variant S65T/T203Y, which showed a specific halide ion-binding site, NMR chemical shift mapping shows no evidence for specific ion binding. Instead, chemical shift perturbations are observed for many residues primarily located in both lids of the beta-barrel structure, which suggests that small scale structural rearrangements occur on increasing ionic strength under mildly acidic conditions and that these are propagated to the chromophore resulting in fluorescence quenching."
https://openalex.org/W2108667317,"The secretory proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) have been known to be involved in the virulence, pathogenesis as well as proliferation of the pathogen. Among this set, many proteins have been hypothesized to play a critical role at the genesis of the onset of infection, the primary site of which is invariably the human lung.During our efforts to isolate potential binding partners of key secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis from a human lung protein library, we isolated peptides that strongly bound the virulence determinant protein Esat6. All peptides were less than fifty amino acids in length and the binding was confirmed by in vivo as well as in vitro studies. Curiously, we found all three binders to be unusually rich in phenylalanine, with one of the three peptides a short fragment of the human cytochrome c oxidase-3 (Cox-3). The most accessible of the three binders, named Hcl1, was shown also to bind to the Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) Esat6 homologue. Expression of hcl1 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv led to considerable reduction in growth. Microarray analysis showed that Hcl1 affects a host of key cellular pathways in M. tuberculosis. In a macrophage infection model, the sets expressing hcl1 were shown to clear off M. tuberculosis in much greater numbers than those infected macrophages wherein the M. tuberculosis was not expressing the peptide. Transmission electron microscopy studies of hcl1 expressing M. tuberculosis showed prominent expulsion of cellular material into the matrix, hinting at cell wall damage.While the debilitating effects of Hcl1 on M. tuberculosis are unrelated and not because of the peptide's binding to Esat6-as the latter is not an essential protein of M. tuberculosis-nonetheless, further studies with this peptide, as well as a closer inspection of the microarray data may shed important light on the suitability of such small phenylalanine-rich peptides as potential drug-like molecules against this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2018172046,"Background Lewis Y (Ley) is a blood group-related carbohydrate that is expressed at high surface densities on the majority of epithelial carcinomas and is a promising target for antibody-based immunotherapy. A humanized Ley-specific antibody (hu3S193) has shown encouraging safety, pharmacokinetic and tumor-targeting properties in recently completed Phase I clinical trials. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the three-dimensional structures for both the free (unliganded) and bound (Ley tetrasaccharide) hu3S193 Fab from the same crystal grown in the presence of divalent zinc ions. There is no evidence of significant conformational changes occurring in either the Ley carbohydrate antigen or the hu3S193 binding site, which suggests a rigid fit binding mechanism. In the crystal, the hu3S193 Fab molecules are coordinated at their protein-protein interface by two zinc ions and in solution aggregation of Fab can be initiated by zinc, but not magnesium ions. Dynamic light scattering revealed that zinc ions could initiate a sharp transition from hu3S193 Fab monomers to large multimeric aggregates in solution. Conclusions/Significance Zinc ions can mediate interactions between hu3S193 Fab in crystals and in solution. Whether metallic ion mediated aggregation of antibody occurs in vivo is not known, but the present results suggest that similar clustering mechanisms could occur when hu3S193 binds to Ley on cells, particularly given the high surface densities of antigen on the target tumor cells."

The adoption of the new definition of a smear-positive case could directly increase case detection by up to 28%. Examining Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) sputum smears for up to 10 minutes before declaring them negative has previously been shown to increase case detection (over and above that gained by the adoption of the new case definition) by 70% compared with examination times in routine practice. Three times the number of staff would be required to adequately examine the current workload of smears using ZN microscopy. Through implementing new policy recommendations and LED-based fluorescence microscopy the current laboratory staff complement could investigate the same number of patients, examining auramine-stained smears to an extent that is equivalent to a 10 minutes ZN smear examination.Combined implementation of the new WHO recommendations on smear microscopy and LED-based fluorescence microscopy could result in substantial increases in smear positive case-detection using existing human resources and minimal additional equipment."

Several mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in three-dimensional domain swapping in proteins. These include 1) destabilization of the monomer, 2) accumulation of mutations in the dimer interface, and 3) modifications (e.g. deletions or mutations) in the hinge loop (1Liu Y. Eisenberg D.

The modified genes of the IgG1 2G12 mutants were codon-optimized and synthesized by GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) and stably transfected into protein-free cultivated Chinese hamster ovary dehydrofolate reductase-deficient suspension cells (ATCC CRL-9096) as described earlier (10Reisinger H. Steinfellner W. Stern B. Katinger H. Kunert R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 81: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection with polyethyleneimine/DNA, selection was started with hypoxanthine/thymidine-deficient medium. Stably transfected clones were propagated and purified over a protein A column. Quality control of purified IgG fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Final IgG concentrations were determined by A280 measurement. CD analysis was performed on a PiStar-180 spectrometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder from Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, U.K.). For recording near-UV spectra (240–340 nm) the quartz cuvette had a path length of 10 mm. Spectral bandwidth was 2 nm; step size, 1 nm; scan time, 21 min; protein concentration, 0.1 mg/ml. All CD measurements were performed in 5 mm PBS, pH 7.3, at 25 °C (11Marsche G. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. Sattler W. Malle E. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 79: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each spectrum was automatically corrected with the base line to remove birefringence of the cell. The instrument was flushed with nitrogen with a flow rate of 5 liters min−1. For the preparation of the 2G12 IgG samples, freeze drying and heavy metal shadowing were performed according to Kellenberger and Kistler (12Kellenberger E. Kistler J. Hoppe S. Mason R. Unconventional Electron Microscopy for Molecular Structure Determination. F. Vieweg and Sohn, Braunschweig, Germany1979: 49-79Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of the antibody preparations were taken on a CM 12 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Buffer-exchanged (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3) and concentrated (1 mg/ml) 2G12 IgG samples were mixed with activated papain solution (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm cysteine, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) to give a final papain/antibody ratio of 4% (w/w). The resulting mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped by adding 30 mm iodoacetamide. Subsequently, the cleaved antibody solution mix was buffer-exchanged (PBS) and incubated twice with PBS-preequilibrated protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature under gentle agitation on a shaker. Finally the Fab-containing supernatants were collected and further characterized by SDS-PAGE. Each purified antibody sample (IgG and Fab) was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 3 cell system. Subsequently, the 2G12 samples were visualized with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. 96-well microplates (eBioscience) were sensitized with recombinant gp160 MN (100 ng/well) overnight at 4 °C. All of the following steps were carried out at room temperature. After washing the plates with TPBS (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20), the wells were blocked for 1 h with 4% nonfat dry milk in TPBS. The 2G12 Fab samples (2 μg/ml) were serially diluted in 1% nonfat dry milk/TPBS and added to the antigen-coated wells. After 1 h, bound 2G12 Fab was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fab conjugate (Sigma) diluted 1:1,000 in 1% nonfat dry milk/TPBS. Finally, bound conjugate was visualized with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Pierce) and measured at 450 nm. The papain-digested 2G12 Fab variants (100 μg/ml) were loaded in PBS (50 μl) onto a PBS-equilibrated Superdex 75 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected by UV absorbance. JR-FL pseudovirus was generated as described previously (13Nelson J.D. Brunel F.M. Jensen R. Crooks E.T. Cardoso R.M. Wang M. Hessell A. Wilson I.A. Binley J.M. Dawson P.E. Burton D.R. Zwick M.B. J.

Pseudotyped virus was added at a 1:1 ratio to serially diluted (1:3) 2G12 variants (starting at 200 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C, for 1 h. TZM-bl cells were then seeded (1:1 by volume) at 1 × 104 cells/well in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. After a 48-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, lysed, and finally developed with luciferase assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luminescence in relative light units was measured using an Orion microplate luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). ELISA microplates were coated overnight with 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-human Fab fragment in PBS at 4 °C. The capture antibodies (2G12 Fab variants) were mixed with 100-fold concentrated JR-FL pseudovirus at a final antibody concentration of 5 μg/ml. The resulting antibody/virus mix was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and subsequently pelleted for 50 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. In the meantime, the coated plates were washed with PBS and blocked (3% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting antibody/virus pellets were resuspended in PBS, transferred onto the ELISA plates, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, plates were washed and overlaid with 1 × 104 TZM-bl cells in 100 μl/well. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was measured as described above. All experiments were performed in duplicate. The antibody models were generated with COOT (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (15DeLano W.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of domain swapping in 2G12 further, particularly the roles of previously highlighted residues at the VH/VH′ dimer interface and elbow region, three IgG1 2G12 heavy chain mutants with multiple “germ line” amino acid substitutions in the VDJ region were created (Fig. 1A). An amino acid alignment of the VH domains of these 2G12 mutants with that of wild-type 2G12 (2G12-wt) is shown in Fig. 1B. In the first mutant, 2G12-JH3, the J region of 2G12-wt was replaced by a corresponding germ line region IGHJ3*01, resulting in five amino acid substitutions and one deletion (Fig. 1B). Two of these substitutions and the amino acid deletion occur in the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3, whereas the remaining three substitutions are located in the J region. For the second mutant, 2G12-GL, four additional germ line amino acid substitutions are found in the VH region, including one substitution in the framework region (FR) 1, one in the CDR2, and two in the FR3. In a third construct, 2G12-3H6, the 2G12 VH region was completely exchanged by a different VH region derived from a previously described antibody (16Gach J.S. Maurer M. Hahn R. Gasser B.

Biol. 2008; 382: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to verify the responsibility of the 2G12 DJ region for domain swapping. All modified 2G12 heavy chain genes and the corresponding 2G12-wt light chain genes (codon-optimized and synthesized by GeneArt) were stably transfected into protein-free cultivated Chinese hamster ovary dehydrofolate reductase-deficient suspension cells (ATCC CRL-9096). The protein A-purified IgG1 2G12 mutants exhibited electrophoretic characteristics similar to those of IgG 2G12-wt as revealed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). The IgG1 2G12-wt and IgG1 2G12 mutants were further analyzed by CD spectrometry. Measurements in the near-UV region (240–340 nm) are shown in Fig. 2A. IgG1 2G12-JH3 exhibited a spectrum identical to that of IgG1 2G12-wt, indicating that the exchange of the J region of IgG1 2G12-wt had no influence on the overall structure. Substitution of four additional amino acids in the IgG1 2G12-GL mutant was reflected by an apparent structural change. However, this difference may have derived from subtle changes in the local environment of particular aromatic residues, which are not necessarily associated with any major structural change (i.e. domain exchange). The spectrum of the third mutant, IgG1 2G12–3H6, revealed the largest difference from IgG1 2G12-wt. In this mutant, the whole VH region was exchanged, which appeared to be accompanied by major structural changes. To investigate potential structural differences between the IgG1 2G12-wt and the IgG1 2G12 mutants further, electron microscopy was carried out. We used freeze drying and heavy metal shadowing to visualize the frozen IgG samples in the electron microscope. Although the resolution of this preparation method was slightly lower compared with a previously described staining method (18Roux K.H. Zhu P. Seavy M. Katinger H. Kunert R. Seamon V. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we were able to discriminate between I-shaped and Y-shaped conformations of the 2G12 samples (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 18Roux K.H. Zhu P. Seavy M. Katinger H. Kunert R. Seamon V. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The IgG1 2G12-wt, IgG1 2G12-JH3, and IgG1 2G12-GL displayed a successively decreasing predominance of the I-shaped conformation (∼90%, ∼75%, and ∼40%, respectively). In contrast, mutant 2G12-3H6 IgG1 existed predominantly in a Y-shaped conformation (∼90%). Taken together, these electron microscopy results indicate qualitative structural differences between the different IgG1 2G12 samples (supplemental Fig. S2). We next examined the binding capacities of Fab 2G12 mutants (produced by papain digestion) to recombinant gp160 MN (Fig. 2B). Relative affinities (i.e. apparent affinities determined from the antibody concentration at half-maximal binding) of Fab 2G12-JH3, Fab 2G12-GL, and Fab 2G12-3H6 compared with Fab 2G12-wt were less than 1%. These findings are in good correlation with those of Calarese et al. (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), who discovered that most of their mutations to the primary combining site, secondary binding site, and VH/VH′ interface resulted in a dramatic loss of binding to gp120. Considering that the gp160 specificity ELISA might not represent an optimal environment for the 2G12 mutants, the same samples were analyzed further for binding activity to native gp120 (i.e. in solution virus capture assay) as well as neutralization potency on JR-FL pseudovirus. In contrast to 2G12-wt, the mutants were neither able to capture free virus nor exhibited any neutralization capacity (data not shown). Finally, the Fab 2G12 variants were examined for their ability to form three-dimensional domain-swapped dimers. For this experiment, Fab 2G12 fractions were concentrated, visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), and separated by gel filtration. Fig. 3B shows the normalized spectrograms. Fab 2G12-wt eluted as two dominant peaks at 26.5 and 30 min, corresponding to dimeric and monomeric forms, respectively. Fab 2G12-JH3 also eluted as two peaks at 26.5 and 30 min. However, the proportion of dimer was significantly less than that for Fab 2G12-wt. In contrast, Fab 2G12-GL, Fab 2G12-3H6, and the Fab 3H6 control exhibited dominant peaks at 30 min, indicating monomer only. The fact that 2G12-JH3 still forms a dimer (Fig. 3B) indicates that the ProH113 to Ser substitution in the J region does not prevent VH domain exchange. The high resolution crystal structure of Fab 2G12 (Protein Data Bank code 1op3) (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) revealed that Pro N, Cα, Cβ at the elbow, or hinge region of the domain-exchanged dimer are within van der Waals (VDW) contact of ValH84 Cγ2 (Fig. 4A). These hydrophobic interactions were proposed to stabilize the conformation of the hinge region in which the VH domain pivots around ProH113 to facilitate dimerization. Modeling of the ProH113 to Ser substitution, as found in 2G12-JH3, by simply mutating the ProH133 side chain to that of the most probable rotamer of the Ser side chain using the program COOT (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23224) Google Scholar) suggests that these interactions could be conserved in the mutant (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the ϕ and ψ angles of the modeled Ser lie within the preferred regions of the Ramachandran plot. Consequently, the conformation of the hinge as observed in the Fab 2G12 structure may be maintained in 2G12-JH3 via hydrophobic interactions between ValH84 and SerH113 that are analogous to those between ValH84 and ProH113. On the other hand, the fact that 2G12-GL does not form a dimer (Fig. 3B) could be due to one or a combination of the four additional substitutions found in this mutant over 2G12-JH3. As mentioned above, in the Fab 2G12 structure, ValH84 Cγ2 was observed to form several VDW interactions with ProH113′ at the elbow region as well as with ValH111 O (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Modeling of the ValH84 to Ala substitution suggests that these interactions would be lost in 2G12-GL, and this may be enough to destabilize the hinge region and, hence, inhibit dimerization. In regard to the IleH19 to Arg substitution, the region of the VH/VH′ interface around IleH19 was revealed to be very tightly packed in the Fab 2G12 structure (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B), with the hydrophobic side chain of IleH19 being within VDW contact of SerH7′, GlyH8′, IleH19′, LeuH20′, SerH21′, and TyrH79′. The binding interactions in the VH/VH′ interface would probably be decreased significantly by disruption of these hydrophobic contacts. Moreover, because of steric clashes, it is not possible to model any rotamers of the Arg side chain at this position using COOT without substantially affecting the location and rotamers of the surrounding side chains. The IleH19 to Arg substitution may, therefore, not even be tolerated within the dimer interface. In relation to the PheH77 to Ser substitution, the aromatic side chain of PheH77 was observed to be within VDW contact of ThrH68′ and GlnH81′ in the Fab 2G12 structure (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Modeling a Ser at this position suggests that these interactions would be lost in the 2G12-GL mutant. The ArgH57 to Ile substitution would break a salt bridge with AspH72′ observed at the VH/VH′ dimer interface of Fab 2G12 (Fig. 4C) (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In addition to the putative role of this salt bridge in stabilizing the VH/VH′ interface, it is also likely to be important for positioning of the neighboring TyrH56 which, in the complex with Manα1,2Man (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), forms pi-stacking interactions with TyrL94 at the VH/VL interface. These interactions in turn may be important for the positioning of GlyL93 O which H-bonds with the terminal mannose O6 in the Manα1,2Man containing arms of high mannose sugars. Notably, a TyrH56 to Ala substitution was reported to cause a dramatic loss in affinity of 2G12 for gp120 (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Moreover, SerH54, ThrH55, and ArgH57 to Ala substitutions were similarly observed to lead to significantly decreased gp120 binding (6Calarese D.A. Scanlan C.N. Zwick M.B. Deechongkit S. Mimura Y. Kunert R. Zhu P. Wormald M.R. Stanfield R.L. Roux K.H. Kelly J.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Katinger H. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Science. 2003; 300: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). These effects could similarly arise from changes in the conformation of the aromatic side chain of TyrH56 which prevent it from forming pi-stacking interactions with TyrL94. Consequently, the unusual domain-exchanged configuration of 2G12 could be fostered by the single or combined effects of four amino acid side chains that either help to stabilize the elbow region (H113) or the VH/VH′ dimer interface. Moreover, a proline at H113 has been shown here to not be required for the domain swapping capability of 2G12. Rather, the hydrophobic contacts between the residue at this position and the side chain of residue His84 appear to be predominantly responsible for stabilization of the elbow region. The lack of domain swapping capability observed for the mutant 2G12–3H6 clearly indicates that the 2G12-wt CDR3 and J region alone are not sufficient to promote VH domain exchange when the complete VH region of 2G12 is replaced by another antibody VH region. Taken together, the present study shows that the I-shaped conformation of 2G12 cannot be traced back to a single amino acid mutation but rather involves a complex interplay of amino acid replacements. It remains to be further investigated at which stage these mutations occurred in the evolution of this very unique antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2073313857,"Background The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) is an exceptionally social and gregarious species of chiropteran known to roost in assemblages that can number in the millions. Chemical recognition of roostmates within these assemblages has not been extensively studied despite the fact that an ability to chemically recognize individuals could play an important role in forming and stabilizing complex suites of social interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings Individual bats were given a choice between three roosting pouches: one permeated with the scent of a group of roostmates, one permeated with the scent of non-roostmates, and a clean control. Subjects rejected non-roostmate pouches with greater frequency than roostmate pouches or blank control pouches. Also, bats chose to roost in the roostmate scented pouches more often than the non-roostmate or control pouches. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that T. brasiliensis has the ability to chemically recognize roostmates from non-roostmates and a preference for roosting in areas occupied by roostmates. It is important to investigate these behaviors because of their potential importance in colony dynamics and roost choice."
https://openalex.org/W1974926759,"Although high throughput technologies for gene profiling are reliable tools, sample/tissue heterogeneity limits their outcomes when applied to identify molecular markers. Indeed, inter-sample differences in cell composition contribute to scatter the data, preventing detection of small but relevant changes in gene expression level. To date, attempts to circumvent this difficulty were based on isolation of the different cell structures constituting biological samples. As an alternate approach, we developed a tissue compartment analysis (TCA) method to assess the cell composition of tissue samples, and applied it to standardize data and to identify biomarkers.TCA is based on the comparison of mRNA expression levels of specific markers of the different constitutive structures in pure isolated structures, on the one hand, and in the whole sample on the other. TCA method was here developed with human kidney samples, as an example of highly heterogeneous organ. It was validated by comparison of the data with those obtained by histo-morphometry. TCA demonstrated the extreme variety of composition of kidney samples, with abundance of specific structures varying from 5 to 95% of the whole sample. TCA permitted to accurately standardize gene expression level amongst >100 kidney biopsies, and to identify otherwise imperceptible molecular disease markers.Because TCA does not require specific preparation of sample, it can be applied to all existing tissue or cDNA libraries or to published data sets, inasmuch specific operational compartments markers are available. In human, where the small size of tissue samples collected in clinical practice accounts for high structural diversity, TCA is well suited for the identification of molecular markers of diseases, and the follow up of identified markers in single patients for diagnosis/prognosis and evaluation of therapy efficiency. In laboratory animals, TCA will interestingly be applied to central nervous system where tissue heterogeneity is a limiting factor."
https://openalex.org/W2036650587,"T cells absorb nanometric membrane vesicles, prepared from plasma membrane of antigen presenting cells, via dual receptor/ligand interactions of T cell receptor (TCR) with cognate peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plus lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) with intercellular adhesion molecule 1. TCR-mediated signaling for LFA-1 activation is also required for the vesicle absorption. Exploiting those findings, we had established a high throughput screening (HTS) platform and screened a library for isolation of small molecules inhibiting the vesicle absorption. Follow-up studies confirmed that treatments (1 hour) with various mitochondrial antagonists, including a class of anti-diabetic drugs (i.e., Metformin and Phenformin), resulted in ubiquitous inhibition of the vesicle absorption without compromising viability of T cells. Further studies revealed that the mitochondrial drug treatments caused impairment of specific membrane-proximal TCR signaling event(s). Thus, activation of Akt and PLC-γ1 and entry of extracellular Ca2+ following TCR stimulation were attenuated while polymerization of monomeric actins upon TCR triggering progressed normally after the treatments. Dynamic F-actin rearrangement concurring with the vesicle absorption was also found to be impaired by the drug treatments, implying that the inhibition by the drug treatments of downstream signaling events (and the vesicle absorption) could result from lack of directional relocation of signaling and cell surface molecules. We also assessed the potential application of mitochondrial antagonists as immune modulators by probing effects of the long-term drug treatments (24 hours) on viability of resting primary T cells and cell cycle progression of antigen-stimulated T cells. This study unveils a novel regulatory mechanism for T cell immunity in response to environmental factors having effects on mitochondrial function."
