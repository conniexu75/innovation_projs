https://openalex.org/W1983698513,"IT has been pointed out1 that a low activity of hepatic pyruvate kinase (ATP-phosphotransferase EC.2.7.1.40) favours gluconeogenesis, and a high activity favours lipogenesis from oxidizable substances. These experiments with rats showed that the activity of the enzyme was rapidly affected by alterations the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, being highest when the diet contained 55 percent carbohydrate (mostly as starch) and least when it contained no carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W2092097470,"ETHIDIUM bromide (EB) (2,7 di-amino-phenyl phenanthridine 10-ethyl bromhydrate) is an antimicrobial drug which, like proflavine (an acridine), forms reversible complexes with nucleic acids1,2. In vitro, it inhibits DNA-polymerase and, at a lesser rate, DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase2. In the same way, EB and related phenanthridine derivatives inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acids in bacteria3 and Ehrlich ascites cells4; they are also trypanocidal5. Moreover, the photosensitization of arboviruses6, the inhibition of their development7 and that of a Pseudomonas pyocyanea phage8 by these compounds have been reported. Although the responses of several virus-infected systems to the action of acridines have been given in detail9,10, the comparable interactions with EB have not yet been so clearly described. The present paper details the action of EB on herpes virus and its growth in baboon kidney cells."

https://openalex.org/W1969809819,"EXPERIMENTAL transplantation of the thyroid gland has been widely investigated1,2. As a rule autotransplantation of the adult thyroid is easily attained, but positive results with homotransplantation in laboratory animals (mammals) are sometimes achieved only after additional treatment with corticosteroids3,4 or after implantation in the anterior lye chamber5,6, brain or, especially in the case of the guinea-pig7, in the testes."

https://openalex.org/W2035561900,"THERE are two theories about the uptake of chylomicron triglyceride by the liver. The widely held view that chylomicrons are removed intact from the circulation1–3 has been challenged by Felts and Mayes4. They propose that the triglycerides are not taken up directly by the liver but are hydrolysed elsewhere by lipoprotein lipase, the resulting non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) being taken up by the liver cells. In vivo evidence that intact chylomicrons are removed by the liver has been presented earlier5 but was open to two objections4,6. First, heparin was used as an anticoagulant in the collection of the chylomicrons and sufficient could have remained after washing to stimulate lipoprotein lipase activity in the circulation. Second, studies on whole liver tissue may not give a true picture of events occurring in the parenchymal cells themselves, since trapping of chylomicrons in the tissue spaces does occur both in vivo7 and in perfusion experiments6."
https://openalex.org/W2040785091,"EDWARDS1 has recently criticized Li's description2 of his formula for the rate of change of mean fitness in a population as the “fundamental theorem of natural selection” on the grounds that Fisher's derivation3 of the fundamental theorem used overlapping generations, whereas Li uses separate generations. Because Fisher3 said that his theorem held “the supreme position among the biological sciences”, and because at one time he worked on one of the many organisms which in the wild have non-overlapping generations4, it seems very unlikely that he thought the generation-system had any essential effect on his theorem, and it is not possible to exclude from consideration formulations with non-overlapping generations when discussing the generality of the theorem. True or untrue statements with one system of generations are likely to be just so with the other."

https://openalex.org/W1971727405,"RAJENDREN1 has recently published observations on the nuclear life cycle of Hemileia vastatrix in which he describes penetration of the leaf as occurring by means of a “bifid infection peg” produced from an appressorium, which he considers does not lie over a stoma. The two branches of the “peg” are shown as growing from the appressorium over the surface of the leaf to penetrate two separate stomata. It is surprising that Rajendren does not comment on the fact that this method of penetration is quite different from that given in the literature and which was first described by Marshall Ward3."
