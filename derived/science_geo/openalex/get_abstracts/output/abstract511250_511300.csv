https://openalex.org/W2073217307,"Efficient protein delivery using cationic lipid transfection reagents enables high efficiency protein-based genome editing in vivo and in vitro. Efficient intracellular delivery of proteins is needed to fully realize the potential of protein therapeutics. Current methods of protein delivery commonly suffer from low tolerance for serum, poor endosomal escape and limited in vivo efficacy. Here we report that common cationic lipid nucleic acid transfection reagents can potently deliver proteins that are fused to negatively supercharged proteins, that contain natural anionic domains or that natively bind to anionic nucleic acids. This approach mediates the potent delivery of nM concentrations of Cre recombinase, TALE- and Cas9-based transcription activators, and Cas9:sgRNA nuclease complexes into cultured human cells in media containing 10% serum. Delivery of unmodified Cas9:sgRNA complexes resulted in up to 80% genome modification with substantially higher specificity compared to DNA transfection. This approach also mediated efficient delivery of Cre recombinase and Cas9:sgRNA complexes into the mouse inner ear in vivo, achieving 90% Cre-mediated recombination and 20% Cas9-mediated genome modification in hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2784380838,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control expression of thousands of genes in plants and animals. miRNAs function by guiding Argonaute proteins to complementary sites in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) targeted for repression. We determined crystal structures of human Argonaute-2 (Ago2) bound to a defined guide RNA with and without target RNAs representing miRNA recognition sites. These structures suggest a stepwise mechanism, in which Ago2 primarily exposes guide nucleotides (nt) 2 to 5 for initial target pairing. Pairing to nt 2 to 5 promotes conformational changes that expose nt 2 to 8 and 13 to 16 for further target recognition. Interactions with the guide-target minor groove allow Ago2 to interrogate target RNAs in a sequence-independent manner, whereas an adenosine binding-pocket opposite guide nt 1 further facilitates target recognition. Spurious slicing of miRNA targets is avoided through an inhibitory coordination of one catalytic magnesium ion. These results explain the conserved nucleotide-pairing patterns in animal miRNA target sites first observed over two decades ago."
https://openalex.org/W2000224750,"The challenge of global population aging has been brought into sharper focus by the financial crisis of 2008. In particular, growing national debt has drawn government attention to two apparently conflicting priorities: the need to sustain public spending on pensions and health care versus the need to reduce budget deficits. A number of countries are consequently reconsidering their pension and health care provisions, which account for up to 40% of all government spending in advanced economies. Yet population aging is a global phenomenon that will continue to affect all regions of the world. By 2050 there will be the same number of old as young in the world, with 2 billion people aged 60 or over and another 2 billion under age 15, each group accounting for 21% of the world's population."
https://openalex.org/W2031308814,"Emerging infectious diseases are reducing biodiversity on a global scale. Recently, the emergence of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans resulted in rapid declines in populations of European fire salamanders. Here, we screened more than 5000 amphibians from across four continents and combined experimental assessment of pathogenicity with phylogenetic methods to estimate the threat that this infection poses to amphibian diversity. Results show that B. salamandrivorans is restricted to, but highly pathogenic for, salamanders and newts (Urodela). The pathogen likely originated and remained in coexistence with a clade of salamander hosts for millions of years in Asia. As a result of globalization and lack of biosecurity, it has recently been introduced into naïve European amphibian populations, where it is currently causing biodiversity loss."

This is also a peak time for clinical onset of most mental illnesses (see the chart) (1). One in five adolescents have a mental illness that will persist into adulthood (2). Mental illnesses that emerge before adulthood impose a 10-fold higher cost than those that emerge later in life (3). Mental health costs are the highest single source of global economic burden in the world (4)."
https://openalex.org/W1986492410,"Existing mouse models of lethal Ebola virus infection do not reproduce hallmark symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, neither delayed blood coagulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation nor death from shock, thus restricting pathogenesis studies to nonhuman primates. Here we show that mice from the Collaborative Cross panel of recombinant inbred mice exhibit distinct disease phenotypes after mouse-adapted Ebola virus infection. Phenotypes range from complete resistance to lethal disease to severe hemorrhagic fever characterized by prolonged coagulation times and 100% mortality. Inflammatory signaling was associated with vascular permeability and endothelial activation, and resistance to lethal infection arose by induction of lymphocyte differentiation and cellular adhesion, probably mediated by the susceptibility allele Tek . These data indicate that genetic background determines susceptibility to Ebola hemorrhagic fever."
https://openalex.org/W2065998067,"Donors tend to avoid charities that dedicate a high percentage of expenses to administrative and fundraising costs, limiting the ability of nonprofits to be effective. We propose a solution to this problem: Use donations from major philanthropists to cover overhead expenses and offer potential donors an overhead-free donation opportunity. A laboratory experiment testing this solution confirms that donations decrease when overhead increases, but only when donors pay for overhead themselves. In a field experiment with 40,000 potential donors, we compared the overhead-free solution with other common uses of initial donations. Consistent with prior research, informing donors that seed money has already been raised increases donations, as does a $1:$1 matching campaign. Our main result, however, clearly shows that informing potential donors that overhead costs are covered by an initial donation significantly increases the donation rate by 80% (or 94%) and total donations by 75% (or 89%) compared with the seed (or matching) approach."
https://openalex.org/W1983833690,"Catalysts used for heterogeneous processes are usually composed of metal nanoparticles dispersed over a high–surface-area support. In recent years, near-ambient pressure techniques have allowed catalyst characterization under operating conditions, overcoming the pressure gap effect. However, the use of model systems may not truly represent the changes that occur in real catalysts (the so-called material gap effect). Supports can play an important role in the catalytic process by providing new active sites and may strongly affect both the physical and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles. We used near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to show that the surface rearrangement of bimetallic (rhodium-palladium) nanoparticles under working conditions for ethanol steam reforming with real catalysts is strongly influenced by the presence of a reducible ceria support."
https://openalex.org/W2100894966,"An understanding of the formation of large magmatic reservoirs is a key issue for the evaluation of possible strong volcanic eruptions in the future. We estimated the size and level of maturity of one of the largest volcanic reservoirs, based on radial seismic anisotropy. We used ambient-noise seismic tomography below the Toba caldera (in northern Sumatra) to observe the anisotropy that we interpret as the expression of a fine-scale layering caused by the presence of many partially molten sills in the crust below 7 kilometers. This result demonstrates that the magmatic reservoirs of present (non-eroded) supervolcanoes can be formed as large sill complexes and supports the concept of the long-term incremental evolution of magma bodies that lead to the largest volcanic eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W1975204938,"Determining the origin of water and the timing of its accretion within the inner solar system is important for understanding the dynamics of planet formation. The timing of water accretion to the inner solar system also has implications for how and when life emerged on Earth. We report in situ measurements of the hydrogen isotopic composition of the mineral apatite in eucrite meteorites, whose parent body is the main-belt asteroid 4 Vesta. These measurements sample one of the oldest hydrogen reservoirs in the solar system and show that Vesta contains the same hydrogen isotopic composition as that of carbonaceous chondrites. Taking into account the old ages of eucrite meteorites and their similarity to Earth's isotopic ratios of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, we demonstrate that these volatiles could have been added early to Earth, rather than gained during a late accretion event."
https://openalex.org/W1971358085,"Neurotrophins regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development and plasticity, but their precise in vivo functions during neural circuit assembly in the central brain remain unclear. We show that the neurotrophin receptor tropomyosin-related kinase C (TrkC) is required for dendritic growth and branching of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells. Sparse TrkC knockout reduced dendrite complexity, but global Purkinje cell knockout had no effect. Removal of the TrkC ligand neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from cerebellar granule cells, which provide major afferent input to developing Purkinje cell dendrites, rescued the dendrite defects caused by sparse TrkC disruption in Purkinje cells. Our data demonstrate that NT-3 from presynaptic neurons (granule cells) is required for TrkC-dependent competitive dendrite morphogenesis in postsynaptic neurons (Purkinje cells)--a previously unknown mechanism of neural circuit development."
https://openalex.org/W1965801138,"Flavonoids are plant-derived polyphenolic molecules that have potential biological effects including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumoral effects. These effects are related to the ability of flavonoids to modulate signaling pathways, such as the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway controls many aspects of embryonic development and tissue maintenance and has been found to be deregulated in a range of human cancers. We performed several in vivo assays in Xenopus embryos, a functional model of canonical Wnt signaling studies, and also used in vitro models, to investigate whether isoquercitrin affects Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our data provide strong support for an inhibitory effect of isoquercitrin on Wnt/β-catenin, where the flavonoid acts downstream of β-catenin translocation to the nuclei. Isoquercitrin affects Xenopus axis establishment, reverses double axes and the LiCl hyperdorsalization phenotype, and reduces Xnr3 expression. In addition, this flavonoid shows anti-tumoral effects on colon cancer cells (SW480, DLD-1, and HCT116), whereas exerting no significant effect on non-tumor colon cell (IEC-18), suggesting a specific effect in tumor cells in vitro. Taken together, our data indicate that isoquercitrin is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin and should be further investigated as a potential novel anti-tumoral agent."
https://openalex.org/W1998508479,"The complex ways in which humans depend on their natural environment are increasingly expressed in terms of ecosystem services, which are often assigned economic values to assist decision-making. The key attraction of the ecosystem services concept to conservationists lies in the potential for win-win outcomes ( 1 ), where the value of an ecosystem service depends on high biological diversity and cannot be increased by modifying it. Such outcomes are possible. For example, in Costa Rican coffee plantations, retention of forest patches doubled pest control of coffee berry borer beetle by birds, with substantial economic benefits to coffee farmers ( 2 ). However, attention to ecosystem services does not automatically lead to the conservation of biodiversity ( 3 ). A series of factors challenge the creation of synergies between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation (see the figure)."

https://openalex.org/W1979054775,"Beyond forming bone, osteoblasts play pivotal roles in various biologic processes, including hematopoiesis and bone metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated in intercellular communication via transfer of proteins and nucleic acids between cells. We focused on the proteomic characterization of nonmineralizing (NMOBs) and mineralizing (MOBs) human osteoblast (SV-HFOs) EVs and investigated their effect on human prostate cancer (PC3) cells by microscopic, proteomic, and gene expression analyses. Proteomic analysis showed that 97% of the proteins were shared among NMOB and MOB EVs, and 30% were novel osteoblast-specific EV proteins. Label-free quantification demonstrated mineralization stage-dependent 5-fold enrichment of 59 and 451 EV proteins in NMOBs and MOBs, respectively. Interestingly, bioinformatic analyses of the osteoblast EV proteomes and EV-regulated prostate cancer gene expression profiles showed that they converged on pathways involved in cell survival and growth. This was verified by in vitro proliferation assays where osteoblast EV uptake led to 2-fold increase in PC3 cell growth compared to cell-free culture medium-derived vesicle controls. Our findings elucidate the mineralization stage-specific protein content of osteoblast-secreted EVs, show a novel way by which osteoblasts communicate with prostate cancer, and open up innovative avenues for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2073023510,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are viewed as safe, readily available and promising adult stem cells, which are currently used in several clinical trials. Additionally, their soluble-factor secretion and multi-lineage differentiation capacities place MSCs in the forefront of stem cell types with expected near-future clinical applications. In the present work MSCs were isolated from the umbilical cord matrix (Wharton's jelly) of human umbilical cord samples. The cells were thoroughly characterized and confirmed as bona-fide MSCs, presenting in vitro low generation time, high proliferative and colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) capacity, typical MSC immunophenotype and osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity. The cells were additionally subjected to an oligodendroglial-oriented step-wise differentiation protocol in order to test their neural- and oligodendroglial-like differentiation capacity. The results confirmed the neural-like plasticity of MSCs, and suggested that the cells presented an oligodendroglial-like phenotype throughout the differentiation protocol, in several aspects sharing characteristics common to those of bona-fide oligodendrocyte precursor cells and differentiated oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1981113527,"Statins are drugs commonly used for the treatment of high plasma cholesterol levels. Beyond these well known lipid-lowering properties, they possess broad-reaching effects in vivo, including antitumor effects. Statins inhibit the growth of multiple tumors. However, the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we show that simvastatin inhibits the proliferation of human leiomyoma cells. This was associated with decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and multiple changes in cell cycle progression. Simvastatin potently stimulated leiomyoma cell apoptosis in a manner mechanistically dependent upon apoptotic calcium release from voltage-gated calcium channels. Therefore, simvastatin possesses antitumor effects that are dependent upon the apoptotic calcium release machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2012359876,"Chalcone synthase is a key and often rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments that accumulate in plant organs such as flowers and fruits, but the relationship between CHS expression and the petal coloration level in different cultivars is still unclear. In this study, three typical crabapple cultivars were chosen based on different petal colors and coloration patterns. The two extreme color cultivars, 'Royalty' and 'Flame', have dark red and white petals respectively, while the intermediate cultivar 'Radiant' has pink petals. We detected the flavoniods accumulation and the expression levels of McCHS during petals expansion process in different cultivars. The results showed McCHS have their special expression patterns in each tested cultivars, and is responsible for the red coloration and color variation in crabapple petals, especially for color fade process in 'Radiant'. Furthermore, tobacco plants constitutively expressing McCHS displayed a higher anthocyanins accumulation and a deeper red petal color compared with control untransformed lines. Moreover, the expression levels of several anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were higher in the transgenic McCHS overexpressing tobacco lines than in the control plants. A close relationship was observed between the expression of McCHS and the transcription factors McMYB4 and McMYB5 during petals development in different crabapple cultivars, suggesting that the expression of McCHS was regulated by these transcription factors. We conclude that the endogenous McCHS gene is a critical factor in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis during petal coloration in Malus crabapple."
https://openalex.org/W2129537329,"Pah1 is the phosphatidate phosphatase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that produces diacylglycerol for triacylglycerol synthesis and concurrently controls the levels of phosphatidate used for phospholipid synthesis. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Pah1 regulate its subcellular location and phosphatidate phosphatase activity. Compared with its phosphorylation by multiple protein kinases, Pah1 is dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase complex consisting of Nem1 (catalytic subunit) and Spo7 (regulatory subunit). In this work, we characterized the Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase complex for its enzymological, kinetic, and regulatory properties with phosphorylated Pah1. The dephosphorylation of Pah1 by Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase resulted in the stimulation (6-fold) of phosphatidate phosphatase activity. For Pah1 phosphorylated by the Pho85-Pho80 kinase complex, maximum Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase activity required Mg(2+) ions (8 mm) and Triton X-100 (0.25 mm) at pH 5.0. The energy of activation for the reaction was 8.4 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was thermally labile at temperatures above 40 °C. The enzyme activity was inhibited by sodium vanadate, sodium fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and phenylglyoxal but was not significantly affected by lipids or nucleotides. Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase activity was dependent on the concentrations of Pah1 phosphorylated by Pho85-Pho80, Cdc28-cyclin B, PKA, and PKC with kcat and Km values of 0.29 s(-1) and 81 nm, 0.11 s(-1) and 127 nm, 0.10 s(-1) and 46 nm, and 0.02 s(-1) and 38 nm, respectively. Its specificity constant (kcat/Km) for Pah1 phosphorylated by Pho85-Pho80 was 1.6-, 4-, and 6-fold higher, respectively, than that phosphorylated by PKA, Cdc28-cyclin B, and PKC."
https://openalex.org/W2012424523,"Although all KRas (protein that in humans is encoded by the KRas gene) point mutants are considered to have a similar prognostic capacity, their transformation and tumorigenic capacities vary widely. We compared the metastatic efficiency of KRas G12V (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog with valine mutation at codon 12) and KRas G13D (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog with aspartic mutation at codon 13) oncogenes in an orthotopic colorectal cancer (CRC) model. Following subcutaneous preconditioning, recombinant clones of the SW48 CRC cell line [Kras wild-type (Kras WT)] expressing the KRas G12V or KRas G13D allele were microinjected in the mouse cecum. The percentage of animals developing lymph node metastasis was higher in KRas G12V than in KRas G13D mice. Microscopic, macroscopic, and visible lymphatic foci were 1.5- to 3.0-fold larger in KRas G12V than in KRas G13D mice (P < 0.05). In the lung, only microfoci were developed in both groups. KRas G12V primary tumors had lower apoptosis (7.0 ± 1.2 vs. 7.4 ± 1.0 per field, P = 0.02), higher tumor budding at the invasion front (1.2 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 0.1, P = 0.04), and a higher percentage of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-overexpressing intravasated tumor emboli (49.8 ± 9.4% vs. 12.8 ± 4.4%, P < 0.001) than KRas G13D tumors. KRas G12V primary tumors showed Akt activation, and β5 integrin, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and Serpine-1 overexpression, whereas KRas G13D tumors showed integrin β1 and angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) overexpression. The increased cell survival, invasion, intravasation, and specific molecular regulation observed in KRas G12V tumors is consistent with the higher aggressiveness observed in patients with CRC expressing this oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2001318653,"Although patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who adhere to a pulmonary rehabilitation program are better able to manage their illness and experience a better health-related quality of life, pulmonary rehabilitation remains underused. This study aims to describe the experiences of patients who are in a pulmonary rehabilitation program, and explore the perceptions of both patients and health professionals about what improves effective pulmonary rehabilitation.A qualitative research design, including focus groups and individual interviews with 25 patients and 7 program health professionals, was used to obtain combined perspectives about the factors underpinning the COPD patient's reasons for participation in a rehabilitation program.Three themes were derived from the descriptive content analysis: (1) building confidence, (2) a perception of immediate tangible results, and (3) being ready and having access to the program.Qualitative findings from this study suggest that a patient's adherence to a COPD rehabilitation program can be improved by quickly building up the participant's confidence, promoting tangible results, and by timely recognizing and responding to the issues of readiness and access. Based on these findings, health care providers could develop strategies to better serve COPD patients who face multiple barriers to access and successfully complete a pulmonary rehabilitation program."
https://openalex.org/W2090092141,"Apelin is the endogenous ligand of the orphan 7-transmembrane domain GPCRAPJ, now named the apelin receptor (ApelinR). Apelin plays a prominent role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. To better understand the structural organization of the ApelinR, we built 3 homology 3-dimensional (3D) models of the human ApelinR using the validated cholecystokinin receptor-1 3D model or the X-ray structures of the β2-adrenergic and CXCR4 receptors as templates. Docking of the pyroglutamyl form of apelin 13 (pE13F) into these models revealed the conservation at the bottom of the binding site of a hydrophobic cavity in which the C-terminal Phe of pE13F was embedded. In contrast, at the top of the binding site, depending on the model, different interactions were visualized between acidic residues of the ApelinR and the basic residues of pE13F. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that Asp 92, Glu 172, and Asp 282 of rat ApelinR are key residues in apelin binding by interacting with Lys 8, Arg 2, and Arg 4 of pE13F, respectively. These residues are only seen in the CXCR4-based ApelinR 3D model, further validating this model. These findings bring new insights into the structural organization of the ApelinR and the mode of apelin binding.—Gerbier, R., Leroux, V., Couvineau, P., Alvear-Perez, R., Maigret, B., Llorens-Cortes, C., Iturrioz, X., New structural insights into the apelin receptor: identification of key residues for apelin binding.

How CD44 functions as a rolling ligand despite its weak affinity for E-selectin is unknown. We examined the nanometer scale organization of CD44 on intact cells. CD44 on leukocytes and transfected K562 cells was cross-linked within a 1.14-nm spacer. Depolymerizing actin with latrunculin B reduced cross-linking. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) revealed tight co-clustering between CD44 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and CD44 fused to cyan fluorescent protein on K562 cells. Latrunculin B reduced FRET-reported co-clustering. Number and brightness analysis confirmed actin-dependent CD44-YFP clusters on living cells. CD44 lacking binding sites for ankyrin and for ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins on its cytoplasmic domain (ΔANKΔERM) did not cluster. Unexpectedly, CD44 lacking only the ankyrin-binding site (ΔANK) formed larger but looser clusters. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrated increased CD44 mobility by latrunculin B treatment or by deleting the cytoplasmic domain. ΔANKΔERM mobility increased only modestly, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain engages the cytoskeleton by an additional mechanism. Ex vivo differentiated CD44-deficient neutrophils expressing exogenous CD44 rolled on E-selectin and activated Src kinases after binding anti-CD44 antibody.

These proteins are synthesized with the respective presequences, which are proteolytically removed following membrane insertion. Second, the E. coli YidC has an extra TM segment at its N terminus and a large periplasmic domain following it (14.Sääf A. Monné M. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G.

Until recently, there was very little structural information available on YidC. In 2008, x-ray crystallography showed that the large periplasmic domain of the E. coli YidC adopted a super-β-sandwich domain commonly seen in sugar-binding proteins (16.Ravaud S. Stjepanovic G.

In 2014, there was a breakthrough in the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 field with the determination of the crystal structure of the Bacillus halodurans YidC2 at a 2.4 Å resolution (21.Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A. Nishiyama K. Sugano Y. Mori T. Dohmae N. Hirata K. Nakada-Nakura Y. Maturana A.D. Tanaka Y. Mori H. Sugita Y. Arisaka F. Ito K. Ishitani R. Tsukazaki T. Nureki O. Structural basis for Sec-independent membrane protein insertion by YidC.Nature. 2014; 509: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a novel fold and showed that the five conserved TM helices form a hydrophilic groove containing a conserved positively charged residue (Fig. 1A). The hydrophilic groove is located in the inner leaflet of the bilayer and faces the cytoplasm and lipid bilayer. YidC has no hydrophilic pore and is closed to the extracellular side. Kumazaki et al. (21.Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A. Nishiyama K. Sugano Y. Mori T. Dohmae N. Hirata K. Nakada-Nakura Y. Maturana A.D. Tanaka Y. Mori H. Sugita Y. Arisaka F. Ito K. Ishitani R. Tsukazaki T. Nureki O. Structural basis for Sec-independent membrane protein insertion by YidC.Nature. 2014; 509: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the conserved positively charged residue in the groove of YidC plays a critical role in membrane insertion of the single-spanning MifM protein that has two negatively charged residues in the translocated tail. The hydrophilic cavity with the arginine is proposed to promote insertion by attracting the negatively charged N-terminal tail of the substrate. Interestingly, the conserved arginine is crucial for Bacillus subtilis SpoIIIJ (YidC1) to function, and SpoIIIJ was only able to rescue the growth of a SpoIIIJ depletion strain when the conserved arginine was changed to a lysine but not when mutated to a neutral or negatively charged residue. This suggests that the positively charged residue is essential for YidC1 to facilitate membrane protein insertion in B. subtilis. Moreover, the hairpin structure at the entrance of the hydrophilic groove at the cytoplasmic surface is important for the activity of SpoIIIJ in B. subtilis and may be important for the binding of YidC substrates. In this study, we investigated the role of the conserved Arg at position 366 for the membrane insertase function of the E. coli YidC. Although E. coli YidC is fully functional with a substituted amino acid with either a polar or an apolar side chain, its function was lost when it was substituted with a negatively charged amino acid in place of Arg-366. In contrast, the conserved positively charged residue was critical for the Gram-positive S. mutans YidC2 to complement the E. coli YidC depletion strain. We found only S. mutans YidC2 with a positively charged residue at position 73 was functional in membrane protein insertion in E. coli. In contrast, the chloroplast Alb3 homolog was functional in E. coli even when the conserved lysine (found in place of arginine in the wild-type construct) was substituted with an amino acid with a neutral side chain. However, like the E. coli YidC, Alb3 was not functional when this residue was substituted with a negatively charged amino acid. Finally, the importance of the dynamic hairpin C1 region was examined for the E. coli YidC because this region was proposed to be involved in the initial recruitment of YidC substrates (21.Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A. Nishiyama K. Sugano Y. Mori T. Dohmae N. Hirata K. Nakada-Nakura Y. Maturana A.D. Tanaka Y. Mori H. Sugita Y. Arisaka F. Ito K. Ishitani R. Tsukazaki T. Nureki O.

Deletion of the entire helical hairpin structure or deletion of its C-terminal region impaired YidC activity. However, alanine scanning mutagenesis showed the precise amino acid sequence is not important for the helical hairpin function.

All of the mutants of YidC homologs were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli JS7131 was transformed with pMS119 encoding either Pf3-23Lep, PC-Lep, or PreCyoA-N-P2 and then further transformed with pACYC184 encoding YidC or the appropriate homolog (H1Alb3 or 247YidC2). The cells were grown in LB media in the presence of ampicillin (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (final concentration, 25 μg/ml). Depletion of the chromosomally encoded YidC was achieved by growth in the presence of 0.2% glucose for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed with M9 medium and then transferred into this medium, which lacks Met, and grown for 30 min. Expression of YidC-dependent membrane proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 min, followed by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine (70 μCi/ml) for 1 min. To analyze membrane insertion of PC-Lep and PreCyoA-N-P2, a signal peptide cleavage assay was used. After [35S] labeling, an equal volume of 20% TCA was added to precipitate total proteins. The precipitate was washed with ice-cold acetone and resuspended in Tris-SDS (pH 8.0) buffer. The samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation to examine membrane insertion by signal peptide processing of PC-Lep to C-Lep or PreCyoA-N-P2 to CyoA-N-P2. Antiserum to leader peptidase was used to immunoprecipitate PC-Lep and C-Lep or PreCyoA-N-P2 and CyoA-N-P2. Protease accessibility was employed to assay membrane insertion of Pf3-23Lep. Following radiolabeling, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in 40% sucrose and 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To prepare spheroplasts, lysozyme (5 μg/ml) and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) were added, and the sample was kept on ice for 20 min. Where indicated, proteinase K was added (0.5 mg/ml final concentration) and incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by the addition of PMSF to quench the proteinase K reaction. Immunoprecipitation of Pf3-23Lep was performed using leader peptidase antiserum, and OmpA was precipitated with OmpA antiserum, as described previously. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The translocation efficiencies were determined by quantitation of the appropriate bands using ImageJ, developed at National Institutes of Health. The percent of translocation across the membrane was determined by calculating the percent of the signal peptidase processed band appearing on the gels. For the Pf3-derived proteins the protease-protected bands were analyzed. For Pf3-23Lep, one of the seven methionines in the protein sequence was lost upon proteinase K cleavage, so Equation 1 was used to determine the percent of translocation.%translocation=7/6 cleaved Pf3-23Lep7/6 cleaved Pf3-23Lep+uncleaved Pf3-23Lep×100(Eq. 1) For Procoat-Lep, two out of seven methionine residues were lost upon signal peptidase cleavage; thus Equation 2 was used to determine the percentage of the protein translocated.%translocation=7/5 processed Procoat-Lep7/5 processed Procoat-Lep+unprocessed Procoat-Lep×100(Eq. 2) For PreCyoA-N-P2, one out of seven methionine residues was lost upon signal peptidase cleavage; therefore, Equation 3 was used to determine the percent of translocation.%translocation=7/6 processed PreCyoA-N-P27/6 processed PreCyoA-N-P2 unprocessed PreCyoA-N-P2×100(Eq. 3) The % translocation for all the insertion studies is presented in the figures with the data. E. coli JS7131 cells bearing the respective pACYC184 plasmids were grown overnight in Luria broth (LB) with 0.2% arabinose and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The following morning, the cells were washed once and back-diluted 1:100 into LB medium lacking arabinose. The cells were grown for 3 h and were subsequently serially diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000), and 4 μl was spotted on LB plates containing 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose and chloramphenicol, respectively. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The complementation experiments with the E. coli YidC and its mutants (Figs. 2A and 3A), and the A. thaliana H1Alb3 and its mutants (Fig. 5A), respectively, were performed on the same LB + arabinose agar plate and the same LB + glucose plate, respectively.

Antibody produced against a C-terminal peptide from Pisum sativum Alb3, which reacts with A. thaliana Alb3, was a gift from Ralph Henry. The crystal structure of B. halodurans YidC2 revealed a hydrophilic groove that was exposed to the cytoplasm and the inner bilayer leaflet (Fig. 1A) (21.Kumazaki K. Chiba S. Takemoto M. Furukawa A.

https://openalex.org/W2169225250,"Mucopolysaccharidosis I Hurler (MPSI-H) is a pediatric lysosomal storage disease caused by genetic deficiencies in IDUA, coding for α-l-iduronidase. Idua(-/-) mice share similar clinical pathology with patients, including the accumulation of the undegraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulfate (HS), and dermatan sulfate (DS), progressive neurodegeneration, and dysostosis multiplex. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most effective treatment for Hurler patients, but reduced intensity conditioning is a risk factor in transplantation, suggesting an underlying defect in hematopoietic cell engraftment. HS is a co-receptor in the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) migration to the bone marrow (BM), but the effect of HS alterations on HSPC migration, or the functional role of HS in MPSI-H are unknown. We demonstrate defective WT HSPC engraftment and migration in Idua(-/-) recipient BM, particularly under reduced intensity conditioning. Both intra- but especially extracellular Idua(-/-) BM HS was significantly increased and abnormally sulfated. Soluble heparinase-sensitive GAGs from Idua(-/-) BM and specifically 2-O-sulfated HS, elevated in Idua(-/-) BM, both inhibited CXCL12-mediated WT HSPC transwell migration, while DS had no effect. Thus we have shown that excess overly sulfated extracellular HS binds, and sequesters CXCL12, limiting hematopoietic migration and providing a potential mechanism for the limited scope of HSCT in Hurler disease."
https://openalex.org/W2123114567,"Tumor cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN or CD13) has two puzzling functions unrelated to its enzymatic activity: mediating tumor cell motility and serving as a receptor for tumor-homing peptides (peptides that bring anti-cancer drugs to tumor cells). To investigate APN-based tumor-homing therapy, we determined the crystal structure of APN complexed with a tumor-homing peptide containing a representative Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif. The tumor-homing peptide binds to the APN enzymatic active site, but it resists APN degradation due to a distorted scissile peptide bond. To explore APN-based tumor cell motility, we examined the interactions between APN and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. APN binds to, but does not degrade, NGR motifs in ECM proteins that share similar conformations with the NGR motif in the APN-bound tumor-homing peptide. Therefore, APN-based tumor cell motility and tumor-homing therapy rely on a unified mechanism in which both functions are driven by the specific and stable interactions between APN and the NGR motifs in ECM proteins and tumor-homing peptides. This study further implicates APN as an integrin-like molecule that functions broadly in cell motility and adhesion by interacting with its signature NGR motifs in the extracellular environment.

Therefore, APN-based tumor cell motility and tumor-homing therapy rely on a unified mechanism in which both functions are driven by the specific and stable interactions between APN and the NGR motifs in ECM proteins and tumor-homing peptides. This study further implicates APN as an integrin-like molecule that functions broadly in cell motility and adhesion by interacting with its signature NGR motifs in the extracellular environment."

https://openalex.org/W2020053733,"USP28 (ubiquitin-specific protease 28) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has been implicated in the DNA damage response, the regulation of Myc signaling, and cancer progression. The half-life stability of major regulators of critical cellular pathways depends on the activities of specific ubiquitin E3 ligases that target them for proteosomal degradation and deubiquitinating enzymes that promote their stabilization. One function of the post-translational small ubiquitin modifier (SUMO) is the regulation of enzymatic activity of protein targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the SUMO modification of the N-terminal domain of USP28 negatively regulates its deubiquitinating activity, revealing a role for the N-terminal region as a regulatory module in the control of USP28 activity. Despite the presence of ubiquitin-binding domains in the N-terminal domain, its truncation does not impair deubiquitinating activity on diubiquitin or polyubiquitin chain substrates. In contrast to other characterized USP deubiquitinases, our results indicate that USP28 has a chain preference activity for Lys11, Lys48, and Lys63 diubiquitin linkages.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This post-translation modification consists of the formation of an isopeptidic bond between the C terminus of the Ub or Ubl molecule and a lysine residue of the target protein. Ubiquitin tagging is the major cellular signal to promote the proteasomal degradation of protein targets, normally by the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. In addition to the protein degradation pathway, Ubls have also been implicated in multiple cellular processes, mainly by regulating protein-protein interactions, protein localization, or enzymatic activity (3Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Concepts in sumoylation: a decade on.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar, 4Hochstrasser M. Origin and function of ubiquitin-like proteins.Nature. 2009; 458: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Formation of the covalent isopeptidic bond between Ubls and the protein target occurs through a specific enzymatic cascade for each type of Ubl modification. This cascade involves the activating E1, the conjugating E2, and the ligating E3 enzymes (5Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of Ubl modification is determined primarily by the E3 ligase enzymes, which select the protein target and are comprised of a large and diverse family in mammals. Ub and Ubl modification can be reversed by a large family of proteases that remove Ub or Ubl from substrates and, in some instances, can protect them from degradation by the 26 S proteasome (6Gareau J.R.

USP28 is a member of a family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). DUBs comprise a large class of intracellular proteases that can cleave ubiquitin from substrates. DUBs can be divided into five families: ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH), ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTU), MJD (Josephins), and MPN+/JAMM (JAB1/MPN/MOV34 metalloenzymes). All of these families are cysteine proteases except the MPN+/JAMM family, which are metalloproteases. USP28 belongs to the USP family, which is comprised of more than 50 members (7Komander D.

USP28 is highly homologous to USP25, which has been biochemically characterized. Searches in silico predicted that both USP28 and USP25 contain one ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) and two ubiquitin interaction motifs (UIM) in the N-terminal region of the proteins. The crystal structures of a number of DUBs in the USP class have been resolved, including USP7/HAUSP, USP14, USP2, USP21, and USP8 providing the basis for molecular recognition studies of these proteases in the apo form and in complex with ubiquitin (9Hu M.

These structural studies demonstrated that the mechanism for ubiquitin recognition is similar in these proteins that are homologous only within their catalytic site regions, and it was hypothesized that this recognition mechanism is common to all DUBs of the USP/UBP class. Genomic approaches have identified at least 530 human genes that putatively encode enzymes involved in the conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin. Of these, at least 79 are thought to encode functional DUBs, some of which have multiple isoforms (15Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R.

Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Marfany G. Characterization of alternatively spliced products and tissue-specific isoforms of USP28 and USP25.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0043)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently found as an interaction partner of 53BP1, a key regulator of DNA repair pathway choice (24Valero R.

Characterization of alternatively spliced products and tissue-specific isoforms of USP28 and USP25.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0043)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of USP28 was reported to be required for IR-induced apoptosis and the stability of numerous DNA damage response regulators (25Zhang D. Zaugg K. Mak T.W. Elledge S.J. A role for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 in control of the DNA-damage response.Cell. 2006; 126: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Independently, USP28 was reported to stabilize the Myc proto-oncogene by antagonizing the activity of the SCFFBW7 ubiquitin ligase complex (17Popov N. Herold S. Llamazares M. Schülein C. Eilers M. Fbw7 and Usp28 regulate myc protein stability in response to DNA damage.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2327-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Popov N. Wanzel M. Madiredjo M. Zhang D.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This function of USP28 was required for Myc induced transformation, and it was found to be up-regulated in human colon carcinoma and important to prevent differentiation. It was proposed that the dissociation of USP28 from Fbw7 in response to DNA damage provides a potential mechanism that coordinates Myc stability with the DNA damage response (23Popov N. Wanzel M.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has confirmed the interaction between USP28 and 53BP1 but found only minor effects on the DNA damage response and no impairment in 53BP1-dependent processes, suggesting that it may not represent an attractive therapeutic target for chemosensitization (18Jacq X.

However, its conditional depletion in a mouse model of colorectal cancer led to a significant increase in tumor latency, suggesting that in particular contexts, the modulation of its activity may influence cancer progression (22Diefenbacher M.E.

Although SUMO is not a direct tag for proteosomal degradation, there are several examples of cross-talk between the SUMO and the ubiquitin modification systems (27Praefcke G.J. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. SUMO playing tag with ubiquitin.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of IκBα (inhibitor of transcription factor NF-κB) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, SUMO or ubiquitin is conjugated on particular lysine residues, thus determining the protein fate in the cell (28Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. SUMO-1 modification of IκBα inhibits NF-κB activation.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 29Hoege C. Pfander B.

In this context, of particular interest was the discovery of ubiquitin-dependent degradation by specific SUMO-target ubiquitin E3 ligases (STUbL) that can recognize substrates with polySUMO chains (30Prudden J. Pebernard S. Raffa G. Slavin D.A. Perry J.J. Tainer J.A. McGowan C.H. Boddy M.N.

Another example includes the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme E2-25K, in which SUMO conjugation prevents interaction with the ubiquitin E1 enzyme (34Pichler A. Knipscheer P. Oberhofer E. van Dijk W.J. Körner R. Olsen J.V. Jentsch S. Melchior F. Sixma T.K. SUMO modification of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2–25K.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, the DUB protease USP25 has been shown to be either SUMOylated or monoubiquitinated on Lys99. The ubiquitin modification of Lys99 enhanced USP25 deubiquitinating activity on the model substrate MyBPC1 (myosine-binding protein C), whereas SUMO modification had an inhibitory effect on its activity (35Denuc A. Bosch-Comas A. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Marfany G.

Interestingly, the ubiquitin-binding domains in the N-terminal region of USP25 seem to play a role in the regulation of its protease activity (35Denuc A. Bosch-Comas A. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Marfany G.

In this study, we have investigated the catalytic properties of USP28 against different ubiquitin substrates and examined in particular the role of the N-terminal region in the regulation of protease activity. We have found that the SUMO modification of the N-terminal region inhibits the deubiquitinating activity of USP28, suggesting SUMO modification as a potential regulator of the activity of USP28 and adding another link to the cross-talk between these two post-translational modifications systems. However, in contrast to USP25, the N-terminal region of USP28 does not impair the deubiquitinating activity of the catalytic domain, and the analysis of the SUMO2-USP28 fusion proteins suggests a direct interaction of SUMO with the catalytic domain of USP28. Interestingly, USP28 displays a chain preference for Lys11, Lys48, and Lys63 diubiquitin linkages, in contrast to other nonspecific members of the USP deubiquitinase family. These results reveal unexpected diversity in the regulatory mechanisms and substrate preference of structurally similar USPs. The pENTR-USP25 construct was purchased from Open Biosystems (Human ORFeome Collection), and the pDZ-Flag-USP28 construct was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid 15665). The USP28 open reading frame was cloned into the pENTRC vector by PCR followed by TOPO cloning (pENTR directional TOPO cloning kits; Invitrogen).

SUMO2 fusion proteins were constructed by PCR and inserted into the USP28160–757 and USP281–757 constructs (primers are shown in Table 1). Plasmids containing Δ14-SUMO2-precursor (first 14-amino acid deletion of SUMO2 precursor) and Δ14-SUMO2 (first 14-amino acid deletion of the mature SUMO2) were constructed based on the results of Reverter and Lima (37Reverter D.

They are purified by the procedure mentioned above. cDNA encoding for the particular proteins were amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pET28b-Smt3 to encode a polypeptide fused to a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag and followed by another SENP-cleavable Smt3 tag.

Bacterial cultures were grown by fermentation at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm.

Protein was separated from lysate by metal affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen); eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol; and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol with SENP2 at a 1:1000 ratio. After SENP2 cleavage, proteins were separated by gel filtration (Superdex 200; GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, diluted to 50 mm NaCl, applied to anion exchange resin (Mono Q; GE Healthcare), and eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 50% of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 15 column volumes. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, concentrated, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C. The small scale SUMOylation reactions of USP28 constructs were performed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 150 nm SAE1/SAE2 (E1)), 100 nm Ubc9 (E2), 10 nm IR1 (E3), 16 mm USPs, and 32 mm SUMO in MilliQ water. Samples are taken at 0, 30, and 60 min. The large scale SUMOylation of USP281–757 (containing the N-terminal and the catalytic domains) is 10 times the size of the small scale SUMOylation reaction. Products were verified by SDS-PAGE, purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare), concentrated to 1 mg/ml, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed in the Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona mass spectrometry core facility. Proteins were excised from polyacrylamide gels and subjected to in-gel digests with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or both enzymes. Digested peptides were diluted in 1% formic acid. The nano-LC-MS/MS set up was as follows. Samples were loaded on a 180 μm × 2 cm C18 Symmetry trap column (Waters) at a flow rate of 15 μl/min using a nano-Acquity Ultra Performance LCTM chromatographic system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Peptides were separated using a C18 analytical column (BEH130TM C18 75 μm × 25 cm, 1.7 μm; Waters Corp.) with a 90-min run, comprising three consecutive steps with linear gradients from 1 to 35% B in 30 min, from 35 to 50% B in 5 min, and from 50% to 85% B in 3 min, followed by isocratic elution at 85% B in 10 min and stabilization to initial conditions (A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN). The column outlet was directly connected to an Advion TriVersa NanoMate (Advion) fitted on an LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode. Survey MS scans were acquired in the FT with the resolution (defined at 400 m/z) set to 100,000. Up to six of the most intense ions per scan were fragmented and detected in the linear ion trap. The ion count target value was 1,000,000 for the survey scan and 50,000 for the MS/MS scan. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s. Spray voltage in the NanoMate source was set to 1.70 kV. Capillary voltage and tube lens on the LTQ-FT were tuned to 40 and 120 V. Minimal signal required to trigger MS to MS/MS switch was set to 1000, and activation Q was 0.250. The spectrometer was working in positive polarity mode, and singly charged state precursors were rejected for fragmentation. At least one blank run before each analysis was performed to ensure the absence of cross-contamination from previous samples. A database search was performed with Proteome Discoverer software v1.3 (Thermo) using the Sequest search engine and a custom database, which included N-terminal sequences of USP28 and USP25. Search parameters included no enzyme restriction, carbamidomethyl in cysteine as static modification and methionine oxidation, and +599.266 Da (QQQTGG) in lysine as dynamic modifications. Peptide mass tolerance was 10 ppm, and the MS/MS tolerance was 0.8 Da. Peptides with XCorr > 1.1 (z = 1), 1.25 (z = 2), and 1.68 (z = 3) were considered as positive identifications. Human polyubiquitin chain (Lys48, Lys63, and 3–7ubs) and diubiquitin (Lys48 and Lys63) were purchased from Boston Biochem. They were dissolved in the buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 nm Tris 8.0, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol with a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The polyubiquitin chains were diluted 10 times to 0.1 mg/ml and mixed with different concentrations of USP28 constructs (0.5, 5, 50, and 500 nm) at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Diubiquitin substrate was prepared with a narrow dilution of the USP28 constructs: 4, 20, 100, and 500 nm. For the comparative experiment between USP281–757-SUMO2 and USP281–757 in the cleavage of polyubiquitin chains, SENP2 protease at 50 nm was incubated to the reaction mixture for 20 min at 37 °C, to release SUMO from the USP28-SUMO2 adduct. Reactions were stopped after 25 min with SDS loading buffer and analyzed by PAGE. Proteins were detected by staining with SYPRO (Bio-Rad). In the time course experiment with diubiquitin substrates, the concentrations of USP28 and USP28-SUMO2 were fixed at approximately 50 nm. A similar SENP2 incubation was prepared to release SUMO from the USP28-SUMO2 adducts. For the analysis of the cleavage of the different diubiquitin substrates, eight types of diubiquitin linkages (linear, Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63) were purchased from the UBPBio Company. All substrates were dissolved in the buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 nm Tris (pH 8.0), and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. A time course experiment was conducted with three USP28 constructs at fixed substrate (5 μm) and USP28 concentrations (120 nm). Based on structural alignments with other members of the USP family and on a previously published report on the homologous USP25, the USP28 full-length protein (1077 residues) can be divided in three domains: the N-terminal domain (∼160 residues long), the catalytic “conserved” USP domain (∼350–400 residues long), and the C-terminal extension domain (∼400 residues) (Fig. 1a). The N-terminal region of USP28 includes 159 residues (USP281–159), from Met1 to Gly159, the C-terminal residue corresponding with the beginning of the conserved USP catalytic domain (Fig. 1, a and b). In a recent report on USP25, in silico comparative searches predicted three different ubiquitin binding motifs in the N-terminal region: one UBA and two UIMs (35Denuc A. Bosch-Comas A.

The N-terminal regions of USP28 and USP25 are highly homologous, particularly in these ubiquitin-binding motifs (Fig. 1b).

https://openalex.org/W2006556165,"Several aspects of behavior and physiology, such as sleep and wakefulness, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion exhibit daily oscillations known as circadian rhythms. These circadian rhythms are orchestrated by an intrinsic biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus which is adjusted to the daily environmental cycles of day and night by the process of photoentrainment. In mammals, the neuronal signal for photoentrainment arises from a small subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that send a direct projection to the SCN. ipRGCs also mediate other non-image-forming (NIF) visual responses such as negative masking of locomotor activity by light, and the pupillary light reflex (PLR) via co-release of neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) from their synaptic terminals. The relative contribution of each neurotransmitter system for the circadian photoentrainment and other NIF visual responses is still unresolved. We investigated the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission for circadian photoentrainment and NIF behaviors by selective ablation of ipRGC glutamatergic synaptic transmission in mice. Mutant mice displayed delayed re-entrainment to a 6 h phase shift (advance or delay) in the light cycle and incomplete photoentrainment in a symmetrical skeleton photoperiod regimen (1 h light pulses between 11 h dark periods). Circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness also was reduced in some mutant mice. Other NIF responses such as the PLR and negative masking responses to light were also partially attenuated. Overall, these results suggest that glutamate from ipRGCs drives circadian photoentrainment and negative masking responses to light."
https://openalex.org/W2019949457,"Colon cancer is caused by multiple genomic alterations which lead to genomic instability (GI). GI appears in molecular pathways of microsatellite instability (MSI) and chromosomal instability (CIN) with clinically observed case shares of about 15–20% and 80–85%. Radiation enhances the colon cancer risk by inducing GI, but little is known about different outcomes for MSI and CIN. Computer-based modelling can facilitate the understanding of the phenomena named above. Comprehensive biological models, which combine the two main molecular pathways to colon cancer, are fitted to incidence data of Japanese a-bomb survivors. The preferred model is selected according to statistical criteria and biological plausibility. Imprints of cell-based processes in the succession from adenoma to carcinoma are identified by the model from age dependences and secular trends of the incidence data. Model parameters show remarkable compliance with mutation rates and growth rates for adenoma, which has been reported over the last fifteen years. Model results suggest that CIN begins during fission of intestinal crypts. Chromosomal aberrations are generated at a markedly elevated rate which favors the accelerated growth of premalignant adenoma. Possibly driven by a trend of Westernization in the Japanese diet, incidence rates for the CIN pathway increased notably in subsequent birth cohorts, whereas rates pertaining to MSI remained constant. An imbalance between number of CIN and MSI cases began to emerge in the 1980s, whereas in previous decades the number of cases was almost equal. The CIN pathway exhibits a strong radio-sensitivity, probably more intensive in men. Among young birth cohorts of both sexes the excess absolute radiation risk related to CIN is larger by an order of magnitude compared to the MSI-related risk. Observance of pathway-specific risks improves the determination of the probability of causation for radiation-induced colon cancer in individual patients, if their exposure histories are known."

In staphylococci, partial de-N-acetylation of the exopolysaccharide poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) by the extracellular protein IcaB is required for biofilm formation. To understand the molecular basis for PNAG de-N-acetylation, the structure of IcaB from Ammonifex degensii (IcaBAd) has been determined to 1.7 Å resolution.

https://openalex.org/W2008961134,"Mutations in the membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP/Mfrp) gene, specifically expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and ciliary body, cause nanophthalmia or posterior microphthalmia with retinitis pigmentosa in humans, and photoreceptor degeneration in mice. To better understand MFRP function, microarray analysis was performed on eyes of homozygous Mfrprd6 and C57BL/6J mice at postnatal days (P) 0 and P14, prior to photoreceptor loss. Data analysis revealed no changes at P0 but significant differences in RPE and retina-specific transcripts at P14, suggesting a postnatal influence of the Mfrprd6 allele. A subset of these transcripts was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In Mfrprd6 eyes, a significant 1.5- to 2.0-fold decrease was observed among transcripts of genes linked to retinal degeneration, including those involved in visual cycle (Rpe65, Lrat, Rgr), phototransduction (Pde6a, Guca1b, Rgs9), and photoreceptor disc morphogenesis (Rpgrip1 and Fscn2). Levels of RPE65 were significantly decreased by 2.0-fold. Transcripts of Prss56, a gene associated with angle-closure glaucoma, posterior microphthalmia and myopia, were increased in Mfrprd6 eyes by 17-fold. Validation by qRT-PCR indicated a 3.5-, 14- and 70-fold accumulation of Prss56 transcripts relative to controls at P7, P14 and P21, respectively. This trend was not observed in other RPE or photoreceptor mutant mouse models with similar disease progression, suggesting that Prss56 upregulation is a specific attribute of the disruption of Mfrp. Prss56 and Glul in situ hybridization directly identified Muller glia in the inner nuclear layer as the cell type expressing Prss56. In summary, the Mfrprd6 allele causes significant postnatal changes in transcript and protein levels in the retina and RPE. The link between Mfrp deficiency and Prss56 up-regulation, together with the genetic association of human MFRP or PRSS56 variants and ocular size, raises the possibility that these genes are part of a regulatory network influencing postnatal posterior eye development."
https://openalex.org/W2068117941,"Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe associated with periodontal disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal carcinoma. A serine endopeptidase of 61–65 kDa capable of damaging host tissue and of inactivating immune effectors was detected previously in F. nucleatum. Here we describe the identification of this serine protease, named fusolisin, in three oral F. nucleatum sub-species. Gel zymogram revealed fusobacterial proteolytic activity with molecular masses ranging from 55–101 kDa. All of the detected proteases were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. analysis revealed that all of the detected proteases are encoded by genes encoding an open reading frame (ORF) with a calculated mass of approximately 115 kDa. Bioinformatics analysis of the identified ORFs demonstrated that they consist of three domains characteristic of autotransporters of the type Va secretion system. Our results suggest that the F. nucleatum fusolisins are derived from a precursor of approximately 115 kDa. After crossing the cytoplasmic membrane and cleavage of the leader sequence, the C-terminal autotransporter domain of the remaining 96–113 kDa protein is embedded in the outer membrane and delivers the N-terminal S8 serine protease passenger domain to the outer cell surface. In most strains the N-terminal catalytic 55–65 kDa domain self cleaves and liberates itself from the autotransporter domain after its transfer across the outer cell membrane. In F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 this autocatalytic activity is less efficient resulting in a full length membrane-anchored serine protease. The mature serine protease was found to cleave after Thr, Gly, Ala and Leu residues at the P1 position. Growth of F. nucleatum in complex medium was inhibited when serine protease inhibitors were used. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether fusolisin might be used as a target for controlling fusobacterial infections."

Genetic defects in OSTM1 (osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1) cause autosomal recessive osteopetrosis in humans. In particular, OSTM1 mutations that exclude the transmembrane domain might lead to the production of a secreted form of truncated OSTM1. However, the precise role of the secreted form of truncated OSTM1 remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functional role of truncated OSTM1 in osteoclastogenesis. Here, we showed that a secreted form of truncated OSTM1 binds to the cell surface of osteoclast (OC) precursors and inhibits the formation of multinucleated OCs through the reduction of cell fusion and survival. Truncated OSTM1 significantly inhibited the expression of OC marker genes through the down-regulation of the BLIMP1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1)-NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells c1) axis.

https://openalex.org/W2117922536,"Financial (positive or negative) and non-financial incentives or rewards are increasingly used in attempts to influence health behaviours. While unintended consequences of incentive provision are discussed in the literature, evidence syntheses did not identify any primary research with the aim of investigating unintended consequences of incentive interventions for lifestyle behaviour change. Our objective was to investigate perceived positive and negative unintended consequences of incentive provision for a shortlist of seven promising incentive strategies for smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A multi-disciplinary, mixed-methods approach included involving two service-user mother and baby groups from disadvantaged areas with experience of the target behaviours as study co-investigators. Systematic reviews informed the shortlist of incentive strategies. Qualitative semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey of health professionals asked open questions on positive and negative consequences of incentives. The participants from three UK regions were a diverse sample with and without direct experience of incentive interventions: 88 pregnant women/recent mothers/partners/family members; 53 service providers; 24 experts/decision makers and interactive discussions with 63 conference attendees. Maternity and early years health professionals (n = 497) including doctors, midwives, health visitors, public health and related staff participated in the survey. Qualitative analysis identified ethical, political, cultural, social and psychological implications of incentive delivery at population and individual levels. Four key themes emerged: how incentives can address or create inequalities; enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation and wellbeing; have a positive or negative effect on relationships with others within personal networks or health providers; and can impact on health systems and resources by raising awareness and directing service delivery, but may be detrimental to other health care areas. Financial incentives are controversial and generated emotive and oppositional responses. The planning, design and delivery of future incentive interventions should evaluate unexpected consequences to inform the evidence for effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and future implementation."

Patients in Group 1 (n = 273) received rosuvastatin (10 mg), and those in group 2 (n = 805) received atorvastatin (20 mg). The primary end-point was the development of CIN, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL, or an increase ≥25% from baseline within 48-72 h after contrast medium exposure.CIN was observed in 58 (5.4%) patients. The incidence of CIN was similar in patients pretreated with either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin (5.9% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.684). The same results were also observed when using other definitions of CIN. Clinical and procedural characteristics did not show significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Additionally, there were no significant inter-group differences with respect to in-hospital mortality rates (0.4% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.141), or other in-hospital complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that rosuvastatin and atorvastatin demonstrated similar efficacies for preventing CIN, after adjusting for potential confounding risk factors (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval, 0.62-2.20, p = 0.623). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients taking either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin had similar incidences of all-cause mortality (9.4% vs. 7.1%, respectively; p = 0.290) and major adverse cardiovascular events (29.32% vs. 23.14%, respectively; p = 0.135) during follow-up.Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin have similar efficacies for preventing CIN in patients with CKD undergoing PCI."

The knockdown impaired the FcεRI-induced release of a lysosome enzyme, β-hexosaminidase, without affecting the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The release of mRFP-tagged neuropeptide-Y, a reporter for the regulated exocytosis, was also decreased in the PI3K-C2α-deficient cells. The release was increased significantly by the expression of the siRNA-resistant version of PI3K-C2α. In wild-type cells, FcεRI stimulation induced the formation of large vesicles, which were associated with CD63, a marker protein of secretory granules. On the vesicles, the existence of PI3K-C2α and PtdIns(3,4)P2 was observed. These results indicated that PI3K-C2α and its product PtdIns(3,4)P2 may play roles in the secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W2099990239,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infects 200 million individuals worldwide. Although several FDA approved drugs targeting the HCV serine protease and polymerase have shown promising results, there is a need for better drugs that are effective in treating a broader range of HCV genotypes and subtypes without being used in combination with interferon and/or ribavirin. Recently, two crystal structures of the core of the HCV E2 protein (E2c) have been determined, providing structural information that can now be used to target the E2 protein and develop drugs that disrupt the early stages of HCV infection by blocking E2's interaction with different host factors. Using the E2c structure as a template, we have created a structural model of the E2 protein core (residues 421-645) that contains the three amino acid segments that are not present in either structure. Computational docking of a diverse library of 1,715 small molecules to this model led to the identification of a set of 34 ligands predicted to bind near conserved amino acid residues involved in the HCV E2: CD81 interaction. Surface plasmon resonance detection was used to screen the ligand set for binding to recombinant E2 protein, and the best binders were subsequently tested to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of Huh-7 cells by HCV. One compound, 281816, blocked E2 binding to CD81 and inhibited HCV infection in a genotype-independent manner with IC50's ranging from 2.2 µM to 4.6 µM. 281816 blocked the early and late steps of cell-free HCV entry and also abrogated the cell-to-cell transmission of HCV. Collectively the results obtained with this new structural model of E2c suggest the development of small molecule inhibitors such as 281816 that target E2 and disrupt its interaction with CD81 may provide a new paradigm for HCV treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2023882541,"Background Birch pollen-allergic subjects produce polyclonal cross-reactive IgE antibodies that mediate pollen-associated food allergies. The major allergen Bet v 1 and its homologs in plant foods bind IgE in their native protein conformation. Information on location, number and clinical relevance of IgE epitopes is limited. We addressed the use of an allergen-related protein model to identify amino acids critical for IgE binding of PR-10 allergens. Method Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) from meadow rue is structurally homologous to Bet v 1 but does not bind Bet v 1-reactive IgE. NCS was used as the template for epitope grafting. NCS variants were tested with sera from 70 birch pollen allergic subjects and with monoclonal antibody BV16 reported to compete with IgE binding to Bet v 1. Results We generated an NCS variant (Δ29NCSN57/I58E/D60N/V63P/D68K) harboring an IgE epitope of Bet v 1. Bet v 1-type protein folding of the NCS variant was evaluated by 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectroscopy. BV16 bound the NCS variant and 71% (50/70 sera) of our study population showed significant IgE binding. We observed IgE and BV16 cross-reactivity to the epitope presented by the NCS variant in a subgroup of Bet v 1-related allergens. Moreover BV16 blocked IgE binding to the NCS variant. Antibody cross-reactivity depended on a defined orientation of amino acids within the Bet v 1-type conformation. Conclusion Our system allows the evaluation of patient-specific epitope profiles and will facilitate both the identification of clinically relevant epitopes as biomarkers and the monitoring of therapeutic outcomes to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of allergies caused by PR-10 proteins."

Here, the differential gene expression between OXY and PYL mucosa was assessed in seven starter pigs. Total RNA expression was analyzed by whole genome Affymetrix Porcine Gene 1.1_ST array strips. Exploratory functional analysis of gene expression values was done by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, comparing OXY and PYL. Normalized enrichment scores (NESs) were calculated for each gene (statistical significance defined when False Discovery Rate % <25 and P-values of NES<0.05). Expression values were selected for a set of 44 genes and the effect of point of gastric sample was tested by analysis of variance with the procedure for repeated measures. In OXY, HYDROGEN ION TRANSMEMBRANE TRANSPORTER ACTIVITY gene set was the most enriched set compared to PYL, including the two genes for H+/K+-ATPase. Pathways related to mitochondrial activity and feeding behavior were also enriched (primarily cholecystokinin receptors and ghrelin). Aquaporin 4 was the top-ranking gene. In PYL, two gene sets were enriched compared with OXY: LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION and LIPID RAFT, a gene set involved in cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane. The single most differentially expressed genes were gastrin and secretoglobin 1A, member 1, presumably located in the epithelial line, to inactivate inflammatory mediators. Several genes related to mucosal integrity, immune response, detoxification and epithelium renewal were also enriched in PYL (P<0.05). The data indicate that there is significant differential gene expression between OXY of the young pig and PYL and further functional studies are needed to confirm their physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2072207395,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder that affects more than 121 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization ( 1 , 2 ). Despite the prevalence of this pathological syndrome, the most effective treatment currently for MDD is a combination of a limited variety of monoamine-based antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Twenty percent of people with MDD are not helped by existing therapies ( 3 – 5 ), which have been targeting the same serotonin and norepinephrine systems for over 60 years ( 6 ). Most antidepressant treatments have multiple side effects and require weeks to take effect ( 7 ). Unfortunately, during this lag period, up to the onset of activation, there is considerable morbidity and a high risk of suicide ( 8 , 9 ). Thus there is an imperative need for the development of naturally acting antidepressants. A possible reason for the ineffectual treatment of MDD so far has been the incomplete understanding of the nature of depression. Most work in the field, to date, has focused on the passive pathological mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of depression. In contrast, my work focuses on understanding why some individuals are psychophysiologically normal in response to stress (i.e., resilient to depression), while others succumb to depression ( 10 – 14 ). The majority of the population successfully employs active coping skills in response to stress, such as optimism, rationalization, wishful thinking, relaxation, and humor, which are linked to the function of the mesolimbic reward neural circuitry ( 15 ). Thus, current work has only recently begun to understand the neurobiological basis for these psychosocial coping skills ( 10 , 14 , 15 )."
https://openalex.org/W2094213784,"Current target enrichment systems for large-scale next-generation sequencing typically require synthetic oligonucleotides used as capture reagents to isolate sequences of interest. The majority of target enrichment reagents are focused on gene coding regions or promoters en masse. Here we introduce development of a customizable targeted capture system using biotinylated RNA probe baits transcribed from sheared bacterial artificial chromosome clone templates that enables capture of large, contiguous blocks of the genome for sequencing applications. This clone adapted template capture hybridization sequencing (CATCH-Seq) procedure can be used to capture both coding and non-coding regions of a gene, and resolve the boundaries of copy number variations within a genomic target site. Furthermore, libraries constructed with methylated adapters prior to solution hybridization also enable targeted bisulfite sequencing. We applied CATCH-Seq to diverse targets ranging in size from 125 kb to 3.5 Mb. Our approach provides a simple and cost effective alternative to other capture platforms because of template-based, enzymatic probe synthesis and the lack of oligonucleotide design costs. Given its similarity in procedure, CATCH-Seq can also be performed in parallel with commercial systems."
https://openalex.org/W2016719128,"Cell surface glycans vary widely, depending on cell properties. We hypothesized that glycan expression on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) might change during cardiomyogenic differentiation toward the myocardial phenotype. N-glycans were isolated from iPSCs, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM), and original C57BL/6 mouse myocardium (Heart). Their structures were analyzed by a mapping technique based on HPLC elution times and MALDI-TOF/MS spectra. Sixty-eight different N-glycans were isolated; the structures of 60 of these N-glycans were identified. The quantity of high-mannose type (immature) N-glycans on the iPSCs decreased with cardiomyogenic differentiation, but did not reach the low levels observed in the heart. We observed a similar reduction in neutral N-glycans and an increase in fucosylated or sialyl N-glycans. Some structural differences were detected between iPSC-CM and Heart. No N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NeuGc) structures were detected in iPSC-CM, whereas the heart contained numerous NeuGc structures, corresponding to the expression of cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase. Furthermore, several glycans containing Galα1-6 Gal, rarely identified in the other cells, were detected in the iPSC-CM. The expression of N-glycan on murine iPSCs changed toward the myocardial phenotype during cardiomyogenic differentiation, leaving the structural differences of NeuGc content or Galα1-6 Gal structures. Further studies will be warranted to reveal the meaning of the difference of N-glycans between the iPSC-CM and the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2016308341,"Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by unilaterally beginning frontoparietal and basal ganglia atrophy. The study aimed to prove the hypothesis that there are differences in hemispheric susceptibility to disease-related changes.Two groups of CBS patients with symptoms starting either on the left or right body side were investigated. Groups consisted of four patients each and were matched for sex, age and disease duration. Patient groups and a group of eight healthy age-matched controls were analyzed using deformation field morphometry and neuropsychological testing. To further characterize individual disease progression regarding brain atrophy and neuropsychological performance, two female, disease duration-matched patients differing in initially impaired body side were followed over six months.A distinct pattern of neural atrophy and neuropsychological performance was revealed for both CBS: Patients with initial right-sided impairment (r-CBS) revealed atrophy predominantly in frontoparietal areas and showed, except from apraxia, no other cognitive deficits. In contrast, patients with impairment of the left body side (l-CBS) revealed more widespread atrophy, extending from frontoparietal to orbitofrontal and temporal regions; and apraxia, perceptional and memory deficits could be found. A similar pattern of morphological and neuropsychological differences was found for the individual disease progression in l-CBS and r-CBS single cases.For similar durations of disease, volumetric grey matter loss related to CBS pathology appeared earlier and progressed faster in l-CBS than in r-CBS. Cognitive impairment in r-CBS was characterized by apraxia, and additional memory and perceptional deficits for l-CBS."
https://openalex.org/W2086403693,"Despite recent breakthroughs in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic within South Africa, the transmission of the virus continues at alarmingly high rates. It is possible, with the use of phylogenetic methods, to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in order to identify factors that may contribute to the sustained transmission of the virus. The aim of this study was to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst the infected population of Cape Town.We analysed gag p24 and RT-pol sequences which were generated from samples spanning over 21-years with advanced phylogenetic techniques. We identified two transmission clusters over a 21-year period amongst randomly sampled patients from Cape Town and the surrounding areas. We also estimated the origin of each of the identified transmission clusters with the oldest cluster dating back, on average, 30 years and the youngest dating back roughly 20 years.These transmission clusters represent the first identified transmission events among the heterosexual population in Cape Town. By increasing the number of randomly sampled specimens within a dataset over time, it is possible to start to uncover transmission events of HIV amongst local communities in generalized epidemics. This information can be used to produce targeted interventions to decrease transmission of HIV in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2169069173,"Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling plays crucial roles in various developmental processes including those in the brain. We examined the role of Fgf16 in the formation of the zebrafish brain. The knockdown of fgf16 decreased cell proliferation in the forebrain and midbrain. fgf16 was also essential for development of the ventral telencephalon and diencephalon, whereas fgf16 was not required for dorsoventral patterning in the midbrain. fgf16 was additionally required for the specification and differentiation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes, but not for those of glutamatergic neurons in the forebrain. Cross talk between Fgf and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling was critical for the specification of GABAergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes. The expression of fgf16 in the forebrain was down-regulated by the inhibition of Hh and Fgf19 signaling, but not by that of Fgf3/Fgf8 signaling. The fgf16 morphant phenotype was similar to that of the fgf19 morphant and embryos blocked Hh signaling. The results of the present study indicate that Fgf16 signaling, which is regulated by the downstream pathways of Hh-Fgf19 in the forebrain, is involved in forebrain development."
https://openalex.org/W1994170843,"Stem cell therapy has a potential for regenerating damaged myocardium. However, a key obstacle to cell therapy’s success is the loss of engrafted cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in the ischemic myocardium. While many strategies have been developed to improve engrafted cell survival, tools to evaluate cell efficacy within the body are limited. Traditional genetic labeling tools, such as GFP-like fluorescent proteins (eGFP, DsRed, mCherry), have limited penetration depths in vivo due to tissue scattering and absorption. To circumvent these limitations, a near-infrared fluorescent mutant of the DrBphP bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, IFP1.4, was developed for in vivo imaging, but it has yet to be used for in vivo stem/progenitor cell tracking. In this study, we incorporated IFP1.4 into mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) by a lentiviral vector. Live IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were imaged by their near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) using an Odyssey scanner following overnight incubation with biliverdin. A significant linear correlation was observed between the amount of cells and NIRF signal intensity in in vitro studies. Lentiviral mediated IFP1.4 gene labeling is stable, and does not impact the apoptosis and cardiac differentiation of CPC. To assess efficacy of our model for engrafted cells in vivo, IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were intramyocardially injected into infarcted hearts. NIRF signals were collected at 1-day, 7-days, and 14-days post-injection using the Kodak in vivo multispectral imaging system. Strong NIRF signals from engrafted cells were imaged 1 day after injection. At 1 week after injection, 70% of the NIRF signal was lost when compared to the intensity of the day 1 signal. The data collected 2 weeks following transplantation showed an 88% decrease when compared to day 1. Our studies have shown that IFP1.4 gene labeling can be used to track the viability of transplanted cells in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2076304767,"David Marr and Tomaso Poggio proposed that in order to figure out information processing in the brain, we must understand its operation at the computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels ( 1 ). Computational tasks of the visual system, for example, include extracting properties of the external world, such as recognizing objects, and estimating their locations and movements. Algorithmically, the visual system adopts a hierarchical organization, whereby visual features of increasing complexity are represented and integrated at successive stages of processing. Some retinal ganglion cells respond best to small, round, visual stimuli of high contrast. This information is relayed by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to the primary visual cortex (V1), where neurons become sensitive to the orientation and motion direction of visual features ( 2 ). Further up the visual processing hierarchy, neuronal representations become increasingly more complex, as neurons become responsive to contours and objects often invariant of their precise location in visual space. What remains unknown is how, at the implementational level, these computations at different stages of the visual system are carried out by the neuronal networks. Similar to many proteins whose structures determined by crystallography provide mechanistic insights into their functions, knowledge of the connectivity-function relationship of neuronal networks may provide a mechanistic understanding of how the brain generates the representation of increasing levels of abstraction. In view of this, my work with Thomas Mrsic-Flogel and Sonja Hofer at University College London has helped to develop an experimental approach that allowed us to relate the connectivity between cortical neurons to their visual response properties ( 3 )."
