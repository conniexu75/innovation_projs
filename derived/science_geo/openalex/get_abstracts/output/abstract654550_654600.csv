https://openalex.org/W3036931136,"The clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been well described. We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT–PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People’s Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15–26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6–10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8–38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys. A cohort of asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly lower levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies compared to a cohort of age- and sex-matched symptomatic infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W3036386821,"During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the infection of millions of people and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The entry of the virus into cells depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although there is currently no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19-convalescent individuals. Plasma samples collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres; titres were less than 50 in 33% of samples, below 1,000 in 79% of samples and only 1% of samples had titres above 5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed the expansion of clones of RBD-specific memory B cells that expressed closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on the RBD neutralized the virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as 2 ng ml-1. In conclusion, most convalescent plasma samples obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective."
https://openalex.org/W3036603151,"Cellular senescence is characterized by stable cell-cycle arrest and a secretory program that modulates the tissue microenvironment1,2. Physiologically, senescence serves as a tumour-suppressive mechanism that prevents the expansion of premalignant cells3,4 and has a beneficial role in wound-healing responses5,6. Pathologically, the aberrant accumulation of senescent cells generates an inflammatory milieu that leads to chronic tissue damage and contributes to diseases such as liver and lung fibrosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and osteoarthritis1,7. Accordingly, eliminating senescent cells from damaged tissues in mice ameliorates the symptoms of these pathologies and even promotes longevity1,2,8-10. Here we test the therapeutic concept that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that target senescent cells can be effective senolytic agents. We identify the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)11 as a cell-surface protein that is broadly induced during senescence and show that uPAR-specific CAR T cells efficiently ablate senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. CAR T cells that target uPAR extend the survival of mice with lung adenocarcinoma that are treated with a senescence-inducing combination of drugs, and restore tissue homeostasis in mice in which liver fibrosis is induced chemically or by diet. These results establish the therapeutic potential of senolytic CAR T cells for senescence-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2983510028,"While soliton microcombs offer the potential for integration of powerful frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy systems, their operation requires complex startup and feedback protocols that necessitate difficult-to-integrate optical and electrical components. Moreover, CMOS-rate microcombs, required in nearly all comb systems, have resisted integration because of their power requirements. Here, a regime for turnkey operation of soliton microcombs co-integrated with a pump laser is demonstrated and theoretically explained. Significantly, a new operating point is shown to appear from which solitons are generated through binary turn-on and turn-off of the pump laser, thereby eliminating all photonic/electronic control circuitry. These features are combined with high-Q $Si_3N_4$ resonators to fully integrate into a butterfly package microcombs with CMOS frequencies as low as 15 GHz, offering compelling advantages for high-volume production."
https://openalex.org/W3036012425,"The gut microbiota synthesize hundreds of molecules, many of which influence host physiology. Among the most abundant metabolites are the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which accumulate at concentrations of around 500 μM and are known to block the growth of Clostridium difficile1, promote hepatocellular carcinoma2 and modulate host metabolism via the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (ref. 3). More broadly, DCA, LCA and their derivatives are major components of the recirculating pool of bile acids4; the size and composition of this pool are a target of therapies for primary biliary cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonetheless, despite the clear impact of DCA and LCA on host physiology, an incomplete knowledge of their biosynthetic genes and a lack of genetic tools to enable modification of their native microbial producers limit our ability to modulate secondary bile acid levels in the host. Here we complete the pathway to DCA and LCA by assigning and characterizing enzymes for each of the steps in its reductive arm, revealing a strategy in which the A-B rings of the steroid core are transiently converted into an electron acceptor for two reductive steps carried out by Fe-S flavoenzymes. Using anaerobic in vitro reconstitution, we establish that a set of six enzymes is necessary and sufficient for the eight-step conversion of cholic acid to DCA. We then engineer the pathway into Clostridium sporogenes, conferring production of DCA and LCA on a nonproducing commensal and demonstrating that a microbiome-derived pathway can be expressed and controlled heterologously. These data establish a complete pathway to two central components of the bile acid pool."
https://openalex.org/W3035794825,"The β1-adrenoceptor (β1AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples1 to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs. G-protein-mediated signalling is terminated by phosphorylation of the C terminus of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and by coupling of β-arrestin 1 (βarr1, also known as arrestin 2), which displaces Gs and induces signalling through the MAP kinase pathway2. The ability of synthetic agonists to induce signalling preferentially through either G proteins or arrestins-known as biased agonism3-is important in drug development, because the therapeutic effect may arise from only one signalling cascade, whereas the other pathway may mediate undesirable side effects4. To understand the molecular basis for arrestin coupling, here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the β1AR-βarr1 complex in lipid nanodiscs bound to the biased agonist formoterol5, and the crystal structure of formoterol-bound β1AR coupled to the G-protein-mimetic nanobody6 Nb80. βarr1 couples to β1AR in a manner distinct to that7 of Gs coupling to β2AR-the finger loop of βarr1 occupies a narrower cleft on the intracellular surface, and is closer to transmembrane helix H7 of the receptor when compared with the C-terminal α5 helix of Gs. The conformation of the finger loop in βarr1 is different from that adopted by the finger loop of visual arrestin when it couples to rhodopsin8. β1AR coupled to βarr1 shows considerable differences in structure compared with β1AR coupled to Nb80, including an inward movement of extracellular loop 3 and the cytoplasmic ends of H5 and H6. We observe weakened interactions between formoterol and two serine residues in H5 at the orthosteric binding site of β1AR, and find that formoterol has a lower affinity for the β1AR-βarr1 complex than for the β1AR-Gs complex. The structural differences between these complexes of β1AR provide a foundation for the design of small molecules that could bias signalling in the β-adrenoceptors."
https://openalex.org/W3035914962,"Animals coexist in commensal, pathogenic or mutualistic relationships with complex communities of diverse organisms, including microorganisms1. Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters that have previously been proposed to modulate nervous system activity and behaviours of their hosts2,3. However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain signalling and its physiological relevance are largely unknown. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the neuromodulator tyramine produced by commensal Providencia bacteria, which colonize the gut, bypasses the requirement for host tyramine biosynthesis and manipulates a host sensory decision. Bacterially produced tyramine is probably converted to octopamine by the host tyramine β-hydroxylase enzyme. Octopamine, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 octopamine receptor on ASH nociceptive neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify the genes that are required for tyramine biosynthesis in Providencia, and show that these genes are necessary for the modulation of host behaviour. We further find that C. elegans colonized by Providencia preferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially produced tyramine and host octopamine signalling. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut bacteria mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, and thereby promotes fitness of both the host and the microorganism."
https://openalex.org/W3022360544,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus with a ten-kilobase single-stranded RNA genome. HIV-1 must express all of its gene products from a single primary transcript, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce diverse protein products that include structural proteins and regulatory factors1,2. Despite the critical role of alternative splicing, the mechanisms that drive the choice of splice site are poorly understood. Synonymous RNA mutations that lead to severe defects in splicing and viral replication indicate the presence of unknown cis-regulatory elements3. Here we use dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) to investigate the structure of HIV-1 RNA in cells, and develop an algorithm that we name 'detection of RNA folding ensembles using expectation-maximization' (DREEM), which reveals the alternative conformations that are assumed by the same RNA sequence. Contrary to previous models that have analysed population averages4, our results reveal heterogeneous regions of RNA structure across the entire HIV-1 genome. In addition to confirming that in vitro characterized5 alternative structures for the HIV-1 Rev responsive element also exist in cells, we discover alternative conformations at critical splice sites that influence the ratio of transcript isoforms. Our simultaneous measurement of splicing and intracellular RNA structure provides evidence for the long-standing hypothesis6-8 that heterogeneity in RNA conformation regulates splice-site use and viral gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W3036443046,"Metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAB) are involved in the modulation of synaptic responses in the central nervous system and have been implicated in neuropsychological conditions that range from addiction to psychosis1. GABAB belongs to class C of the G-protein-coupled receptors, and its functional entity comprises an obligate heterodimer that is composed of the GB1 and GB2 subunits2. Each subunit possesses an extracellular Venus flytrap domain, which is connected to a canonical seven-transmembrane domain. Here we present four cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human full-length GB1–GB2 heterodimer: one structure of its inactive apo state, two intermediate agonist-bound forms and an active form in which the heterodimer is bound to an agonist and a positive allosteric modulator. The structures reveal substantial differences, which shed light on the complex motions that underlie the unique activation mechanism of GABAB. Our results show that agonist binding leads to the closure of the Venus flytrap domain of GB1, triggering a series of transitions, first rearranging and bringing the two transmembrane domains into close contact along transmembrane helix 6 and ultimately inducing conformational rearrangements in the GB2 transmembrane domain via a lever-like mechanism to initiate downstream signalling. This active state is stabilized by a positive allosteric modulator binding at the transmembrane dimerization interface. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of apo, agonist- and positive allosteric modulator-bound forms of the GB1–GB2 heterodimer of the metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor shed light on the activation mechanism of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3036802325,"Semiconductor ring lasers are miniaturized devices that operate on clockwise and counterclockwise modes. These modes are not coupled in the absence of intracavity reflectors, which prevents the formation of a standing wave in the cavity and, consequently, of a population inversion grating. This should inhibit the onset of multimode emission driven by spatial hole burning. Here we show that, despite this notion, ring quantum cascade lasers inherently operate in phase-locked multimode states, that switch on and off as the pumping level is progressively increased. By rewriting the master equation of lasers with fast gain media in the form of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we show that ring frequency combs stem from a phase instability---a phenomenon also known in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates. The instability is due to coupling of the amplitude and phase modulation of the optical field in a semiconductor laser, which plays the role of a Kerr nonlinearity, highlighting a connection between laser and microresonator frequency combs."

https://openalex.org/W3035842044,"Abstract Many corals harbour symbiotic dinoflagellate algae. The algae live inside coral cells in a specialized membrane compartment known as the symbiosome, which shares the photosynthetically fixed carbon with coral host cells while host cells provide inorganic carbon to the algae for photosynthesis 1 . This endosymbiosis—which is critical for the maintenance of coral reef ecosystems—is increasingly threatened by environmental stressors that lead to coral bleaching (that is, the disruption of endosymbiosis), which in turn leads to coral death and the degradation of marine ecosystems 2 . The molecular pathways that orchestrate the recognition, uptake and maintenance of algae in coral cells remain poorly understood. Here we report the chromosome-level genome assembly of a Xenia species of fast-growing soft coral 3 , and use this species as a model to investigate coral–alga endosymbiosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 16 cell clusters, including gastrodermal cells and cnidocytes, in Xenia sp. We identified the endosymbiotic cell type, which expresses a distinct set of genes that are implicated in the recognition, phagocytosis and/or endocytosis, and maintenance of algae, as well as in the immune modulation of host coral cells. By coupling Xenia sp. regeneration and single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed a dynamic lineage progression of the endosymbiotic cells. The conserved genes associated with endosymbiosis that are reported here may help to reveal common principles by which different corals take up or lose their endosymbionts."

https://openalex.org/W3035906360,"Plants respond to changes in ultraviolet (UV) radiation both morphologically and physiologically. Among the variety of plant UV-responses, the synthesis of UV-absorbing flavonoids constitutes an effective non-enzymatic mechanism to mitigate photoinhibitory and photooxidative damage caused by UV stress, either reducing the penetration of incident UV radiation or acting as quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we designed a UV-exclusion experiment to investigate the effects of UV radiation in Silene littorea. We spectrophotometrically quantified concentrations of both anthocyanins and UV-absorbing phenolic compounds in petals, calyces, leaves and stems. Furthermore, we analyzed the UV effect on the photosynthetic activity in hours of maximum solar radiation and we tested the impact of UV radiation on male and female reproductive performance. We found that anthocyanin concentrations showed a significant decrease of about 20% with UV-exclusion in petals and stems, and a 30% decrease in calyces. The concentrations of UV-absorbing compounds under UV-exclusion decreased by approximately 25% in calyces and stems, and 12% in leaves. Photochemical efficiency of plants grown under UV decreased at maximum light stress, reaching an inhibition of 58% of photosynthetic activity, but their ability to recover after light-stress was not affected. In addition, exposure to UV radiation did not affect ovule production or seed set per flower, but decreased pollen production and total seed production per plant by 31% and 69%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that UV exposure produced opposing effects on the accumulation of plant phenolic compounds and reproduction. UV radiation increased the concentration of phenolic compounds, suggesting a photoprotective role of plant phenolics against UV light, yet overall reproduction was compromised."
https://openalex.org/W3036384837,"Coordinated skills such as speech or dance involve sequences of actions that follow syntactic rules in which transitions between elements depend on the identities and order of past actions. Canary songs consist of repeated syllables called phrases, and the ordering of these phrases follows long-range rules1 in which the choice of what to sing depends on the song structure many seconds prior. The neural substrates that support these long-range correlations are unknown. Here, using miniature head-mounted microscopes and cell-type-specific genetic tools, we observed neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC2-4 as canaries explored various phrase sequences in their repertoire. We identified neurons that encode past transitions, extending over four phrases and spanning up to four seconds and forty syllables. These neurons preferentially encode past actions rather than future actions, can reflect more than one song history, and are active mostly during the rare phrases that involve history-dependent transitions in song. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of HVC include 'hidden states' that are not reflected in ongoing behaviour but rather carry information about prior actions. These states provide a possible substrate for the control of syntax transitions governed by long-range rules."

https://openalex.org/W3036093017,"The Asian mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), is an invasive mosquito which has become one of the most important vectors of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses worldwide. This species was reported for the first time in Cameroon in early 2000s and became the dominant Aedes species in the urban areas in the southern part of Cameroon but remain poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the susceptibility profile of A. albopictus collected throughout Cameroon and investigated the potential resistance mechanisms involved. Immature stages of A. albopictus were collected between March and July 2017 in 15 locations across Cameroon and reared until G1/G2 generation. Larval, adult bioassays, and synergists [piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM)] assays were carried out according to WHO recommendations. F1534C mutation was genotyped in field collected adults (Go) using allele specific PCR. All tested populations were susceptible to both larvicides, temephos and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), after larval bioassays. Adult bioassays revealed a high level of resistance of A. albopictus to 4% DDT with mortality rates ranging from 12.42% in Bafang to 75.04% in Kumba. The resistance was reported also in 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.25% permethrin, and 0.1% propoxur in some locations. A loss of susceptibility to 0.1% bendiocarb was found in one of three populations analysed. A full susceptibility to 1% fenitrothion were observed across the country. A full recovery or partial of susceptibility was observed in A. albopictus when pre-exposed to PBO or DEM and then to DDT and permethrin, respectively. The F1534C kdr mutation was not detected in A. albopictus. This study showed that the susceptibility profile of A. albopictus to insecticide vary according to the sampling location and insecticides used. These findings are useful to planning vector control program against arbovirus vectors in Cameroon and can be used as baseline data for further researches."
https://openalex.org/W3035860153,"Immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) by mosquito bite provides >90% sterile protection against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in humans. RAS invade hepatocytes but do not replicate. CD8+ T cells recognizing parasite-derived peptides on the surface of infected hepatocytes are likely the primary protective mechanism. We conducted a randomized clinical trial of RAS immunization to assess safety, to achieve 50% vaccine efficacy (VE) against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), and to generate reagents from protected and non-protected subjects for future identification of protective immune mechanisms and antigens.Two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) of healthy, malaria-naïve, non-pregnant adults age 18-50 received five monthly immunizations with infected (true-immunized, n = 21) or non-infected (mock-immunized, n = 5) mosquito bites and underwent homologous CHMI at 3 weeks. Immunization parameters were selected for 50% protection based on prior clinical data. Leukapheresis was done to collect plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Adverse event rates were similar in true- and mock-immunized subjects. Two true- and two mock-immunized subjects developed large local reactions likely caused by mosquito salivary gland antigens. In Cohort 1, 11 subjects received 810-1235 infected bites; 6/11 (55%) were protected against CHMI vs. 0/3 mock-immunized and 0/6 infectivity controls (VE 55%). In Cohort 2, 10 subjects received 839-1131 infected bites with a higher first dose and a reduced fifth dose; 9/10 (90%) were protected vs. 0/2 mock-immunized and 0/6 controls (VE 90%). Three/3 (100%) protected subjects administered three booster immunizations were protected against repeat CHMI vs. 0/6 controls (VE 100%). Cohort 2 uniquely showed a significant rise in IFN-γ responses after the third and fifth immunizations and higher antibody responses to CSP.PfRAS were generally safe and well tolerated. Cohort 2 had a higher first dose, reduced final dose, higher antibody responses to CSP and significant rise of IFN-γ responses after the third and fifth immunizations. Whether any of these factors contributed to increased protection in Cohort 2 requires further investigation. A cryobank of sera and cells from protected and non-protected individuals was generated for future immunological studies and antigen discovery.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01994525."

https://openalex.org/W3036143655,"The fossil record provides an invaluable insight into the temporal origins of extant lineages of organisms. However, establishing the relationships between fossils and extant lineages can be difficult in groups with low rates of morphological change over time. Molecular dating can potentially circumvent this issue by allowing distant fossils to act as calibration points, but rate variation across large evolutionary scales can bias such analyses. In this study, we apply multiple dating methods to genome-wide datasets to infer the origin of extant species of Isoetes, a group of mostly aquatic and semi-aquatic isoetalean lycopsids, which closely resemble fossil forms dating back to the Triassic. Rate variation observed in chloroplast genomes hampers accurate dating, but genome-wide nuclear markers place the origin of extant diversity within this group in the mid-Paleogene, 45–60 million years ago. Our genomic analyses coupled with a careful evaluation of the fossil record indicate that despite resembling forms from the Triassic, extant Isoetes species do not represent the remnants of an ancient and widespread group, but instead have spread around the globe in the relatively recent past."

https://openalex.org/W3036121585,"Mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53 are rare in renal cell carcinomas. p53 is a key factor for inducing antiangiogenic genes and RCC are highly vascularized, which suggests that p53 is inactive in these tumors. One regulator of p53 is the Mdm2 oncogene, which is correlated with high-grade, metastatic tumors. However, the sole activity of Mdm2 is not just to regulate p53, but it can also function independent of p53 to regulate the early stages of metastasis. Here, we report that the oncoprotein Mdm2 can bind directly to the tumor suppressor VHL, and conjugate nedd8 to VHL within a region that is important for the p53-VHL interaction. Nedd8 conjugated VHL is unable to bind to p53 thereby preventing the induction of antiangiogenic factors. These results highlight a previously unknown oncogenic function of Mdm2 during the progression of cancer to promote angiogenesis through the regulation of VHL. Thus, the Mdm2-VHL interaction represents a pathway that impacts tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3036533630,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with future cardiovascular morbidity and recognized as a women-specific risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms for this association are not well established. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular-related biomarkers, galectin-3 (Gal-3) and protein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK) type 9, in women with GDM. Methods Blood samples were drawn in the third trimester from 31 women diagnosed with GDM and from 35 women with normal pregnancies. Blood levels of Gal-3 and PCSK-9 were measured using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In addition, we measured Gal-3 levels in 24 pregnant women in the first trimester who later developed GDM and in 36 healthy controls. Continuous variables were compared using student’s t-test and categorical variables by chi-square/fisher's exact tests. Results We found increased levels of Gal-3 in women diagnosed with GDM compared to women without GDM (124.6±32% versus control; pv = 0.001). Furthermore, we demonstrated elevated levels of Gal-3 during the first trimester among women who later developed GDM compared with women who did not develop any gestational morbidity (125.7±32% versus control; pv = 0.004). Third-trimester levels of PCSK-9 did not differ between women with and without GDM (560±45ng/mL versus 553±33ng/mL; pv = 0.4). Conclusions The results suggest a possible mechanism that may link GDM to the future increased cardiovascular risk in these patients. Additionally, increased Gal-3 levels during the first trimester may suggest a new early predictor for GDM."
https://openalex.org/W3036177561,"Minimizing the effort to propel a manual wheelchair is important to all users in order to optimize the efficiency of maneuvering throughout the day. Assessing the propulsion cost of wheelchairs as a mechanical system is a key aspect of understanding the influences of wheelchair design and configuration. The objective of this study was to model the relationships between inertial and energy-loss parameters to the mechanical propulsion cost across different wheelchair configurations during straight and curvilinear trajectories. Inertial parameters of an occupied wheelchair and energy loss parameters of drive wheels and casters were entered into regression models representing three different maneuvers. A wheelchair-propelling robot was used to measure propulsion cost. General linear models showed strong relationships (R2 > 0.84) between the system-level costs of propulsion and the selected predictor variables representing sources of energy loss and inertial influences. System energy loss parameters were significant predictors in all three maneuvers. Yaw inertia was also a significant predictor during zero-radius turns. The results indicate that simple energy loss measurements can predict system-level performance, and inertial influences are mostly overshadowed by the increased resistive losses caused by added mass, though weight distribution can mitigate some of this added cost."
https://openalex.org/W3035861421,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a commonly used substance among youths, particularly those who are living in poor economic conditions with low levels of education and who have had bad childhood experiences. The Akha and Lahu hill tribe youths living on the Thailand-Myanmar-Laos border are identified as the group most vulnerable to MA use in Thailand. The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MA use and determine its associations with childhood experiences among Akha and Lahu youths aged 15-24 years in northern Thailand.A cross-sectional study was performed. Validated and sealed questionnaires were used to gather information from participants after obtaining the informed consent form. Questionnaires were completed by participants and their parents at home. Logistic regression was used to identify the associations between variables at the α = 0.05 level.A total of 710 participants participated in the study: 54.2% were Akha, 52.5% were females, 50.6% were aged 15-17 years, and 11.4% did not have Thai identification card (ID) cards. The overall prevalence of MA use at least once among Akha and Lahu youths was 14.5%. After controlling for all potential confounding factors, 8 variables were found to be associated with MA use. Males had a greater chance of MA use than females (AOR = 4.75; 95% CI = 2.27-9.95). Participants aged 21-24 years had a greater chance of MA use than those aged 15-17 years (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.11-5.71). Those who had a family member who used MA had a greater chance of MA use than those who did not (AOR = 5.04; 95% CI = 1.66-15.32). Those who had been physically assaulted by a family member while aged 0-5 years had a greater chance of MA use than those who had not (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.02-5.12). Those who had been physically assaulted by a family member while aged 6-14 years had a greater chance of MA use than those who had not (AOR = 3.15; 95% CI = 1.32-7.54). Those who had a close friend who used alcohol had a greater chance of MA use than those who did not (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI = 1.24-4.72). Those who had a highly confident personality had a greater chance of MA use than those who did not (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.17-4.69), and those who smoked had a greater chance of MA use than those who did not (AOR = 8.27; 95% CI = 4.42-15.46).All relevant government and nongovernment agencies together with the Ministry of Public Health Thailand should address MA use among Akha and Lahu youths by properly developing a community health intervention that lowers risk of MA use by addressing family relationships, male youth behaviors, and focused on those individuals with a highly confident personality."
https://openalex.org/W3036042197,"Meloidogyne partityla is the dominant root-knot nematode (RKN) species parasitizing pecan in Georgia. This species is known to cause a reduction in root growth and a decline in the yields of mature pecan trees. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of this RKN is required to control this nematode disease and reduce losses in pecan production. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed for simple, rapid, and on-site detection of M. partityla in infested plant roots and validated to detect the nematode in laboratory and field conditions. Specific primers were designed based on the sequence distinction of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-18S/5.8S ribosomal RNA gene between M. partityla and other Meloidogyne spp. The LAMP detection technique could detect the presence of M. partityla genomic DNA at a concentration as low as 1 pg, and no cross reactivity was found with DNA from other major RKN species such as M. javanica, M. incognita and M. arenaria, and M. hapla. We also conducted a traditional morphology-based diagnostic assay and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine which of these techniques was less time consuming, more sensitive, and convenient to use in the field. The LAMP assay provided more rapid results, amplifying the target nematode species in less than 60 min at 70°C, with results 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (~2-3 hrs). Morphology-based, traditional diagnosis was highly time-consuming (2 days) and more laborious than conventional PCR and LAMP assays. These features greatly simplified the operating procedure and made the assay a powerful tool for rapid, on-site detection of pecan RKN, M. partityla. The developed LAMP assay will facilitate accurate pecan nematode diagnosis in the field and contribute to the management of the pathogen."

Data were obtained from the Finnish School-age Physical Activity (FSPA) study 2016 from 4677 national representative 11-, 13-, and 15-year-old children and adolescents. MVPA and individual- and environmental-related factors were assessed by a questionnaire and analyzed by two-level logistic regression. Seventeen of the twenty-one variables were statistically significantly associated with MVPA. However, only three variables were statistically significant in all MVPA subgroups, whereby self-directed PA at least twice a week, fewer perceived barriers, and higher peer support increased the odds of participating in more MVPA. The results from this study showed essential differences among the MVPA subgroups, also supporting previous findings, whereby various individual- and environmental-based factors are associated with children and adolescents’ levels of MVPA. Challenges to designing and implementing effective interventions are based on the need to account for individual differences within the population, as well as the varied connections between PA with different social and physical environments where children and adolescents’ PA takes place. PA interventions with various actions at multiple levels are warranted."

Thus, the presented project evaluated of influence of the selective antagonist of A2A adenosine receptor—KD-64 as compared to the known non-selective antagonist—caffeine on these two particular processes. Two different inflammation models were induced namely local and systemic inflammation. Obesity was induced in mice by high-fat diet and the tested compounds (KD-64 and caffeine) were administrated for 21 days. KD-64 showed anti-inflammatory effect in both tested inflammation models and administered at the same dose as ketoprofen exerted stronger effect than this reference compound. Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α observed in obese control mice were significantly lowered by the administration of KD-64 and were similar to the values observed in control non-obese mice. Interestingly, caffeine increased the levels of these parameters. In contrast to caffeine which had no influence on AlaT activity, KD-64 administration significantly lowered AlaT activity in the obese mice. Although, contrary to caffeine, KD-64 did not reduce diet-induced obesity in mice, it improved glucose tolerance. Thus, the activity of the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist was quite different from that of the non-selective."
https://openalex.org/W3036331801,"Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with an increased risk of tobacco smoking, and more difficulties with smoking cessation compared to non-ADHD individuals. Women with ADHD may therefore show elevated rates of smoking during pregnancy. Aims To examine the association between ADHD and smoking habits among pregnant women in Sweden and Norway. Methods Women pregnant for the first time were identified in Sweden (n = 622,037), and Norway (n = 293,383), of which 1.2% (n = 7,444), and 1.7% (n = 4,951) were defined as having ADHD, respectively. Data on smoking habits were collected early and late in pregnancy. Results In Sweden, ADHD was associated with an increased risk of smoking early in pregnancy, adjusted risk ratio (adjRR) 2.69 (95% confidence interval, 2.58–2.81), and late in pregnancy, adjRR 2.95 (2.80–3.10). Similar findings were observed in the Norwegian data, early in pregnancy, adjRR 2.31 (2.21–2.40), and late in pregnancy, adjRR 2.56 (2.42–2.70). Women with ADHD were more likely to continue smoking during pregnancy, compared to women without ADHD, both in Sweden adjRR 1.13 (1.10–1.17), and in Norway, adjRR 1.16 (1.12–1.20). Having a sibling diagnosed with ADHD was associated with an increased risk of smoking early and late in pregnancy, in both Sweden and Norway. Conclusions Women with ADHD are considerably more likely to smoke early and late in (their first) pregnancy and are less likely to stop smoking between the two time points. Smoking, early and late in pregnancy, co-aggregates in families with ADHD. Smoking prevention and intervention programs should be targeted towards women with ADHD, specifically during their childbearing years, to ensure better mother and child outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3036535491,"Early-onset depression is associated with increased lifespan chronicity, suicidality, and the functional burdens associated with recurrent episodes. Reduction of these negative long-term outcomes requires an understanding of what interventions reduce vulnerabilities or ameliorate their associated neural patterns. Rumination-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (RFCBT), an evidence-based treatment which directly targets a well-known risk for depressive relapse (i.e., ruminative habit), has shown preliminary success for reducing relapse rates among adolescents and adults in remission from Major Depressive Disorder (rMDD). In the current pilot study, clinical outcomes and neuroimaging predictors are explored over two years following a randomized controlled trial of eight weeks of RFCBT (n = 17) or Assessment Only (AO; n = 16) to prevent depressive relapse among adolescents. Baseline neural activation during a rumination induction task, neural change during treatment, and treatment group are examined as predictors of relapse. Regions selected were based upon hyperactivation patterns in rMDD compared to healthy adolescents, and occurred largely in default mode, somatomotor, visual and salience network regions. Twenty-five adolescents successfully completed quality fMRI scans at Baseline and after eight weeks of RFCBT or AO. RFCBT-treated youth maintained lower depression scores over the two-year period, relapsed at slower and less frequent rates, and were hospitalized less often for suicidality than AO. Although both groups reported lower ruminative tendencies after one year, at two-year follow-up, RFCBT maintained reductions whereas AO reported a return of ruminative tendencies. Adolescents who demonstrated higher activation at Baseline in default mode and limbic regions during rumination induction reported reduced depressive symptoms over the follow-up period. These data offer preliminary evidence that targeting rumination can stave off depressive relapse among vulnerable adolescents, and that such targeted treatment may aid a compensation process for disease-related brain functioning reducing risk to further depressive episodes.

Irr acts by binding to target genes, including the iron control element (ICE), and is degraded in response to heme binding. Here, we examined this binding activity using fluorescence anisotropy with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled ICE-like oligomer (FAM-ICE). In the presence of Mn2+, Irr addition increased the fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to formation of the Irr–ICE complex. The addition of EDTA to the Irr–ICE complex reduced fluorescence anisotropy, but fluorescence was recovered after Mn2+ addition, indicating that Mn2+ binding is a prerequisite for complex formation.

We observed that the His-cluster region is also the heme binding site; results from fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses disclosed that the addition of a half-equivalent of heme dissociates Irr from ICE, likely because of Mn2+ release due to heme binding. We hypothesized that heme binding to another heme binding site, Cys-29, would also inhibit the formation of the Irr–ICE complex because it is proximal to the ICE binding site, which was supported by the loss of ICE binding activity in a Cys-29–mutated Irr.

Iron is a necessary micronutrient for all organisms, as it plays a key role in cellular functions, acting as a chemical catalyst in addition to influencing electron transport, oxygen transport, and mitochondrial energy generation (1Aisen P. Enns C. Wessling-Resnick M. Chemistry and biology of eukaryotic iron metabolism.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33 (11470229): 940-95910.1016/S1357-2725(01)00063-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, excessive intracellular iron is cytotoxic; this is because of its ability to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause damage to cellular components. Because of this, iron homeostasis is strictly regulated, and iron acquisition, storage, and consumption are balanced to maintain a constant cellular iron level (2Wang J. Pantopoulos K. Regulation of cellular iron metabolism.Biochem. J. 2011; 434 (21348856): 365-38110.1042/BJ20101825Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Defects in this regulation lead to severe diseases, such as anemia, pica, liver cirrhosis, and neurological deficits. Despite its biological importance, the molecular control mechanisms of iron homeostasis are still undiscovered, and functional characterization of the essential regulatory proteins is also still quite limited. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of cellular iron homeostasis, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that exists as an endosymbiont in root nodule of plants, is used as the typical model system. In this species of bacteria, various types of iron-containing proteins or heme, which is an iron-protoporphyrin IX complex, are used to support nitrogen fixation. The nitrogenase complex, which comprises more than 10% of cellular proteins in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as some cyanobacteria and azotobacteraceae, includes 30–34 iron ions per molecule (3Eady R.R.

B. japonicum is known to possess a global regulator protein, known as the iron response regulator (Irr), which regulates iron homeostasis and associated metabolic processes (4Rudolph G. Semini G.

When cells are grown under iron-limiting conditions, Irr functions as a transcriptional repressor of the hemB gene, which encodes one of the heme biosynthetic enzymes, δ-aminoleuvulinic acid dehydratase; this prevents accumulation of a cytotoxic heme precursor, protoporphyrin IX. Under iron-replete conditions, Irr is thought to degrade, allowing hemB transcription to resume and promoting heme biosynthesis (7Kobayashi K. Nakagaki M. Ishikawa H. Iwai K. O'Brian M.R. Ishimori K.

Using a yeast one-hybrid system, the in vivo interaction of Irr with the iron control element (ICE), which is an incomplete inversed repeat cis-performing AT-rich DNA region, has been reported (10Botello-Morte L.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190 (18539736): 5172-517710.1128/JB.00495-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By occupying the promoter-binding site in iron-limited cells, Irr represses gene transcription (12Sangwan I. Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum Irr protein is a transcriptional repressor with high-affinity DNA-binding activity.J.

The mRNA transcripts of Irr-regulated genes as well as the promoter occupancy by Irr were only seen under iron-depleted conditions, indicating that the interactions between Irr and the ICE-like motif depend on the iron status of the cells. Interestingly, interactions between Irr and the ICE-like motif are also dependent on manganese (Mn2+) (12Sangwan I. Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum Irr protein is a transcriptional repressor with high-affinity DNA-binding activity.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 (18539736): 5172-517710.1128/JB.00495-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In media supplemented with Mn2+, genes including ICE-like motifs were strongly regulated by iron, whereas this iron-dependent regulation was lost under low-manganese conditions. Thus, Mn2+ contributes to the expression of genes including ICE-like motifs, suggesting that the binding of Irr to the ICE-like motifs requires Mn2+ binding to Irr. Despite this evidence, Mn2+ binding to purified Irr protein has not yet been confirmed. To detect the iron status of the intracellular environment, Irr has been found to utilize heme as a regulatory molecule (8Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Heme is an effector molecule for iron-dependent degradation of the bacterial iron response regulator (Irr) protein.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1999; 96 (10557272): 13056-1306110.1073/pnas.96.23.13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Irr degrades in iron-replete cells, restarting transcription of the genes it was repressing; this degradation is thought to be induced by the direct binding of heme. Irr has two heme binding sites, the first of which is Cys29 in the heme-regulatory motif (HRM), which contains a short consensus sequence composed of Cys and Pro and is found in many heme-regulated proteins, such as heme-regulated inhibitor kinases (13Chen J.-J. Londo I.M. Regulation of protein synthesis by heme-regulated eIF-2a kinase.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-10810.1016/S0968-0004(00)88975-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), heme activator proteins (14Zhang L. Guarente L. Heme binds to a short sequence that serves a regulatory function in diverse proteins.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7835342): 313-32010.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb07005.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and circadian factors (15Yang J. Kim K.D. Lucas A. Drahos K.E. Santos C.S. Mury S.P. Capelluto D.G. Finkielstein C.V. A novel heme-regulatory motif mediates heme-dependent degradation of the circadian factor period 2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28 (18505821): 4697-471110.1128/MCB.00236-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The other heme binding site is in the His-cluster region far from the HRM region. Heme binding to these sites in Irr induces the oxidative modification of the protein moiety, leading to Irr degradation (9Yang J. Ishimori K. O'Brian M.R. Two heme binding sites are involved in the regulated degradation of the bacterial iron response regulator (Irr) protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (15613477): 7671-767610.1074/jbc.M411664200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It should be noted here that heme binding to Irr and the successive oxidative modification are inhibited in the presence of Mn2+, and that the addition of Mn2+ to heme-bound Irr releases the heme from the protein (16Puri S. Hohle T.H. O'Brian M.R. Control of bacterial iron homeostasis by manganese.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2010; 107 (20498065): 10691-1069510.1073/pnas.1002342107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In a heme-deficient mutant strain, ΔhemAH, the addition of Mn2+ suppressed the degradation of Irr under the moderated heme concentrations (200 nm); however, cells grown under conditions with large excesses of heme (5 mm) did not accumulate Irr in the presence of Mn2+, suggesting that the effectiveness of Mn2+ on preventing Irr degradation depends on the heme concentration (16Puri S. Hohle T.H. O'Brian M.R. Control of bacterial iron homeostasis by manganese.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2010; 107 (20498065): 10691-1069510.1073/pnas.1002342107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mn2+ is likely a competitive inhibitor of heme binding to the Irr protein; however, the binding site of Mn2+ in Irr has not yet been determined. In this paper, we confirmed that the binding of Mn2+ is essential for Irr to bind to the ICE-like motif, using purified proteins and a fluorophore-labeled ICE-like oligomer DNA. The Mn2+ binding site was found to be in the His-cluster region of Irr, which overlaps one of the heme binding sites in Irr. Heme binding to Irr likely induces the release of Mn2+ from the binding site in the His-cluster region, dissociating Irr from the ICE-like motif. In addition, the conformational changes associated with heme binding to another heme binding site, Cys29 in the HRM region located near the ICE binding site, also inhibit binding to ICE. Although heme bound to Irr would trigger oxidative modification of the protein, which has been thought to be essential for the dissociation of Irr from the ICE-like motif, the heme-induced oxidative modification would be initiated after the dissociation of Irr from the target gene to protect the target gene from the ROS produced by heme-bound Irr. Because of this, the oxidative modification and protein degradation would inhibit the rebinding of Irr to the target gene and/or the formation of cytotoxic free heme. Previous studies have reported that the promoter occupancy for genes including ICE-like motifs was suppressed under Mn2+-limited conditions, suggesting that Mn2+ binding is essential for the binding of ICE to Irr (16Puri S. Hohle T.H. O'Brian M.R. Control of bacterial iron homeostasis by manganese.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2010; 107 (20498065): 10691-1069510.1073/pnas.1002342107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To confirm this, a 6-carboxyfluorescein-modified DNA oligomer (FAM-ICE) was prepared as a model for the ICE-like motif, and the formation of the complex between Irr and FAM-ICE was monitored using fluorescence anisotropy. In the presence of Mn2+, fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-ICE was increased by the addition of Irr, corresponding to complex formation (Fig. 1, green). In the absence of Mn2+, this increase was much smaller than that in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1, orange), indicating that binding of the ICE-like motif to Mn2+-free Irr was nonspecific and Mn2+ is essential for Irr to bind to the ICE-like motif. The Mn2+-mediated binding of Irr to ICE was also confirmed by the addition of a metal chelator, EDTA, to the Irr-ICE complex. When EDTA was added to the Irr-ICE complex, fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-ICE was decreased (Fig. 2A), indicating that removal of Mn2+ led to dissociation of Irr from FAM-ICE. The inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) measurements confirmed the complete dissociation of Mn2+ from Irr after the EDTA treatment (Table 1). Supporting this, in the presence of FAM-ICE, the addition of Mn2+ to Mn2+-free Irr enhanced the fluorescence anisotropy, indicating that Mn2+ restored the binding ability of Irr (Fig. 2B). This type of essential role for metal binding in the binding activity to target DNA for transcriptional regulators is one of the characteristics of metal-responsive transcriptional regulators, including Fur. The apo (metal-free) state of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 Fur (MgFur) is unable to bind to the target DNA site; however, metal binding results in the restoration of this activity (17Deng Z.

However, the competition experiments required excess amounts of Mn2+-free Irr to that of the dye, and rather higher concentrations of Mn2+-free Irr (>10 μm) resulted in less accurate estimation of Kd(Mn2+), varying from the nm to µm range because of the structural instability of Irr under the high-concentration range.

The comparable Mn2+ affinity to the heme binding affinity of Irr was supported by the competitive binding between heme and Mn2+. As previously reported (16Puri S. Hohle T.H. O'Brian M.R.

The metal binding in Fur superfamily proteins also affects oligomerization status to regulate the binding affinity to target DNA (22D'Autréaux B. Pecqueur L. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Diederix R.E.M.

We examined the oligomerization status of Irr upon the binding of Mn2+ using size-exclusion column chromatography. Fig. 3A shows chromatograms for Irr in the absence and presence of Mn2+; a major peak appeared at 14.7 ml, corresponding to an estimated molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 3B). As the calculated molecular mass of monomeric Irr is 18 kDa, this result indicates that the Mn2+-bound and Mn2+-free Irr forms dimers. Irr, therefore, forms a stable dimeric state, which is similar to that seen in the group including EcFur (23Pecqueur L. D'Autreaux B. Dupuy J. Nicolet Y. Jacquamet L. Brutscher B. Michaud-Soret I.

In the chromatogram of Mn2+-free Irr, two additional peaks around 12.4 and 17.3 ml were observed, indicating the appearance of high- and low-molecular-mass species of Irr in the solution without Mn2+. In the presence of EDTA, Mn2+-free Irr was unstable and gradually formed precipitates under the concentrated conditions. The appearance of the high-molecular-mass species suggested the formation of oligomers by partially denatured Irr during gel chromatography. On the other hand, the reasons for the appearance of the low-molecular-mass species are unclear. Because the apparent molecular mass of the low-molecular-mass species was less than that of monomeric Irr, the interaction between partially denatured Irr and gels in column may retard the moving of the protein, resulting in the slow-moving species in the chromatogram. That the longer incubation with EDTA before applying the column enhanced the intensity of the low-molecular mass species also supports the gradual denaturation of Irr in the absence of Mn2+. A trough around 18 ml also would be because of perturbations of the column conditions induced by nonspecific interactions between partially denatured Irr and gels in the column. The Fur superfamily has two metal binding sites (25Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L.

Site 1 is found in the C-terminal dimerization domain, and site 2 is found in the histidine-rich hinge region, known as the His-cluster region, between the DNA binding and dimerization domains. To confirm the metal binding to purified Irr, we utilized ICP-OES, which showed that Irr incubated with 0.1 mm MnCl2 contained 1.82 ± 0.32 mol Mn/mol protein (Table 1). Other metals were present at less than 0.1 mol metal/mol protein. Although we found that Irr as isolated bound Zn2+, the binding affinity of Zn2+ to Irr was much lower than that of Mn2+, and incubation of purified Irr in a solution containing 0.1 mm MnCl2 completely replaced Zn2+ with Mn2+. The functional significance of the binding of Zn2+ in Irr as isolated is unclear, and considering that the expression level of Irr and the ICE binding depended only on Mn2+, not on Zn2+, in B. japonicum (16Puri S.

MgFur, one of the Fur proteins possessing two metal binding sites, similarly has two metal binding sites; site 1 is in the dimerization domain (green), and site 2 is in the histidine-rich hinge region (gray) near the DNA binding domain (blue) (Fig. 4). The amino acid residues His33, Glu81, His90, and Glu101, which constitute the histidine-rich hinge region in MgFur, are conserved in Irr (17Deng Z. Wang Q. Liu Z. Zhang M. Machado A.C. Chiu T.P.

Although the metal binding sites in Irr have not yet been identified, the consensus amino acid sequence for site 2 in BsPerR is completely conserved in this protein, suggesting that Mn2+ binds to site 2 in a similar manner in Irr. To confirm Mn2+ binding to site 2 in Irr, we mutated amino acid residues constituting this site (H63A and H117-119A). These His-cluster mutants were quite unstable at higher concentrations (>10 μm), and, as illustrated in Fig. 3A, high- and low-molecular-weight species were detected in the gel chromatogram, as found for Mn2+-free Irr. Longer incubation of these mutants under high concentrations before applying the column resulted in aggregation and precipitation. In the His117-119A mutant, we detected substantial amounts of high-molecular-weight species, probably because of the aggregation of the partially denatured proteins. The destabilized structures of these mutants also suggest that the His-cluster region is the keystone for the protein structure of Irr. On the other hand, no aggregation or precipitat"

Skin irritation is one of the adverse events caused by opioid use. 344 methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients were recruited with records and measurements on methadone dose, plasma methadone concentrations, and treatment emergent symptom scales (TESS). 15 patients reported with skin irritation. Five SNPs located within the NECTIN4 genetic region were genotyped. The NECTIN4 gene within the adherens junction interaction pathway was associated with methadone dose in pathway-based genome wide association analyses (P = 0.0008). Three highly-linked SNPs, rs11265549, rs3820097, and rs4656978, were significantly associated with methadone dose (P = 0.0003), plasma concentrations of R,S-methadone (P = 0.0004) and TNF-α (P = 0.010) in all 344 MMT patients, and with self-report skin irritation symptom scores (P = 0.010) in the 15 MMT patients who reported with skin irritation. To identify the possible roles of plasma level of Nectin-4 in the responses to MMT and opioid use, additional age- and gender-matched 51 controls and 83 methadone-free abstinent former heroin users were recruited. Plasma level of Nectin-4 was the highest in MMT patients among the three groups. The results suggest involvement of genetic variants on NECTIN4 in methadone dose. Plasma Nectin-4 level is likely an indicator for continued use of opioids."

Over the 20th century, efforts to drain the Everglades for agriculture and development severely damaged the ecosystem so that today roughly 50% of the historic flow of water through the Everglades has been diverted elsewhere. In an attempt to restore the Everglades, the U.S. Congress authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in 2000, expected to cost over $16 billion and to take several decades to complete. We used the results from a stated preference choice experiment (SPCE) survey of Florida households to estimate the willingness to pay for several ecological attributes related to CERP performance indicators likely to be impacted by Everglades restoration. We also used a latent class model (LCM) to explore preference heterogeneity among respondents. On average, survey respondents were willing to pay for improvements in all of the attributes included in the survey, namely increased populations of wading birds, American alligators, endangered snail kites, and spotted seatrout, and reduced polluted discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers. Willingness to pay was highest for reduced polluted discharges from Lake Okeechobee."

We established a cell-free high-throughput screening assay to search for small molecule inhibitors of DNA binding by transcription factors. A screen was performed using p53 as a target, resulting in the identification of NSC194598 that inhibits p53 sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro (IC50 = 180 nM) and in vivo. NSC194598 selectively inhibited DNA binding by p53 and homologs p63/p73, but did not affect E2F1, TCF1, and c-Myc. Treatment of cells with NSC194598 alone paradoxically led to p53 accumulation and modest increase of transcriptional output owing to disruption of the MDM2-negative feedback loop. When p53 was stabilized and activated by irradiation or chemotherapy drug treatment, NSC194598 inhibited p53 DNA binding and induction of target genes. A single dose of NSC194598 increased the survival of mice after irradiation. The results suggest DNA binding by p53 can be targeted using small molecules to reduce acute toxicity to normal tissues by radiation and chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3035888906,"Fisheries and aquaculture industries worldwide remain reliant on seed supply from wild populations, with their success and sustainability dependent on consistent larval recruitment. Larval dispersal and recruitment in the marine environment are complex processes, influenced by a multitude of physical and biological factors. Biophysical modelling has increasingly been used to investigate dispersal and recruitment dynamics, for optimising management of fisheries and aquaculture resources. In the Fiji Islands, culture of the black-lip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera) is almost exclusively reliant on wild-caught juvenile oysters (spat), through a national spat collection programme. This study used a simple Lagrangian particle dispersal model to investigate current-driven larval dispersal patterns, identify potential larval settlement areas and compare simulated with physical spat-fall, to inform targeted spat collection efforts. Simulations successfully identified country-wide patterns of potential larval dispersal and settlement from 2012–2015, with east-west variations between bi-annual spawning peaks and circulation associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation. Localised regions of larval aggregation were also identified and compared to physical spat-fall recorded at 28 spat collector deployment locations. Significant and positive correlations at these sites across three separate spawning seasons (r(26) = 0.435; r(26) = 0.438; r(26) = 0.428 respectively, p = 0.02), suggest high utility of the model despite its simplicity, for informing future spat collector deployment. Simulation results will further optimise black-lip pearl oyster spat collection activity in Fiji by informing targeted collector deployments, while the model provides a versatile and highly informative toolset for the fishery management and aquaculture of other marine taxa with similar life histories."
https://openalex.org/W3036345150,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cancer development and progression, and some function in a highly cancer-specific manner. However, whether the cause of their expression is an outcome of a specific regulatory mechanism or nonspecific transcription induced by genome reorganization in cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated a group of lncRNAs that we previously identified to be aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer (PC), called TPCATs. Our high-throughput real-time PCR experiments were integrated with publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data and revealed that the expression of a subset of TPCATs is driven by PC-specific transcription factors (TFs), especially androgen receptor (AR) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Our in vitro validations confirmed that AR and ERG regulated a subset of TPCATs, most notably for EPCART. Knockout of EPCART was found to reduce migration and proliferation of the PC cells in vitro. The high expression of EPCART and two other TPCATs (TPCAT-3-174133 and TPCAT-18-31849) were also associated with the biochemical recurrence of PC in prostatectomy patients and were independent prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the expression of numerous PC-associated lncRNAs is driven by PC-specific mechanisms and not by random cellular events that occur during cancer development. Furthermore, we report three prospective prognostic markers for the early detection of advanced PC and show EPCART to be a functionally relevant lncRNA in PC."

To profile the landscape of microRNAs with significant cytotoxicity in the context of glioblastoma (GBM), we performed a high-throughput screen in adult and pediatric GBM cells using a synthetic oligonucleotide library representing all known human microRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was used to refine this list and the top seven microRNAs were validated in a larger panel of GBM cells using state-of-the-art in vitro assays. The cytotoxic effect of our most relevant candidate was assessed in a preclinical model. Our screen identified ~100 significantly cytotoxic microRNAs with 70% concordance between cell lines. MicroRNA-1300 (miR-1300) was the most potent and robust candidate. We observed a striking binucleated phenotype in miR-1300 transfected cells due to cytokinesis failure followed by apoptosis. This was also observed in two stem-like patient-derived cultures. We identified the physiological role of miR-1300 as a regulator of endomitosis in megakaryocyte differentiation where blockade of cytokinesis is an essential step. In GBM cells, where miR-1300 is normally not expressed, the oncogene Epithelial Cell Transforming 2 (ECT2) was validated as a direct key target. ECT2 siRNA phenocopied the effects of miR-1300, and ECT2 overexpression led to rescue of miR-1300 induced binucleation. We showed that ectopic expression of miR-1300 led to decreased tumor growth in an orthotopic GBM model. Our screen provides a resource for the neuro-oncology community and identified miR-1300 as a novel regulator of endomitosis with translatable potential for therapeutic application."

Data that could be used to guide the scale up of HIV prevention and control strategies has significant gaps. The study sought to estimate the prevalence of HIV and its associated determinants in Akwa Ibom state. Methods Akwa Ibom AIDS Indicator Survey (AKAIS) is a population based cross-sectional survey, with a two-stage probability sampling. The survey had both behavioural and biological components. Tablet-based questionnaire was used to collect data on participant’s household information, demographics, socio-economic, and behavioral risk factors associated with HIV; while the biological component involved collection of venous blood samples for participants who were over 19months. For children aged 18months on less, capillary blood from finger prick sample was used. Participants were tested for HIV. Other biomarker tests for HIV positive participants included CD4, HIV-1 RNA viral load and incidence assays. Results In all 15,609 people (8,963 adults aged 15 years and older (55% females), 6,646 individuals less than 15 years (51% males), from 4,313 households, participated in AKAIS. Overall, 2.8% (423 persons; 422 HIV-1 and 1 HIV-2) were found to be HIV positive. HIV prevalence was 4.8% in adults (15 years and above) and 0.4% in pediatric (< = 14 years) participants. HIV prevalence was significantly higher in females (5.6%) than males (3.7%) aged 15 years and older (p <0.001). Overall HIV incidence was 0.41% Conclusions HIV prevalence among adults was 4.8% with an overall incidence of 0.41%.

Several recombinant Treponema pallidum-proteins have already been tested for syphilis diagnosis and they are critical to achieve high accuracy in serological testing. Our aim was to assess the varied from performance of T. pallidum-recombinant proteins TmpA, TpN17 and TpN47 for syphilis serodiagnosis. The proteins were evaluated using sera of 338 T. pallidum-negative, 173 T. pallidum-positive individuals and 209 sera from individuals infected with unrelated diseases. The diagnostic potential was validated by analysis of ROC curves. In the liquid microarray analyses, the ROC curve varied from 99.0% for TmpA and TpN17 to 100% for TpN47. The sensitivity score yielded values of up to 90% for TpN17, 100% for TpN47 and 80.0% for TmpA. The lowest and highest specificity values were presented by TpN47 (91.9%) and TmpA antigens (100%), respectively. TpN47 showed the highest accuracy score (95.5%) among all the recombinant proteins assayed. For the ELISA, the ROC curve was 97.2%, 91.8% and 81.6% for TpN17, TmpA and TpN47, respectively. TpN17 and TmpA yielded a sensitivity of 69.9%, while TpN47 obtained a value of 53.8%. Specificity was almost 100% for all three proteins. No cross-reaction was observed for TpN17 in the serum samples from non-bacterial infections. Regarding leptospirosis-positive samples, cross-reactivity score was varied from 8.6 to 34.6%.

https://openalex.org/W3036862929,"Introduction The effect of anticoagulation control on overall Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients taking warfarin in Pakistan has not been explored yet. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate HRQoL among warfarin patients in Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients on warfarin in Pakistan. By purposive sampling, data were collected using demographic data collection form and the World Health Organization Quality of Life: Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF is comprised of four domains; physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results Out of 295 warfarin patients, more females than males (<0.001) were observed (n = 184, 62.4%, and n = 111, 37.6% respectively). One hundred and eighteen (40.0%) patients were less than 30-years of age, whereas one hundred and seventy-seven (60.0%) patients were above 30-years of age. Mean scores for the physical (62.44±15.36), psychological (67.84±15.54), social (64.27±26.28) and environment domains (63.45±17.66) were observed. Conclusion Patients had overall lower to moderate but satisfactory HRQoL scores in all four domains. Age, gender, employment status, education level, the indication of use and duration of warfarin therapy was associated with one or more domains of HRQoL among warfarin patients. The findings of this study would serve as a primary database for future studies. This study highlights how non-clinical factors could impact HRQoL in studied patients."
https://openalex.org/W3036311825,"Oxidative status of maternal blood represents an important parameter of pregnancy that is involved in both, regulation of physiological processes and (if significantly altered) development of different pregnancy complications. Inherited thrombophilias represent genetic disorders that increase the risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy. Little is known about the impact of thrombophilia on the oxidative status of maternal blood. In this study, we analyzed oxidative status of blood of 56 women with pregnancies burdened by inherited thrombophilias. The status was established at three different trimesters using biochemical assays and electrochemical measurements, and it was compared to 10 age- and trimester-matching controls. Activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase in the 1st and the 2nd trimester of thrombophilic pregnancy were lower than controls. Also, there was less oxidation in the plasma, according to higher concentration of reduced thiols and lower oxidation-reduction potential. Therefore, it appears that thrombophilic mothers do not experience oxidative stress in the circulation in the first two trimesters. However, the rise in GPx, GR and SOD activities in the 3rd trimester of thrombophilic pregnancy implies that the risk of oxidative stress is increased during the late pregnancy. These results are important for developing antioxidative treatment that could tackle thrombophilia-related pregnancy complications."

Patients and methods The study design is a retrospective and noncomparative interventional case series from a tertiary referral center in Taiwan. Patients experiencing vessel growth at the iris and anterior chamber angle, along with an IOP > 21 mmHg were included. Results Twenty-five eyes from 23 patients were included over a 24-month period. After the procedures, all of them had a lower IOP value than their preoperative value. The mean IOP was 38.2± 7.1 mm Hg preoperatively, and 10.2± 4.7 mmHg (1 day), 13.8± 4.6 mmHg (1 week), 15.0± 5.3 mmHg (2 weeks), 17.4± 4.7 mmHg (1 month), 16.6± 4.1 mmHg (3 months), 16.0± 5.0 mmHg (6 months), and 15.7± 5.5 mmHg (12 months) postoperatively. At the 6th and 12th months, the IOP stabilized rate was 84% and 75%, respectively. Complications in the initial postoperative period (< 3 months) included uveitis (24%), and hyphema (16%), which were both resolved in the early postoperative period. Complications beyond 6 months included hypotony and phthisis bulbi in two patients (8%) in our study. There was no subject who suffered from retinal detachment, endophthalmitis or any other severe complications. Conclusions The results of this study show that CEaP offers positive results in IOP lowering and NV regression. Additionally, CEaP is a complete treatment for NVG in controlling IOP and NV growth. The IOP lowering effects can be sustained upon completion of the treatment."

For the first time, we present cubozoan spatial and temporal distributions in the earliest stages and their relationships with different factors. Abundances of Carybdea marsupialis medusae showed high interannual variability from 2008 to 2014 along the Dénia coast (SE Spain, W Mediterranean). During 2015, samples were collected from 11 beaches along 17 km of coastline, 8 times from January to November in order to determine the effects of environmental factors on the distribution of juvenile C. marsupialis. Juveniles (≤ 15 mm diagonal bell width) were present from May to July, with more sampled near shore (0-15 m). Most of them occurred in June when their numbers were unequal among beaches (average 0.05 ind m-3, maximum 6.71 ind m-3). We tested distributions of juveniles over time and space versus temperature, salinity, nutrients (N, P and Si), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and zooplankton abundance. Temperature and cladocerans (zooplankton group) were significantly positively correlated with juvenile distribution, whereas Chl-a concentration was weakly negative. By contrast, in 2014, high productivity areas (Chl-a and zooplankton) overlapped the maximum adult abundance (5.2 ind m-3). The distribution of juveniles during 2015 did not spatially coincide with the areas where ripe adults were located the previous year, suggesting that juveniles drift with the currents upon release from the cubopolyps. Our results yield important insights into the complexity of cubozoan distributions."
https://openalex.org/W3035929549,"Non-physician clinicians (NPCs) providing services in functionally private markets account for a large share of the workforce in the primary care system in many low-income and middle-income countries. Although regular in-service training is believed to be crucial to updating NPCs' professional knowledge, skills, and practices, participation rates are often low. Low participation may result from the ""credence good"" nature of the market for primary care: if patients are unable to observe quality improvements from training, NPCs have weaker incentives to participate. Empirical evidence is limited on the relationship between market competition and NPC participation in-service training as well as how participation varies with the type of training available.The study uses a dataset of 301 NPCs from three prefectures in Yunnan, a province in southwest China, collected in July 2017. Logistic regression is used to estimate the relationship between competition and NPC's participation in in-service training. We assess the relationship between participation and both the quantity of competition (number of competitors in the same village and surrounding villages) and the quality of competition (proxied using characteristics of competing clinicians).In 2016, nearly two thirds of NPCs participated in face-to-face or web-based in-service trainings at least once. Specifically, 58 percent of NPCs participated in face-to-face in-service trainings, and 24 percent of NPCs participated in web-based in-service trainings.
