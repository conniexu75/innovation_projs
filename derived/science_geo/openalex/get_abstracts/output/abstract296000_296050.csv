https://openalex.org/W1982897289,"X-ray diffraction studies confirm that, with few exceptions, each skeletal element of echtinoderms is a single crystal of magnesium-rich calcite and that a relation exists between the shape of the element and the crystallographic a- and c-axes. The exceptions incluide the teeth of echinoids, and the calcareous ring as well as the anal teeth of holothurians. The tubercles of an echinoid plate begin their growth as parts of the single crystal of the plate; under the mechanical action of the spines that are attached to them, they become partly polycrystalline, as shown by scanning electron microscopy and by x-ray powder diffraction. The interface between inorganic crystalline and organic amorphous matter in the skeletal element appears to be the first example reported in nature of a periodic mninimal suirface."

Male shifting corresponds with the season of mating, and results in copulation with females of newly joined groups. This pattern is socially disruptive, but provides opportunity for exchange of genetic material between groups of a region."
https://openalex.org/W2060118777,There has developed in the contemporary natural sciences a recognition that there is a subset of problems such as population atomic war and environmental corruption for which there are no technical solutions (1 2). There is also an increasing recognition among contemporary social scientists that there is a subset of problems such as population atomic war environmental corruption and the recovery of a livable urban environment for which there are no current political solutions [(3)]. The thesis of this article is that the common area shared by these two subsets contains most of the critical problems that threaten the very existence of contemporary man. (excerpt)
https://openalex.org/W2042943320,"The submicroscopic morphology of magnesian calcite skeletal units of echinoids, revealed by scanning electron microscopy, was compared with crystal orientation data obtained by x-ray methods and with macroscopic morphology. The Perischoechinoidea and the Euechinoidea differ with regard to the shapes of their trabeculae. Nearly all plates and spines are single crystals. A variety of diJfferent directional relations of c- and a-axes to the main morphological directions are found for different species; adjacent plates with identical c-axis orientation differ strongly in orientation of their a-axes. Fracture surfaces of single trabeculae show cleavage planes and zonal layers attributed to changes in secretion conditions."

The importance of familiarity is demonstrated by cultural differences obtained with photographs of natural settings which emphasize depth cues."

When equipped with an appropriate ultraviolet-transmitting lens, such a camera can be used for the direct examination of ultraviolet reflection patterns (for example, on flowers, butterflies) that are invisible to us, but visible to insects."

Acclimation to a high temperature (35 degrees C) resulted in the selection of a lowered mean preferred body temperature, whereas acclimation to lower temperatures (12 degrees C and 25 degrees C) produced no change in the preferred body temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2043956412,"The Central Indian Ridge is mantled with flows of low-potassium basalt of uniform composition. Gabbro, anorthosite, and garnet-bearing lherzolite are exposed in cross fractures, and lherzolite is the bedrock at the center of the ridge. The lherzolites are upper-mantle rock exposed by faulting."
https://openalex.org/W1973022582,"In Aplysia periodic spontaneous gill movements are controlled by activity endogenous to the abdominal ganglion. These movements were still observed when only the ctenidio-genital nerve was left intact between the ganglion and the gill. One kind of spontaneous gill movement (one per 5 minutes at 15 degrees C) was correlated with the expression of activity of interneuron II; others were not. With reference to this kind of spontaneous gill movement, four types of central neurons in the ganglion send processes to the gill via the nerve. Two cell types (ii, iii) are inhibited and the other two (i, iv) are excited. Two types (i, ii) elicited gill movement-one type activating large gill areas elicited spontaneous gill movements, and the other activating specific gill regions did not participate in the spontaneous gill movements. The value of this preparation in studying the role of central neurons eliciting specific patterned movements and the temporal organization of their activity is shown."
https://openalex.org/W2020927948,Auditory neurons in the avian cochlear nucleus are systematically arranged according to their best frequencies. The thresholds of single auditory neurons at their best frequencies match the thresholds of hearing obtained by behavioral methods for the same frequencies. The upper range of single-unit best frequencies shows distinct interspecific variation which is correlated with the differences in the range of vocal frequencies. Most songbirds do not seem to produce frequencies below I kilohertz but can hear them.
https://openalex.org/W1991434081,"The reflection spectrum of Mars can be well matched from 0.2 through 1.6 microns (and farther) by polymers of carbon suboxide, reflection spectra for which have now been measured. We propose that the reddish color of Mars might be attributed to carbon suboxide, not the commonly considered limonite or other iron-bearing minerals."

The concentration of mucopolysaccharide is somewhat higher in the cuticle, where it it the only soluble polysaccharide, than in the digestive gland, where it makes up 10 to 25 percent of the total polysaccharide content."

https://openalex.org/W2005089047,"Subfossil pine stubs from a peat bog in the Netherlands were linked together dendrochronologically and sampled at intervals of 30 or 50 years for carbon-14 analysis. The results suggest that the carbon-14 content of the atmosphere was not changing between about 5400 and 5100 B.C., but that it was increasing slightly about 800 years earlier."
https://openalex.org/W2064270974,"Recent observations of the spectrum of the planet Venus, with spectrographs of low and high dispersion at the Georgetown College Observatory, show that a wide, continuous absorption band is present in the violet and near-ultraviolet. The band begins near wavelength 4500 A and extends to the short-wavelength limit of our spectrograms near 3800 A. It is similar in structure to the strong absorption, reported by others, for gaseous nitrogen tetroxide."
https://openalex.org/W2081680569,"The analysis of line-of-sight residual accelerations from Lunar Orbiters 3 and 5 does not show any evidence for large mascons near the lunar limbs. Although unfavorable geometry reduces the acceleration effect due to any mascon near the limb, simulations show that large masses at Mare Orientale and Mare Marginis would produce substantial accelerations, in complete disagreement with the actual Doppler tracking data obtained from a Lunar Orbiter experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2031588442,"Brenner et al. have pointed out that spurious variations may be introduced into computation of satellite orbits by a combination of the use of osculating elements and a maldistribution of the observations. They suggest that this circumstance is the source of the eccentricity variations in the Vanguard I orbit which have been attributed to the third zonal harmonic. This criticism is based on a misunderstanding of the Vanguard orbit and tracking programs. The source materials for our study of the third zonal harmonic were not osculating elements, and the observations were in fact uniformly distributed around the Vanguard I orbit."
