https://openalex.org/W1517621505,"A new metabolic pathway characterized recently that is expressed in activated macrophages involves the formation of nitric oxide ('N = O) as an intermediate. The 'N = O formed decomposes to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). The substrate for the reaction is the amino acid arginine which is oxidized at the guanido nitrogen to yield citrulline as the other product of the reaction. The studies reported here show that the activity for this unusual oxidation reaction which is contained in the 100,000 x g supernatant was lost after desalting on a Sephadex G-25 column. A small molecule cofactor was found to be required for the restoration of activity. The addition of (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and NADPH led to complete recovery of activity in this desalted protein. Analysis of macrophage cell extracts, using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, showed that BH4 was present at 17 pmol/10(6) cells or 2.1 microM in macrophage supernatant. Only the (6R)-isomer was present. With the addition of BH4 and NADPH, there was loss of arginine that was equal to the NO2-, NO3-, and citrulline formed. With substoichiometric levels of NADPH relative to BH4, the loss of arginine was greater than the formation of the end products of the reaction. A scheme for the reaction pathway consistent with the results involves N-hydroxylation of arginine as the initial step. The participation of BH4 in this type of oxidative chemistry is consistent with previous characterizations of this co-factor."
https://openalex.org/W2010044764,"wingless, a segment polarity gene required in every segment for the normal development of the Drosophila embryo, encodes a cysteine-rich protein with a signal peptide. A polyclonal antiserum localizes the wingless protein in approximately the same region of the embryo as the wingless mRNA. The pattern of antigen localization changes rapidly during development. In the extended germband stage, stripes of wingless staining are present in the trunk region just anterior to the parasegment boundary; wingless-expressing cells abut engrailed-expressing cells across that boundary. wingless antigen is seen both inside and outside the cell by electron microscopy: inside the cell, in small membrane-bound vesicles and in multivesicular bodies; outside the cell, close to or on the plasma membrane and associated with material in the intercellular space. The multivesicular bodies containing the wingless protein are occasionally found in engrailed-positive cells, suggesting that the wingless protein behaves as a paracrine signal."
https://openalex.org/W2123030732,The CD4 lymphocyte surface glycoprotein and the lck tyrosine protein kinase p56lck are found as a complex in T lymphocytes. We have defined the domains in both proteins that are responsible for this interaction by coexpressing hybrid and deleted forms of the two proteins in HeLa cells. We have found that the unique 32 amino-terminal residues of p56lck and the 38 carboxy-terminal residues of CD4 that comprise the cytoplasmic domain are both necessary and sufficient by themselves for the interaction of the two proteins. The interaction appears to be independent of other T cell-specific proteins and probably occurs before CD4 reaches the cell surface. Our findings suggest that the specialized amino-terminal domains of other members of the src family of intracellular tyrosine kinases may also mediate transmembrane signaling via coupling to the cytoplasmic domains of specific transmembrane proteins.
https://openalex.org/W2034863466,"The Golgi complex, a membranous organelle with important functions in membrane traffic and macromolecular synthesis, has been stained in living cells with a fluorescent sphingolipid. Cells were first incubated with liposomes containing N-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-6-aminocaproyl sphingosine (C6-NBD-ceramide), or with a bovine serum albumin complex of the fluorescent lipid, and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. An intensely fluorescent perinuclear structure was identified as the Golgi apparatus by its colocalization with known Golgi markers in fixed cells. C6-NBD-ceramide was used to observe the morphology of the Golgi apparatus in living cells in the presence or absence of monensin or Colcemid, and during mitosis. In all cases, C6-NBD-ceramide revealed a Golgi apparatus in the living cell that was identical to that obtained with conventional procedures that require fixation."
https://openalex.org/W2091550771,Steroid hormones regulate cellular differentiation and physiologic functions predominantly through gene transcription. Regulation is achieved by the interaction of specific steroid receptor proteins and target genes. Expression cloning techniques were used to select human glucocorticoid receptor complementary DNA clones in order to define the mechanism by which the receptor exerts its transcriptional control. Immobilized fusion proteins from individual clones were used to select epitope-specific antibody which was subsequently eluted and identified by binding to protein blots of cellular extracts. Three cross-hybridizing clones containing inserts expressing antigenic determinants of the human glucocorticoid receptor were isolated.
https://openalex.org/W2015661750,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain, is believed to act by increasing membrane conductance of chloride ions. In this study it was found that GABA agonists increased the uptake of chloride-36 by cell-free membrane preparations from mouse brain. This influx was rapid (less than 5 seconds), and 13 micromolar GABA produced a half-maximal effect. The GABA antagonists (bicuculline and picrotoxin) blocked the effect of GABA, whereas pentobarbital enhanced the action. This may be the first demonstration of functional coupling among GABA and barbiturate receptors and chloride channels in isolated membranes. The technique should facilitate biochemical and pharmacological studies of GABA receptor-effector coupling."

https://openalex.org/W1532893184,"Mammalian cells contain two forms of RNA polymerase II, designated IIO and IIA, that differ in the extent of phosphorylation within the C-terminal domain of their largest subunit. Phosphorylation of this domain, which results in the conversion of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO, may play an important role in the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase of transcription. A third form of the enzyme, RNA polymerase IIB, is found in vitro and lacks the repetitive C-terminal domain. Purified calf thymus RNA polymerase IIA was labeled selectively with casein kinase II in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and used as substrate for the identification and partial purification of factors that catalyze the conversion of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO. HeLa cell S-100 transcription extracts contain such an activity that cofractionates with factors essential for promoter-dependent transcription through heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-5PW, and DE52 chromatography. The activity is dependent on either ATP, GTP, or dATP, requires a hydrolyzable beta,gamma-phosphoanhydride bond, and cannot utilize pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates. This observation supports the idea that the conversion activity is a protein kinase. Transcription of the major late promoter of adenovirus-2 was carried out in the presence of a reconstituted transcription extract containing purified RNA polymerases IIO, IIA, or IIB, and the nature of the elongating enzyme was determined by photoaffinity labeling. When the reaction was initiated with RNA polymerase IIO or IIB, nascent transcripts were found cross-linked to subunit IIo or IIb, respectively. However, when the reaction was initiated with RNA polymerase IIA, nascent transcripts were cross-linked to subunit IIo. Consequently, phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of subunit IIa must have occurred prior to elongation. The copurification of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO conversion activity with factors essential for promoter-dependent transcription and the observation that RNA polymerase II containing an unphosphorylated C-terminal domain is phosphorylated prior to elongation suggest that protein kinases that phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of subunit IIa may play an essential role in transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1563310899,"Cyclic GMP causes the release of endogenous Ca2+ from rod outer segments, whose plasma membrane has been made permeable, or from isolated discs. Approximately 11,000 Ca2+ ions are released per disc at saturating concentrations of cyclic GMP. The velocity and the amplitude of the release of Ca2+ are dependent on the concentration of cyclic GMP. The maximal rate of the Ca2+ efflux is approximately 7 X 10(4) Ca2+ ions s-1 rod-1. The Ca2+ release by cyclic GMP is independent of light. The activation of the efflux occurred within a narrow range of the cyclic GMP concentration (30-80 microM) and does not obey a simple Michaelis-Menten scheme. Instead, the kinetic analysis of the Ca2+ efflux suggests that a minimum number of 2 molecules of cyclic GMP activates the ion conductance in a cooperative fashion. The release of Ca2+ by cyclic GMP requires a gradient of Ca2+ ions across the disc membrane. If the endogenous Ca2+ gradient is dissipated by means of the ionophore A23187, the release of Ca2+ by cyclic GMP is abolished. Ca2+ is released by analogues of cyclic GMP which are either modified at the 8-carbon position of the imidazole ring or by the deaza-analogue of cyclic GMP. Congeners of cyclic GMP which are modified at the ribose, phosphodiester, or pyrimidine portion of the molecule are ineffective. The hydrolysis of cyclic GMP by the light-regulated phosphodiesterase of rod outer segments is not a necessary condition for the Ca2+ release because 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, a congener resistant to hydrolysis, is a more powerful activator of the release than cyclic GMP itself. Ca2+ release by cyclic GMP is inhibited by organic and inorganic blockers of Ca2+ channels. The l-stereoisomer of cis-diltiazem blocks the release of Ca2+ at micromolar concentrations, whereas the d-form is much less effective. These results suggest that disc membranes contain a cationic conductance which is permeable to Ca2+ ions and which is regulated through the cooperative binding of at least 2 molecules of cyclic GMP to regulatory sites of the transport protein. By this mechanism, subtle changes in the concentration of cyclic GMP could promote large changes in the flux of Ca2+ ions across the disc membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2034367190,"T cells expressing either the alpha beta or gamma delta antigen receptor (TCR) are distinct cell lineages. The single locus encoding the TCR alpha and delta genes requires special regulation to avoid alpha gene expression in gamma delta T cells. We show here that the minimal alpha enhancer is active in the gamma delta T cell lineage but gains alpha beta lineage specificity through negative cis-acting elements 3' of the C alpha gene that silence the enhancer in gamma delta T cells. The negative elements at the C alpha locus consist of several silencers that work in an orientation- and distance-independent fashion. These silencers also act on a retroviral enhancer that is normally ubiquitously expressed, restricting its activity to alpha beta cells. The alpha silencers are active in non-T cell lines, suggesting that the decision of a cell to differentiate into the alpha beta T cell lineage may involve specific relief from these silencers. Silencers are likely to be as important as enhancers in establishing lineage-specific gene expression in many systems."
https://openalex.org/W1520016172,"Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein whose sequence is highly conserved throughout evolution from invertebrates to mammals. It is both a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. In the cytoplasm it is involved in ATP-dependent nonlysosomal proteolysis. In the nucleus, ubiquitin is conjugated to histone 2A and may play a role in regulation of chromatin structure and/or regulation of transcriptional activity. During attempts to identify a cDNA encoding somatomedin-C (insulin-like growth factor I) we screened a fetal human liver cDNA library with a mixture of 17 base oligonucleotides corresponding to a portion of the B chain of somatomedin-C. One oligonucleotide of the mixture hybridized to two cDNAs encoding ubiquitin despite a 2-base pair mismatch. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the 350- and 516-base pair cDNAs revealed that they correspond to the same ubiquitin mRNA. The coding sequence of the 516-base pair cDNA begins at amino acid 5 of the ubiquitin sequence and encodes amino acids 5 through 76 of ubiquitin, an 80-amino acid carboxy-terminal extension, a 3' untranslated region, and a poly(A) tail. The finding that ubiquitin is synthesized as a precursor raises the possibility that the precursor sequence may be important in compartmentalization of ubiquitin or ubiquitin precursors. Analyses of ubiquitin mRNAs in poly(A) RNA extracted from human liver and various rat tissues reveals that there are three distinct mRNAs encoding ubiquitin in humans and four mRNAs in the rat."

https://openalex.org/W1900727795,"Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and anti-insulin receptor antibody were used to study insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled Fao hepatoma cells. Without insulin, the receptor contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine and could be immunoprecipitated with anti-receptor antibody but not with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After incubation of these cells with insulin, both antibodies immunoprecipitated the phosphorylated receptor. The beta-subunit of the receptor precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from cells stimulated with insulin (100 nM) for 1 min contained predominantly phosphotyrosine, whereas, after 10 min with insulin, the amounts of phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine were nearly equal. These results suggest that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation preceded insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit. Sequential immunoprecipitation of receptor with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by precipitation of the remaining proteins with anti-receptor antibody suggests that insulin receptors which contain phosphoserine in the basal state are tyrosine phosphorylated more slowly than the dephosphorylated receptors or not at all after the addition of insulin. The beta-subunit of the insulin receptor was the major phosphorylated protein precipitated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from insulin-stimulated Fao cells. These results confirm our notion that insulin initially stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation and subsequently serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in intact cells and suggests that this sequence of reactions occurs faster on receptors that are dephosphorylated before the incubation with insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1481688884,"The affinity of the chemoattractant receptor for N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) is regulated by guanine nucleotides, and chemoattractants stimulate increased intracellular cAMP levels in PMNs. Our data, however, indicate that this receptor does not activate membrane-bound adenylate cyclase via direct nucleotide regulatory protein (N) coupling but instead raises cAMP levels indirectly via a mechanism which appears to require Ca2+ mobilization. This conclusion is based on the following data: 1) prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) activated and alpha 2-adrenergic treatment inhibited adenylate cyclase activation in PMN plasma membranes; fMet-Leu-Phe, however, neither activated nor inhibited adenylate cyclase in these membranes; 2) depletion of extracellular Ca2+ had no effect on isoproterenol and PGE1 elicited cAMP responses in intact PMNs while peak fMet-Leu-Phe and A23187-induced responses were reduced by approximately 50 and 80%, respectively; 3) 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate, a purported Ca2+ antagonist, caused almost complete inhibition of fMet-Leu-Phe and ionophore-induced cAMP responses in intact cells but had no effect on PGE1 and isoproterenol; 4) alpha 2-adrenergic agonists inhibited PGE1 but not chemoattractant- or A23187-elicited cAMP responses in intact PMNs; and 5) pretreatment of cells with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine) greatly potentiated the PGE1 and isoproterenol cAMP responses but nearly abolished the peak fMet-Leu-Phe response. Thus, chemoattractants appear to utilize a novel mechanism to raise cAMP levels which appear to require Ca2+ mobilization and could be mediated in part through a transient inhibition of phosphodiesterases. We suggest that stimulation of PMN functions by chemoattractants may utilize an N-coupled process to generate a Ca2+ signal which could in turn raise intracellular cAMP levels indirectly and thereby provide negative regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1640776676,"In this study, we investigated the effect of the anticancer drug doxorubicin on Ca2+ fluxes of isolated highly purified sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions (longitudinal tubules and terminal cisternae (Saito, A., Seiler, S., Chu, A., and Fleischer, S. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 875-885] and of chemically skinned skeletal muscle fibers of the rabbit. In terminal cisternae, doxorubicin inhibits Ca2+ uptake (IC50 at 0.5 microM) and increases 2.6-fold Ca2+-dependent ATPase rate (half-maximal activation at 3 microM) and unidirectional Ca2+ efflux (8-fold stimulation at 25 microM). On the contrary, doxorubicin is without effect on longitudinal tubules. In skinned muscle fibers, doxorubicin induces rapid and transient Ca2+ release, as measured by tension development (half-maximal stimulation at 6 microM), which is completely and reversibly inhibited by ruthenium red, a known inhibitor of Ca2+ release from isolated terminal cisternae. Doxorubicin has no effect on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and on the contractile apparatus of skinned muscle fibers. It is concluded that doxorubicin activates Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and opens a Ca2+ efflux pathway (Ca2+ channel) selectively localized in terminal cisternae. Doxorubicin might interact with Ca2+ channels involved in physiological Ca2+ release."

https://openalex.org/W76213163,Three members of the human metallothionein-I gene family have been cloned and characterized. Two of the genes encode closely related but distinct metallothionein-I subtypes. Both of these genes are functional as shown by their transcription in cultured hepatoblastoma cells and by their ability to render transfected cells resistant to cadmium toxicity. The cotranscription of these nonallelic genes shows that the previously observed microheterogeneity of metallothionein-I protein preparations is due to the expression of distinct gene products. The third clone is incapable of encoding a typical metallothionein due to an early termination codon and two nonconservative amino acid replacements. This nonfunctional pseudogene retains introns. Evolutionary comparisons reveal conserved DNA sequences in both the coding and regulatory regions of these genes.

https://openalex.org/W1550370420,"Southern blot analysis has identified several metallothionein gene sequences in a human pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata. Two of these genes encoding proteins designated MT-I and MT-II have been cloned and sequenced. No introns were found in either of the genes. The complete primary structure of MT-II was also determined by protein sequencing methods. As isolated, MT-I and MT-II consist of 62 and 51 amino acids, respectively. The only residues predicted from the nucleotide sequence but not present in the isolated protein are the amino-terminal methionines in each sequence. MT-I contains 18 cysteines, 14 of which are present as Cys-X-Cys motifs and two additional cysteines in a Cys-X-X-Cys sequence. The sequence of MT-II contains 16 cysteinyl residues, 14 of which are in Cys-X-Cys sequences. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicates the presence of Cu(I)-thiolate bonds in both proteins. The binding stoichiometries are 11-12 for MT-I and 10 for MT-II. Under certain nutritional conditions, a truncated form of MT-II was also produced. Northern analysis of the total cellular RNA from copper-treated cells showed that both MT-I and MT-II genes are regulated by this metal ion in a concentration-dependent fashion. The concentrations of MT-II mRNA appeared to be higher than that of MT-I mRNA at all concentrations of copper sulfate tested. Both genes are inducible by silver but not by cadmium salts. Cadmium ions, however, are effective in reducing the control levels of both MT-I and MT-II mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1500758106,"A method was developed for isolation of native ribosomal subunits from rat gastrocnemius muscle. Native 40 S subunits which were isolated by this method retained their associated nonribosomal proteins and consisted primarily of particles with equilibrium densities of 1.41 and 1.48 g/cm3. Based on the binding of radiolabeled Met-tRNAmeti, the 1.41 g/cm3 particle was identified as the 40 S initiation complex. Insulin deficiency in vivo resulting from either diabetes or fasting led to a 2-fold increase in 75 S monomers but had no effect on the numbers of native 40 and 60 S subunits or the relative distribution of the 1.41 and 1.48 g/cm3 particles. The rate of protein synthesis in perfused muscle preparations derived from insulin-deficient rats was reduced to about half the control value. Addition of insulin to the perfusate restored protein synthesis and 75 S monomers to control levels. The effect of insulin on protein synthesis was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the amount of Met-tRNAmeti bound to the 1.41 g/cm3 particle. These findings identify formation of 40 S initiation complexes as a site of action of insulin on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2058659535,The obligate intracellular prokaryote Chlamydia trachomatis is the etiological agent of trachoma and is a primary causative pathogen of sexually transmitted genital tract disease; both diseases affect millions of people each year. The cloning of genes encoding the enzyme or enzymes producing the genus-specific lipopolysaccharide antigen of Chlamydia into Escherichia coli is reported here. The cloned chlamydial lipopolysaccharide antigen appears to be a hybrid lipopolysaccharide molecule composed of both Chlamydia and Escherichia coli components. The chlamydial lipopolysaccharide antigen is expressed on the surfaces of the viable Escherichia coli recombinants. These findings may have a significant impact on defining the role of this highly conserved antigen in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of chlamydial infections.

https://openalex.org/W2063602878,"Two types of specific telomeric protein-DNA complex are reconstituted upon incubation of purified Oxytricha telomere protein with (T4G4)4, an oligodeoxynucleotide of telomeric sequence. The complexes differ in electrophoretic mobility, in protein-DNA contacts, and in the rate of DNA exchange. The patterns of protein-DNA interaction determined by modification interference suggest a model in which the protein can bind either to the two T4G4 repeats at the 3' end or to two internal repeats; in the latter case, it can make a different set of contacts with the terminal repeat to form the more stable complex. Native telomeric chromatin isolated from Oxytricha contains both types of complexes. The reconstituted monomeric complexes associate to give a high molecular weight form that has an altered chemical footprint. Such interactions may mediate the association of chromosomal telomeres in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2020343823,"During development of Dictyostelium discoideum, a surface glycoprotein of Mr 80,000 (gp80) is known to mediate EDTA-resistant cell-cell adhesion via homophilic interaction. Antibodies directed against a 13 amino acid sequence (13-mer) near the NH2 terminus of the protein were found to inhibit cell reassociation. This 13-mer also inhibited gp80-cell interaction and gp80-gp80 interaction. The cell binding site was mapped to the octapeptide sequence YKLNVNDS by using shorter peptide sequences to inhibit gp80 interaction. High salt concentrations inhibited homophilic interactions of both the 13-mer and gp80, suggesting that ionic interactions are involved in the forward binding reaction. Since disruption of homophilic interactions between the bound molecules required the presence of Triton X-100, hydrophobic interactions may occur after the initial ionic binding."
https://openalex.org/W1546769212,"The effect of anion-specific inhibitors on the utilization of the sugar nucleotides (UDP-glucose, GDP-mannose, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) required for the formation of the oligosaccharide-lipid involved in N-glycosylation has been studied in intact endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles from thyroid. Of the reagents tested, the nonpenetrating probe DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid) and its dihydro derivative (H2DIDS) were the most effective, causing a pronounced impairment in the synthesis from UDP-Glc of dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) glucose (50% reduction at 60 microM DIDS) and in the incorporation of glucose into oligosaccharide-lipid and N-glycosylated protein; in contrast, no inhibition was observed in the formation from UDP-Glc of a glycogen-like proteoglucan. The specificity of the DIDS effect was indicated by the finding that methyl isothiocyanate, a nonanionic amino-reactive agent, demonstrated negligible inhibition. While DIDS also effected a block in the formation of Dol-P-P-GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc, no impairment in the utilization of GDP-Man for Dol-P-Man synthesis was observed. Since the DIDS inhibition of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc utilization was maintained after disruption of the ER vesicles with Triton, even when the incubations were supplemented with Dol-P, it appears that this reagent does not interact with sugar nucleotide translocator proteins but rather with the cytoplasmically oriented anion binding sites of glycosyltransferases (UDP-Glc- and UDP-GlcNAc:Dol-P glucosyl- and GlcNAc-1-P transferases). This is consistent with the protease sensitivity of these enzymes in the intact ER vesicles. Incubation of the vesicles with tritiated H2DIDS (8 microM) introduced radioactivity into membrane polypeptides with molecular weights of about 52,000 and 31,000 as observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that this inhibitor may prove useful as an affinity label in further studies of some of the glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of lipid-monosaccharide intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1501862764,"Many investigations of the biosynthesis of ribosomes have revealed that ribosome numbers increase with growth rate in a parallel fashion. However, we have now shown that there is also a need for active ribosome synthesis in a nonmitotic tissue which is induced to secrete. The paragonial glands of Drosophila melanogaster produce and secrete proteins that are found in the seminal fluid. Following even a single copulation event these glands are substantially reduced in size, but rapidly refill, synthesizing new secretion proteins (Chen, P.S. 1980) in Invertebrate Systems in Vitro (Kurstak, E., Maramorosch, K., and Dubendorfer, A., eds) pp. 303-313, Elsevier, Amsterdam) Anticipating that paragonial gland cells might require more ribosomes to accomplish this burst of protein synthesis, we injected 10-day-old adult male flies with either [32P] phosphate or [35S]methionine, allowed them to copulate (40 +/- 20 min after injection), and then measured the amounts of rRNA and ribosomal protein synthesis taking place with time. There is clearly a burst of ribosome synthesis starting as early as 30 min after copulation and declining after 6 h. This is evidenced by the coordinate accumulation of labeled rRNAs and ribosomal proteins. However, further experiments showed that there is no concomitant rise in the accumulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs. This suggests that these mRNAs are underutilized in the paragonial glands before copulation and more actively translated after copulation. A stimulation of translation of ribosomal proteins is then well-coordinated with increased rRNA transcription, but an increase of ribosomal protein mRNAs is not coordinated with these events. Both the up- and down-regulation of ribosome biosynthesis need not be coupled to cell growth or a specific developmental schedule, but rather may be due to the need for secretory protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1486464851,"Solution x-ray scattering using synchrotron radiation as an x-ray source was used to analyze the Ca2+-dependent shape change of pig brain calmodulin in detail. The radius of gyration of calmodulin at 10 mg/ml was increased by 0.9 A. The increase was nearly completed when 2.5 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin was added, whereas the radius of gyration of calmodulin with mastoparan decreased by about 3 A with an increasing Ca2+ concentration up to 4 mol of Ca2+/mol of calmodulin. At a moderate angle of region, both scattering profiles from calmodulin with or without Ca2+ displayed clear humps at s = 0.03 A-1 which are characteristic of a dumbbell structure. However, in the presence of mastoparan, the hump in the scattering profile became obscure and later disappeared with the third and fourth Ca2+ binding to calmodulin. These findings are attributable to the Ca2+-induced shape change of calmodulin with mastoparan from a dumbbell structure to a non-dumbbell structure in which the distance between the two lobes of calmodulin become closer by a bend in the central helix."
https://openalex.org/W2143837503,"The kinetic mechanism of dextransucrase was studied using the Streptococcus mutans enzyme purified by affinity chromatography to a specific activity of 36.9 mumol/min/mg of enzyme. In addition to dextran synthesis, the enzyme catalyzed sucrose hydrolysis and isotope exchange between fructose and sucrose. The rates of sucrose hydrolysis and dextran synthesis were partitioned as a function of dextran concentration such that exclusive sucrose hydrolysis was observed in the absence of dextran and exclusive dextran synthesis at high dextran concentrations. An analogous situation was observed with fructose-dependent partitioning of sucrose hydrolysis and fructose exchange. Steady state dextran synthesis and fructose isotope exchange kinetics were simplified by assay at dextran or fructose concentrations high enough to eliminate significant contributions from sucrose hydrolysis. This limited dextran synthesis assays to dextran concentrations above apparent saturation. The limitation was diminished by establishing conditions in which the enzyme does not distinguish between dextran as a substrate and product which allowed initial discrimination among mechanisms on the basis of the presence or absence of dextran substrate inhibition. No inhibition was observed, which excluded ping-pong and all but three common sequential mechanisms. Patterns of initial velocity fructose production inhibition and fructose isotope exchange at equilibrium were consistent with dextran synthesis proceeding by a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. A nonsequential segment was apparent in the exchange reaction between fructose and sucrose assayed in the absence of dextran. However, the absence of detectable glucosyl exchange between dextrans and the lack of steady state dextran substrate inhibition indicate that glucosyl transfer to dextran must occur almost exclusively through the sequential route. A review of the kinetic constants from steady state dextran synthesis, fructose product inhibition, and fructose isotope exchange showed a consistency in constants derived from each reaction and revealed that dextran binding increases the affinity of sucrose and fructose for dextransucrase."
https://openalex.org/W1998706402,"Interaction of thiocyanate with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was investigated by relaxation rate measurements (at 50.68 MHz) of the 15N resonance of thiocyanate nitrogen and by following the hyperfine shifted ring methyl proton resonances (at 500 MHz) of the heme group of SCN-.HRP solutions. At pH 4.0, the apparent dissociation constant (KD) for thiocyanate binding to HRP was deduced to be 158 mM from the relaxation rate measurements. Chemical shift changes of 1- and 8-ring methyl proton resonances in the presence of various amounts of thiocyanate at pH 4.0 yielded KD values of 166 and 136 mM, respectively. From the pH dependence of KD and the 15N resonance line width, it was observed that thiocyanate binds to HRP only under acidic conditions (pH less than 6). The binding was found to be facilitated by protonation of an acid group on the enzyme with pKa 4.0. The pH dependence of the 15N line width as well as the apparent dissociation constant were quantitatively analyzed on the basis of a reaction scheme in which thiocyanate in deprotonated ionic form binds to the enzyme in protonated acidic form. The KD for thiocyanate binding to HRP was also evaluated in the presence of an excess of exogenous substrates such as resorcinol, cyanide, and iodide ions. It was found that the presence of cyanide (which binds to heme iron at the sixth coordination position) and resorcinol did not have any effect on the binding of thiocyanate, indicating that the binding site of the thiocyanate ion is located away from the ferric center as well as from the aromatic donor binding site. The KD in the presence of iodide, however, showed that iodide competes with thiocyanate for binding at the same site. The distance of the bound thiocyanate ion from the ferric center was deduced from the 15N relaxation time measurements and was found to be a 6.8 A. From the distance as well as the change in the chemical shifts and line width of 1- and 8-methyl proton resonances, it is suggested that the binding site of thiocyanate may be located near heme, placed symmetrically with respect to 1- and 8-methyl groups of the heme of HRP. Similarity in the modes of binding of iodide and thiocyanate suggests that the oxidation of thiocyanate ion by H2O2 may also proceed via the two-electron transfer pathway under acidic conditions, as is the case for iodide."
https://openalex.org/W2091207615,"The carcinogenic process is extremely complex and is affected by diverse environmental and host factors. The mechanism for the gradual development of the transformed phenotype (a process termed ""progression"") was studied in type 5 adenovirus (Ad5)-transformed rat embryo cells. Progression was not correlated with major changes in the pattern of integration of viral DNA sequences. Instead, it was associated with an increased methylation of integrated viral sequences other than those corresponding to the E1 transforming genes of Ad5. A single exposure of progressed cells to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (Aza) resulted in a stable reversion to the unprogressed state of the original parental clone. A further selection of cells after growth in agar allowed the isolation of Aza-treated clones that had regained the progressed phenotype. These observations indicate that progression is a reversible process and suggest that progression may be associated with changes in the state of methylation of one or more specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1510853853,"Two monoclonal antibodies with specificities for Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomal subunit protein L7/L12 were isolated. The antibodies and Fab fragments thereof were purified by affinity chromatography using solid-phase coupled L7/L12 protein as the immunoadsorbent. The two antibodies were shown to recognize different epitopes; one in the N-terminal and the other in the C-terminal domain of protein L7/L12. Both intact antibodies strongly inhibited polyuridylic acid-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, ribosome-dependent GTPase activity, and the binding of elongation factor EF-G to the ribosome. Ratios of antibody to ribosome of 4:1 or less were effective in inhibiting these activities. Neither antibody prevented the association of ribosomal subunits to form 70 S ribosomes. The Fab fragments showed similar effects."
https://openalex.org/W1661736764,"The regulation of DNA polymerase alpha was examined in quiescent, human fibroblast cells stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by subculturing in fresh serum-containing medium. The level of DNA polymerase alpha activity was measured in cell lysates and after specific immunoprecipitation. DNA polymerase alpha activity increased approximately 10-fold during the period of measurement. The activity increase was coincident with an approximately 60-fold increase in thymidine incorporation in the whole cells representing the first S phase. The large increase in polymerase alpha activity was not predominantly the result of synthesis of new polymerase, since the abundance of the enzyme changed less than 2-fold over the measured period. The quantity of [32P]phosphate incorporated into two subunits (180 and 68 kilodaltons) of DNA polymerase alpha increased approximately 10-fold in parallel with the increase in polymerase activity. The specific activity of the cellular ATP pool remained nearly constant over the period of measurement, indicating that the increase in labeling reflects a true increase in incorporation of phosphate. Results from other laboratories indicate that phosphorylation of DNA polymerase alpha increases its catalytic activity. Our results then suggest that the activity increase observed in DNA polymerase alpha when quiescent, human fibroblasts are stimulated to proliferate is largely caused by a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory process."
https://openalex.org/W2056305070,"The histidine-selective reagents diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) and dimethylpyrocarbonate were used to study active site residues of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Both reagents show pseudo first-order inhibition of enzyme activity at 22 +/- 1 degree C with calculated second-order rate constants of 2.8 and 4.6 M-1 s-1, respectively. The inhibition appears partially reversible. Substrates affect the rate of inhibition: KHCO3 enhances the rate, Mn2+ has little effect, and phosphoenolpyruvate decreases the rate. The best protection is obtained by IDP or IDP and Mn2+. The kinetic studies show that modification of histidine is specific and leads to loss of enzymatic activity. Two histidines per enzyme are modified by DEPC, as measured by an absorption change at 240 nm, in the absence of substrate, leading to loss in activity. One histidine per molecule is modified in the presence of KHCO3, giving inactivation. Cysteine and lysine residues are not affected. A study of the inhibition rate constant as a function of pH gives a pKa of 6.7. Enzyme modified by DEPC in the absence of substrate (1% remaining activity) shows no binding of ITP or of phosphoenolpyruvate to the enzyme.Mn2+ complex as studied by proton relaxation rates. When enzyme is modified in the presence of KHCO3 (44% remaining activity), ITP and KHCO3 bind to the enzyme.Mn2+ complex similarly to the binding to native enzyme. Phosphoenolpyruvate binding to modified enzyme.Mn results in an enhancement of proton relaxation rates rather than the decrease observed with native enzyme.Mn. The CD spectra of histidine-modified enzyme show a decrease in alpha-helical and random structure with an increase in anti-parallel beta-sheet structure compared to native enzyme. These results show that avian phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has 2 histidine residues which are reactive with DEPC and dimethylpyrocarbonate, and one of the 15 histidine residues in the protein is at or near the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site and is involved in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1540641009,"The U1 RNA species in 10 mouse cell lines were examined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Seven cell lines that were not infected by Friend spleen focus forming virus gave only one (I) or two (I and II) U1 RNA-containing spots. However, two Friend cell lines (FVTCT and Friend 745a cells) gave three spots (I, II, and III) and another Friend cell line, K-1 cells, gave four spots (I, II, III, and IV). As a result of further separation and fingerprinting analysis of each spot, FVTCT and Friend 745a cells were found to contain U1a-1, U1b-1, -2, and -6 RNAs whereas K-1 cells were found to contain several U1 RNAs, which we call U1a-1 and -2, U1b-4, -5, and -6 RNAs. We determined the sequences of these seven U1 RNAs and found that mouse U1 RNAs had two basic sequences (U1a and -b). The nucleotide sequence of U1a-1 RNA was identical to that of rat U1a RNA, while U1a-2 RNA was one base different from U1a-1 RNA. Relative to U1a-1 RNA all of the U1b RNAs had five base substitutions and one additional base and were under-methylated in the center. U1b-6 RNA contained two base substitutions and one base addition in the 3'-terminal portion of U1b-1 RNA. U1b-2, -4, and -5 RNAs, which were observed only in Friend cells, each had an additional base substitution in the 5'-half of U1b-1 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2010024453,"A recombinant human cell line constructed by transfection of epithelial cells with a plasmid containing the hepatitis B virus core gene (HBc) was used to study the regulation of HBc gene expression. Methylation of a single Hpa II site 280 base pairs upstream from the structural gene was found to regulate the expression of the core gene. Expression increased in cells treated with 5'-azacytidine as a result of cytosine demethylation at this site, and there was a fivefold increase in the number of HBc gene transcripts in total cellular messenger RNA. The varied life cycle of hepatitis B virus in disease such as viral hepatitis and liver cancer may therefore be attributable to the site-specific regulation of the gene involved in replication of the viral DNA and to the cytophathic effects elicited by this gene in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557412572,"Abstract Adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) was used to examine the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of norepinephrine secretion by digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells. While most kinases will use ATP gamma S to thiophosphorylate proteins, thiophosphorylated proteins are relatively resistant to dethiophosphorylation by protein phosphatases. Norepinephrine secretion by permeabilized PC12 cells was ATP- and Ca2+-dependent but resistant to calmodulin antagonists. Half-maximum secretion was obtained in 0.75 microM Ca2+. Permeabilized PC12 cells were incubated with ATP gamma S in the absence of Ca2+, the ATP gamma S was removed, and norepinephrine secretion was determined. Preincubation with ATP gamma S increased the amount of norepinephrine secreted in the absence of Ca2+, but it had no effect on the amount released in the presence of Ca2+. After a 15-min preincubation in 1 mM ATP gamma S, there was almost as much secretion in the absence of Ca2+ as in its presence. Inclusion of ATP in the preincubation inhibited the effect of ATP gamma S. Ca2+ stimulated the rate of modification by ATP gamma S as brief preincubations with ATP gamma S in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in higher levels of Ca2+-independent secretion than did preincubations with ATP gamma S in the absence of Ca2+. Similarly, brief preincubations of permeabilized cells with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in elevated levels of Ca2+-independent secretion. Secretion of norepinephrine from ATP gamma S-treated cells was ATP-dependent. These results suggest that norepinephrine secretion by PC12 cells is regulated by a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation. Once this phosphorylation has occurred, secretion is still ATP-dependent, but it no longer requires Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1538009901,"The folding of the hormone-specific (beta) subunit of the glycoprotein hormone bovine lutropin was studied after the translation and processing of bovine pituitary mRNA in a system derived from Krebs ascites tumor cells. Of the three forms of beta subunit recognized in this system, only the subunit which had both its prepeptide removed and an oligosaccharide moiety attached formed a tertiary structure which could be immunoprecipitated by an antiserum specific to isolated (folded) lutropin-beta. This glycosylated subunit also combined with added alpha subunit to form the dimeric alpha-beta complex. The results of the translation and processing experiments parallel those of previous experiments in which alpha subunit folding was examined. In contrast to alpha subunit, however, the difficulty of demonstrating correct refolding of beta subunit after reduction and reoxidation of its disulfide bonds strongly suggests that the formation of its correct tertiary structure not only requires carbohydrate attached to the peptide chain but also must occur during formation of the nascent beta chain."
https://openalex.org/W1644840942,"We have isolated a monoclonal antibody against Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) that recognizes the functional domain specified by the ssb-113 temperature-sensitive mutation, a domain which is distinct from the DNA-binding site. Although the ssb-113 and ssb-1 mutations result in many similar phenotypic defects, they differ significantly in others, indicating that they affect different functional domains of the protein. Whereas the SSB-1 mutant protein is clearly defective in tetramer formation and is also unable to bind single-stranded DNA at nonpermissive temperatures, no similar in vitro defects have yet been found in the SSB-113 mutant protein. In fact, the only reported in vitro effect of the ssb-113 mutation on the protein is a slight increase in its helix destabilizing ability. Competition radioimmunoassays using a monoclonal antibody demonstrated that SSB-113 mutant protein, containing a single amino acid substitution at position 176 (the penultimate residue), did not compete with SSB while SSB-1 protein (with a single change at position 55) did compete with SSB. This analysis was refined by studies with a proteolysis fragment and with peptides derived from both SSB and SSB-113. The results indicate that the antibody recognizes a determinant near the COOH-terminal end of the protein and that the SSB-113 mutation lies within or very close to this determinant."
