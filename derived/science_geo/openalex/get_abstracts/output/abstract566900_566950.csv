Thus, RBPs perform unexpectedly broad roles at the active zone that together with those of RIMs are essential for all active zone functions.

Thus, RBPs perform unexpectedly broad roles at the active zone that together with those of RIMs are essential for all active zone functions. In a presynaptic terminal, active zones are assembled at the plasma membrane opposing the synaptic cleft. Presynaptic active zones organize the neurotransmitter release machinery by performing four key functions: tethering vesicles at release sites, priming vesicles for rapid Ca2+-triggered fusion, localizing Ca2+ channels adjacent to release sites, and coordinating trans-synaptic signaling for precise alignment of pre- and postsynaptic elements (Südhof, 2012Südhof T.C. The presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2012; 75: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, how active zones form and function remains incompletely understood. Early electron microscopy (EM) studies of brain tissue stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) showed that active zones contain a grid of pyramid-shaped dense projections with intercalated synaptic vesicles (Bloom and Aghajanian, 1966Bloom F.E. Aghajanian G.K. Cytochemistry of synapses: selective staining for electron microscopy.Science. 1966; 154: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Gray and Guillery, 1966Gray E.G.

Akert K. Moor H. Sandri C. The fine structure of freeze-fractured presynaptic membranes.J. Neurocytol. 1972; 1: 129-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but the role of the presynaptic dense projections was uncertain. For instance, no clear-cut protein component of dense projections has been identified, no molecular manipulation appears to change their fine structure, and dense projections are only visible in chemically fixed, but not in native, EM samples (Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2010Fernández-Busnadiego R. Zuber B. Maurer U.E. Cyrklaff M. Baumeister W. Lucic V. Quantitative analysis of the native presynaptic cytomatrix by cryoelectron tomography.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As a result, it is unknown whether presynaptic dense projections visualize a normal protein complex that is not visible in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) samples, or whether they represent a chemical fixation artifact. In support of the first hypothesis, high-resolution immunolabeling studies of active zones uncovered a specific arrangement and orientation of the active zone proteins RIMs, piccolo/asczonin, and bassoon, suggesting that the active zone is truly composed of defined protein complexes (Dani et al., 2010Dani A.

USA. 2011; 108: E392-E401Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In support of the second hypothesis, however, no genetic manipulation of an active zone protein has impaired assembly of dense projections, not even manipulations that completely block neurotransmitter release such as deletions of Munc18-1 or Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 (Verhage et al., 2000Verhage M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9037-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), suggesting that dense projections may be a non-specific protein aggregate. Although the structure of active zones thus remains enigmatic, major progress was made in the functional analysis of their components. Biochemical studies suggested that a densely interconnected network of interacting active zone proteins mediates the functions of the active zone (reviewed in Südhof, 2012Südhof T.C. The presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2012; 75: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Specific contributions of active zone proteins to particular functions were shown, including roles for Munc13s in activating the SNARE/SM protein membrane fusion machinery (Ma et al., 2011Ma C. Li W.

Most of these functions are similarly observed in vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting evolutionarily conserved core machinery. However, no manipulation an active zone protein impaired all active zone functions or appeared to alter the structure of their dense projections. RIMs and their eponymous RBPs are multidomain scaffolding proteins that bind directly or indirectly to nearly all other active zone proteins and to Ca2+ channels (Figure 1A; Wang et al., 1997Wang Y.

In mice, deletion of all RIMs only partly impairs vesicle tethering, Ca2+ channel localization, and vesicle priming, and does not alter dense projections (Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L.

Deletion of RBPs, conversely, causes a decrease in coupling of Ca2+ channels to action potentials without affecting any other active zone function (Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C. Liu X. Gonzalez A.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Importantly, deletion of the single RBP gene in Drosophila disrupts the structure of active zones, decreases synaptic vesicle priming, and reduces neurotransmitter release (Liu et al., 2011Liu K.S.

RIM-binding protein links synaptic homeostasis to the stabilization and replenishment of high release probability vesicles.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1056-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, RIMs and RBPs together appear to contribute to all active zone functions, but seem to individually account for only some of these functions. Interestingly, both RIMs (Krumm et al., 2015Krumm N. Turner T.N. Baker C. Vives L. Mohajeri K. Witherspoon K. Raja A. Coe B.P. Stessman H.A. He Z.X. et al.Excess of rare, inherited truncating mutations in autism.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and RBPs (Bucan et al., 2009Bucan M. Abrahams B.S. Wang K. Glessner J.T. Herman E.I. Sonnenblick L.I. Alvarez Retuerto A.I. Imielinski M. Hadley D. Bradfield J.P. et al.Genome-wide analyses of exonic copy number variants in a family-based study point to novel autism susceptibility genes.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000536Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) are implicated in autism, suggesting that the functions of these proteins are rate limiting for cognitive performance in humans. Here, we hypothesized that RIMs and RBPs act redundantly to control multiple active zone functions, and that their functions may have been underestimated when only one of these protein families was deleted (Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To explore this hypothesis, we produced quadruple conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking all neuronal RIMs and RBPs, and analyzed the acute deletion of these proteins in two types of central synapses: calyx of Held synapses in acute slices and hippocampal synapses in culture. Our data suggest that RIMs and RBPs are redundantly essential for all active zone functions. Specifically, we find that deletion of RIMs and RBPs blocks neurotransmitter release, Ca2+ channel recruitment, and vesicle tethering, and additionally disorganizes the alignment of postsynaptic density (PSD) with presynaptic active zones. Moreover, our data show that deletion of RIMs and RBPs together, but not of RIMs or RBPs separately, severely impairs assembly of presynaptic dense projections that are characteristic of active zones. Thus, our results suggest that RIMs and RBPs redundantly constitute central scaffolds from which active zones are constructed. We crossed RIM1/RIM2 double cKO mice (RIM1,2fl mice; Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) with RBP1/RBP2 double cKO mice (RBP1,2fl mice; Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C. Liu X. Gonzalez A. Südhof T.C. RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to generate RIM/RBP quadruple cKO mice (RIMfl/RBPfl mice; Figure S1, available online). The eight “floxed” alleles of quadruple cKO mice were efficiently and faithfully deleted by Cre-recombinase as analyzed by genomic PCRs, allowing conditional deletion of all significantly expressed isoforms of RIMs and RBPs in brain. Thus, this approach made it possible to directly compare the effects of ablating all RIMs and RBPs to the effects of deleting either only RIMs or only RBPs (Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C.

The calyx of Held synapse is arguably the best preparation for quantitative biophysical dissection of synaptic transmission because it affords electrophysiological measurements of both pre- and postsynaptic processes at high resolution (Forsythe, 1994Forsythe I.D.

Pre- and postsynaptic whole-cell recordings in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body of the rat.J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To acutely delete RIMs and RBPs from presynaptic calyx terminals, we stereotactically injected two viruses into the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (aVCN) of newborn RIMfl/RBPfl mice (Figure 1B; Wimmer et al., 2004Wimmer V.C. Nevian T. Kuner T. Targeted in vivo expression of proteins in the calyx of Held.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 449: 319-333PubMed Google Scholar, Soler-Llavina et al., 2011Soler-Llavina G.J. Fuccillo M.V.

USA. 2011; 108: 16502-16509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Specifically, we injected lentiviruses encoding EGFP-tagged wild-type Cre-recombinase (Cre) and Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding channelrhodopsin-P2A-GFP proteins (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). As a control, we injected lentiviruses encoding EGFP-tagged truncated Cre-recombinase (ΔCre; Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and AAVs encoding a YFP-tagged channelrhodopsin variant. These virus combinations permitted unambiguous labeling of calyx terminals via co-expressed fluorescent proteins, and enabled precise activation of control and mutant presynaptic calyx terminals with pulses of blue light via co-expressed channelrhodopsins. We cut acute brainstem slices from 9- to 11-day-old injected mice. Calyx terminals could be readily identified in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of these slices via the co-expressed fluorescent proteins, and were confirmed by immunostaining for synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2; Sun et al., 2007Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. A dual-Ca2+-sensor model for neurotransmitter release in a central synapse.Nature. 2007; 450: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar; Figure 1C). We then patched postsynaptic MNTB neurons and recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) after presynaptic optogenetic activation (Figure 1C). To validate the optogenetic approach, we directly compared spike-mediated EPSCs triggered by optical and electrical stimulation. For this purpose, we monitored release induced by light activation in channelrhodopsin-expressing calices, patch clamped the same group of terminals, and measured release again after triggering presynaptic action potentials with current injections (Figure S2). We observed no major differences in release evoked by optical or electrical stimulation, confirming that our approach reliably monitors spike-triggered release from a calyx terminal (Figure S2). We observed robust synaptic responses in control synapses, but virtually no synaptic responses (<5%) in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses (Figure 1D). The RIM/RBP deletion phenotype appears to be more severe than the sum of the separate phenotypes produced by RIM and RBP deletions (Han et al., 2011Han Y. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Schneggenburger R. RIM determines Ca2+ channel density and vesicle docking at the presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2011; 69: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting a fundamental redundant role for RIMs and RBPs in release. In the previous RIM and RBP deletion studies, however, RIMs or RBPs were deleted early in development, raising the possibility of developmental compensation. Thus, to directly compare the impact of RIM, RBP, and RIM/RBP deletions on release under identical conditions, we stereotactically injected either RIM1,2fl (RIMfl; Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) or RBP1,2fl (RBPfl; Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C. Liu X. Gonzalez A. Südhof T.C. RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) mice with Cre-expressing or control viral vectors as described above, and quantified spike-evoked release. We found that deleting all RIMs reduced transmission by ∼60% (Figure 1E), whereas deleting all RBPs did not significantly reduce transmission (Figure 1F). Importantly, rise-time kinetics were not affected by either of these manipulations, but the trial-to-trial variability (measured as the coefficient of variation, c.v.) of both the EPSC amplitude and the rise time was strongly increased by both manipulations, consistent with a role for RIMs and RBPs in coupling Ca2+ channels to the transmitter release machinery (Figures 1E and 1F; Han et al., 2011Han Y. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Schneggenburger R. RIM determines Ca2+ channel density and vesicle docking at the presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2011; 69: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Direct comparison of release impairments in RIM, RBP, and RIM/RBP mutants revealed statistical significance among all of these groups (Figure S2D). Specifically, combined deletion of RIM/RBP inhibited release significantly more than the sum of the individual deletions, suggesting functional redundancy between these active zone proteins in Ca2+-triggered release (Figures 1D–1F and S2D). The small amount of remaining release in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses could represent a different type of release, or could be due to residual RIM/RBP proteins that had not yet been degraded 10 days after injection of Cre-expressing viruses. To explore this issue, we analyzed the remaining release in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses quantitatively. Close examination of release dynamics during single trials (Figure 1G) revealed synaptic transmission failures and a significant increase in the variability of EPSC time-to-peak delays and rise times that likely resulted from highly variable synaptic delays and strongly asynchronous multiquantal release (Figures 1G and 1H). Quantification of EPSC parameters showed that EPSCs in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses had similar averaged rise-time kinetics but significantly shorter EPSC decay times and half-widths (Figures 1G–1I). Moreover, synaptic transmission success percentages, which are 100% for wild-type synapses, declined dramatically after deletion of RIMs and RBPs, with half of all synapses exhibiting transmission failures (Figure 1I). The dramatic changes in transmitter release dynamics in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses could be caused not only by impaired coupling of presynaptic Ca2+ influx to release (Han et al., 2011Han Y. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Schneggenburger R. RIM determines Ca2+ channel density and vesicle docking at the presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2011; 69: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but also by a strongly reduced release probability of the mutant synapses. When the release probability is strongly reduced, the remaining evoked responses display properties that approximate those of single quanta of release, with much faster apparent kinetics (Isaacson and Walmsley, 1995Isaacson J.S. Walmsley B. Counting quanta: direct measurements of transmitter release at a central synapse.Neuron. 1995; 15: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We thus directly compared the properties of spontaneous (quantal) and evoked EPSCs during single trials in individual RIM/RBP-deficient synapses (Figures 1J and 1K). These trials confirmed that removal of RIM/RBPs caused strong asynchrony in the timing of evoked responses and often produced transmission failures. Due to the good signal-to-noise ratio (quantal responses at the calyx are ∼40 pA!), strong asynchrony, and fast EPSC kinetics, evoked single quanta responses could be frequently and easily distinguished from currents that resulted from multiquantal release (Figure 1J, arrowheads). Direct comparison of the amplitude, rise, decay, and half-width of spontaneous and evoked quantal currents in individual synapses revealed no significant differences between spontaneous and evoked quantal responses (Figure 1K). Together, these results indicate that removal of RIMs and RBPs so strongly decreased the release probability that the recorded EPSCs essentially represent single-vesicle exocytosis events, accounting at least in part for the changes in release dynamics. Moreover, these observations suggest that the little remaining release in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses exhibits properties that would be expected if a subset of synapses contained some residual RIM proteins and RBPs (Han et al., 2011Han Y.

RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which may be predicted if one considers that recordings were made only ∼10 days after viral injections. Finally, it should be noted that better voltage clamping of smaller EPSCs in mutant synapses could also make a minor contribution to the faster apparent EPSC kinetics of these synapses. To further characterize neurotransmitter release in RIM/RBP-deficient calyx synapses, we stereotactically injected into the aVCN of RIMfl/RBPfl mice Cre- or ΔCre-expressing lentiviruses and EGFP-expressing AAVs, which allow full imaging of calyx terminals. We used confocal microscopy for three-dimensional reconstruction of individual calyx terminals, but detected no differences in the size or surface area between control and RIM/RBP-deficient terminals (Figures 2A and 2B ). We then asked whether the block of release in RIM/RBP-deficient synapses is due to impairments in Ca2+ triggering of release and/or vesicle priming for release. To address this question, we monitored the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles using dual pre- and postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings in calyx synapses (Figure 2C). We depolarized nerve terminals from −80 to 0 mV for 50 ms, which causes maximal opening of presynaptic Ca2+ channels and evokes release of all primed synaptic vesicles from a calyx terminal (Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C. Liu X. Gonzalez A. Südhof T.C. RIM-BPs mediate tight coupling of action potentials to Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2015; 87: 1234-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). During these experiments, we monitored presynaptic Ca2+ currents via the presynaptic patch pipette and transmitter release as EPSCs via the postsynaptic patch pipette (Figure 2D). EPSCs were recorded in 1 mM γ-DGG and 0.1 mM cyclothiazide to reduce glutamate receptor saturation and desensitization, respectively. In wild-type terminals, presynaptic depolarization triggered large presynaptic Ca2+ currents (∼1.7 nA) and robust postsynaptic EPSCs (∼24 nA). In RIM/RBP-deficient terminals, Ca2+ currents were largely inhibited, but not eliminated (∼0.5 nA), and the EPSCs were nearly abolished (<0.5 nA; Figure 2D). Quantifications of EPSCs revealed a >97% reduction in RRP size. Release of the tiny remaining RRP was delayed and slowed down (Figure 2E). Deconvolution of the EPSCs (Su"
https://openalex.org/W2513655066,"In a nerve terminal, synaptic vesicle docking and release are restricted to an active zone. The active zone is a protein scaffold that is attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane and opposed to postsynaptic receptors. Here, we generated conditional knockout mice removing the active zone proteins RIM and ELKS, which additionally led to loss of Munc13, Bassoon, Piccolo, and RIM-BP, indicating disassembly of the active zone. We observed a near-complete lack of synaptic vesicle docking and a strong reduction in vesicular release probability and the speed of exocytosis, but total vesicle numbers, SNARE protein levels, and postsynaptic densities remained unaffected. Despite loss of the priming proteins Munc13 and RIM and of docked vesicles, a pool of releasable vesicles remained. Thus, the active zone is necessary for synaptic vesicle docking and to enhance release probability, but releasable vesicles can be localized distant from the presynaptic plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2508396692,"Variance analysis of postsynaptic current amplitudes suggests the presence of distinct docking sites (also called release sites) where vesicles pause before exocytosis. Docked vesicles participate in the readily releasable pool (RRP), but the relation between docking site number and RRP size remains unclear. It is also unclear whether all vesicles of the RRP are equally release competent, and what cellular mechanisms underlie RRP renewal. We address here these questions at single glutamatergic synapses, counting released vesicles using deconvolution. We find a remarkably low variance of cumulative vesicle counts during action potential trains. This, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, indicates that vesicles transit through two successive states before exocytosis, so that the RRP is up to 2-fold higher than the docking site number. The transition to the second state has a very rapid rate constant, and is specifically inhibited by latrunculin B and blebbistatin, suggesting the involvement of actin and myosin."
https://openalex.org/W2515160436,"Different individuals exhibit distinct behaviors, but studying the neuronal basis of individuality is a daunting challenge. Here, we considered this question in the vomeronasal organ, a pheromone-detecting epithelium containing hundreds of distinct neuronal types. Using light-sheet microscopy, we characterized in each animal the abundance of 17 physiologically defined types, altogether recording from half a million sensory neurons. Inter-animal differences were much larger than predicted by chance, and different physiological cell types showed distinct patterns of variability. One neuronal type was present in males and nearly absent in females. Surprisingly, this apparent sexual dimorphism was generated by plasticity, as exposure to female scents or single ligands led to both the elimination of this cell type and alterations in olfactory behavior. That an all-or-none apparent sex difference in neuronal types is controlled by experience-even in a sensory system devoted to ""innate"" behaviors-highlights the extraordinary role of ""nurture"" in neural individuality."

In addition, we assessed the prevalence of IgG antibodies against spotted fever group (SFGR) and typhus group (TGR) rickettsiae in opossum sera. Of the 597 flea specimens collected from opossums and cats, 37.2% tested positive for Rickettsia. PCR and sequencing of rickettsial genes obtained from C. felis flea DNA preparations revealed the presence of R. typhi (1.3%), R. felis (28.0%) and R. felis-like organisms (7.5%). Sera from opossums contained TGR-specific (40.84%), but not SFGR-specific antibodies. The detection of R. felis and R. typhi in the C. felis fleas in Orange County highlights the potential risk for human infection with either of these pathogens, and underscores the need for further investigations incorporating specimens from humans, animal hosts, and invertebrate vectors in endemic areas. Such studies will be essential for establishing a link in the ongoing flea-borne rickettsioses outbreaks."

Three images were acquired in one visit and 1 image 3 months later.PAFD image quality for all images necessary to calculate reproducibility was sufficient to analysis only in 18 of the 83 participants (21.7%) who were successfully imaged for RNFLT. Intrasession coefficient of variation (CV) ranged between 2.30 and 3.89%, and 3.51 and 5.12% for the peripapillary sectors in the ONH and RPC layers, respectively. The corresponding between-visit CV values ranged between 3.05 and 4.26%, and 4.99 and 6.90%, respectively. Intrasession SD did not correlate with the corresponding RNFLT in any sector in either layer (P≥0.170). In the ONH layer sector PAFD values did not correlate with the corresponding RNFLT values (P≥0.100). In contrast, in the RPC layer a significant positive correlation between the corresponding sector PAFD and RNFLT values was found for all but one peripapillary sectors (Pearson-r range: 0.652 to 0.771, P≤0.0046).Though in several patients routine use of PAFD measurement may be limited by suboptimal image quality, in the successfully imaged cases (21.7% of the study eyes in the current investigation) reproducibility of sector PAFD values seems to be sufficient for clinical research. In stable patients intrasession variability explains most of the between-visit variability. Sector PAFD variability is independent from sector RNFLT, a marker of glaucoma severity. In the RPC layer sector PAFD and RNFLT show strong to very strong positive correlation."
https://openalex.org/W2514615766,"Background The prognostic significance of sarcopenia, an important component of cancer cachexia, has been demonstrated in oncologic patients. Catabolic drivers have been suggested to be key features of cancer cachexia. Objective To determine the relationship between systemic inflammatory markers and CT-determined muscle mass in patients with SCLC. Methods Cross-sectional muscle areas were evaluated at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) using baseline CT images in 186 SCLC patients. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 muscle index (L3MI, muscle area at L3/height2) of < 55 cm2/m2 for men and of < 39 cm2/m2 for women. Systemic inflammatory markers investigated included serum white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and albumin. Results Mean L3MI was 47.9 ± 9.7 cm2/m2 for men and 41.6 ± 7.0 cm2/m2 for women. Sarcopenia was present in 128 patients (68.8%), and sarcopenic patients had significant serum lymphocyte counts and albumin levels (p = 0.002 and 0.041, respectively), and higher NLRs and CRP levels (p = 0.011 and 0.026) than non-sarcopenic patients. Multivariable analysis revealed that CRP independently predicted L3MI (β = -0.208; 95% CI, -0.415 to -0.002; p = 0.048), along with gender and BMI (p values < 0.001) and performance status (p = 0.010). Conclusion The present study confirms a significant linear relationship exists between CT-determined muscle mass and CRP in SCLC patients. This association might provide a better understanding of the mechanism of cancer cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W2511852445,"This study evaluated phenotypic (rph) and genetic correlations (rg) between 8 feed efficiency traits and other traits of economic interest including weight at selection (WS), loin-eye area (LEA), backfat thickness (BF), and rump fat thickness (RF) in Nellore cattle. Feed efficiency traits were gain:feed, residual feed intake (RFI), residual feed intake adjusted for backfat thickness (RFIb) and for backfat and rump fat thickness (RFIsf), residual body weight gain (RG), residual intake and body weight gain (RIG), and residual intake and body weight gain using RFIb (RIGb) and RFIsf (RIGsf). The variance components were estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood method using a two-trait animal model. The heritability estimates (h2) were 0.14, 0.24, 0.20, 0.22, 0.19, 0.15, 0.11 and 0.11 for gain:feed, RFI, RFIb, RFIsf, RG, RIG, RIGb and RIGsf, respectively. All rph values between traits were close to zero, except for the correlation of feed efficiency traits with dry matter intake and average daily gain. High rg values were observed for the correlation of dry matter intake, average daily gain and metabolic weight with WS and hip height (>0.61) and low to medium values (0.15 to 0.48) with the carcass traits (LEA, BF, RF). Among the feed efficiency traits, RG showed the highest rg with WS and hip height (0.34 and 0.25) and the lowest rg with subcutaneous fat thickness (-0.17 to 0.18). The rg values of RFI, RFIb and RFIsf with WS (0.17, 0.23 and 0.22), BF (0.37, 0.33 and 0.33) and RF (0.30, 0.31 and 0.32) were unfavorable. The rg values of gain:feed, RIG, RIGb and RIGsf with WS were low and favorable (0.07 to 0.22), while medium and unfavorable (-0.22 to -0.45) correlations were observed with fat thickness. The inclusion of subcutaneous fat thickness in the models used to calculate RFI did not reduce the rg between these traits. Selecting animals for higher feed efficiency will result in little or no genetic change in growth and will decrease subcutaneous fat thickness in the carcass."
https://openalex.org/W2518217842,"Dendritic voltage integration determines the transformation of synaptic inputs into output firing, while synaptic calcium integration drives plasticity mechanisms thought to underlie memory storage. Dendritic calcium integration has been shown to follow the same synaptic input-output relationship as dendritic voltage, but whether similar operations apply to neurons exhibiting sublinear voltage integration is unknown. We examined the properties and cellular mechanisms of these dendritic operations in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons using dendritic voltage and calcium imaging, in combination with synaptic stimulation or glutamate uncaging. We show that, while synaptic potentials summate sublinearly, concomitant dendritic calcium signals summate either linearly or supralinearly depending on the number of synapses activated. The supralinear dendritic calcium triggers a branch-specific, short-term suppression of neurotransmitter release that alters the pattern of synaptic activation. Thus, differential voltage and calcium integration permits dynamic regulation of neuronal input-output transformations without altering intrinsic nonlinear integration mechanisms."

This study aims to examine the relationship between persistently high C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, and the incidence of CKD in RA.We retrospectively examined the relationship between the levels of CRP and incidence of CKD in 345 RA patients. The outcome of interest was incidence of CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or positive dipstick testing for proteinuria for ≥3 months. We defined high CRP, as >3.0 mg/L. On the basis of three measurements of CRP for 6-months period, patients were divided into three groups: group 1, including patients with no high CRP values; group 2, patients with transient high CRP values (once or twice) and group 3, patients with persistently high CRP values.During a median follow-up period of 89 months, 14% of all patients developed CKD. The cumulative incidence of CKD was 7% in group 1, 14% in group 2 and 22% in group 3 (P = 0.008, log-rank test). In a multivariate analysis, including classical risk factors for CKD, persistently high CRP was an independent predictor of the incidence of CKD (hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.53; P = 0.01).Persistently high CRP was a significant risk factor for the incidence of CKD. Results suggest that persistent inflammation is a marker for the high risk of CKD in RA."

Donor milk is currently processed by Holder pasteurization, producing a microbiologically safe product but significantly reducing immunoprotective components. Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation at 254 nm is being investigated as an alternative treatment method and has been shown to preserve components such as lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory IgA considerably better than Holder pasteurization. We describe the inactivation of cytomegalovirus, a virus commonly excreted into breast milk, using UV-C irradiation. Full replication was ablated by various treatment doses. However, evidence of viral immediate early proteins within the cells was never completely eliminated indicating that some viral gene transcription was still occurring. In conclusion, UV-C may be a safe alternative to pasteurisation for the treatment of human donor milk that preserves the bioactivity. However, our data suggests that CMV inactivation will have to be carefully evaluated for each device designed to treat breast milk using UV-C irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2510163456,"The widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant (HR) Kochia scoparia is an increasing concern for growers in the US Great Plains and Canada. K. scoparia populations resistant to dicamba have been reported in six US states. Populations cross-resistant to dicamba and fluroxypyr have been reported from wheat fields in Montana, USA. It is unclear whether resistance to the auxinic herbicides (dicamba and/or fluroxypyr), can alter the fitness traits of K. scoparia. The objectives of this research were to compare the germination dynamics in response to thermal environment, vegetative growth and fecundity characteristics, and the relative competitive ability of dicamba-fluroxypyr–susceptible (S) vs.–resistant (R) K. scoparia selected from within a single segregating population (collected from wheat-fallow field in MT). S and R selected lines were developed after three generations of recurrent group selection. Compared to the S selected line, the R selected line had lower cumulative germination at all constant temperatures except 25°C, and at all alternating temperatures except 30/35°C. Also, the R selected line had delayed germination relative to the S selected line. The R had lower plant height, plant width, primary branches, total leaf area, stem diameter, and shoot dry weight compared with the S plants in the absence of competition. The reduction in seed production per plant resulted in a 39% fitness cost. The 1000-seed weight of R (1.6 g) was also less than that of S (2.6 g). When grown in an intraspecific competition at different mixture proportions, replacement series indices for the growth parameters further indicated that the R was less competitive than the S. Evident from this research, the dicamba-fluroxypyr–resistant R selected line is less likely to persist in a field population in the absence of the auxinic herbicides."

Reasoning that targeted transgene integration occurs through the capture of transforming DNA by the homology-dependent pathway for DNA double-strand break (DNA-DSB) repair, we analysed the genome-wide transcriptomic response to bleomycin-induced DNA damage and generated mutants in candidate DNA repair genes. Massively parallel (Illumina) cDNA sequencing identified potential participants in gene targeting. Transcripts encoding DNA repair proteins active in multiple repair pathways were significantly up-regulated. These included Rad51, CtIP, DNA ligase 1, Replication protein A and ATR in homology-dependent repair, Xrcc4, DNA ligase 4, Ku70 and Ku80 in non-homologous end-joining and Rad1, Tebichi/polymerase theta, PARP in microhomology-mediated end-joining. Differentially regulated cell-cycle components included up-regulated Rad9 and Hus1 DNA-damage-related checkpoint proteins and down-regulated D-type cyclins and B-type CDKs, commensurate with the imposition of a checkpoint at G2 of the cell cycle characteristic of homology-dependent DNA-DSB repair. Candidate genes, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling helicases associated with repair and recombination, were knocked out and analysed for growth defects, hypersensitivity to DNA damage and reduced GT efficiency. Targeted knockout of PpCtIP, a cell-cycle activated mediator of homology-dependent DSB resection, resulted in bleomycin-hypersensitivity and greatly reduced GT efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2518595940,"Background In our previous study, we found significant differences in the mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) levels among hypertensive patients with different degrees of vascular endothelial cells damage. These differences were closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins. Moreover, compared to the control group, the expression of transcription factor activating factor 4 (ATF4) was also found to be significantly different in the hypertensive patients with different degrees of vascular endothelial cells damage groups. These results were confirmed using gene prediction software, which showed synergistic effects between ATF4 and miR-1283. ATF4 is a key molecule in ERS. Three ERS pathways exist:protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1)-induced apoptosis. The PERK pathway is the most important and also includes the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and ATF4. In this report, we studied the regulatory effects of miR-1283 and ATF4 on the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. Methodology/Principal Findings We verified the relationship between miR-1283 and ATF4 using a luciferase activity assay and observed the regulatory effects of miR-1283 and ATF4 on the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions/Significance ATF4 is a target gene of miR-1283, which regulates the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathway by inhibiting ATF4, and it plays a critical role in inducing injury in HUVECs and mouse heart tissue."

Here, we argue that the use of design strategies based on combining ultrasensitive response dynamics with negative feedback represents a natural approach to this problem that fully exploits the strongly nonlinear nature of cellular information processing. We propose that such feedback mechanisms can explain the adaptive responses observed in one of the most widely studied biomolecular feedback systems—the yeast osmoregulatory response network. Based on our analysis of such system, we identify strong links with a well-known branch of mathematical systems theory from the field of Control Engineering, known as Sliding Mode Control. These insights allow us to develop design guidelines that can inform the construction of feedback controllers for synthetic biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2512124241,"Background Dysfunctional fear responses play a central role in many mental disorders. New insights in learning and memory suggest that pharmacological and behavioural interventions during the reconsolidation of reactivated fear memories may increase the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. It has been proposed that interventions applied during reconsolidation may modify the original fear memory, and thus prevent the spontaneous recovery and reinstatement of the fear response. Methods We investigated whether pharmacological (propranolol) and behavioural (reappraisal, multisensory stimulation) interventions reduce fear memory, and prevent reinstatement of fear in comparison to a placebo control group. Eighty healthy female subjects underwent a differential fear conditioning procedure with three stimuli (CS). Two of these (CS+) were paired with an electric shock on day 1. On day 2, 20 subjects were pseudo-randomly assigned to either the propranolol or placebo condition, or underwent one of the two behavioural interventions after one of the two CS+ was reactivated. On day 3, all subjects underwent an extinction phase, followed by a reinstatement test. Dependent variables were US expectancy ratings, fear-potentiated startle, and skin conductance response. Results Differential fear responses to the reactivated and non-reactivated CS+ were observed only in the propranolol condition. Here, the non-reactivated CS+ evoked stronger fear-potentiated startle-responses compared to the placebo group. None of the interventions prevented the return of the extinguished fear response after re-exposure to the unconditioned stimulus. Conclusions Our data are in line with an increasing body of research stating that the occurrence of reconsolidation may be constrained by boundary conditions such as subtle differences in experimental manipulations and instructions. In conclusion, our findings do not support a beneficial effect in using reconsolidation processes to enhance effects of psychotherapeutic interventions. This implies that more research is required before therapeutic interventions may benefit from a combination with reconsolidation processes."

We aimed to assess the activity, users and content of the online discussion, #KidneyStones, on Twitter. Methods We investigated the Symplur Signals analytics tool for Twitter data distributed via the #KidneyStones hashtag over a one year period. Activity analysis reflected overall activity and tweet enhancements. We assessed users’ geolocations and performed an influencer analysis. Content analysis included the most frequently used words, tweet sentiment and shares for top tweets. Results 3,426 users generated over 10,333 tweets, which were frequently accompanied by links (49%), mentions (30%) and photos (13%). Users came from 106 countries across the globe and were most frequently from North America (63%) and Europe (16%). Individual and organisational healthcare professionals made up 56% of the influencers of the Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones. Besides the words ‘kidney’ (used 4,045 times) and ‘stones’ (3,335), ‘pain’ (1,233), ‘urine’ (1,158), and ‘risk’ (1,023) were the most frequently used words. 56% of tweets had a positive sentiment.

Design and Participants A pilot case-control study between March 2006 and June 2009 of patients referred on discharge to a multidisciplinary, integrated outpatient model of care that includes outpatient follow-up, timely GP communication and dial-in service compared with usual care following discharge, within a metropolitan, tertiary referral, public teaching hospital. Controls were matched in a 4:1 ratio with cases for age, gender, index admission diagnosis and length of stay. Main outcome measures Non-elective readmission rates, total readmission length of stay and overall survival. Results A total of 252 cases and 1008 control patients were included in the study. Despite the patients referred to the multidisciplinary model of care had slightly more comorbid conditions, significantly higher total length of hospital stay in the previous 12 months and increased prevalence of diabetes and heart failure by comparison to those who received usual care, they had significantly improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.70 95% CI 0.51–0.96, p = 0.029) and no excess in the number of hospitalisations observed. Conclusion Following discharge from hospital, holistic multidisciplinary outpatient management is associated with improved survival in older patients with multimorbidity.

Approximately one-third of MB patients succumb to treatment failure and some survivors suffer detrimental side effects. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore new therapeutic regimens to overcome chemotherapeutic agent resistance or reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity.We detected the expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in MB and CD133+ MB cell lines and MB tissues using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining. The antitumor effects of inhibitors against IAPs on MB or CD133+ MB cells were evaluated by MTT assay, Annexin V/PI analysis, and caspase-3/7 activity. Autophagy was assessed by the conversion of light chain (LC) 3-I to LC3-II and Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit.MB cells showed higher expression of IAPs compared to normal astrocytes and normal brain tissues. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents combined with small-molecule IAP inhibitors (LCL161 or LBW242) showed a synergistic effect in MB cells. Combined treatments triggered apoptosis in MB cells through activation of caspase-3/7 and autophagic flux simultaneously. In addition, we found that CD133+ MB cells with features of cancer stem cells displayed higher levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2 (cIAP1/2), and were hypersensitive to treatment with IAP inhibitors.These results shed light on the biological effects of combination therapy on MB cells and illustrate that IAP inhibitors are more effective for CD133+ stem-like MB cells."
https://openalex.org/W2511923635,"As tantalizing as the idea that background music beneficially affects foreign vocabulary learning may seem, there is-partly due to a lack of theory-driven research-no consistent evidence to support this notion. We investigated inter-individual differences in the effects of background music on foreign vocabulary learning. Based on Eysenck's theory of personality we predicted that individuals with a high level of cortical arousal should perform worse when learning with background music compared to silence, whereas individuals with a low level of cortical arousal should be unaffected by background music or benefit from it. Participants were tested in a paired-associate learning paradigm consisting of three immediate word recall tasks, as well as a delayed recall task one week later. Baseline cortical arousal assessed with spontaneous EEG measurement in silence prior to the learning rounds was used for the analyses. Results revealed no interaction between cortical arousal and the learning condition (background music vs. silence). Instead, we found an unexpected main effect of cortical arousal in the beta band on recall, indicating that individuals with high beta power learned more vocabulary than those with low beta power. To substantiate this finding we conducted an exact replication of the experiment. Whereas the main effect of cortical arousal was only present in a subsample of participants, a beneficial main effect of background music appeared. A combined analysis of both experiments suggests that beta power predicts the performance in the word recall task, but that there is no effect of background music on foreign vocabulary learning. In light of these findings, we discuss whether searching for effects of background music on foreign vocabulary learning, independent of factors such as inter-individual differences and task complexity, might be a red herring. Importantly, our findings emphasize the need for sufficiently powered research designs and exact replications of theory-driven experiments when investigating effects of background music and inter-individual variation on task performance."

Previous studies have revealed that overexpression of PLAGL2 is associated with many human cancers. However, it has been reported that PLAGL2 also plays as a tumor suppressor. The precise role of PLAGL2 in prostate cancer (PCa) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of PLAGL2 in PCa. Data from microarray datasets demonstrated that the DNA copy number and mRNA level of PLAGL2 were significantly increased in PCa compared with normal prostate. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis from paired PCa samples and prostate cell lines confirmed upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels in PCa. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that staining of PLAGL2 in PCa tissues was significantly higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. In addition, the high expression of PLAGL2 was only involved in preoperative PSA, but was not related to age, Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin status, clinical stage and positive lymph node metastasis. Moreover, our results showed that PLAGL2 was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) of PCa patients, and overexpressed PLAGL2 was related to early development of BCR and poor OS. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PLAGL2 is overexpressed in PCa. The increased expression of PLAGL2 correlates to PCa progression following radical prostatectomy and may serve as a novel poor prognostic marker for PCa."

Methods HMGB1 levels were measured in sera from 34 patients with PM/DM and from 34 healthy controls by ELISA. Results Significantly higher serum levels of HMGB1 were found in patients with PM [12.75 ng/ml (4.34–25.07 ng/ml), p < 0.001] and DM [20.75 ng/ml (3.80–124.88 ng/ml), p < 0.001] than in healthy controls [5.64 ng/ml (2.71–8.71 ng/ml)]. Importantly, the average HMGB1 level in PM/DM patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was 25.84 ng/ml, which is significantly higher than that in PM/DM patients without ILD [12.68 ng/ml] (p < 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the serum HMGB1 cutoff value that best discriminated PM/DM patients with ILD from those without ILD was 14.5ng/ml. The area under the curve was 0.87±0.05, and the 95% Confidence interval (CI) was 0.77–0.98. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this serum HMGB1 cutoff level was 84.6% and 89% respectively. Patients with higher levels of HMGB1 expression had lower overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates, whereas patients with lower levels of HMGB1 expression had higher survival rates. Conclusion Multivariate analysis showed that HMGB1 expression is a prognostic indicator for patient survival.

Moreover, the efficacy of a topical allicin cream was examined in BALB/c (Bagg albino, laboratory-bred strain of the House Mouse) mice with cutaneous leishmanial lesions compared to the currently used drug, sodiumstibogluconate (pentostam).Cytotoxiciy and promastigote proliferation were measured. Different concentrations (50, 100, 150, and 200 μM) of liquid allicin were tested on L. major promastigotes twice: after 24 and 48 hours using an MTT colorimetric assay. In the in vivo condition, the efficacies of allicin cream and liquid allicin at two concentrations (0.15 μM/mouse and 0.30 μM/mouse) were evaluated. Serum factors of the control and treated groups were tested to evaluate the toxic effects of allicin on the liver and kidney.Allicin at a concentration of 50 μM inhibited the growth of Leishmania promastigotes. Topical application of allicin cream reduced lesion sizes in mice. No significant differences in biochemical analysis were observed between the control and treated groups.Allicin has antileishmanial effects under in vitro and in vivo conditions and may be used in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2515972532,"Aim To examine whether elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms are related to all-cause mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes, not using insulin. Methods 948 participants in the community-wide Nord-Trøndelag Health Survey conducted during 1995–97 completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale with subscales of anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Elevated symptoms were defined as HADS-A or HADS-D ≥8. Participants with type 2 diabetes, not using insulin, were followed until November 21, 2012 or death. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate associations between baseline elevated anxiety symptoms, elevated depressive symptoms and mortality, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, HbA1c, cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications. Results At baseline, 8% (n = 77/948) reported elevated anxiety symptoms, 9% (n = 87/948) elevated depressive symptoms and 10% (n = 93/948) reported both. After a mean follow-up of 12 years (SD 5.1, range 0–17), 541 participants (57%) had died. Participants with elevated anxiety symptoms only had a decreased mortality risk (unadjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.96). Adjustment for HbA1c attenuated this relation (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50–1.07). Those with elevated depression symptoms alone had an increased mortality risk (fully adjusted model HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05–1.84). Having both elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms was not associated with increased mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96–1.74). Conclusions Elevated depressive symptoms were associated with excess mortality risk in people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin. No significant association with mortality was found among people with elevated anxiety symptoms. Having both elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms was not associated with mortality. The hypothesis that elevated levels of anxiety symptoms leads to behavior that counteracts the adverse health effects of Type 2 diabetes needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2517192199,"The benchmark dose (BMD) method has been increasingly used to assess the health risks of cadmium (Cd) in epidemiological studies. The aim of our study was to estimate the threshold levels of urinary Cd (UCd) using the BMD method in a general population of Jiangshan City, Zhejiang Province of China. In our study, a total of 934 people (469 men, 465 women) were recruited and morning urine samples were collected from all the participants. Levels of Cd, creatinine, and renal dysfunction indicators such as retinol binding protein (RBP), β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), and N-acetyl-b-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine were detected for analysis of BMD and BMD low (BMDL) of UCd. RBP, β2-MG, and NAG in urine all correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with UCd except of age (P = 0.767). When the benchmark response (BMR) was 5%, the BMD/BMDL of UCd for RBP, β2-MG, and NAG was 1.69/ 0.89, 1.24/0.62, 0.85/0.49 μg/g Cr in men and 1.70/0.76, 1.35/0.64, 1.36/0.65 μg/g Cr in women, respectively. If the BMR was set at 10%, the BMD/BMDL of UCd for RBP, β2-MG, and NAG was 2.44/1.59, 2.09/1.30, 1.80/1.04 μg/g Cr in men and 2.43/1.53, 2.10/1.34, 2.31/1.37 μg/g Cr in women, respectively. Our results provided evidence for Cd-induced tubular effects in cadmium non-polluted areas in China. Both β2-MG and NAG were more sensitive than RBP in response to Cd exposure.

These data were merged with the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry to identify ESRD patients. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause ESRD as well as for cause-specific ESRD due to the following primary renal diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), vascular nephropathy (VN), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and other diseases (OD).During a mean follow-up of 17.5 years 403 participants developed ESRD (ADPKD 36, VN 97, DN 86, and OD 184). All parameters except TG and GGT were significantly associated with all-cause ESRD risk. Particular cause-specific ESRD risk factor patterns were found: for ADPKD increased risk from hypertension (HR 11.55); for VN from smoking (HR 1.81), hypertension (HR 2.37), TG (≥5.70 vs. <1.17 mmol/L: HR 9.27); for DN from smoking (HR 1.77), BMI (≥30 vs. 18.5-24.9 kg/m2: HR 7.55), FBG (≥6.94 vs. <5.55 mmol/L: HR 7.67), hypertension (HR 1.08), TG (≥5.70 vs. <1.17 mmol/L: HR 2.02), GGT (HR 2.14); and for OD from hypertension (HR 2.29), TG (≥5.70 vs. <1.17 mmol/L: HR 6.99) and TC (≥6.22 vs. <5.18 mmol/L: HR 1.56).Particular anthropometric and metabolic ESRD risk factors differ in importance depending on the primary renal disease.

https://openalex.org/W2515648256,"Many signals of natural selection have been identified in the human genome. However, except for some single-locus mechanisms, most molecular processes generating these adaptation signals are still unknown. We developed an approach that integrates datasets related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with information about systems biology and genetic signatures of natural selection to identify evidence of polygenic adaptation. Specifically, we focused on five anthropometric measurements: body mass index (BMI), height, waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHR), and waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WC), and sex differences for WHR and WC. We performed an enrichment analysis for signals of natural selection in protein interaction networks associated with anthropometric traits in European populations. The adaptation signals-enriched gene networks associated highlighted epistatic interactions in the context of polygenic selection for the investigated traits. These polygenic mechanisms indicated intriguing selective mechanisms related to the anthropometric traits: adult locomotory behavior for BMI, infection resistance for height, interplay between lipid transport and immune systems for WHR, and female-specific polygenic adaptation for WHR and WC. In conclusion, we observed evidence of polygenic adaptation in the context of systems genetics of anthropometric traits that indicates polygenic mechanisms related to the natural selection in European populations."
https://openalex.org/W2518048939,"Background Salt, protein, acid precursors, and fluid intake have been identified as factors that influence cyst growth in ADPKD. Unfortunately, the feasibility of following these dietary restrictions/enhancements from a patient’s point-of-view has yet to be studied. The purpose of this study is to understand better the experiences of patients following a relatively complex dietary prescription targeting these factors. Methods Twelve adults with ADPKD and kidney function >30ml/min/1.73m2 were recruited from the University of Kansas Medical Center Polycystic Kidney Disease clinic. In a qualitative design, semi-structured interviews of participants were conducted following a four week dietary intervention (experimental diet lower in sodium, protein, and acid precursors, and supplemented with water) either face-to-face or by telephone. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and checked for accuracy. Transcripts were analyzed thematically for emerging themes. Results Participants reported that eating less meat and more fruits and vegetables were the easiest components of the diet, whereas reaching the daily goal amount of fruits and vegetables and tracking the diet constantly were the most difficult components. Participants had little difficulty with fluid intake and reported the prescribed fluid goal as achievable. The tracking system for fruits and vegetables and protein was reported to be both helpful and intuitive, but tracking their intake on paper was tedious. Eating out was the most significant barrier to following the diet with some individuals avoiding restaurants in order to comply with the dietary prescription. Conclusion Participants on the experimental diet heightened their awareness of the consumption of dietary salt, protein, acid precursors, and fluid intake. Additionally, most participants believed adherence to the prescribed diet was feasible. However, participants wanted less cumbersome ways to track and monitor the diet, especially given that the prescribed diet is designed for lifelong adherence. Future studies should focus on targeting these specific dietary factors in larger groups of more ethnically and culturally diverse populations to help inform clinicians and how best to help diverse populations adhere to the dietary intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2515946202,"Post-vaccine monitoring programs for human papillomavirus (HPV) have been introduced in many countries, but HPV serology is still an underutilized tool, partly owing to the weak antibody response to HPV infection. Changes in antibody levels among non-vaccinated individuals could be employed to monitor herd effects of immunization against HPV vaccine types 16 and 18, but inference requires an appropriate statistical model. The authors developed a four-component bivariate mixture model for jointly estimating vaccine-type seroprevalence from correlated antibody responses against HPV16 and -18 infections. This model takes account of the correlation between HPV16 and -18 antibody concentrations within subjects, caused e.g. by heterogeneity in exposure level and immune response. The model was fitted to HPV16 and -18 antibody concentrations as measured by a multiplex immunoassay in a large serological survey (3,875 females) carried out in the Netherlands in 2006/2007, before the introduction of mass immunization. Parameters were estimated by Bayesian analysis. We used the deviance information criterion for model selection; performance of the preferred model was assessed through simulation. Our analysis uncovered elevated antibody concentrations in doubly as compared to singly seropositive individuals, and a strong clustering of HPV16 and -18 seropositivity, particularly around the age of sexual debut. The bivariate model resulted in a more reliable classification of singly and doubly seropositive individuals than achieved by a combination of two univariate models, and suggested a higher pre-vaccine HPV16 seroprevalence than previously estimated. The bivariate mixture model provides valuable baseline estimates of vaccine-type seroprevalence and may prove useful in seroepidemiologic assessment of the herd effects of HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2508031563,"Objective The association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the risk of mortality among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) is complex and still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of eGFR on the risk prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality with a long follow-up period among patients with CHD in China. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3276 Chinese patients with CHD. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of different levels of eGFR with the risks of mortality. Results During a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years, 293 deaths were identified. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios associated with different levels of eGFR (≥90 [reference group], 60–89, 30–59, 15–29 ml/min per 1.73m2) at baseline were 1.00, 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87–1.88), 1.96 (95% CI, 1.31–2.94), and 3.91 (95% CI, 2.15–7.13) (P <0.001) for all-cause mortality, and 1.00, 1.26 (95% CI, 0.78–2.04), 1.94 (95% CI, 1.17–3.20), and 3.77 (95% CI, 1.80–7.89) (P <0.001) for CVD mortality, respectively. After excluding subjects who died during the first 2 years of follow-up (n = 113), the graded associations of eGFR with the risks of all-cause and CVD morality were still present. The addition of eGFR to a model including traditional cardiovascular risk factors resulted in significant improvement in the prediction of all-cause and CVD mortality. Conclusions Reduced eGFR (< 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at baseline is associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality among Chinese patients with CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2510689616,"Methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP) salts have been widely used to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential and the triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) moiety has been attached to many bioactive compounds including antioxidants to target them into mitochondria thanks to their high affinity to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix. The adverse effects of these compounds on cellular metabolism have been insufficiently studied and are still poorly understood. Micromolar concentrations of TPMP cause a progressive inhibition of cellular respiration in adherent cells without a marked effect on mitochondrial coupling. In permeabilized cells the inhibition was limited to NADH-linked respiration. We found a mixed inhibition of the Krebs cycle enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) with an estimated IC50 3.93 [3.70-4.17] mM, which is pharmacologically plausible since it corresponds to micromolar extracellular concentrations. Increasing the lipophilic character of the used TPP+ compound further potentiates the inhibition of OGDHC activity. This effect of TPMP on the Krebs cycle ought to be taken into account when interpreting observations on cells and mitochondria in the presence of TPP+ derivatives. Compounds based on or similar to TPP+ derivatives may also be used to alter OGDHC activity for experimental or therapeutic purposes."

Here, we report on estimating the feasibility of building possible molecular models of STAT5A tetramers bound to a DNA double helix with all possible spacings between the dimer binding sites. We found that the calculated feasibility estimates correlated well with the experimentally measured frequency of tetramer-binding sites. This suggests that the feasibility of forming the tetramer complex was a major factor in the evolution of this DNA sequence variation."

Main outcome measure was the use of FRIDs.FRIDs were used by 79% of persons with APD and 75% of persons without APD. Persons with APD were more likely to use ≥ 1 FRIDs compared to persons without APD (adjusted OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.06-1-12). The association was stronger for concomitant use of ≥ 5 FRIDS (adjusted OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.44-1.55).The high use of FRIDs among persons with APD indicates that these patients may be at increased risk of drug-induced falls. Further studies are needed to investigate how these drugs affect the risk of falling in persons with PD."
https://openalex.org/W2515535513,"Over the last decade, there has been a great improvement in the oral health of Brazilians. However, such a trend was not observed among five-year-old children. Dental caries are determined by the interplay between biological and behavioral factors that are shaped by broader socioeconomic determinants. It is well established that dental disease is concentrated in socially disadvantaged populations. To reduce social and health inequalities, the Brazilian government created Family Health Program (ESF), and the Bolsa Família Program, the Brazilian conditional cash transfer program (Bolsa Família Program). The aim of this study was to examine the oral health care and promotion provided by the Family Health Teams to children and caregivers covered by the Bolsa Família Program. Data was collected through interviews with three groups of participants: 1) dentists working for the Family Health Program; 2) Family Health Program professionals supervising the Bolsa Família Program health conditionalities (Bolsa Família Program supervisors); and 3) parents/caregivers of children covered by the Bolsa Família Program. A pretested questionnaire included sociodemographic, Bolsa Família Program, oral health promotion, dental prevention and dental treatment questions. The results showed that most dentists performed no systematic efforts to promote oral health care to children covered by the Bolsa Família Program (93.3%; n = 69) or to their parents/caregivers (74.3%; n = 55). Many dentists (33.8%) did not provide oral health care to children covered by the Bolsa Família Program because they felt it was beyond their responsibilities. Nearly all Bolsa Família Program supervisors (97.3%; n = 72) supported the inclusion of oral health care in the health conditionality of the Bolsa Família Program, but 82.4% (n = 61) stated they did not promote oral health activities to children covered by the Bolsa Família Program. Children in the routine care setting were more often referred to dentists than children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program (p≤0.001). Parents/caregivers (99.2%; n = 381) agreed that oral health care is important and 99.5% (n = 382) would like their children to be seen regularly.No collaboration was observed between the Bolsa Família Program and the Family Health Program with regard to the provision of oral health care. Making oral health care a Bolsa Família Program conditionality may reduce oral health care inequalities for extreme poor children under seven in Brazil."

During the last decades, area-wide pest management (AW-IPM) approaches with a sterile insect technique (SIT) component have been used to control populations of this pest in an effective and environment-friendly manner. The development of genetic sexing strains (GSS), such as the Vienna 8 strain, has been played a major role in increasing the efficacy and reducing the cost of SIT programs. However, mass rearing, extensive inbreeding, possible bottleneck phenomena and hitch-hiking effects might pose major risks for deterioration and loss of important genetic characteristics of domesticated insect. In the present study, we present a modified procedure to cryopreserve the embryos of the medfly Vienna 8 GSS based on vitrification and used this strain as insect model to assess the impact of the cryopreservation process on the genetic structure of the cryopreserved insects. Forty-eight hours old embryos, incubated at 24°C, were found to be the most suitable developmental stage for cryopreservation treatment for high production of acceptable hatch rate (38%). Our data suggest the absence of any negative impact of the cryopreservation process on egg hatch rate, pupation rates, adult emergence rates and stability of the temperature sensitive lethal (tsl) character on two established cryopreserved lines (flies emerged from cryopreserved embryos), named V8-118 and V8-228. Taken together, our study provides an optimized procedure to cryopreserve the medfly Vienna 8 GSS and documents the absence of any negative impact on the genetic structure and quality of the strain.

We evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with HCC, taking into account of their past clinical courses.Patients with HCC treated with sorafenib as a first-line systemic therapy, whose courses documented from the time of the initial diagnosis, were retrospectively analyzed.Of the 123 patients receiving sorafenib therapy at an advanced-stage, baseline characteristics differed including the rate of hepatitis C virus, Child-Pugh class, and status of intrahepatic lesions according to stage progression processes. Overall survival (OS) in patients progressed directly from the early-stage (15.3 months) was significantly longer than that in patients diagnosed at the advanced-stage (5.3 months, P = 0.022) and progressed from the intermediate-stages (6.0 months, P = 0.041). Of 105 patients diagnosed at the intermediate-stage on past clinical courses, OS of starting sorafenib therapy before progression to the advanced-stage (67 patients) was significantly longer than for patients starting sorafenib therapy only after progression to the advanced-stage (38 patients) (P = 0.015).Characteristic differences between past stage progression processes might affect prognosis in advanced-stage HCC patients receiving sorafenib. Switching to sorafenib therapy before progression to the advanced-stage appears more effective than that after progression to the advanced-stage in patients diagnosed in the intermediate-stage on past clinical courses prior to sorafenib administration."

The main interacting surfaces of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA have been mapped to the interdomain connecting loop and to the carboxy-terminal domain. Here we report that the subunit interface of yeast PCNA also has regulatory roles in the function of several DNA damage response pathways. Using site-directed mutagenesis we engineered mutations at both sides of the interface and investigated the effect of these alleles on DNA damage response. Genetic experiments with strains bearing the mutant alleles revealed that mutagenic translesion synthesis, nucleotide excision repair, and homologous recombination are all regulated through residues at the subunit interface. Moreover, genetic characterization of one of our mutants identifies a new sub-branch of nucleotide excision repair. Based on these results we conclude that residues at the subunit boundary of PCNA are not only important for the formation of the trimer structure of PCNA, but they constitute a regulatory protein domain that mediates different DNA damage response pathways, as well."

Adult patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery were randomly allocated in either non-angle-modified (Group N, n = 54) or angle-modified (Group M, n = 54) groups. During mask ventilation in the sniffing position, angle-modification was performed in Group M as follows: the distal tip of the tube was placed at the level of the cricoid cartilage and the shaft was bent at the intersection of the oral and pharyngeal axes estimated from the patient's surface anatomy. The time needed and the number of attempts for successful intubation and Cormack and Lehane (C-L) grade were recorded. Overall median intubation time (sec) was significantly shorter in Group M than in Group N [10.2 vs. 15.1, P<0.001]. In addition, Group M showed the shorter median intubation time (sec) in C-L grades I-III [8.2 vs. 11.1 in C-L grade I, (P = 0.003), 10.3 vs. 15.3 in II, (P = 0.001), and 11.8 vs. 27.9 in III, (P<0.001), respectively]. Moreover, all intubation was successfully performed at the first attempt in patients with C-L grades I-III in Group M (P = 0.027).

The goal of this study was to identify any changes in the concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during HSV-1 infection of epithelial cells that could potentially be used as an indicator of a response to stress. An additional objective was to study if any VOCs released from acute epithelial infection may influence subsequent neuronal infection to facilitate latency. To investigate these hypotheses, Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 and the emission of VOCs was analyzed using two-dimensional gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (2D GC/MS). It was observed that the concentrations of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) in particular changed significantly after a 24-hour infection. Since HSV-1 may establish latency in neurons after the acute infection, GBL was tested to determine if it exerts neuronal regulation of infection. The results indicated that GBL altered the resting membrane potential of differentiated LNCaP cells and promoted a non-permissive state of HSV-1 infection by repressing viral replication. These observations may provide useful clues towards understanding the complex signaling pathways that occur during the HSV-1 primary infection and establishment of viral latency."

Operations of the fishing gear mark checkpoints in a continuous complex decision-making process. Individual fisher behavior is modeled by identifying diversified choices over decision-space for an entire fishing trip, which allows inclusion of prior and current vessel locations and conditions among the explanatory variables. Among these factors are vessel capacity; departure and arrival port; duration of the fishing trip; daily and cumulative distance travelled, which provides a proxy for operation costs; expected revenue; oceanographic conditions; and tons of fish on board. The model uses a two-step decision process to capture the probability of a vessel choosing a specific fishing region for the first set and the probability of switching to (or staying in) a specific region to fish before returning to its landing port. The model provides a means to anticipate the success of marine resource management, and it can be used to evaluate fleet diversity in fisher behavior, the impact of climate variability, and the stability and resilience of complex coupled human and natural systems."

Metamorphosis in B. neritina is mediated by both the nervous system and the release of developmental signals. However, no research has been conducted to investigate the expression of neuropeptides (NP)/peptide hormones in B. neritina larvae. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the NP/peptide hormones in the marine bryozoan B. neritina based on in silico identification methods. We recovered 22 transcripts encompassing 11 NP/peptide hormone precursor transcript sequences. The transcript sequences of the 11 isolated NP precursors were validated by cDNA cloning using gene-specific primers. We also examined the expression of three peptide hormone precursor transcripts (BnFDSIG, BnILP1, BnGPB) in the coronate larvae of B. neritina, demonstrating their distinct expression patterns in the larvae. Overall, our findings serve as an important foundation for subsequent investigations of the peptidergic control of bryozoan larval behavior and settlement."

Our results indicate that stylasterid morphology is highly plastic and that many events of independent evolution and reversion have occurred. Our analysis also allows sketching a possible identikit of the stylasterid ancestor. It had calcareous skeleton, reticulate-granular coenosteal texture, polyps randomly arranged, gastrostyle, and dactylopore spines, while lacking a gastropore lip and dactylostyles. If the ancestor had single or double/multiple chambered gastropore tube is uncertain. These data suggest that the ancestor was similar to the extant genera Cyclohelia and Stellapora.

During the development of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo a highly coordinated maturation process resulting in the ensheathment of multiple axons in compact multi-lamellar structures, termed myelin. The segmental wrapping of axons facilitates enhanced propagation of action potentials by providing increased interaxonal resistance, decreased membrane capacitance, and ordered segregation of ion channels at Nodes of Ranvier. In addition, recent work suggests that oligodendrocytes serve as key sources of metabolic support for axons (Simons and Nave, 2016Simons M. Nave K.-A. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a020479Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As a result, disruption or malformation of myelin is highly relevant to many neuropathologies, such as multiple sclerosis (Hughes and Appel, 2016Hughes E.G. Appel B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 39: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). While recent strides have been made in understanding factors involved in OPC migration and differentiation, one fundamental unanswered question is how oligodendrocytes discriminate their axonal targets from other structures. For example, why don’t oligodentrocytes ensheath dendrites or somata? Are there myelin-inducing signals on axons, repulsive signals expressed by the somatodendritic compartment, or is there a combination? In this issue of Neuron, Redmond et al., 2016Redmond S.A. Mei F. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Osso L.A. Leshkowitz D. Shen Y.-A.A. Kay J.N. Aurrand-Lions M. Lyons D.A. Peles E. Chan J.R. Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 824-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar tackle these questions and reveal a novel role for junction adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) as a myelin repulsion molecule. They provide evidence for a model in which JAM2 surface expression in the somatodendritic compartment of spinal cord neurons (SCNs) inhibits the local formation of myelin through interaction with an unidentified receptor on oligodendrocytes (Figure 1). Historically, oligodendrocytes have been known as eager myelinators that will readily form myelin sheets in culture, even on glass coverslips, and can myelinate inert objects such as polystyrene nanofibers (Hughes and Appel, 2016Hughes E.G. Appel B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 39: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, oligodendrocytes do not appear to require inductive signaling from axons to commence myelination. However, when cultured with neurons, and in vivo, myelin is strictly segregated to axons, suggesting that while myelin genesis is an intrinsic feature of oligodendrocytes, extrinsic myelin guidance cues must exist to prevent improper somatodendritic ensheathment. Redmond et al., 2016Redmond S.A. Mei F. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Osso L.A. Leshkowitz D. Shen Y.-A.A. Kay J.N. Aurrand-Lions M. Lyons D.A. Peles E. Chan J.R. Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 824-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar explored the nature of these potential guidance cues by co-culturing rat primary SCNs with OPCs. Normally, when co-cultured, OPCs differentiate and exclusively myelinate axons. However, when the authors pre-treated the neurons with the cross-linker paraformaldehyde (PFA) to disrupt neuron-oligodendrocyte signaling, not only were axons myelinated, but dendrites and even some SCN somata were ensheathed. These results suggested that an inhibitory signal on the somatodendritic compartment may have been interrupted by the cross-linker. To identity somatodendritic-specific myelin inhibitory signals, they conducted next-generation RNA-sequencing of cultured SCN and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, looking for genes differentially expressed by the SCNs. They reasoned that since DRG neurons lack true dendrites, they would be unlikely hosts to a somatodendritic inhibitor. Among the candidate inhibitory proteins that they identified, JAM2 caught their attention due to its low expression in DRG cell bodies and high expression in SCN somatodendritic compartments. JAM2 is a member of the JAM family, which are transmembrane proteins involved in the formation of tight junctions. JAM2 has also been reported to have a role in cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis in tumor cells (Zhao et al., 2016Zhao H. Yu H. Martin T.A. Teng X. Jiang W.G. Oncol. Rep. 2016; 36: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, when the extracellular portion of JAM2, fused to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin (JAM2-Fc), was introduced into cultured oligodendrocytes, they found markedly higher JAM2-Fc binding to myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+), myelinating oligodendrocytes relative to OPCs. This result suggests that the surface expression of a JAM2 receptor could be upregulated during OPC maturation, as would be expected from a regulator of myelination. Redmond et al. also provide compelling evidence for JAM2 modulation of oligodendrocyte myelination in vitro. When OPCs were plated onto an array of micropillars, they formed myelin; however, when the micropillars were coated with JAM2-Fc, myelination was reduced by 86%. Importantly, there were no changes in OPC or oligodendrocyte density directly adjacent to the micropillar array, suggesting that, unlike many previously discovered regulators of myelin, JAM2 is an inhibitor of myelination without affecting OPC differentiation, proliferation, or migration. However, due to technical limitations, they were unable to examine the cell density directly at the micropillar array. Therefore, local changes in OPC differentiation or adhesion cannot be ruled out. Myelinating SCN/OPC co-cultures were also affected by JAM2 manipulation. Introduction of soluble JAM2-Fc inhibited myelin formation in cultures from wild-type (WT) mice, yet culturing SCNs isolated from JAM2 knockout (JAM2-KO) mice with WT OPCs resulted in an increase in the myelination of somatodendritic compartments. However, the increase in myelinated dendrites in JAM2-KO mixed cultures was modest compared to the increase in dendritic myelination previously noted in SCNs treated with PFA. This difference suggests that there may be multiple inhibitory elements localized to somatodendritic compartments. In vivo analysis of JAM2-KO mice also supports the hypothesis that JAM2 serves as an inhibitor of somatodendritic myelination, although, similar to the in vitro findings, results from the JAM2-KO mice suggest that there are other myelin inhibitory molecules. Redmond et al. examined the dorsal horn of JAM2-KO mice, since the myelin in this region is relatively sparse, facilitating their ability to evaluate individual myelin segments. Strikingly, they found a significant increase in MBP+ structures surrounding neuronal somata relative to control, with 72% of JAM2-KO hemisections containing more than one ensheathed soma compared to 16% in WT. Additionally, the investigators discovered that the wrapped soma were exclusively positive for the inhibitory neuron marker, paired box gene 2 (PAX2). This result indicates that JAM2’s role in myelin inhibition may vary by neuronal subtype, and that other inhibitory signals likely contribute to somatodendritic myelin guidance. To fully understand JAM2 inhibitory signaling, a wider survey of myelin in the spinal cord and brain of JAM2 KO mice is required. Of course, such a study is technically challenging given the density of myelin in many regions of the CNS, making resolution of individual myelin segments difficult. However, one approach could be to use mice, previously generated by the Chan lab, which exhibit sparse labeling of oligodendrocytes, enabling visualization of the myelin segments from single oligodendrocytes (Chong et al., 2012Chong S.Y.C. Rosenberg S.S. Fancy S.P.J. Zhao C. Shen Y.-A.A. Hahn A.T. McGee A.W. Xu X. Zheng B. Zhang L.I. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A question tantalizingly left unanswered by this study is: what affect does the aberrant ensheathment of somatodendritic structures have on neuronal function? Redmond et al., 2016Redmond S.A. Mei F. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Osso L.A. Leshkowitz D. Shen Y.-A.A. Kay J.N. Aurrand-Lions M. Lyons D.A. Peles E. Chan J.R. Neuron. 2016; 91 (this issue): 824-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar do note that in the ensheathed somata of JAM2-KO neurons, there was abnormal clustering of neuronal contactin-associated protein (CASPR). Typically, CASPR is found only in the paranodal structures of the Nodes of Ranvier. Previous findings suggest that interruption or improper construction of axonal myelin can cause ion channel mislocalization, impairing conduction and contributing to disease pathology (Faivre-Sarrailh and Devaux, 2013Faivre-Sarrailh C. Devaux J.J. Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Yet the functional effects of mislocalized paranodal proteins to the somatodendritic compartment are still unknown. The question of the potential impact of mislocalized myelin on neuronal activity is especially intriguing in the context of synaptic function. If the neuronal soma and dendrites are ensheathed, it is difficult to imagine how synapses would form or function. Redmond et al. did not observe any synaptic markers on the myelinated somata of the PAX2+ neurons; however, they point out that typically very few of these neurons have somatic synapses. Therefore, it is not known whether the wrapping impaired or reversed synapse formation, or if only somata without synapses were targeted. Given the interconnected nature of the CNS, even the abnormal wrapping of a few selective neurons is likely to alter the activity of an entire circuit, possibly resulting in altered cognitive function and/or behavior. Understanding the consequences of JAM2 deletion at the whole-animal level will be fertile ground for future studies. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates a reciprocal relationship between neuronal activity and myelin formation. Numerous studies have indicated that the firing of action potentials promotes CNS myelin formation. Recently, Gibson et al., 2014Gibson E.M. Purger D. Mount C.W. Goldstein A.K. Lin G.L. Wood L.S. Inema I. Miller S.E. Bieri G. Zuchero J.B. et al.Science. 2014; 344: 1252304Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar provided convincing optogenetic evidence for activity-dependent myelination in the premotor cortex of mice. In addition, studies conducted in zebrafish demonstrated that manipulation of vesicle release, triggering either synaptic silencing or hyperactivation, results in decreased myelination of affected axons or increased myelin thickness, respectively (Mensch et al., 2015Mensch S. Baraban M. Almeida R. Czopka T. Ausborn J. El Manira A. Lyons D.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Hines et al., 2015Hines J.H. Ravanelli A.M. Schwindt R. Scott E.K. Appel B. Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Therefore, one can envision neuronal activity downregulating myelin inhibitors, such as JAM2, to facilitate myelination. Other avenues for future research include further characterization of JAM2 signaling in the CNS and, likely, the discovery of additional inhibitory myelin guidance factors. While several JAM2 receptors have previously been characterized, the identity of those used by oligodendrocytes remains opaque (Zhao et al., 2016Zhao H. Yu H. Martin T.A. Teng X. Jiang W.G. Oncol. Rep. 2016; 36: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibitory guidance factors may not be restricted to somatodendritic structures. If oligodendrocyte myelination is as intrinsic as it appears, it is likely that unmyelinated cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, express similar inhibitory signals. Furthermore, Tomassy et al., 2014Tomassy G.S. Berger D.R. Chen H.-H. Kasthuri N. Hayworth K.J. Vercelli A. Seung H.S. Lichtman J.W. Arlotta P. Science. 2014; 344: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar recently used high-throughput EM analysis to demonstrate that mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons display large variation in the pattern of myelin, exhibiting long stretches without consistent myelination. The regulation of those patterns could be due to differential expression of inhibitory molecules such as JAM2. Clearly, this study has opened up many new lines of inquiry; nevertheless, the identification of a myelin inhibitor that prevents wrapping of the somatodendritic compartment nicely addresses a long-standing impediment to our comprehension of myelin formation. In addition, the results of this study have important implications for treating demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, where the promotion of remyelination remains an elusive goal. Somatodendritic Expression of JAM2 Inhibits Oligodendrocyte MyelinationRedmond et al.NeuronAugust 4, 2016In BriefRedmond et al. demonstrate that JAM2 is a somatodendritic inhibitor of oligodendrocyte myelination. JAM2 is necessary and sufficient to inhibit myelin wrapping in vitro, and loss of JAM2 leads to aberrant myelination of dorsal horn PAX2+ interneuron cell bodies in the spinal cord dorsal horn.

Alternative ways to treat this disease are urgently needed. Here we evaluate the in vitro effect of direct current (DC) capacitive coupling electrical stimulation on the biology and viability of Plasmodium falciparum. We designed a system that exposes infected erythrocytes to different capacitively coupled electric fields in order to evaluate their effect on P. falciparum. The effect on growth of the parasite, replication of DNA, mitochondrial membrane potential and level of reactive oxygen species after exposure to electric fields demonstrate that the parasite is biologically able to respond to stimuli from DC electric fields involving calcium signaling pathways."
