One goal is algorithmic prediction of viable routes to a desired compound; the other is implementation of a known reaction sequence on a platform that needs little to no human intervention. Coley et al. now report preliminary integration of these two protocols. They paired a retrosynthesis prediction algorithm with a robotically reconfigurable flow apparatus. Human intervention was still required to supplement the predictor with practical considerations such as solvent choice and precise stoichiometry, although predictions should improve as accessible data accumulate for training.

https://openalex.org/W3102922614,"Geometrically frustrated magnets provide abundant opportunities for discovering complex spin textures, which sometimes yield unconventional electromagnetic responses in correlated electron systems. It is theoretically predicted that magnetic frustration may also promote a topologically nontrivial spin state, i.e., magnetic skyrmions, which are nanometric spin vortices. Empirically, however, skyrmions are essentially concomitant with noncentrosymmetric lattice structures or interfacial-symmetry-breaking heterostructures. Here, we report the emergence of a Bloch-type skyrmion state in the frustrated centrosymmetric triangular-lattice magnet Gd2PdSi3. We identified the field-induced skyrmion phase via a giant topological Hall response, which is further corroborated by the observation of in-plane spin modulation probed by resonant x-ray scattering. Our results exemplify a new gold mine of magnetic frustration for producing topological spin textures endowed with emergent electrodynamics in centrosymmetric magnets."

Colibactin has been difficult to isolate in full, but pieces of the structure have been worked out, including an electrophilic warhead. Xue et al. found that colibactin contains two conjoined warheads, which is consistent with its ability to alkylate and cross-link DNA. Chemical synthesis and comparison to cell coculture confirm the structure and properties of this unstable and potentially carcinogenic metabolite. Science , this issue p. eaax2685"

Norman et al. developed a framework for mapping and understanding GIs. This approach leverages high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data gathered from CRISPR-mediated, pooled perturbation screens. Diverse transcriptomic phenotypes construct a “manifold” representing all possible states of the cell. Each perturbation and GI projects the cell state to a particular position on this manifold, enabling unbiased ordering of genes in pathways and systematic classifications of GIs.

https://openalex.org/W2967950872,"The modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), featured by the consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish and lean meat, while excluding grains, dairy products, salt and refined sugar, has gained substantial public attention in recent years because of its potential multiple health benefits. However, to date little is known about the actual impact of this dietary pattern on the gut microbiome (GM) and its implications for human health. In the current scenario where Western diets, low in fiber while rich in industrialized and processed foods, are considered one of the leading causes of maladaptive GM changes along human evolution, likely contributing to the increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases, we hypothesize that the MPD could modulate the Western GM towards a more “ancestral” configuration. In an attempt to shed light on this, here we profiled the GM structure of urban Italian subjects adhering to the MPD, and compared data with other urban Italians following a Mediterranean Diet (MD), as well as worldwide traditional hunter-gatherer populations from previous publications. Notwithstanding a strong geography effect on the GM structure, our results show an unexpectedly high degree of biodiversity in MPD subjects, which well approximates that of traditional populations. The GM of MPD individuals also shows some peculiarities, including a high relative abundance of bile-tolerant and fat-loving microorganisms. The consumption of plant-based foods–albeit with the exclusion of grains and pulses–along with the minimization of the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the MPD, could therefore contribute to partially rewild the GM but caution should be taken in adhering to this dietary pattern in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W2967533822,"Critically-ill surgical patients are at higher risk for sarcopenia, which is associated with worse survival. Sarcopenia may impair the respiratory musculature, which can subsequently influence the outcome of ventilator weaning. Although there are a variety of weaning parameters predictive of weaning outcomes, none have tried to incorporate ""muscle strength"" or ""sarcopenia"". The aim of the current study was to explore the association between sarcopenia and difficult-to-wean (DtW) in critically-ill surgical patients. The influence of sarcopenia on ICU mortality was also analyzed.Ninety-six patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled. Demographic data and weaning parameters were recorded from the prospectively collected database, and the total psoas muscle area (TPA) was determined at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebra by computed tomography. Sarcopenia was defined by previously established cut-off points and its influence on clinical outcomes was examined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to investigate the predictive capability of TPA and weaning parameters for predicting weaning outcomes.The median age of the studied patients was 73 years. Thirty patients (31.3%) were sarcopenic and 30 (31.3%) were defined as DtW. Eighteen patients (18.8%) had ICU mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for DtW and ICU mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of TPA for predicting successful weaning was 0.727 and 0.720 in female and male patients, respectively. After combining TPA and conventional weaning parameters, the AUC for DtW increased from 0.836 to 0.911 and from 0.835 to 0.922 in female and male patients, respectively.Sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for DtW and ICU mortality. TPA has predictive value when assessing weaning outcomes and can be used as an effective adjunct predictor along with conventional weaning parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2966971863,"Adolescent-friendly health programs have been in place in Nepal since 2008, yet uptake of the services for sexual and reproductive health remains suboptimal. For uptake of these services to improve, a rich understanding is needed of the factors impacting their acceptance and utilization from the perspectives of adolescents, health care staff, and key community informants. This study applied a qualitative research design involving six focus groups with 52 adolescents and in-depth interviews with 16 adolescents, 13 key informants, and 9 health care providers from six adolescent-friendly health facilities in Nepal. Thematic analysis was conducted for data analysis. The key themes identified as barriers include access issues due to travel, institutional health care barriers, perceived lack of privacy and confidentiality, and the unprofessional attitudes of staff towards the sexual health needs of adolescents. These themes are underpinned by gendered ideology and a moral framework around the sexual behavior of adolescents. Interview responses suggested that health care providers take a policing role in prescribing adolescents' conformity to this moral framework in their delivery of reproductive health care and services. While physical access to health services may be problematic for some adolescents, this is not the priority issue. Attention needs to be given to increasing the capacity of health care providers to deliver services without imposing their own and socially sanctioned moral frameworks around adolescent sexual behavior. Such capacity building should include training that is experiential and emphasizes the importance of confidentiality and non-judgmental attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2967640898,"Development of white striping (WS) and wooden breast (WB) in broiler breast meat have been linked to hypoxia, but their etiologies are not fully understood. This study aimed at investigating absolute expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and genes involved in stress responses and muscle repair using a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from pectoralis major collected from male 6-week-old medium (carcass weight ≤ 2.5 kg) and heavy (carcass weight > 2.5 kg) broilers. Samples were classified as ""non-defective"" (n = 4), ""medium-WS"" (n = 6), ""heavy-WS"" (n = 7) and ""heavy-WS+WB"" (n = 3) based on abnormality scores. The HIF1A transcript was up-regulated in all of the abnormal groups. Transcript abundances of genes encoding 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), and phosphorylase kinase beta subunit (PHKB) were increased in heavy-WS but decreased in heavy-WS+WB. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was up-regulated in non-defective samples. The muscle-specific mu-2 isoform of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM2) was up-regulated in the abnormal samples, particularly in the heavy groups. The genes encoding myogenic differentiation (MYOD1) and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) exhibited similar expression pattern, of which medium-WS and heavy-WS significantly increased compared to non-defective whereas expression in heavy-WS+WB was not different from either non-defective or WS-affected group. The greatest and the lowest levels of calpain-3 (CAPN3) and delta-sarcoglycan (SCGD) were observed in heavy-WS and heavy-WS+WB, respectively. Based on micrographs, the abnormal muscles primarily comprised fibers with cross-sectional areas ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 μm2. Despite induced glycolysis at the transcriptional level, lower stored glycogen in the abnormal muscles corresponded with the reduced lactate and higher pH within their meats. The findings support hypoxia within the abnormal breasts, potentially associated with oversized muscle fibers. Between WS and WB, divergent glucose metabolism, cellular detoxification and myoregeneration at the transcriptional level could be anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2968514531,"Background The German Committee on Vaccination recommends pneumococcal vaccination for infants, seniors 60+ years and patients at risk with defined underlying diseases. Aim of this study was to assess the pneumococcal vaccination rate (pnc-VR) in patients with certain incident inherited or acquired immunodeficiency or immunosuppression and to understand who vaccinates these patients who are particularly at high risk to develop a pneumococcal infection. Methods We conducted a cohort study in patients aged 2 years or older, with a first episode of a “high-risk” condition between January 2013 and December 2014 based on a representative sample of German claims data. Pnc-VR was calculated as the proportion of patients receiving any pneumococcal vaccine within two years after first episode of “high-risk” condition. Further analyses cover pnc-VR stratified by high risk conditions and region, time to vaccination, and physician specialty administering the pneumococcal vaccination. Results The study population comprised 204,088 incident “high-risk” patients (56% female). The overall pnc-VR within two years was 4.4% (95%-confidence interval: 4.3%-4.5%). Within specific high-risk conditions, we found the highest vaccination rate of 11.5% (10.1%-13.0%) among patients starting immunosuppressants with underlying rheumatoid arthritis followed by 9.9% (7.8%-12.4%) in HIV patients. Stratification by region revealed a slightly higher vaccination rate in Eastern (6.5%: 6.0%-6.9%) compared to Western Germany (4.2%: 4.1–4.3%). Median time to vaccination within the first two years in vaccinated patients was 332.5 days (Q1 142 days, Q3 528 days). The majority of patients (92.6%) got vaccinated by a general practitioner. Conclusion Although these vulnerable patients need protection most, our study suggests that the overall pnc-VR after a first episode of a high-risk condition for pneumococcal disease is very low and vaccination is far too late. To prevent pneumococcal disease in patients at high risk, further efforts are needed to increase awareness and improve the timeliness of pneumococcal vaccination."

Their exclusive interaction in the Golgi compartment is a prerequisite for their full catalytic activity, whereas a lack of this interaction is associated with cancers and hypoxia. To date, no structural information exists that shows how glycosyltransferases functionally assemble with each other. Using molecular docking simulations to predict interaction surfaces, along with mutagenesis screens and high-throughput FRET analyses in live cells to validate these predictions, we show here that B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 interact via highly charged noncatalytic surfaces, leaving the active sites exposed and accessible for donor and acceptor substrate binding. Moreover, we found that the assembly of ST6GAL1 homomers in the endoplasmic reticulum before ST6GAL1 activation in the Golgi utilizes the same noncatalytic surface, whereas B4GALT1 uses its active-site surface for assembly, which silences its catalytic activity. Last, we show that the homomeric and heteromeric B4GALT1/ST6GAL1 complexes can assemble laterally in the Golgi membranes without forming cross-cisternal contacts between enzyme molecules residing in the opposite membranes of each Golgi cisterna. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the regulation of glycosyltransferase interactions, the transitions between B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 homo- and heteromers in the Golgi, and cooperative B4GALT1/ST6GAL1 function in N-glycan synthesis. β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1 (B4GALT1) and ST6 β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) catalyze the successive addition of terminal β-1,4–linked galactose and α-2,6–linked sialic acid to N-glycans.

Most glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins with three distinct structural and functional domains: a transmembrane domain preceded by an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a stem domain (STEM) oriented toward the lumen of the Golgi, and a globular catalytic domain (CAT) (2Harduin-Lepers A. Joe T. Ivan M.D. Sialobiology: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function: Sialic Acid Glycoconjugates in Health and Disease. Bentham Science Publishers, 2013: 85-116Google Scholar). The presence of the catalytic domains in the Golgi lumen allows for the processing of glycan chains along their passage through the secretory pathway (3Harrus D. Kellokumpu S. Glumoff T.

Their oligomerization state depends on several factors; for instance, glycosyltransferases acting on N-glycans assemble into less active homomeric complexes in the ER but form functionally relevant and fully active heteromers in the Golgi (5Hassinen A.

This transition between homomers and heteromers is key for spatial and temporal regulation of glycosylation, as glycan addition and removal are sequential and do not use any template, unlike synthesis of mRNA and proteins. Such complexes have been identified so far in all glycosylation pathways, i.e. in the synthesis of N- and O-glycans, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids. For instance, in the case of glycosaminoglycans, complexes termed GAGosomes (8Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Order out of chaos: assembly of ligand binding sites in heparan sulfate.Annu. Rev.

The ER and Golgi microenvironments have primary roles in governing the type of assembly made, in addition to contributing to the preservation of the Golgi structure and ER–Golgi trafficking (10Bräuer P.

Accordingly, the redox state difference between these two compartments regulates the interaction between B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1, whereas the pH gradient (pH 7 versus pH 6.3) affects B4GALT1 and ST3GAL3 interactions as well as interactions between glycosyltransferases that act on O-glycans (6Hassinen A.

Changes in Golgi redox potential in hypoxic cells correlates with loss of α-2,6 sialylation and inactivation of ST6GAL1 and its inability to bind B4GALT1. These events have been shown to be coordinated by formation of two disulfide bonds on two distinct surface areas within the catalytic domain of the enzyme (12Hassinen A. Khoder-Agha F.

On the other hand, the first human B4GALT1 dimeric structure indicates that the homodimeric interaction takes place via the surface surrounding the active site, and two mutations there (M340H and H343A) prevented dimer formation, most likely by changing the affinity to the Mn2+ binding and by altering the active site's loop dynamicity (13Harrus D.

To decipher how the B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 glycosyltransferases interact and function at the molecular and cellular levels, we utilized molecular modeling and docking, mutagenesis screens, domain truncations, and validation with high-throughput FRET analyses. Our data unveil, for the first time, interaction surfaces important for assembly of both homomeric and heteromeric complexes between B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1. Our findings also show that the complexes can interact laterally, i.e. without necessarily having contacts across the cisternal space. The results also provide mechanistic details that facilitate transitions between enzyme homo- and heteromers in the Golgi in addition to providing a rationale for having such an intricate transition system to regulate glycosylation. Recently, we presented the first human homodimeric crystal structure of B4GALT1 and showed that the interaction takes place at the surface surrounding the active site of the enzyme through concerted loop movements involving amino acids Met340 and His343 (13Harrus D. Khoder-Agha F. Peltoniemi M. Hassinen A. Ruddock L. Kellokumpu S. Glumoff T.

To determine possible heterodimer interaction sites in the B4GALT1 catalytic domain, we first utilized molecular docking predictions using the ClusPro server (15Kozakov D. Hall D.R. Xia B. Porter K.A. Padhorny D. Yueh C. Beglov D. Vajda S. The ClusPro web server for protein-protein docking.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 (28079879): 255-27810.1038/nprot.2016.169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) and obtained several potential residues that can mediate the interaction with ST6GAL1. We created single mutations of selected amino acids (Fig. 1A) and screened their effects on the interaction by using the FRET system. Enzymes tagged with mVenus (donor) and mCherry (acceptor) were expressed in COS-7 cells, and FRET signals were acquired strictly from Golgi regions of cells by image segmentation and fine adjustments (7Khoder-Agha F. Sosicka P. Escriva Conde M. Hassinen A. Glumoff T. Olczak M. Kellokumpu S.

The active-site mutants M340H, M340E, and H343A did not affect the heteromeric interaction, as no FRET signal loss was observed (Fig. 1D). Based on the crystal structure (13Harrus D. Khoder-Agha F. Peltoniemi M. Hassinen A. Ruddock L. Kellokumpu S. Glumoff T. The dimeric structure of wild-type human glycosyltransferase B4GALT1.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 (30352055): e020557110.1371/journal.pone.0205571Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the Cys172 residue forms a disulfide bridge with Cys130 that restricts the conformational flexibility of a semi-disordered loop (Cys130 to Cys172) in the catalytic domain of B4GALT1 opposite the active site (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we mutated C172A and nearby Q206A. The mutations had a significant effect on heteromers, with 67% and 34% loss of FRET signal, respectively (Fig. 1D). No such loss was detected with B4GALT1 homodimers (Fig. 1C), indicating the specificity of the C172A and Q206A mutations. Interestingly, directed docking of ST6GAL1 to this interface of B4GALT1 with the Haddock server (16van Zundert G.C.P. Rodrigues J.P.G.L.M. Trellet M. Schmitz C. Kastritis P.L. Karaca E.

Based on the docked model, seven charged residues (Glu144, Glu152, Lys156, Lys162, Arg170, Asp171, and Arg204) involved in salt bridges with ST6GAL1 were identified as being important for the heteromeric interaction (Fig. 1E). Of these, we selected six to mutate into serine residues (D150S, E152S, K156S, K162S, R166S, and D171S). The mutant construct (B4GALT1.Ncat, Fig. 1F) lost its ability to bind ST6GAL1 but preserved its ability to bind to itself (Fig. 1G). These data provide strong support for this surface to mediate B4GALT1 binding to ST6GAL1. We then tested whether ST3GAL3 binding is similarly affected by the mutations. ST3GAL3 is an enzyme that competes with ST6GAL1 on binding to B4GALT1 (5Hassinen A. Rivinoja A. Kauppila A. Kellokumpu S. Golgi N-glycosyltransferases form both homo- and heterodimeric enzyme complexes in live cells.J. Biol.

To our surprise, ST3GAL3 still interacted with the mutant B4GALT1.Ncat protein (Fig. 1H). This suggests that, even though the two sialyltransferases compete for binding to B4GALT1 (Fig. 1H), they use different but mutually exclusive interaction surfaces on B4GALT1. The same methodology was applied to determine the ST6GAL1 interaction surfaces, which effectuate both homodimerization as well as heterodimerization to B4GALT1.

Molecular docking on the ClusPro server revealed residues that can modulate the interaction of B4GALT1 with ST6GAL1 (Fig. S1A) in two distinct surfaces, one being the active site and the other one residing opposite the active site. Point mutations of the depicted residues on ST6GAL1 significantly inhibited both homomeric and heteromeric interactions. For example, the H263A mutation inhibited homomer formation by 50% and heteromer formation by 15% (Fig. S1, B and C), whereas R145A and H405A each inhibited only homomer formation by 16% and 40%, respectively. All of these residues are situated opposite the active site (Fig. S1A). Molecular docking of ST6GAL1 with itself using the SymmDock server (19Schneidman-Duhovny D. Inbar Y. Nussinov R. Wolfson H.J.

The three residues (Arg145, His263, and His405) mentioned above are part of this same surface. The heterodimer and homodimer docking models were overlapping and involved several shared salt bridges on the same surface (Fig. 2C). Based on these models, a mutated construct was designed (Fig. 2D) to remove seven charged amino acids. The following mutations were included: D146S, D157S, K171S, H263S, E310S, D336S, and R402S (yielding the mutant ST6GAL1.Ncat, Fig. 2D). FRET measurements showed that the mutations significantly inhibited both interactions (homomers by 68% and heteromers by 87%). Based on one of the docking models, the active-site area may participate in ST6GAL1 homodimer formation (similar to B4GALT1). Therefore, we also tested this possibility and prepared another mutant construct, ST6GAL1.Cat, in which the lysine and arginine residues were mutated to glutamic acid residues (K111E, K241E, R242E, and K358E; Fig. S1D). FRET measurements revealed that the mutations did not affect homomeric interactions, but they inhibited the formation of heteromers by 36% (Fig. S1A, right panel). Because of this, we constructed several other mutations within the same active-site area, which, however, did not fold and/or localize correctly in the Golgi membranes (data not shown). An important factor to consider is the presence of one N-glycosylated residue, Asn149 (17Kuhn B. Benz J. Greif M. Engel A.M. Sobek H. Rudolph M.G. The structure of human α-2,6-sialyltransferase reveals the binding mode of complex glycans.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

They both reside in the identified interaction surface area of ST6GAL1 (Fig. 3A). To examine whether they contribute to the interactions, we carried out FRET measurements in cells treated with swainsonine or tunicamycin. Swainsonine is a known mannosidase inhibitor and halts processing of high-mannose N-glycans to complex N-glycans. Tunicamycin, in turn, depletes all N-glycans from newly synthetized proteins by inhibiting the formation of N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol, a necessary acceptor substrate for N-glycan precursor synthesis. FRET measurements in swainsonine-treated cells showed no loss of the FRET signal between ST6GAL1 homomers and between B4GALT1/ST6GAL1 heteromers, indicating that the interactions are not dependent on complex N-glycans (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, tunicamycin treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in the formation of B4GALT1/ST6GAL1 heteromers (Fig. 3C). The reason for this is not clear but may relate either to steric hindrance of the interaction by the existing N-glycan, tunicamycin-induced oxidative stress in the ER and the Golgi compartments (21Kim S.H. Kwon D.Y. Kwak J.H. Lee S. Lee Y.H. Yun J. Son T.G. Jung Y.S. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress is accompanied with oxidative stress via abrogation of sulfur amino acids metabolism in the liver.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 (30567393): E4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or both. In line with the latter possibility, the more oxidizing environment of the Golgi lumen compared with the ER favors B4GALT1–ST6GAL1 interaction (12Hassinen A. Khoder-Agha F. Khosrowabadi E. Mennerich D. Harrus D. Noel M. Dimova E.Y. Glumoff T. Harduin-Lepers A. Kietzmann T. Kellokumpu S. A Golgi-associated redox switch regulates catalytic activation and cooperative functioning of ST6Gal-I with B4GalT-I.Redox. Biol. 2019; 24 (30959459): 10118210.1016/j.redox.2019.101182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the interaction mutants are enzymatically active, we measured their activities first in cellulo by utilizing electroporated Lec20 cells lacking endogenous B4GALT1 activity and staining with rhodamine-conjugated RCA-I- or fluorescein-conjugated SNA lectin. These lectins are used as markers for terminal β-1,4-galactose and α-2,6-sialic acid, respectively. Transfection of cells expressing WT B4GALT1 or the B4GALT1.Ncat mutant alone with RCA-I lectin (Fig. 4, A and B) slightly increased terminal galactose residues in the cells. Cells expressing both enzymes (B4GALT1-WT and ST6GAL1-WT) simultaneously showed 2-fold higher galactose levels in the cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, cells expressing the interaction mutants (B4GALT1.Ncat and ST6GAL1.Ncat) did not show such an increase, suggesting either that the mutations rendered the B4GALT1 enzyme inactive despite not localizing in the active site or that the low activity may be caused by the loss of its ability to interact with ST6GAL1 (Figs. 1G and 2D), consistent with our previous results (22Hassinen A. Pujol F.M. Kokkonen N. Pieters C. Kihlström M. Korhonen K. Kellokumpu S. Functional organization of Golgi N- and O-glycosylation pathways involves pH-dependent complex formation that is impaired in cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21911486): 38329-3834010.1074/jbc.M111.277681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SNA lectin staining, on the other hand, showed that cells expressing WT B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 together displayed 3-fold higher α-2,6-sialic acid levels than cells expressing the mutant B4GALT1.Ncat and ST6GAL1.Ncat (Fig. 4, A and C). Similar results were obtained from in vitro sialylation assays with cell lysates prepared from cells transfected with an empty vector (Mock), with WT ST6GAL1 (ST6GAL1.WT), or with the ST6GAL1.Ncat mutant constructs. The ST6GAL1.Ncat interaction mutant retained only 10% of the activity of WT ST6GAL1 (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that enzyme interactions are necessary for the full catalytic activity of B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1. However, the possibility that the mutations also intrinsically impair the activity of these two enzymes cannot be excluded at the moment. A recent Golgi EM and tomography study suggested the presence of cisternal protein arrays in the trans-Golgi that likely hold cisternal membranes together (23Engel B.D. Schaffer M. Albert S. Asano S. Plitzko J.M. Baumeister W. In situ structural analysis of Golgi intracisternal protein arrays.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (26311849): 11264-1126910.1073/pnas.1515337112Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 are mainly localized in the trans-Golgi cisternae and, in theory, can adopt two possible configurations: cis and trans, where cis represents lateral interactions in the Golgi membrane and the trans configuration denotes transferases that bind to each other while residing in opposite membranes in one cisterna (Fig. 5A). In support of the latter theoretical possibility, the calculated molecular dimensions of the two transferases (15- to 25-nm diameter) potentially exceed the 20-nm diameter of intracisternal space (24Ladinsky M.S. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. Staehelin L.A. Golgi structure in three dimensions: functional insights from the normal rat kidney cell.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144 (10087259): 1135-114910.1083/jcb.144.6.1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To examine whether B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 indeed interact via cis or trans and what role the stem and catalytic domains have in the interactions, we deleted them separately, expressed the constructs in COS-7 cells, and measured their effect on the interactions using the FRET system. In the case of B4GALT1 homodimers, we found that deletion of the catalytic domain completely inhibited the interaction, indicating that B4GALT1 interacts with itself mainly via this domain (Fig. 5B). Removal of only the stem domain did not inhibit the interaction. Instead, we detected an even higher FRET signal with the stemless enzyme constructs, confirming that homomers form via catalytic domains (Fig. 5B). As the deletion truncates the enzyme size by 10–15 nm, they cannot reach each other from opposite membranes and can therefore only interact via lateral interactions. In the case of ST6GAL1 homodimer formation, neither removal of the catalytic domain nor of the stem domain had any effect on the interaction (Fig. 5B). This indicates that ST6GAL1 can interact with itself via both the stem and the catalytic domains. The reason for the increased FRET signal is not clear but may involve reduced spatial hindrance of the donor and acceptor fluorophores or reduced rigidity of the construct upon removal of the ST6GAL1 stem domain. Structural predictions of the stem domain revealed two α-helical domains that may make the stem domain more rigid. The fact that removal of the stem domain again did not inhibit formation of ST6GAL1 homomers suggests that ST6GAL1 homodimers assemble via lateral (cis) interactions. To investigate whether B4GALT1/ST6GAL1 heteromers utilize the cis or trans configuration for interaction, we expressed truncated enzyme constructs separately in COS-7 cells and measured the FRET signals for comparison. As expected, removal of the catalytic domain reduced heteromer formation by 90%, indicating that the two enzymes interact only via their catalytic domains. When one stemless construct was expressed with a WT partner (e.g. stemless B4GALT1–WT ST6GAL1 or WT B4GALT1–stemless ST6GAL1), we detected a 20% inhibition of the FRET signal. When both stem domains were removed, we found a cumulative 40% decrease in FRET signal. This loss was rescued when we inserted the B4GALT1 stem domain into the stemless ST6GAL1 construct (Fig. 5B). Because 60% of the stemless–stemless FRET signal still exists, it is our conclusion that heteromers can also interact laterally via cis configuration. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that the complexes also form via trans configuration. Glycan synthesis in the Golgi is not only dependent on the catalytic activity of the glycosyltransferases but also on their proper localization and their spatial and temporal interactions with each other. In addition, it has been shown recently that Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases also form complexes with nucleotide sugar transporters (7Khoder-Agha F. Sosicka P. Escriva Conde M. Hassinen A. Glumoff T. Olczak M. Kellokumpu S. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters form multi-enzyme-multi-transporter assemblies in Golgi membranes in vivo.Cell Mol.

This functional coupling between enzymes and their transporters is expected to enhance their catalytic activity and glycosylation efficiency, as each sugar residue can be transferred directly from the transporter to the enzyme and the acceptor substrate in the same complex before transferring the acceptor to the next complex. So far, structural data on Golgi heteromeric assemblies do not exist. This lack of information likely stems from the difficulties in getting such complexes to crystallize in vitro. In live cells, their formation needs special conditions (pH, redox state) provided by the Golgi lumen. In this study, we focused on identifying interaction surfaces needed for assembly of B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1 homomers and their heteromeric complexes. Both enzymes reside in and interact only after their arrival in the Golgi, whereas they both form homomers in the ER (6Hassinen A. Kellokumpu S. Organiza"

Here we present CaSSA, a platform to create unlimited genetic switches based on CRISPR/Cas9 (Ca) and the DNA repair mechanism known as single-strand annealing (SSA). CaSSA allows engineering of independent genetic switches, each responding to a specific gRNA. Expressing multiple gRNAs in specific patterns enables multiplex cell-type-specific manipulations and combinatorial genetic targeting.

https://openalex.org/W2967276982,"Few studies have described winter microclimate selection by bats in the southern United States. This is of particular importance as the cold-adapted fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes the fatal bat disease white-nose syndrome (WNS), continues to spread into southern United States. To better understand the suitability of winter bat habitats for the growth of P. destructans in this region, we collected roost temperature and vapor pressure deficit from 97 hibernacula in six ecoregions in Texas during winter 2016–17 and 2017–18. We also measured skin temperature of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii), Townsend’s big-eared bats (C. townsendii), big-brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius), cave myotis (M. velifer), tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), and Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) during hibernation to study their use of torpor in these habitats. We found that temperatures within hibernacula were strongly correlated with external air temperatures and were often within the optimal range of temperatures for P. destructans growth. Hibernacula and skin temperatures differed among species, with Rafinesque’s big-eared bats, southeastern myotis, and Mexican free-tailed bats occupying warmer microclimates and having higher torpid skin temperatures. For species that were broadly distributed throughout Texas, hibernacula and skin temperatures differed within species by ecoregion; Tri-colored bats and cave myotis in colder, northern regions occupied colder microclimates within hibernacula and exhibited colder skin temperatures, than individuals of the same species in warmer, southern regions. These data illustrate the variability in microclimates used as hibernacula by bats in Texas and suggest similar variation in susceptibility to WNS in the state. Thus, monitoring microclimates at winter roosts may help predict where WNS may develop, and where management efforts would be most effective."

Leaf morphology varied widely within each genetic subgroups. The 96 Japanese var. sinensis were classified into four genetic subgroups as follows; two subgroups of Shizuoka (the largest tea production region) landraces, Uji (most ancient tea production region) landraces, and the pedigree of ‘Yabukita’, the leading green tea cultivar in Japan. These results indicated that the SNP markers obtained from ddRAD-seq are a useful tool to investigate the geographical background and breeding history of Japanese tea.

https://openalex.org/W2967195830,"Background Multimorbidity is considered a major challenge for current health care. Lifestyle interventions, as a broad and generic approach, may have the potential to improve the management of care among patients with multimorbidity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of multimorbidity defined within the cardiometabolic disease domains with dietary patterns, representing habitual dietary intake. Design We studied 129 369 participants from the Lifelines Cohort study (42% male, 45±13 years (range 18–93)) in which diet was assessed using a 110-item food frequency questionnaire. A composite morbidity score was applied in multivariable ordered logistic regression to test the association with dietary patterns derived by principal components analysis, based on sex-specific dietary pattern scores. Results Four dietary patterns were retained, accounting for 26.6% of the variation in overall diet. After control for potential confounders, men and women in the highest quintile of “meat, alcohol and potato pattern” and “snack pattern” had a higher likelihood of having higher morbidity scores than those in the lowest quintile (e.g. men: OR = 1.83(95% CI:1.71–1.97), OR = 1.18(95% CI 1.11–1.27 respectively). The opposite was observed with respect to the “bread and sweets pattern” and “vegetable, fish and fruit pattern” (e.g. women: OR = 0.88(95% CI: 0.81–0.96), OR = 0.86(95% CI 0.81–0.92 respectively). The association partially attenuated after adjusting for BMI, but the associations remained significant among men. Conclusions Robust associations between dietary patterns and multimorbidity within the cardiometabolic domain, in particular a “meat, alcohol and potato pattern”, suggest an important opportunity of dietary interventions in multimobidity prevention. Generic prevention strategies based on population derived dietary patterns may have the potential to enhance lifestyle management among people with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2968601764,"Phagocytosis is a receptor-mediated process critical to innate immune clearance of pathogens. It proceeds in a regulated sequence of stages: (a) migration of phagocytes towards pathogens, (b) recognition of PAMPs and binding through PRRs, (c) engulfment and internalisation into phagosomes, (d) phagosome maturation, and (e) killing of pathogen or host cells. However, little is known about the role that individual receptors play in these discrete stages in the recognition of fungal cells. In a previous study, we found that dectin-2 deficiency impacted some but not all stages of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of Candida glabrata. Because the C-type lectin receptor dectin-2 critically requires coupling to the FcRγ chain for signalling, we hypothesised that this coupling may be important for regulating phagocytosis of fungal cargo. We therefore examined how deficiency in FcRγ itself or two receptors to which it couples (dectin-2 and mincle) impacts phagocytosis of six fungal organisms representing three different fungal taxa. Our data show that deficiency in these proteins impairs murine bone marrow-derived macrophage migration, engulfment, and phagosome maturation, but not macrophage survival. Therefore, FcRγ engagement with selective C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) critically affects the spatio-temporal dynamics of fungal phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2969178643,"Background Globally, Caesarean section (CS) rates are mounting and currently exceed the safe upper limit of 15%. Monitoring CS rates using clinical indications and obstetric sub-group analysis could confirm that women in need have been served. In Bangladesh, the reported CS rate was 31% in 2016, and almost twice that rate in urban settings. Delivering in the private healthcare sector was a strong determinant. This study uses Robson Ten Group Classification System (TGCS) to report CS rates in urban Bangladesh. The clinical causes and determining factors for CS births have also been examined. Methods This record linkage cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 34 urban for-profit private hospitals having CS facilities during the period June to August 2015. Data were supplied by inpatient case records and operation theatre registers. Descriptive analyses were performed to calculate the relative size of each group; the group-specific CS rate, and group contribution to total CS and overall CS rate. CS indications were grouped into eleven categories using ICD 10 codes. Binary logistic regression was performed to explore the determinants of CS. Results Out of 1307 births, delivery by CS occurred in 1077 (82%). Three obstetric groups contributed the most to overall CS rate: previous CS (24%), preterm (23%) and term elective groups (22%). The major clinical indications for CS were previous CS (35%), prolonged and obstructed labor (15%), fetal distress (11%) and amniotic fluid disorder (11%). Multiple gestation, non-cephalic presentation, previous bad obstetric history were positive predictors while oxytocin used for labour induction and increased parity were negative predictors of CS. Conclusions As the first ever study in urban private for-profit health facilities in Bangladesh, this study usefully identifies the burden of CS and where to intervene. Engagement of multiple stakeholders including the private sector is crucial in planning effective strategies for safe reduction of CS."

https://openalex.org/W2967358263,"Since introducing cell-free DNA screening, Sequenom Laboratories has analyzed over 1 million clinical samples. More than 30,000 of these samples were from multifetal gestations (including twins, triplets and higher-order multiples). The clinical laboratory experience with the first 30,000 multifetal samples will be discussed. Maternal plasma samples from multifetal gestations were subjected to DNA extraction and library preparation followed by massively parallel sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed to identify autosomal trisomies and other subchromosomal events. Fetal fraction requirements were adjusted in proportion to fetal number. Outcome data, when voluntarily received from the ordering provider, were collected from internal case notes. Feedback was received in 50 cases. The positivity rate in multifetal samples for trisomy 21 was 1.50%, 0.47% for trisomy 18, and 0.21% for trisomy 13. Average total sample fetal fraction was 12.2% at a mean gestational age of 13 weeks 6 days. Total non-reportable rate was 5.95%. Estimated performance based on ad hoc clinical feedback demonstrates that possible maximum sensitivity and specificity meet or exceed the original performance from clinical validation studies. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening provides certain advantages over that of conventional screening in multifetal gestations and is available in higher-order multiples."
https://openalex.org/W2967398531,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in growth, development, and stress responses. However, the regulatory function of miRNAs in early weaned goats remains unclear. Deep sequencing comparison of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles showed that 18 miRNAs and 373 genes were differentially expressed in pre- and post-weaning Chongming white goats. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes are involved in cellular processes, developmental processes, and growth in terms of biological process analysis. KEGG analysis showed that downregulated genes were enriched in salivary secretion, bile secretion, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and calcium signaling pathways. Additionally, a miRNA-mRNA co-expression network of the 18 dysregulated miRNAs and their 107 target mRNAs was constructed using a combination of Pearson’s correlation analysis and prediction by miRanda software. Among the downregulated miRNAs, two (chi-miR-206 and chi-miR-133a/b) were muscle development-related and the others were cell proliferation associated. Further RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that downregulated miRNAs (chi-miR-99b-3p, chi-miR-224, and chi-miR-10b-5p) were highly expressed in muscle tissues (heart, spleen, or kidney) of the rapid growth period (7-month old) in Chongming white goats. The results of the present study suggested that weaning induced cell proliferation repression in post-weaning goats, providing new insight into the mechanism of muscle development of goats, although additional details remain to be elucidated in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2967268807,"Background Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) was a novel marker of liver fibrosis. We aimed to investigate WFA+-M2BP level in assessing liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. Methods A total of 160 CHB patients, who received a liver biopsy, were consecutively recruited. Serum WFA+-M2BP level was quantified at the time point of biopsy. The results were compared with histopathological manifestations and clinical characteristics of the patients. Results The median WFA+-M2BP level, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index were 1.20 COI, 1.19, and 1.63, respectively. Fifty-one (31.9%) patients had advanced fibrosis. There was a significant increase of WFA+-M2BP levels in parallel to necroinflammation/fibrosis stages. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of WFA+-M2BP level for predicting fibrosis stages were 0.780 of F2, 0.785 of F3, and 0.769 of F4, respectively (all p <0.001). The multivariate analysis identified age (Odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.010–1.092, p = 0.014), platelet (OR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.980–0.998, p = 0.013), and WFA+-M2BP level (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.299–2.984, p = 0.001) as independent factors associated with advanced fibrosis. Combination of age, platelet and WFA+-M2BP level achieved a better diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis (AUROC: 0.732, accuracy: 81.3%) than APRI (AUROC: 0.577, accuracy: 63.8%) or FIB-4 index (AUROC: 0.691, accuracy: 75.6%). Conclusion WFA+-M2BP had a good performance indistinguishing liver fibrosis in CHB patients. The combination of age, platelet, and WFA+-M2BPaddressed more accuracy in identifying patients with advanced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2968709261,"Enteroviruses (EVs) are associated with a broad spectrum of disease manifestations, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, hand, foot and mouth disease, acute flaccid paralysis and acute flaccid myelitis with outbreaks being reported frequently world-wide. The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of all enteroviruses detected in Cyprus in the ten-year period from January 2008 and December 2017 as well as a description of the circulation patterns associated with the most frequently encountered genotypes. For this purpose, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, nasal swab, skin swab and/or stool samples from 2666 patients with a suspected EV infection were analysed between January 2008 and December 2017. Enteroviruses were detected in 295 (11.1%) patients, which were then investigated further for epidemiological analysis by VP1 genotyping. Overall, 24 different enterovirus types belonging to three different species were identified. The predominant species was EV-B (209/295, 71%), followed by species EV-A (77/295, 26.1%). Only one virus belonged to species EV-D, whereas EV-C enteroviruses were not identified at all. The most frequent genotypes identified were echovirus 30 (26.1%), echovirus 6 (14.2%) and coxsackievirus A6 (10.9%). While Echovirus 30 and echovirus 6 frequency was significantly higher in patients older than 3 years of age, the opposite was observed for CV-A16 and EV-A71, which dominated in young children less than 3 years. Importantly, for the current study period a significant increase of previously only sporadically observed EV-A types, such as EV-A71 and CV-A16 was noted. A phylogenetic analysis of EV-A71 showed that the majority of the EV-A71 strains from Cyprus belonged to sub-genogroup C1 and C2, with the exception of one C4 strain that was observed in 2011. The data presented provide a comprehensive picture of enteroviruses circulating in Cyprus over the last decade and will be helpful to clinicians and researchers involved in the treatment, prevention and control of enteroviral infections by helping interpret trends in enteroviral diseases by associating them with circulating serotypes, for studying the association of enteroviruses with clinical manifestations and develop strategies for designing future EV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2944422658,"We proposed a theoretical framework predicting mutualistic outcomes for the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis based on host provenance (crop versus wild). To test the framework, we grew two isolates of Rhizoglomus irregulare (commercial versus an isolate locally isolated), with five crop plants and five wild plants endemic to the region that co-occur with the locally sourced fungus. While inoculation with either isolate had no effect on plant biomass, it decreased leaf P content, particularly for wild plants. All plants associating with the commercial fungus had lower leaf P. Overall, our data shows that wild plants may be more sensitive to differences in mutualistic quality among fungal isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2967125994,"Over the past 30 years, the stony coral Acropora palmata has experienced an excessive loss of individuals showing few signs of recovery throughout the Mexican Caribbean, resulting in long stretches of coral rubble structures. When the coral dies, the skeleton begins to be colonized by algae, sponges, virus, bacteria and other microorganisms, forming a new community. Here we analyze, using a metagenomic approach, the diversity and biogeochemical cycles associated to coral rubble in La Bocana (Puerto Morelos, QRoo, Mexico). This study provides the first broad characterization of coral rubble associated communities and their role in biogeochemical cycling, suggesting a potential view of a world where coral reefs are no longer dominated by corals."
https://openalex.org/W2967211009,"A critical step in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases is the accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of peripheral tissues. The adhesion receptor integrin αDβ2 promotes the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes by supporting macrophage retention in inflamed tissue. We recently found that the end product of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oxidation, 2-(ω-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP), serves as a ligand for αDβ2. CEP adduct with ECM is generated during inflammation-mediated lipid peroxidation. The goal of this project was to identify a specific inhibitor for αDβ2–CEP interaction that can prevent macrophage accumulation. Using a specially designed peptide library, Biacore-detected protein–protein interaction, and adhesion of integrin-transfected HEK 293 cells, we identified a sequence (called P5 peptide) that significantly and specifically inhibited αD–CEP binding. In the model of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal inflammation, the injection of cyclic P5 peptide reduced 3-fold the macrophage accumulation in WT mice but had no effect in αD-deficient mice. The tracking of adoptively transferred, fluorescently labeled WT and αD−/− monocytes in the model of peritoneal inflammation and in vitro two-dimensional and three-dimensional migration assays demonstrated that P5 peptide does not affect monocyte transendothelial migration or macrophage efflux from the peritoneal cavity but regulates macrophage migration through the ECM. Moreover, the injection of P5 peptide into WT mice on a high-fat diet prevents macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue in an αDβ2-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of αDβ2-mediated macrophage adhesion for the accumulation of infiltrating macrophages in the inflamed ECM and propose P5 peptide as a potential inhibitor of atherogenesis and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2968463417,"IGF2:g.3072G>A polymorphism has been described as the causal mutation of a maternally imprinted QTL for muscle growth and fat deposition in pigs. The objective of the current work was to study the association between the IGF2:g.3072G>A polymorphism and the IGF2 gene expression and its effect on fatty acid composition in adipose tissue in different pig genetic backgrounds. A cis-eQTL region associated with the IGF2 mRNA expression in adipose tissue was identified in an eGWAS with 355 animals. The IGF2 gene was located in this genomic interval and IGF2g.3072G>A was the most significant SNP, explaining a 25% of the gene expression variance. Significant associations between IGF2:g.3072G>A polymorphism and oleic (C18:1(n-9); p-value = 4.18x10-07), hexadecanoic (C16:1(n-9); p-value = 4.04x10-07), linoleic (C18:2(n-6); p-value = 6.44x10-09), α-linoleic (C18:3(n-3); p-value = 3.30x10-06), arachidonic (C20:4(n-6); p-value = 9.82x10-08) FAs and the MUFA/PUFA ratio (p-value = 2.51x10-9) measured in backfat were identified. Animals carrying the A allele showed an increase in IGF2 gene expression and higher PUFA and lower MUFA content. However, in additional studies was observed that there could be other proximal genetic variants affecting FA composition in adipose tissue. Finally, no differences in the IGF2 gene expression in adipose tissue were found between heterozygous animals classified according to the IGF2:g.3072G>A allele inherited from the father (APGM or AMGP). However, pyrosequencing analysis revealed that there is imprinting of the IGF2 gene in muscle and adipose tissues, with stronger differences among the paternally and maternally inherited alleles in muscle. Our results suggested that IGF2:g.3072G>A polymorphism plays an important role in the regulation of IGF2 gene expression and can be involved in the fatty acid composition in adipose tissue. In both cases, further studies are still needed to deepen the mechanism of regulation of IGF2 gene expression in adipose tissue and the IGF2 role in FA composition."
https://openalex.org/W2967369717,"Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are a structurally diverse class of plant-specialized metabolites that have been particularly well-studied in the order Ranunculales. The N-methyltransferases (NMTs) in BIA biosynthesis can be divided into three groups according to substrate specificity and amino acid sequence. Here, we report the first crystal structures of enzyme complexes from the tetrahydroprotoberberine NMT (TNMT) subclass, specifically for GfTNMT from the yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum). GfTNMT was co-crystallized with the cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (dmin = 1.6 A), the product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (dmin = 1.8 A), or in complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and (S)-cis-N-methylstylopine (dmin = 1.8 A). These structures reveal for the first time how a mostly hydrophobic L-shaped substrate recognition pocket selects for the (S)-cis configuration of the two central six-membered rings in protoberberine BIA compounds. Mutagenesis studies confirm and functionally define the roles of several highly-conserved residues within and near the GfTNMT-active site. The substrate specificity of TNMT enzymes appears to arise from the arrangement of subgroup-specific stereospecific recognition elements relative to catalytic elements that are more widely-conserved among all BIA NMTs. The binding mode of protoberberine compounds to GfTNMT appears to be similar to coclaurine NMT, with the isoquinoline rings buried deepest in the binding pocket. This binding mode differs from that of pavine NMT, in which the benzyl ring is bound more deeply than the isoquinoline rings. The insights into substrate recognition and catalysis provided here form a sound basis for the rational engineering of NMT enzymes for chemoenzymatic synthesis and metabolic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2967998416,"Background In Kenya, Community Health Committees (CHC) were established to enhance community participation in health services. Their role is to provide leadership, oversight in delivery of community health services, promote social accountability and mobilize resources for community health. CHCs form social networks with other actors, with whom they exchange health information for decision-making and accountability. This case study aimed to explore the structure of a rural and an urban CHC network and to analyze how health-related information flowed in these networks. Understanding the pathways of information in community settings may provide recommendations for strategies to improve the role and functioning of CHCs. Methods In 2017, we conducted 4 focus group discussions with 27 community discussants and 10 semi-structured interviews with health professionals in a rural area and an urban slum. Using social network analysis, we determined the structure of their social networks and how health related information flowed in these networks. Results Both CHCs were composed of respected persons nominated by their communities. Each social network had 12 actors that represented both community and government institutions. CHCs were not central actors in the exchange of health-related information. Health workers, community health volunteers and local Chiefs in the urban slum often passed information between the different groups of actors, while CHCs hardly did this. Therefore, CHCs had little control over the flow of health-related information. Although CHC members were respected persons who served in multiple roles within their communities, this did not enhance their centrality. It emerged that CHCs were often left out in the flow of health-related information and decision-making, which led to demotivation. Community health volunteers were more involved by other actors such as health managers and non-governmental organizations as a conduit for health-related information. Conclusion Social network analysis demonstrated how CHCs played a peripheral role in the flow of health-related information. Their perception of being left out of the information flow led to demotivation, which hampered their ability to facilitate community participation in community health services; hence challenging effective participation through CHCs."
https://openalex.org/W2967179364,"Objective The American Urological Association guidelines recommend 24-hour urine testing in patients with urinary stone disease to decrease the risk of stone recurrence; however, national practice patterns for 24-hour urine testing are not well characterized. Our objective is to determine the prevalence of 24-hour urine testing in patients with urinary stone disease in the Veterans Health Administration and examine patient-specific and facility-level factors associated with 24-hour urine testing. Identifying variations in clinical practice can inform future quality improvement efforts in the management of urinary stone disease in integrated healthcare systems. Materials and methods We accessed national Veterans Health Administration data through the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), hosted by the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), to identify patients with urinary stone disease. We defined stone formers as Veterans with one inpatient ICD-9 code for kidney or ureteral stones, two or more outpatient ICD-9 codes for kidney or ureteral stones, or one or more CPT codes for kidney or ureteral stone procedures from 2007 through 2013. We defined a 24-hour urine test as a 24-hour collection for calcium, oxalate, citrate or sulfate. We used multivariable regression to assess demographic, geographic, and selected clinical factors associated with 24-hour urine testing. Results We identified 130,489 Veterans with urinary stone disease; 19,288 (14.8%) underwent 24-hour urine testing. Patients who completed 24-hour urine testing were younger, had fewer comorbidities, and were more likely to be White. Utilization of 24-hour urine testing varied widely by geography and facility, the latter ranging from 1 to 40%. Conclusions Fewer than one in six patients with urinary stone disease complete 24-hour urine testing in the Veterans Health Administration. In addition, utilization of 24-hour urine testing varies widely by facility identifying a target area for improvement in the care of patients with urinary stone disease. Future efforts to increase utilization of 24-hour urine testing and improve clinician awareness of targeted approaches to stone prevention may be warranted to reduce the morbidity and cost of urinary stone disease."
https://openalex.org/W2968052145,"Research suggests that survivors of interpersonal violence have an increasing experience of bodily symptoms. This study aims to scrutinise the association between lifetime abuse and somatic symptoms among older women and men, considering demographics/socio-economic, social support and health variables.A sample of 4,467 community-dwelling persons aged 60-84 years (57.3% women) living in seven European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Sweden) was recruited for this cross-sectional study. Lifetime abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial and injury) was assessed on the basis of the UK study of elder abuse and the Conflict Tactics Scale-2, while somatic symptoms were assessed by the Giessen Complaint List short version.Women reported somatic symptoms more frequently than men. Multiple regression analyses revealed that lifetime exposure to psychological abuse was associated with higher levels of somatic symptoms among both women and men, while experiencing lifetime sexual abuse was associated with somatic symptoms only among older women, after adjusting for other demographic and socio-economic variables. Country of residence, older age, and low socio-economic status were other independent factors contributing to a higher level of somatic symptoms.The positive association between the experience of abuse during lifetime and the reporting of higher levels of somatic symptoms, in particular among older women, seems to suggest that such complaints in later life might also be related to the experience of mistreatment and not only to ageing and related diseases. Violence prevention throughout lifetime could help to prevent somatic symptoms in later life."

LVDD animal models are limited and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) may cause LVDD, and we recently reported LVDD in an AVS rabbit model. Here we aimed to develop a rabbit model of LVDD without AVS.Rabbits were fed with a 0.5% cholesterol-enriched diet (n = 9) or normal diet (n = 8) until they developed LVDD defined by a value of the echocardiographic parameter E/Em ratio higher than the mean at baseline + 2SD. Rabbits were then fed a 0.2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 weeks (average total diet duration: 20 weeks). Detailed cardiac structure and function measurements were assessed by echocardiography at baseline, weeks 8, 12 and 14 to 20, when applicable. Histological analyses and RT-qPCR were performed on LV samples.The hypercholesterolemic diet induced LVDD without systolic dysfunction or AVS, as shown by multiple echocardiographic parameters, including early filling mitral peak velocity and deceleration rate, Em/Am ratio and E/Em ratio (all p<0.05), and by increased cardiac mRNA expression of brain natriuretic peptide (Bnp). Cardiac expression of mRNA for Nox2, Vcam1, Mmp12, Mmp12/Timp1, Il1b and Col1/Col3 ratios was also higher in these rabbits (p<0.05). In contrast, cardiac Sod2 mRNA expression was reduced in hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared to controls.Rabbits fed with a cholesterol-enriched diet develop LVDD with preserved systolic function and evidence of cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. This rabbit model may be used in future studies to test treatment strategies against LVDD."
https://openalex.org/W2968437537,"Drug-resistant strains of malaria parasites have emerged for most of antimalarial medications. A new chemotherapeutic compound is needed for malarial therapy. Antimalarial activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant P. falciparum has been reported for an isocryptolepine derivative, 8-bromo-2-fluoro-5-methyl-5H-indolo[3,2-c]quinoline (ICL-M), which also showed less toxicity to human cells. ICL-M has indoloquinoline as a core structure and its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we explored the mechanisms of ICL-M in P. falciparum by assessing the stage-specific activity, time-dependent effect, a proteomic analysis and morphology. Since human topo II activity inhibition has been reported as a function of isocryptolepine derivatives, malarial topo II activity inhibition of ICL-M was also examined in this study. The ICL-M exhibited antimalarial activity against both the ring and trophozoite stages of P. falciparum. Our proteomics analysis revealed that a total of 112 P. falciparum proteins were differentially expressed after ICL-M exposure; among these, 58 and 54 proteins were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Proteins localized in the food vacuole, nucleus, and cytoplasm showed quantitative alterations after ICL-M treatment. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that pathways associated with ribosomes, proteasomes, metabolic pathways, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbon metabolism were significantly different in P. falciparum treated with ICL-M. Moreover, a loss of ribosomes was clearly observed by transmission electron microscopy in the ICL-M-treated P. falciparum. This finding is in agreement with the proteomics data, which revealed downregulated levels of ribosomal proteins following ICL-M treatment. Our results provide important information about the mechanisms by which ICL-M affects the malaria parasite, which may facilitate the drug development of isocryptolepine derivatives."

However, the mechanism for RTP1S-mediated OR trafficking remains unclear. In this study, we attempted to reveal the mode of action and critical residues of RTP1S in OR trafficking. Experiments using N-terminal truncation and Ala substitution mutants of RTP1S demonstrated that four N-terminal amino acids have essential roles in OR trafficking. Additionally, using recombinant proteins and split luciferase assays in mammalian cells, we provided evidence for the dimer formation of RTP1S. Furthermore, we determined that the 2nd Cys residue is required for the efficient dimerization of RTP1S.

https://openalex.org/W2967356608,"The portfolio of cytokines is key to the function of macrophages as sentries of the innate immune system as well as being critical for the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Cytokine bias is critical in the fate of macrophages into a continuum of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory macrophages. Due to advances in the field of toxicology, increasingly advanced multi-cellular in vitro safety assessment models are being developed in order to allow for a better predication of potential adverse effects in humans with many of these models include a macrophage population. The selection of the correct macrophage cells in these advanced in vitro models is critical for a physiologically relevant and realistic immune response. In this study we investigated cytokine response profile (IL1-β, IL6, IL10 and TNF-α) of activated and non-activated THP-1 (immortalized monocyte-like cell line), primary human Kupffer cells (liver resident macrophages) and human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells following exposure of a panel of nanomaterials or ethanol. The data demonstrated that the THP-1 cell line are not great cytokine producers. The PBMC appear to be a good in vitro surrogate for circulating/pro-inflammatory macrophages but are not a suitable replacement for Kupffer cells. The findings from this study highlight the necessity for the selection of appropriate macrophages populations to meet the specific physiological requirements of in vitro experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2967638115,"Here, we have investigated the possible effect of UV-B light on the folding/unfolding properties and stability of Arabidopsis thaliana MYB4 (AtMYB4) transcription factor in vitro by using biophysical approaches. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding analyses have shown relatively higher stability of the wild-type recombinant AtMYB4 protein than the N-terminal deletion forms after UV-B exposure. However, as compared to wild-type form, AtMYB4Δ2 protein, lacking both the two N-terminal MYB domains, showed appreciable alteration in the secondary structure following UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiated AtMYB4Δ2 also displayed higher propensity of aggregation in light scattering experiments, indicating importance of the N-terminal modules in regulating the stability of AtMYB4 under UV-B stress. DNA binding assays have indicated specific binding activity of AtMYB4 to a putative MYB4 binding motif located about 212 bp upstream relative to transcription start site of AtMYB4 gene promoter, while relatively weak DNA binding activity was detected for another putative MYB4 motif located at -908 bp in AtMYB4 promoter. Gel shift and fluorescence anisotropy studies have shown increased binding affinity of UV-B exposed AtMYB4 to the promoter proximal MYB4 motif. ChIP assay has revealed binding of AtMYB4 to the promoter proximal (-212 position) MYB4 motif (ACCAAAC) in vivo. Docking experiments further revealed mechanistic detail of AtMYB4 interaction with the putative binding motifs. Overall, our results have indicated that the N-terminal 62-116 amino acid residues constituting the second MYB domain plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the C-terminal region and the overall stability of the protein, while a promoter proximal MYB-motif in AtMYB4 promoter may involve in the regulation of its own expression under UV-B light."
https://openalex.org/W2967936393,"The Mickey Mouse problem refers to the difficulty in predicting which supernatural agents are capable of eliciting belief and religious devotion. We approached the problem directly by asking participants to invent a ""religious"" or a ""fictional"" agent with five supernatural abilities. Compared to fictional agents, religious agents were ascribed a higher proportion of abilities that violated folk psychology or that were ambiguous-violating nonspecific or multiple domains of folk knowledge-and fewer abilities that violated folk physics and biology. Similarly, participants rated folk psychology violations provided by the experimenter as more characteristic of religious agents than were violations of folk physics or folk biology, while fictional agents showed no clear pattern. Religious agents were also judged as more potentially beneficial, and more ambivalent (i.e., similar ratings of benefit and harm), than fictional agents, regardless of whether the agents were invented or well-known to participants. Together, the results support a motivational account of religious belief formation that is facilitated by these biases."
https://openalex.org/W2968358558,"Studies from the social and health sciences have tended to view the household as the locus of access to and distribution of care, resources, monitoring and modeling for children's wellbeing. Obesity may present a special case for the study of investments in children, being a component of health for which more of certain inputs may not lead to better outcomes. We expanded on common measures of household structure in the child health literature by considering co-residence and relatedness of parents, grandparents, other relatives, and other children. Data were from a longitudinal sample of 6,700 children participating in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), the largest U.S. national dataset with measures of child anthropometrics and household structure at seven time-points over nine years. We used lagged survey-adjusted regressions to estimate associations between household structure and subsequent changes in children's weight between ages 5 and 14 years in terms of BMI gain and incident obesity. Adjusting for household structure more thoroughly, children living in households with two parents rather than one parent did not experience advantages in terms of less excess weight gain or lower incidence of obesity during elementary and middle school. Children living with a grandmother gained more weight than children not living with a grandmother. Living with siblings and with non-related adults was associated with less weight gain. These findings corroborate a scenario in which, for health problems associated with caloric surplus, classic household factors have more complex associations with child wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2967086865,"We showed previously an epinephrine-induced inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase in Caco-2 cells mediated via PGE2. This work is an attempt to further elucidate mediators downstream of PGE2 and involved in the observed inhibitory effect. The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase was assayed by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated in presence and absence of ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Changes in the protein expression of the Na+/K+ ATPase were investigated by western blot analysis which revealed a significant decrease in the abundance of the ATPase in plasma membranes. Treating the cells with epinephrine or PGE2 in presence of SC19220, a blocker of EP1 receptors abolished completely the effect of the hormone and the prostaglandin while the effect was maintained unaltered in presence of antagonists to all other receptors. Treatment with calphostin C, PTIO, ODQ or KT5823, respective inhibitors of PKC, NO, soluble guanylate cyclase and PKG, abrogated completely the effect of epinephrine and PGE2, suggesting an involvement of these mediators. A significant inhibition of the ATPase was observed when cells were treated with PMA, an activator of PKC or with 8-Br-cGMP, a cell permeable cGMP analogue. PMA did reduce the protein expression of IκB, as shown by western blot analysis, and its effect on the ATPase was not manifested in presence of an inhibitor of NF-κB while that of SNAP, a nitric oxide donor, was not affected. The results infer that NF-κB is downstream PKC and upstream NO. The data support a pathway in which epinephrine induces the production of PGE2 which binds to EP1 receptors and activates PKC and NF-κB leading to NO synthesis. The latter activates soluble guanylate cyclase resulting in cGMP production and activation of PKG which through direct or indirect phosphorylation inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase by inducing its internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2968020594,"Gut dysbiosis has been associated with worse allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) outcomes. We reported an association between intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci (iVRE: E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus) gut colonization and lower post-transplant mortality. In this study, using an expanded cohort, we evaluated whether our previously observed association is species-specific. We included allo-HCT recipients with ≥1 positive rectal swab or stool culture for iVRE between days -14 and +14 of transplant. To investigate whether iVRE modulate the gut microbiota, we performed agar diffusion assays. To investigate whether iVRE differ in their ability to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, we analyzed iVRE genomes for enzymes in the shikimate and tryptophan pathways. Sixty six (23 E. casseliflavus and 43 E. gallinarum) of the 908 allograft recipients (2011–2017) met our inclusion criteria. Overall survival was significantly higher in patients with E. casseliflavus (91% vs. 62% at 3 years, P = 0.04). In multivariable analysis, E. casseliflavus gut colonization was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.04–0.91, P = 0.04). While agar assays were largely unremarkable, genome mining predicted that E. casseliflavus encodes a larger number of enzymes in the tryptophan metabolism pathway. In conclusion, E. casseliflavus gut colonization is associated with reduced post-HCT morality. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms for this association."
https://openalex.org/W2968456407,"As a result of a high-throughput in situ hybridization screening for adult mouse testes, we found that the mRNA for Tmco5 is expressed in round and elongating spermatids. Tmco5 belongs to the Tmco (Transmembrane and coiled-coil domains) gene family and has a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal and a transmembrane domain in the C-terminal region. A monoclonal antibody raised against recombinant TMCO5 revealed that the protein is expressed exclusively in the elongating spermatids of step 9 to 12 and is localized to the manchette, a transiently emerging construction, which predominantly consists of cytoskeleton microtubules and actin filaments. This structure serves in the transport of Golgi-derived non-acrosomal vesicles. Moreover, induced expression of TMCO5 in CHO cells resulted in the co-localization of TMCO5 with β-tubulin besides the reorganization of the Golgi apparatus. Judging from the results and considering the domain structure of TMCO5, we assume that Tmco5 may have a role in vesicle transport along the manchette."
https://openalex.org/W2967623571,"Cytokeratin 19 (KRT19) protein is highly expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hepatobiliary tissues, and pancreas of humans and mice. In the present study, we used an improved Cre (iCre) gene to enhance the efficiency of Cre expression in mammalian cells. We established a new transgenic Krt19-iCre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mouse model using the BAC recombineering strategy. Site-specific iCre expression pattern was examined in embryos, adults, and elderly Krt19-iCre mice crossed with Tomato or LacZ reporter mice. Both iCre and reporter protein expressions in adult Krt19-iCre;Tomatoflox/+ (Krt19-iCre Tomato reporter) mice were observed mainly in the epithelial cells of the GI tract, hepatobiliary tissues, and pancreas. However, the expression in the intrahepatic and small pancreatic duct were lower than those in the common bile and large pancreatic duct. In the Krt19-iCre; LacZ reporter embryos, β-galactosidase for the LacZ reporter was expressed in the glandular epithelial cells of the GI tract in 9.5-day embryos, 12-day embryos, and newborn mice. The reporter protein expression in Krt19-iCre-Tomato reporter mice was consistent with the KRT19 expression in human GI tissues. In conclusion, Krt19-iCre BAC transgenic mice can be used to investigate developmental and pathological conditions using the iCre-loxP system."
https://openalex.org/W2968264860,"In the United States, there is no reliable data to describe the prevalence of eye diseases leading to visual impairment and little active surveillance to address this knowledge gap. Data that is readily available from many state blind registries may provide helpful information on trends and causes of blindness. We analyzed new registrations with the Oregon Commission for the Blind (OCB) and Oregon State Department of Administrative Services (DAS) from 1961 to 2016 for causes of and trends in blindness. Persons with blindness self-refer into the OCB registry and the Oregon State Department of Administrative Services (DAS) includes those receiving social security disability financial support and other state services. Data for 9,273 blind persons registered were analyzed. The most frequent causes of blindness were age related macular degeneration (AMD) 3,308 (38%), followed by diabetic retinopathy (DR) 729 (8%), congenital conditions 697 (8%), optic nerve atrophy 611 (7%), glaucoma 549 (6%), retinitis pigmentosa 546 (6%), retinopathy of prematurity192 (2%), cataract 180 (2%), and trauma 174 (2%). The mean age of onset of blindness was younger for Blacks (31 years) and Hispanics (33 years) than for Whites (44 years). Analysis of state-based registries can provide useful and locally relevant vision and eye health data where little information is otherwise available."
https://openalex.org/W2968274475,"Serum levels of Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) have been shown to be biomarker for prediction of the quantitative aspects of ovarian reserve. On the male side, sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) DNA fragmentation index (DFI) has been demonstrated to be an important predictor of outcomes in standard IVF procedures but to less degree in intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures (ICSI). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the combination of female AMH serum levels and sperm DFI adds to prediction of the outcome of assisted reproduction. A total of 352 couples was included (ICSI-148: IVF-204) A venous blood sample was drawn for AMH analysis before IVF/ICSI treatment. DFI was measured in the ejaculate used for assisted reproduction. Regression models for the following odds ratio calculations were constructed: for obtaining at least one Good Quality Embryo; for live birth in all procedures; for pregnancy in procedures where embryo transfer was performed; for miscarriage. For DFI increase by 10 percentage points (not increased DFI as reference) odds ratio for Good Quality Embryo was statistically significantly lower when AMH was at lower quartile (AMH <12 pmol/L; OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14-0.59,) but not when AMH was at upper quartile (AMH ≥ 36 pmol/L; OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.43-2.13,). The marginal effect of an increase in DFI by 10 percentage points was statistically significant only when AMH < 25.2 pmol/L. Similar results were obtained as considers live birth following standard IVF. No interactions were seen for standard IVF in relation to the risk of miscarriage and for any of the outcomes when ICSI was used as method of treatment. We conclude that the impact of high DFI on the outcome of standard IVF is most pronounced if the female partner has relatively low AMH levels. This finding may help in defining the role of sperm DNA integrity testing in management of infertile couples. It may also explain some of the heterogeneity in results of studies focusing on predictive value of DFI measurements in assisted reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2968459227,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening for early detection of prostate cancer is common although it is associated with both benefits and potential harms (e.g., the risk of overdiagnosis). Evidence-based health information could help individuals make informed decisions about whether to undergo PSA testing or not. This evaluation aimed to determine whether the written health information materials available in Germany provide appropriate information for informed decision-making on PSA based screening.A list of criteria was developed and used to systematically assess the quality of information on the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening included in written health information materials. Fourteen information materials identified by information requests and online searches were evaluated independently by two of three reviewers. Consensus was achieved with a third reviewer.Of the 14 information materials evaluated, 10 (71%) list the ability to reduce the absolute risk of death from prostate cancer as a benefit of PSA testing, 9 (64%) point out the risks of follow-up diagnostics, 13 (93%) describe the risks of the available prostate cancer treatments, and all 14 specify the risk of overdiagnosis. The minority provide numerical data on benefits and risks. Partially mismatched framing was identified in four cases: two information materials report only the relative frequencies of benefits, and two report only the absolute frequencies of harms. Half of the materials encouraged participation using downplaying or frightening language.The majority of health information materials in Germany describe the benefits and harms of PSA based screening, including overdiagnosis, but often lack adequate balance, neutrality and numbers."
https://openalex.org/W2968377275,"Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that provide mechanical support for cellular structures, and play important roles in cell division, migration, and intracellular transport. Their intrinsic dynamic instability, primarily controlled by polymerization-dependent GTP hydrolysis, allows for rapid rearrangements of microtubule arrays in response to signaling cues. In neurons, increases in intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can protect against microtubule loss and axonal degeneration elicited by axonal transection. The protective effects of NAD+ on microtubule loss have been shown to be indirect in some systems, for example through the sirtuin-3 pathway. However, it is still possible that NAD+ and related metabolites have direct effects on microtubule dynamics to promote assembly or inhibit disassembly. To address this question, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in an in vitro assay with purified bovine brain tubulin and examined the effects of NAD+, NADH, and NMN. We found that the compounds had only small effects on the dynamics at the plus and minus ends of the microtubules. Furthermore, these effects were not statistically significant. Consequently, our data support earlier findings that NADs and their precursors influence microtubule growth through indirect mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2967223386,"In Ebstein's anomaly, maximal expansion in the atrialized right ventricle (RV) occurs during early diastole, whereas that of the functional RV occurs in late diastole, resulting in diastolic dyssynchronous expansion (DSE). We quantitatively assessed DSE and identified preoperative factors correlated with persistent DSE after surgery. Seventeen patients diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly in whom transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images available were retrospectively analyzed for quantitative DSE assessment and 10 patients who underwent surgery and postoperative TTE available were additionally analyzed for postoperative DSE. Severity of DSE was assessed by the time difference of maximal expansion between the atrialized and functional RV divided by the cardiac cycle length × 100 (""DSE index""). Relations between DSE and, clinical, electrophysiologic parameters and the severity of tricuspid valve (TV) tethering (the RV length / tethering height during diastole: ""Tethering index"") were assessed. In total patients, median DSE index and tethering index were 30.3 and 2.1 respectively, and the DSE index was correlated with tethering index (rs = 0.664, P = 0.004). In 10 patients who underwent surgery, this association remained after surgery and at 2-year follow up. Tethering index ≥2.5 separated patients with and without persistent DSE. In conclusion, DSE exists in Ebstein's anomaly. DSE index is related to the tethering index and DSE persists postoperatively if tethering index ≥ 2.5. As the persistent DSE might possibly impede the optimal recovery of RV function after surgery, severity of TV tethering should take into account in considering surgery."
