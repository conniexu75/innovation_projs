https://openalex.org/W1484860178,"Abstract The formation of cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells in arterial tissue may occur by the uptake of modified lipoproteins via the pathway. The macrophage receptor, also called the acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) receptor, has been reported to recognize Ac-LDL as well as oxidized LDL species such as endothelial cell-modified LDL (EC-LDL). We now report that there is another class of macrophage receptors that recognizes EC-LDL but not Ac-LDL. We performed assays of 0 degrees C binding and 37 degrees C degradation of 125I-Ac-LDL and 125I-EC-LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages. Competition studies showed that unlabeled Ac-LDL could compete for only 25% of the binding and only 50% of the degradation of 125I-EC-LDL. Unlabeled EC-LDL, however, competed for greater than 90% of 125I-EC-LDL binding and degradation. Unlabeled Ac-LDL was greater than 90% effective against 125I-Ac-LDL; EC-LDL competed for about 80% of 125I-Ac-LDL binding and degradation. Copper-oxidized LDL behaved the same as EC-LDL in all the competition studies. Copper-mediated oxidation of Ac-LDL produced a superior competitor which could now displace 90% of 125I-EC-LDL binding. After 5 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of ligand, macrophages accumulated six times more cell-associated radioactivity from 125I-EC-LDL than from 125I-Ac-LDL, despite approximately equal amounts of degradation to trichloroacetic acid-soluble products, which may imply different intracellular processing of the two lipoproteins. Our results suggest that 1) there is more than one macrophage scavenger receptor for modified lipoproteins; and 2) oxidized LDL and Ac-LDL are not identical ligands with respect to macrophage recognition and uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1577117187,"The N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (P450I-IE1) is induced severalfold in liver by giving rats ethanol, acetone, pyrazole, and other related small molecular weight compounds. This induction is not the result of an increase in IIE1 mRNA, but could be due to either an increase in translation rate or a decrease in protein degradation. To determine the mechanism of induction, we measured IIE1 synthesis and degradation rates in untreated and acetone-treated rats. This was accomplished by immunopurification of radiolabeled IIE1 protein using a specific monoclonal antibody subsequent to in vivo labeling of total cellular protein with either NaH14CO3 or [3H]leucine. We found that in rats fed acetone, the rate of IIE1 synthesis was not changed; however, IIE1 degradation was markedly altered. In untreated rats, IIE1 protein was degraded via a biphasic pathway consisting of both a rapid and slow component with approximate half-lives of 7 and 37 h, respectively. However, in acetone-treated rats, only a monophasic curve with a half-life of 37 h was observed. The abolition of the rapid degradation component of the IIE1 turnover cycle indicates that induction of IIE1 by acetone is primarily due to specific stabilization of IIE1 protein. Since acetone is also metabolized by IIE1, we believe that this may be a substrate-induced enzyme stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1596187806,"Stopped-flow techniques were used to investigate the kinetics of the formation of manganese peroxidase compound I (MnPI) and of the reactions of MnPI and manganese peroxidase compound II (MnPII) with p-cresol and MnII. All of the rate data were obtained from single turnover experiments under pseudo-first order conditions. In the presence of H2O2 the formation of MnPI is independent of pH over the range 3.12-8.29 with a second-order rate constant of (2.0 +/- 0.1) x 10(6) M-1 s-1. The activation energy for MnPI formation is 20 kJ mol-1. MnPI formation also occurs with organic peroxides such as peracetic acid, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, and p-nitroperoxybenzoic acid with second-order rate constants of 9.7 x 10(5), 9.5 x 10(4), and 5.9 x 10(4) M-1 s-1, respectively. The reactions of MnPI and MnPII with p-cresol strictly obeyed second-order kinetics. The second-order rate constant for the reaction of MnPII with p-cresol is extremely low, (9.5 +/- 0.5) M-1 s-1. Kinetic analysis of the reaction of MnII with MnPI and MnPII showed a binding interaction with the oxidized enzymes which led to saturation kinetics. The first-order dissociation rate constants for the reaction of MnII with MnPI and MnPII are (0.7 +/- 0.1) and (0.14 +/- 0.01) s-1, respectively, when the reaction is conducted in lactate buffer. Rate constants are considerably lower when the reactions are conducted in succinate buffer. Single turnover experiments confirmed that MnII serves as an obligatory substrate for MnPII and that both oxidized forms of the enzyme form productive complexes with MnII. Finally, these results suggest the alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactate facilitate the dissociation of MnIII from the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1508943936,"Fucoidan, poly(L-fucopyranose) linked primarily alpha 1----2 with either a C3- or a C4-sulfate, is an effective anticoagulant in vitro and in vivo (Springer, G. F., Wurzel, H. A., McNeal, G. M., Jr., Ansell, N. J., and Doughty, M. F. (1957) Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 94, 404-409). We have determined the antithrombin effects of fucoidan on the glycosaminoglycan-binding plasma proteinase inhibitors antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II. Fucoidan enhances the heparin cofactor II-thrombin reaction more than 3500-fold. The apparent second-order rate constant of thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II increases from 4 x 10(4) (in the absence of fucoidan) to 1.5 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 as the fucoidan concentration increases from 0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml and then decreases as fucoidan is increased above 10 micrograms/ml. The fucoidan reaction with heparin cofactor II-thrombin is kinetically equivalent to a template model. Apparent fucoidan-heparin cofactor II and fucoidan-thrombin dissociation constants are 370 and 1 nM, respectively. The enhancement of thrombin inhibition by fucoidan, like heparin and dermatan sulfate, is eliminated by selective chemical modification of lysyl residues either of heparin cofactor II or of thrombin. The fucoidan-antithrombin III reactions with thrombin and factor Xa are accelerated maximally 285- and 35-fold at fucoidan concentrations of 30 and 500 micrograms/ml, respectively. Using human plasma and 125I-labeled thrombin in an ex vivo system, the heparin cofactor II-thrombin complex is formed preferentially over the antithrombin III-thrombin complex in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml fucoidan. Our results indicate that heparin cofactor II is activated by fucoidan in vitro and in an ex vivo plasma system and suggest that the major antithrombin activity of fucoidan in vivo is mediated by heparin cofactor II and not by antithrombin III."

https://openalex.org/W1534816195,"Abstract Collagen VI expression was studied in cultured human skin fibroblasts and mouse 3T3 cells using cDNA probes specific for alpha 1(VI), alpha 2(VI), and alpha 3(VI) chains. A 2-3-fold increase of these mRNAs was observed when fibroblasts were grown at increasing densities while only minimal changes occurred for the mRNA levels of collagens I and III, fibronectin, and beta-actin. Changes in mRNA correlated well with an increased production of corresponding proteins as determined by immunological assays. A comparable increase of alpha 1(VI) and alpha 2(VI) but not of alpha 3(VI) chain mRNAs was found for fibroblasts grown in a three-dimensional collagen gel after gel contraction. These conditions resulted, however, in a decrease of steady-state levels of collagens I and III and actin mRNAs. Transformation of 3T3 cells by phorbol ester did not change collagen VI mRNAs but caused a 3-5-fold reduction in mRNA levels for the other extracellular matrix proteins. These data strongly imply different regulatory mechanisms for the expression of collagen VI compared with collagens I and III and fibronectin. The differences may be correlated to changes in cell shape and reflect the requirement for collagen VI as a cell-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1509507343,"The purification, cloning, and complete cDNA-derived sequence of a 17-kDa protein of Dictyostelium discoideum are described. This protein binds to F-actin in a pH-dependent and saturable manner. It induces actin polymerization in the absence of Mg2+ or K+, and is enriched in the submembranous region of the amoeboid cells as indicated by immunofluorescence labeling of cryosections. The mRNA as well as the protein are present throughout growth and all stages of development. The protein is detected in both soluble and particulate fractions of the cells. From a plasma membrane-enriched fraction, minor amounts of the protein are stepwise solubilized with 1.5 M KCl, 0.1 M NaOH, and Triton X-100, but most of the protein is only solubilized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. As judged by the apparent molecular mass in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, immunological cross-reactivity, and two-dimensional electrophoresis, the 17-kDa proteins from the soluble and particulate fraction resemble each other. The cDNA sequence does not reveal any signal peptide, trans-membrane region, or N-glycosylation site. Southern blots hybridized with a cDNA probe that spans the entire coding region show that the 17-kDa protein is encoded by a single gene. The most characteristic feature of the protein is its high content of 31 histidine residues out of 118 amino acids. We designate this protein as hisactophilin and suggest that this histidine-rich protein responds in its actin-binding activity to changes in cellular pH upon chemotactic signal reception."
https://openalex.org/W1551286813,"A methotrexate (MTX)-resistant human colon carcinoma cell line was obtained by growing HCT-8 cells in stepwise increasing concentrations of the drug. The resistant subline (HCT-8R4) was able to grow in the presence of 1 x 10(-4) M MTX and was found to have a 25-fold increase in the level of the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), with a corresponding increase in DHFR gene copies as well as DHFR transcripts. Southern blot analysis of DNA from HCT-8R4 cells revealed the amplification of an altered gene. The amplified DHFR gene lacks an EcoRI restriction enzyme site in the coding region, normally present in other human cell lines. Sequence analysis of cDNA synthesized from transcripts in the MTX-resistant cell line revealed a base transition T----C at nucleotide position 91 resulting in a substitution of serine for phenylalanine. The dissociation constant for MTX binding to the HCT-8R4 enzyme was 1.25 nM, an 8-fold increase from the Kd 150 pM of purified wild type human DHFR. This decrease in binding of MTX to the HCT-8R4 DHFR is consistent with the predicted involvement of phenylalanine in the DHFR active site in hydrophobic interactions with MTX. This mutation plus the 25-fold increase in DHFR activity explains the high level of resistance of this subline to MTX."
https://openalex.org/W1546324908,"Subunit IIa of mammalian RNA polymerase II contains at its C terminus 52 tandem repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. This domain is unmodified in RNA polymerase IIA, extensively phosphorylated in RNA polymerase IIO, and absent from RNA polymerase IIB. In an effort to define the role of the C-terminal domain, we have measured the transcriptional activity of purified RNA polymerases IIO, IIA, and IIB. The ability of each polymerase subspecies to transcribe the major late promoter of adenovirus-2 was examined in a polymerase-dependent transcription system reconstituted from partially purified transcription factors. RNA polymerases IIO, IIA, and IIB are all capable of initiating specific transcripts from this promoter. The transcriptional activity was determined as a function of the concentration of RNA polymerase II, template DNA, and each of the essential general transcription factors. The transcriptional activities of RNA polymerases IIA and IIB were comparable and consistently greater than that of RNA polymerase IIO when assayed under the conditions described here. The kinetics of transcript formation is similar except that RNA polymerase IIO has a more pronounced lag. These results show that the C-terminal domain of subunit IIa is not essential for the accurate initiation of transcripts from the major late promoter of adenovirus-2 and that the effect of the C-terminal domain is not likely mediated by the general transcription factors required for the expression of class II genes."
https://openalex.org/W1601027690,"It has been hypothesized that genomic instability is an important component of tumorigenesis. In an attempt to establish this relationship, we determined the frequencies with which two nontumorigenic and four tumorigenic rat liver epithelial cell lines underwent a particular type of genetic instability, gene amplification. By exposing cells to N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a drug which specifically inhibits the aspartate transcarbamylase activity of the multifunctional CAD enzyme and selects for amplification of the CAD gene, we observed a striking parallel between the ability of these cell lines to become resistant to this drug and the ability of these same cells to form tumors after injection into day-old syngeneic rats. Cells of one highly tumorigenic line became resistant to PALA greater than 70 times more often than those of a non-tumorigenic line. Molecular analyses of eight independent PALA-resistant subclones confirmed that, in each case, this resistance was due to amplification of the CAD gene. Thus, our results demonstrate the relationship between tumorigenicity and at least one measure of genomic instability, CAD gene amplification. The method developed in this study provides a quantitative, rapid indicator of tumorigenicity and should prove useful in trying to elucidate the underlying basis of genomic instability in neoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1484870362,"Abstract Many studies have shown that the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni contains glycoproteins whose oligosaccharide side chains are antigenic in infected hosts. We report here that adult male schistosomes synthesize glycoproteins containing complex-type N-linked chains that have structural features not commonly found in mammalian glycoproteins. Adult male worms were incubated in media containing either [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]galactose, and the metabolically radiolabeled oligosaccharides on newly synthesized glycoproteins were analyzed. Schistosomes synthesize triantennary- and biantennary-like complex-type asparagine-linked chains that contain mannose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Interestingly, none of the complex-type chains contain sialic acid, and few of the chains contain galactose. Since N-acetylgalactosamine is not a common constituent of mammalian-derived N-linked chains, we investigated the position and linkage of this residue in the schistosome-derived glycopeptides. Virtually all of the N-acetylgalactosamine was beta-linked and in a terminal position. The unusual features of the S. mansoni glycoprotein oligosaccharides support the possibility that they may be involved in the host immune response to infection."

https://openalex.org/W1481258397,"Abstract By use of anti-cytosolic fumarase antibody, a cDNA clone was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11 and in the pBR 322 vector. A clone with an insert of about 1.7 kilobases was isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the insert revealed that the cDNA contained a 5'-noncoding region of 25 nucleotides, the coding region of 1,521 nucleotides, and a 3'-nontranslated region of 43 nucleotides followed by a poly(A)+ tail. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 507-amino acid residues (predicted Mr = 54,462), which contained an additional sequence of 41-amino acid residues on the NH2 terminus of the mitochondrial mature fumarase (the presequence). Thus, this reading frame was concluded to encode the precursor of mitochondrial fumarase. The amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence contained all the amino acid sequences of 12 proteolytic polypeptides produced by digestion of purified mitochondrial fumarase with V8 protease. The total amino acid sequence of the mitochondrial fumarase also contained all the sequences of 14 proteolytic peptides obtained from the cytosolic fumarase, indicating that the amino acid sequences of these two isozymes are identical. Furthermore, the results obtained by hybrid-selected translation, Northern and Southern blot, and primer-extension analyses using appropriate cDNA segments prepared with fumarase cDNA (1.7 kilobases) as a probe or primer suggested that the mitochondrial and cytosolic fumarases with identical amino acid sequences are encoded from a single gene and a possibility that the precursors of both these fumarases were synthesized by one species of mRNA having a base sequence coding the presequence of the mitochondrial fumarase by some unknown post-transcriptional mechanism(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1572943262,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) causes pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) to undergo a number of physiological changes which mimic the differentiated neuronal cell, including neurite extension. We have examined protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) as a potential signaling mechanism in NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth and induction of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) can activate protein kinase C and induce ornithine decarboxylase in PC12 cells with kinetics which are similar to those of NGF induction, but only to levels about 10-fold lower. The induction of ornithine decarboxylase by both NGF and PMA is inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D suggesting that both agents increase enzyme activity by increasing gene transcription. The evidence presented here, however, shows that the induction produced by the two agents is through two different pathways. First, maximal induction by NGF is increased when PMA is included in the media showing that the two effects are synergistic. Second, NGF does not cause induction of ornithine decarboxylase in the mutant PC12nnr5 cell line (Green, S.H., Rydel, R.E., Connolly, J.L., and Greene, L.A. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1967-1978) while added PMA does produce an induction of the enzyme. Finally, when protein kinase C is down-regulated by incubating PC12 cells with PMA in serum-containing or serum-free medium for 24 h, the induction by PMA is completely inhibited, while the NGF induction is not affected. A recent study (Hall, F.L., Fernyhough, P., Ishii, D.N., and Vulliet, P.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4460-4466) using sphingosine inhibition concluded that protein kinase C was required for NGF-stimulated neuritogenesis. In contrast, results presented here show that down-regulation of protein kinase C also has no effect on NGF-mediated neurite extension in PC12 cells grown in serum-free medium. Our data demonstrate that induction of ornithine decarboxylase and formation of neurites in PC12 cells by NGF does not require a protein kinase C-mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1598297039,Abstract Factor Va is an essential cofactor for the activation of prothrombin catalyzed by factor Xa. The cofactor is a heterodimer composed of a light chain and a heavy chain that are associated noncovalently in the presence of divalent metal ions. The kinetics of the formation of factor Va from the isolated and separated subunits was examined by the time-dependent regain in cofactor activity using direct assays of prothrombin activation catalyzed by prothrombinase. The rate of reassociation at saturating concentrations of calcium ions was slow with a strong temperature dependence. The product of the association reaction was indistinguishable from native factor Va on the basis of activity. The second order rate constant for the process at 37 degrees C in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 was 1.58 X 10(5) M-1.min-1. Manganese ion increased the rate of regain of activity without influencing the extent of the reaction. The previous identification of a single reactive sulfhydryl in each subunit of factor Va permitted the modification of the separated subunits with sulfhydryl-directed fluorophores. Subunit reassociation was directly measured by fluorescence energy transfer using light chain modified with 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (fluorescence donor) and heavy chain modified with fluorescein 5-maleimide (fluorescence acceptor). Fluorescence measurements indicate that the heavy and light chains associate tightly (Kd = 5.9 x 10(-9) M) and reversibly with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The dissociation of the subunits from the cofactor is first order with a rate constant of 1.03 X 10(-3) min-1. These interpretations were confirmed by physical measurements of subunit reassociation by sedimentation velocity studies.
https://openalex.org/W1569183316,"Ganglioside GD3 was converted at room temperature to two stable lactones, denoted as GD3 lactones I and II. The reaction sequence was presumed to be GD3----GD3 lactone I----GD3 lactone II based on the time course of their production. Lactone I behaved as a monosialoganglioside and lactone II as a neutral species. The two lactones were isolated by DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography. The positions of the inner ester linkages were investigated by two-dimensional J-correlated proton NMR spectroscopy. An ester linkage was most likely formed between the carboxyl group of the external sialic acid residue and C9-OH of the internal sialic acid residue in lactone I. In addition to this ester linkage, a second ester linkage between the carboxyl group of the internal sialic acid and C2-OH of the galactose residue was likely formed in lactone II. The structural changes induced by lactonization were further examined by their reactivity with the monoclonal antibody R24 (Puckel, C. S., Lloyd, K. O., Travassos, L. R., Dippold, W. G., Oettgen, H. F., and Old, L. J. (1982) J. Exp. Med. 155, 1133-1147), which reacted with GD3. R24 was found to bind weakly to GD3 lactone I, but not to GD3 lactone II. The results suggest that the monoclonal antibody requires both sialic acid residues for high affinity binding, and the complete lactonization results in a loss of negative charges and/or a change in the overall conformation of the oligosaccharide moiety which may account for the loss of binding."
https://openalex.org/W1574637083,"A chicken genomic DNA library was screened with a full length cDNA corresponding to the beta subunit of smooth muscle tropomyosin. When hybridized with RNAs isolated from various tissues, this cDNA recognizes two mRNA species: one of 1.3 kilobase pairs present only in smooth muscle and one of 1.6 kilobase pairs present only in skeletal muscle. Two overlapping recombinant phages were shown to contain the entire locus and were further characterized. This locus contains 11 exons and spans approximately 13 kilobase pairs. Exon 1 (amino acids 1-38) contains the 5'-untranslated region which is common to the two mRNAs. Exons 6 (amino acids 189-213) and 11 (amino acids 258-284) contain sequences which are present exclusively in the 1.3-kilobase pair smooth muscle mRNA while exons 7 and 10, which code for an analogous region, contain sequences which are present exclusively in the 1.6-kilobase pair skeletal muscle mRNA (exons 10 and 11 also contain the entire 3'-untranslated regions of the corresponding mRNAs). Other exons, 2 to 5 (amino acids 39-188) and 8 and 9 (amino acids 214-257), contain sequences which are present in both mRNAs. Our results indicate that both the smooth and skeletal beta-tropomyosin mRNAs are derived from transcripts of a single gene with a unique promoter by a differential splicing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1832048158,"Abstract Caldesmons are major Ca2+-calmodulin regulated F-actin binding proteins of smooth and non-muscle cells that have been implicated as components of a thin filament regulatory system. Chicken gizzard caldesmons are monomeric proteins of Mr 140,000 and 135,000. We have employed enzymatic and chemical cleavage methods in order to dissect the protein to locate the Ca2+-calmodulin and F-actin binding domain and the site of molecular weight heterogeneity. Using a novel mapping procedure that employs partial chemical cleavage at cysteine residues, we show that both caldesmon polypeptides contain 2 cysteine residues located approximately 28,000 from the protein's amino terminus and the second approximately 25,000 from the carboxyl terminus. Identification of the composition of partial cleavage products with region-specific antibodies is consistent with this derived map. The apparent molecular weight heterogeneity was found to lie in the approximately 80,000 region between the 2 cysteine residues and therefore is not due to proteolytic processing. Digestion with alpha-chymotrypsin yields a relatively stable basic Mr 40,000 Ca2+-calmodulin and F-actin binding fragment that we have purified and characterized. The chymotryptic 40,000 fragment contains the 25,000 carboxyl-terminal fragment and therefore is derived from the carboxyl-terminal region of caldesmon. The 25,000 fragment obtained after chemical cleavage at cysteine under native conditions has also been purified and shown to bind F-actin and Ca2+-calmodulin. Surprisingly, the purified carboxyl 25,000 fragment, unlike the reduced intact monomer, cross-links F-actin into tightly ordered bundles in which the filaments are in register."
https://openalex.org/W1574530151,"The activity of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex is deficient in patients with the inherited maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). To elucidate the molecular basis of this metabolic disorder, we have isolated three overlapping cDNA clones encoding the E1 α subunit of the human enzyme complex. The composite human E1 α cDNA consists of 1783 base pairs encoding the entire human E1 α subunit of 400 amino acids with calculated Mr = 45,552. The human E1 α and the previously isolated human E2 cDNAs were used as probes in Northern blot analysis with cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from seven unrelated MSUD patients. The results along with those of Western blotting have revealed five distinct molecular phenotypes according to mRNA and protein-subunit contents. These consist of type I, where the levels of E1 α mRNA and E1 α and E1 β subunits are normal in cells, but E1 activity is deficient; Type II, where the E1 α mRNA is present in normal quantity, whereas the contents of E1 α and E1 β subunits are reduced; Type III, where the level of E1 α mRNA is markedly reduced with a concomitant loss of E1 α and E1 β subunits; Type IV, where the contents of both E2 mRNA and E2 subunits are markedly reduced; and Type V, where the E2 mRNA is normally expressed, but the E2 subunit is markedly reduced or completely absent. Type V includes thiamin-responsive (WG-34) and certain classical MSUD cells. These molecular phenotypes have demonstrated the complexity of MSUD and identified the affected gene in different patients for further characterization."

https://openalex.org/W1572393584,"Abstract A monoclonal antibody (BF4) has been used to characterize and purify the heat-shock protein of Mr approximately 90,000 (hsp 90) present in the chick oviduct. In low salt cytosol, the sedimentation coefficient of hsp 90 is approximately 6.8 S, the Stokes radius approximately 7.1 nm, and the calculated Mr approximately 204,000, thus suggesting a dimeric structure. In 0.4 M KCl cytosol, only slightly smaller values were determined (approximately 6.5 S, approximately 6.8 nm, and approximately 187,000). Following purification by ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography, hsp 90 migrated as a single silver-stained band at Mr approximately 90,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the sedimentation coefficient 6.2 S, the Stokes radius approximately 6.8 nm, and the Mr approximately 178,000 confirmed the dimeric structure. However, in both antigen or antibody excess conditions, only one molecule of monoclonal antibody could be bound to the hsp 90 dimer. Whether steric hindrance in a homodimer or the presence of two different 90-kDa proteins in a heterodimer explains this result cannot yet be decided. The dimer is not dissociated by high salt (1 M KCl) or the chaotropic agent (0.5 M NaSCN), but is disrupted by 4 M urea, suggesting a stabilization of the structure by hydrogen bonds. The molybdate-stabilized progesterone receptor hetero-oligomer form of approximately 8 S sedimentation coefficient was purified, and its hsp 90 component was then released by salt treatment. It was found to sediment at approximately 5.8 S and have a Stokes radius approximately 7.1 nm, giving Mr approximately 174,000. This observation is consistent with a previous report suggesting from specific activity determination, scanning of polyacrylamide gels, and cross-linking experiments that each purified nontransformed progesterone receptor molecule includes one progesterone binding unit per two 90-kDa protein molecules (Renoir, J. M., Buchou, T., Mester, J., Radanyi, C., and Baulieu, E. E. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 6016-6023). This work brings direct evidence that both free hsp 90 and the non-hormone binding hsp 90 component released from the nontransformed steroid receptor in the cytosol are in a dimeric form."
https://openalex.org/W1588073287,"Abstract We report the purification of endonuclease G (Ruiz-Carrillo, A., and Renaud, J. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 401-407) from calf thymus nuclei and whole tissue. The enzyme has been enriched 29,000-fold, and the activity was unambiguously identified with a 26-kDa protein after renaturation following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native nuclease behaves as a 50-kDa species by gel filtration, suggesting that it is composed of two subunits, presumably identical. In terms of absolute amounts, endonuclease G (endo G) is a nuclear enzyme although it was also detected in purified mitochondria. Endo G is highly specific for (dG)n.(dC)n tracts in DNA, nicking either strand of relaxed substrates with similar kinetics. The sensitivity of the homopolymer tracts is proportional to their length (from n = 8 to 29), insofar as the flanking sequences are constant. However, the overall rate of cleavage is influenced by the composition of the flanking DNA. Minor cleavage sites contain shorter (dG)n.(dC)n clusters (n = 3-7). Endo G efficiently cleaves (dC)n but not (dG)n runs in single-stranded DNA, suggesting that it may recognize an asymmetric strand conformation of the homopolymer tracts. Endo G does not recognize other homo(co)-polymer sequences or cruciform structures in DNA."

We determined the complete mRNA sequence and showed that the longest cDNA clone, pMS1, contains the entire protein coding region. The deduced polypeptide consists of 561 amino acids with a molecular mass of 63,700 daltons. To discern whether the cloned mRNAs represent distinct malate synthase polypeptides, we compared restriction maps and partial nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clones as well as their pattern of hybridization with restriction fragments in nuclear DNA. The results suggest that the five cloned mRNAs are encoded by either a single gene or by highly conserved members of the gene family."

Gene ca is identified as the male-specific, androgen-dependent C-P-450(16 alpha) gene in adult mice, since the exonic sequence matched 100% to the cDNA, pc16 alpha-2 (Wong, G., Kawajiri, K., and Negishi, M. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 8683-8690). Gene cb and cc are organized in tandem within 18-kilobase pair DNA. Their encoded P-450s contain an approximate 94% nucleotide sequence similarity to the C-P-450(16 alpha). The high similarity in gene nucleotide sequences, including the introns and flanking regions, suggests a combination of an ancestral gene duplication and gene conversion as a mechanism for evolution of the C-P-450(16 alpha) family. Gene ca shows male-specific expression in mouse kidney as well as in liver; gene cb, neither sex-specific nor androgen-dependent, is seen only in liver; gene cc is not expressed in either adult mouse liver or kidney. Expression of these three genes is not detected in adult mouse lung. It appears, therefore, that the C-P-450(16 alpha) gene family includes a large number of genes whose expressions are differentially regulated. Southern hybridization of C-P-450(16 alpha) cDNA to genomic DNAs from mouse-hamster somatic hybrid cells localizes tentatively this gene family on mouse chromosome 15. The recombination frequency in BXD recombinant inbred mice suggests that the C-P-450(16 alpha) gene family is approximately 16M from the 55-kDa locus."

https://openalex.org/W1591346024,"Rat ovarian lutropin receptor occurs predominantly as a monomer of an apparent molecular mass of 70 or 80 kDa determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The receptor contains 0.4% free cysteine and 1.9% cysteine as cystine, determined by amino acid analysis of the S-carboxymethyl receptor prepared before and after reduction. The presence of free thiol groups was further shown by the specific adsorption of the receptor on p-chloromercuribenzoate-agarose and its susceptibility to 3H labeling with [3H]N-ethylmaleimide or [3H]iodoacetic acid. The receptor readily undergoes association into homo-oligomers. Evidence suggests that the association was caused by the intermolecular oxidation of the free -SH groups to form disulfide bonds. The aggregation could be induced by H2O2 or molecular O2 and was inhibited by sulfhydryl protecting agents such as N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetic acid, dithiothreitol, cysteine, and Zn(II). The oligomers could be dissociated by reduction into a monomer. 125I-Labeling of the S-carboxymethyl- or N-ethylmaleyl receptor gave a single band of molecular mass 70 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Furthermore, S-alkylation of the receptor did not affect its binding to the ligand. On reduction, however, it lost its ability to bind to the ligand, but the reduced receptor retained its ability to bind to a specific polyclonal rabbit antireceptor antibody indicating the separation of the ligand and antibody binding sites. Endoproteinase Glu-C cleaved the receptor at a single glutamyl residue to give two components, 46 and 36 kDa. The 36-kDa component was extracellularly located since it contained the carbohydrate. On deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F, it yielded two components, 27 and 25 kDa. The deglycosylation of the reduced intact receptor (80 kDa) with endoglycosidase F occurred in two steps giving 73- and 64-kDa polypeptides, indicating the presence of about 20% carbohydrate contained in two or more N-linked chains."
https://openalex.org/W1578460666,"Abstract With the aim of targeting toxins to selected cells in the gonad, we have prepared conjugates of ovine luteinizing hormone (oLH) with a single chain ribosome-inactivating protein called gelonin. The two proteins were thiolated by using N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate and subsequently reacted under appropriate conditions to form oLH-S-S-gelonin complex. A complete biochemical analysis of thiolated oLH and oLH-gelonin conjugates has been performed. The linkage of the hormone to the toxin probably occurred through a single amino group in the alpha-subunit, with the beta-subunit remaining free. Modification of a single amino group on the alpha-subunit reduced receptor binding and immunological reactivity of the thiolated oLH, but subsequent complexing with the toxin-gelonin did not seriously compromise these activities. oLH and gelonin were calculated to be present in a 1:1 ratio in the hormonotoxin preparation. The conjugate retained significant steroidogenic activity in rat granulosa cells. Upon reaction with mouse tumor Leydig cells (MA-10 cells), the toxin component of the complex became internalized to a sufficient degree to effectively inhibit protein synthesis. The studies provide a rational basis for the design and study of large hormonotoxins."

https://openalex.org/W1533483007,"In order to determine whether qualitative and quantitative differences exist between the non-collagenous proteins of crown and root dentin, rat incisors were separated into their enamel- and cementum-related dentin portions (ERD and CRD, respectively). Isolation of the mineral-bound proteins was performed under nondegradative conditions. Analytical procedures included DEAE-chromatography on high pressure liquid chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and determination of phosphate, protein, and hydroxyproline. The results have shown that considerable differences exist among the two dentins with respect to the quantity of the various phosphoproteins. For this group of proteins as a whole, the ERD contains about 2 times the amount of organic phosphate found in the CRD and about 1.4 times the amount of protein. The content of higher phosphorylated phosphoproteins was about 4 times higher in the ERD than in the CRD, whereas the reverse was shown for the lower phosphorylated phosphoproteins. All differences were found to be statistically significant. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that while the ERD contains phosphoproteins with an apparent molecular mass of 98 kDa, the CRD contains two classes of phosphoproteins one of 98 and one of 88 kDa. The relevance of the observed differences in phosphoprotein distribution is discussed in relation to their possible role in mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1591914994,"The activating kinase of protein phosphatase 1I is distributed in approximately equal amounts between the cytosolic and particulate fractions of bovine brain homogenates. Both species of this protein kinase have been purified to near homogeneity. The cytosolic form, purified about 7,000-fold, has an apparent Mr = approximately 75,000, as estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. The enzyme contains two subunits, with apparent Mr = 52,000 and 46,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both subunits undergo phosphorylation when the enzyme is incubated with Mg2+ and [gamma-32P]ATP. Peptide maps of the two subunits are different, and rabbit antibodies to the 52-kDa subunit show only very minor cross-reactivity to the 46-kDa subunit. These observations indicate that the two subunits are different. The species of protein phosphatase 1I activating kinase that is associated with the membrane fraction has an apparent Mr = approximately 105,000 as estimated by gel filtration. This species also contains two subunits, with apparent Mr = 52,000 and 46,000, the properties of which are very similar, if not identical, to those of the two subunits comprising the cytosolic form of the protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1606349227,"Calf thyroid microsomes were found to contain an enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phospho[35S]sulfate (PAPS) to C-3 of terminal galactose residues in beta 1----4 linkage to GlcNAc. This sulfotransferase is believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the recently described Gal(3-SO4) capping groups present in the N-linked oligosaccharides of thyroglobulin (Spiro, R.G., and Bhoyroo, V. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14351-14358). Assays with various native and modified glycopeptides indicated that the enzyme acted optimally on complex-type carbohydrate units in which beta-linked Gal has been uncovered by desulfation or brought into a terminal position by removal of sialyl and/or alpha-galactosyl residues. With fetuin asialoglycopeptides as acceptors (Km = 0.1 mM) the transfer of sulfate from PAPS (Km = 6.3 microM) had a pH optimum of approximately 7.0, required Mn2+ ions (10-50 mM) and was markedly stimulated by Triton X-100 (0.1%) and ATP (2 mM). The same enzyme apparently sulfated free N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc; Km = 0.69 mM) and its ethyl glycoside, indicating that it had no absolute requirement for a peptide recognition site. Studies with a number of disaccharides related to LacNAc provided information relating to the specifying role of the beta 1----4 galactosyl linkage and the configuration at C-2 of the sugar to which it is attached. Hydrazine-nitrous acid-NaBH4 treatment of the 35S-labeled products from sulfotransferase action on asialoglycopeptides as well as on the ethyl glycoside of LacNAc yielded the same disaccharide, Gal(3-SO4) beta 1----4 anhydromannitol, as is obtained from a similar treatment of thyroglobulin. Subcellular distribution studies indicated that the PAPS:galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase is located in the Golgi compartment which is consistent with the late occurrence of the requisite beta-galactosylation step. It is proposed that in certain tissues the ultimate nature of the capping groups attached to glycoproteins containing terminal Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc sequences could be the result of a competition between this 3-O-sulfotransferase and sialyl- and/or alpha-galactosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1584246568,"Type I procollagen was examined in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta. About half of the pro-α chains were post-translationally overmodified and had a decreased thermal stability. The vertebrate collagenase A fragment had a normal thermal stability, but the B fragment had a decreased thermal stability. Therefore, there was a change in primary structure in amino acids 776–1014 of either the α1(I) or α2(I) chain. Three of five cDNA clones for the α2(I) chain contained a single-base substitution of an A for a G that converted the codon for glycine at amino acid position 907 to aspartate. Complete nucleotide sequencing of bases coding for amino acids 776 to 1014 of the α2(I) chain was carried out in one cDNA clone that contained the mutation in the glycine codon and in one that did not. Also, nucleotide sequencing was performed of bases coding for amino acids 776–1014 of the α1(I) chain in seven independent cDNA clones. No other mutations were found. Therefore, the single base substitution that converts glycine 907 in the α2(I) chain to aspartate is solely responsible for the decreased thermal stability of the type I procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts. Also, glycine 907 of the α2(I) chain is an important component of a cooperative block that determines the melting temperature of the whole molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1531163975,"Abstract A gene for T4 endonuclease V was constructed by joining chemically synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides and expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli under the control of the E. coli tryptophan promoter. Overproduced T4 endonuclease V, which can cleave thymine photodimers as well as the corresponding phosphodiester linkage of DNA, was used to investigate the precise mode of the reaction with single- or double-stranded synthetic DNA fragments containing a thymine photodimer. The substrates, three oligodeoxyribonucleotides, d(GCGGTTGGCG) (10-mer), d(CGAAGGTTGGAAGC) (14-mer), and d(CACGAAGGTTGGAAGCAC) (18-mer), were prepared by UV irradiation of the nascent oligonucleotides. These single-stranded oligonucleotides were cleaved by the enzyme with a concentration 100 times higher than that required for the corresponding duplexes. The Km values for the TT duplex (14- and 18-mer) were found to be on the order of 10(-8) M. Dissociation constants for the 14- and 18-mer duplexes were measured by a binding assay on a nitrocellulose filter and found to be 10(-9)."
https://openalex.org/W1591689230,"The distance between the heme iron of ferrous cytochrome P-450-CAM and a fluorine label attached to the 9-methyl carbon of its substrate, (1R)-(+)-camphor, has been determined using 19F NMR. This investigation uses the Solomon-Bloembergen equation to measure the distance from a paramagnetic heme iron to a fluorine probe incorporated into a substrate that is not in fast exchange. The structural identity of the substrate analogue, 9-fluorocamphor, has been established using one- and two-dimensional NMR methods and mass spectrometry. The relaxation rate of 9-fluorocamphor bound to high-spin paramagnetic ferrous P-450-CAM has been studied at 188, 282, and 376 MHz, and the correlation time has been directly determined from the frequency dependence of the relaxation rate. When the substrate analogue was bound to the low-spin diamagnetic ferrous-CO derivative of the enzyme, the relaxation rate was found to be 100 times slower and was therefore neglected in the distance calculation. The relaxation data for the paramagnetic system and the correlation time have been used to calculate a distance of 3.8 A between the heme iron and the C-9 fluoride. A fit of the distance and the chemical shift data to the pseudocontact shift equation predicts an angle of approximately 52 degrees between the heme normal and the Fe-F vector. The solution state Fe-F distance is somewhat shorter and the angle between the heme normal and the Fe-F vector slightly larger for the substrate-bound ferrous enzyme reported herein than the analogous values for the substrate-bound ferric enzyme determined in the solid state by x-ray crystallography. These differences may reflect a structural change at the substrate-binding site upon reduction of the iron."
https://openalex.org/W1499449111,"Abstract Albumin Venezia is a fast migrating genetic variant of human serum albumin which, in heterozygous subjects, represents about 30% of the circulating protein. The molecular defect in this variant was studied in a subject possessing an atypical level of the mutant (80% of the total protein) and in other members of his family. Albumins, isolated from the sera of the propositus and his heterozygous relatives, were treated with CNBr and the resulting fragments analyzed by isoelectric focusing. The peptides were then isolated in a homogeneous form by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and submitted to sequence analysis. The results show that albumin Venezia possesses a shortened polypeptide chain, 578 residues instead of 585, completely variant from residue 572 to the COOH-terminal end: sequence: (see text). This extensive modification may be accounted for by the deletion of exon 14 and translation to the first terminator codon of exon 15, which normally does not code for protein. The absence of a basic COOH-terminal dipeptide in the mature molecule can be explained by the probable action of serum carboxypeptidase N. Additional support for such action comes from examination of the remaining 20% of the total albumin of the propositus, which is found to contain an extra Arg at its COOH terminus, probably due to partial digestion by carboxypeptidase N. The low serum level of the variant in heterozygous subjects suggests that the COOH-terminal end of the molecule is critical for albumin stability."
https://openalex.org/W1941198514,"Abstract Differences between the influences of phorbol esters (such as 4 beta-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) and of fatty acids (such as oleic acid) on the synthesis and turnover of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and other phospholipids have been studied in glioma (C6), neuroblastoma (N1E-115), and hybrid (NG108-15) cells in culture using [methyl-3H]choline, [32P]Pi, [1,2-14C]ethanolamine, or 1-14C-labeled fatty acids as lipid precursors. 100-500 microM oleic acid stimulated PtdCho synthesis 3- to 5-fold in all three cell lines, but had little influence on chase of choline label following a 24-h pulse. Phorbol ester (50-200 nM) stimulated PtdCho synthesis 1.5- to 3-fold in C6 cells, was without effect in N1E-115 cells, and had intermediate effects on NG108-15 cells. Phorbol ester stimulated both uptake of extracellular choline and synthesis of PtdCho, whereas fatty acid stimulated only synthesis. Release of radioactivity from 24-h pulse-labeled PtdCho to the medium was enhanced by phorbol ester in C6 cells. Incorporation of [32P]Pi, primarily into PtdCho, was stimulated, whereas utilization of [1,2-14C]ethanolamine or 1-14C-fatty acid was little altered by phorbol ester. C6 cells down-regulated with phorbol ester lost the stimulatory response of subsequent treatment with phorbol esters on PtdCho synthesis, but the response to fatty acid was enhanced. Fatty acid had little influence on the relative binding of phorbol ester or translocation of phorbol ester binding sites. Accordingly, metabolism of phospholipids in these cultured cells of neural origin is markedly influenced by cell type, phospholipid class, condition of incubation medium, and nature of stimulator. Phorbol esters and fatty acids appear to enhance phospholipid synthesis and turnover by distinct intracellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1550194264,"Abstract Controlled conditions have been found that give complete reactivation and long term stabilization of rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) after oxidative inactivation by hydrogen peroxide. Inactivated rhodanese was completely reactivated by reductants such as thioglycolic acid (TGA) (100 mM) and dithiothreitol (DTT) (100 mM) or the substrate thiosulfate (100 mM) if these reagents were added soon after inactivation. Reactivability fell in a biphasic first order process. At pH 7.5, in the presence of DTT inactive rhodanese lost 40% of its reactivability in less than 5 min, and the remaining 60% was lost more gradually (t 1/2 = 3.5 h). TGA reactivated better than DTT, and the rapid phase was much less prominent. If excess reagents were removed by gel filtration immediately after inactivation, there was time-independent and complete reactivability with TGA for at least 24 h, and the resulting samples were stable. Reactivable enzyme was resistant to proteolysis and had a fluorescence maximum at 335 nm, just as the native protein. Oxidized rhodanese, Partially reactivated by DTT, was unstable and lost activity upon further incubation. This inactive enzyme was fully reactivated by 200 mM TGA. Also, the enzyme could be reactivated by arsenite and high concentrations of cyanide. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (40-fold molar excess) to inactive rhodanese after column chromatography initiated a time-dependent loss of reactivability. This inactivation was a single first order process (t 1/2 = 25 min). Sulfhydryl titers showed that enzyme could be fully reactivated after the loss of either one or two sulfhydryl groups. Irreversibly inactivated enzyme showed the loss of one sulfhydryl group even after extensive reduction with TGA. The results are consistent with a two-stage oxidation of rhodanese. In the first stage there can form sulfenyl and/or disulfide derivative(s) at the active site sulfhydryl that are reducible by thioglycolate. A second stage could give alternate or additional oxidation states that are not easily reducible by reagents tried to date."
https://openalex.org/W1579052358,"Cell lines were established which produce replication-defective ecotropic and amphotropic host range recombinant retroviruses containing the cDNA for mouse cytochrome P3-450 as well as the bacterial Neo gene for G418 resistance. The G418-resistant clones derived from virus-infected cultures were analyzed for the expression, subcellular localization, and catalytic activities of the cytochrome P3-450. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNAs indicates that the viral DNA was stably integrated into the cellular DNA. Western blot analysis of the proteins showed that the size of the constitutively expressed product was Mr 54,000, indistinguishable from the cytochrome P3-450 found in mouse liver microsomes. Spectral characterization of the P3-450 proteins indicates that the newly synthesized apoprotein incorporated heme and integrated into the microsomes. Enzymatic analysis of the cell homogenates in vitro and of the dividing cells in situ showed very high acetanilide hydroxylase activity and very low aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, a diagnostic feature of the cytochrome P3-450. The precise transmission of the recombinant retroviral sequences into the target cells and the exceptional fidelity of expression of the enzyme in cells will allow the analysis of an increasing number of cloned genes of cytochrome P-450s by defining the individual enzyme specificities, their physiological role in cells, and consequences of their functional expression, such as in toxicity, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1570515175,"Abstract In order to identify calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins in the parathyroid gland, we used electrophoretic blots of proteins separated by a two-dimensional nondenaturing/denaturing gel system and incubated them with 45Ca2+. Parathyroid secretory protein (PSP) and proteins with approximate molecular weights of 98,000, 88,000, 58,000, and 30,000 were noted to bind Ca2+ in cytosolic fractions from bovine parathyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands. However, differences in the binding affinity and capacity of the various proteins were observed. PSP displayed a low affinity and high binding capacity for Ca2+. In the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and 60 mM KCl, native PSP (immobilized on nitrocellulose filters) bound 7.5 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein monomer with an apparent Kd of 1.1 mM. Immunoblotting identified the association of PSP with parathyroid cell membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This property, together with its heat stability, distinguished PSP from other cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins which were identified. There was also evidence for a Ca2+-dependent protein-protein interaction (aggregation) of PSP present in a Nonidet P-40 extract of cell membranes. The high Ca2+ binding capacity of PSP and its Ca2+-dependent membrane association may be features that make PSP a potentially important protein in secretory cells."

https://openalex.org/W1563182363,"Abstract The liquid-state 113Cd NMR data of carboxypeptidase A in the presence and absence of inhibitors obtained by Gettins (Gettins, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15513-15518) are analyzed in terms of whether the inhibitors displace water from Cd2+ upon binding to the protein. This question is addressed by applying the single crystal data and the methods introduced by Honkonen and Ellis (Honkonen, R. S., and Ellis, P. D. (1984) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106, 5488-5497). Calculations based upon these data demonstrate that displacement of water by a carboxyl group should lead to significant shielding of a 113Cd resonance by approximately 100 ppm. Since the observed 113Cd chemical shifts for carboxypeptidase A are modest and deshielding (12-17 ppm), it is argued that the chemical shifts imply that water is not displaced from the Cd2+ center upon binding of inhibitors to carboxypeptidase A. Rather, the Cd2+ ion increases its coordination number from five to six upon binding of the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1583231159,"A spontaneous membrane assembly process has been postulated to account for the rapid perigranular membrane enlargement which occurs during mast cell secretory granule activation. This process requires the presence of a phospholipid store in the quiescent granule. By using purified granules with intact membranes we have determined the total phospholipid content of the average quiescent granule. The results suggest that the average quiescent granule contains sufficient phospholipid to sustain at least a trebling of its perigranular membrane surface area during activation. As much as two-thirds of the total cellular phospholipid is found in the granules, and since a large portion of this phospholipid is extruded into the extracellular space along with the granule matrix during exocytosis, it is implied that this phospholipid can serve as the substrate for the formation of the lipid-derived mediators of inflammation."
