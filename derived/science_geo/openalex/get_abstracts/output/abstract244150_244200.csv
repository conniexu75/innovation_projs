https://openalex.org/W2060061640,"ARCHAEOLOGICAL evidence is often found for the exploitation of marine resources. In New Zealand, one of the most widespread species exploited was the intertidal bivalve Chione stutchburyi, and its growth dynamics form the basis of the technique described here, the purpose of which is to determine at what time of the year shells were collected."
https://openalex.org/W1991314359,"THE Asiatic grass carp is a herbivorous fish which is being bred and extensively cultured for food in Russia and eastern Europe. In Britain where freshwater fish are seldom eaten, apart from eels and salmonids, grass carp are arousing interest because of the possibility of using them as a supplement, or in some situations as an alternative, to present methods of weed control—mechanical cutting or the use of herbicides1. The chief factors involved in the possible use of grass carp have been discussed2,3, one of the most important being the density of fish needed to achieve a desired degree of control. We report here the work done on this topic in 1969."
https://openalex.org/W2071669883,"THE ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea (Fr.) Tul., is common on cereals and grasses throughout the temperate regions of North America1,2. It is often severe on rye (Secale cereale L.) and durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and in recent years it has also been troublesome on Triticale (Triticum sp. × S. cereale) and on male sterile cultivars and lines used in the development of hybrid spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at the University of Manitoba. Field observations in the past have indicated that some cultivars of either spring or durum wheat are more susceptible than others3, but experimental evidence of resistance has not been reported. We therefore investigated the variability of the infection reaction to C. purpurea in the cultivated cereals, aiming to find possible sources of resistance for use in the Triticale and hybrid wheat breeding programmes."

https://openalex.org/W2087800754,"PERENNIAL ice was found late in 1969 near the summit of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano rising 4,200 m above the sea on the island of Hawaii, 19° 49′ N and 155° 28′ W. A part of the ice-lava mixture lies close to the rocky surfaces near the bases of the south walls of the Goodrich Cone and Summit Cone craters (Fig. 1). Seismic refraction measurements have indicated a minimum horizontal extent of ice of hundreds of metres, and a thickness of many decametres. This ice may be the remains of known Pleistocene glaciation1. It is thought to survive near the surface in present climatic conditions because radiation effects make certain areas of the craters colder."

https://openalex.org/W1972074124,"THE importance and essential role of vitamin B12 and cobalt, its precursor, in ruminant nutrition and metabolism have been described1–3. Cobalt deficiency in sheep results in marked changes in the rumen microflora4, and although some difference in the efficiency of fibre digestion may thus be expected to follow, there is little evidence to support this. Marston et al.2 state that the rate and course of carbohydrate fermentation are unaffected by low cobalt levels in the rumen. Other workers have reported that cobalt supplements increased the digestibility of fibre5,6, while Becker and Smith7 found fibre digestibility to be reduced by cobalt supplementation, although the digestibility of ether extract and nitrogen-free extract increased."

The announcement of the launch, giving a transmission frequency of 20.009 MHz, was made in Peking at 1232 UT on April 25. First signals were received at Kettering Grammar School at 1402 UT, towards the end of the twelfth orbit of the Earth."
