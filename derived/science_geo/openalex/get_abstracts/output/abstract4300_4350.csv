https://openalex.org/W1494736908,"Purified rat liver nuclei were incubated with [14C]-NAD+ and the various nuclear protein fractions were separated. Forty per cent of the total radioactivity incorporated was associated with the histone fraction. Of this, about 50% was extracted with H1, in 0.5 N perchloric acid. When crude H1 was purified and fractionated into five different subfractions by chromatography on Bio-Rex 70, it was found that all the H1 subfractions contained radioactivity. This radioactive material was identified as oligomers of adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP-Rib) with an average chain length which corresponded to trimers. The extent of the modification was dependent on the concentration of NAD+. About 60% of the H1 molecules were modified with a concentration of 1 mM NAD+. The presence of these oligomers of ADP-Rib introduced a large degree of microheterogeneity to H1 as detected by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 M urea and 0.9 N acetic acid. Bands of H1 with 10 to 20% less mobility than the unmodified H1 were present. Also, as a consequence of large content of ADP-Rib, the absorption maximum shifted from 275 to 259 nm. The half-life of the bond between the oligomers of ADP-Rib and H1 was about 3 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of 0.1 N NaOH, and 10 m1 were modified. The site of ADP ribosylation in the NH2-terminal half was localized in the tryptic peptide extending from the NH2-terminal end to lysine 15. The site of modification of the COOH-erminal half was localized in the tryptic peptide which contained the only glutamic acid residue in this fragment of H1..."

https://openalex.org/W2060262605,"By means of an approach that combined the techniques of somatic cell genetics and Mendelian breeding studies, the inducibility locus, designated Cv, for ecotropic murine leukemia virus in BALB/c mice, was mapped to chromosome 5, 23 units from the locus for phosphoglucomutase-1, with gene order Cv-Pgm-1-Gus. This low-efficiency inducibility locus is therefore not allelic with the chromosome 7 loci previously described for two other mouse strains with high virus inducibility. These studies provide further evidence that endogenous ecotropic viruses represent viral genomes inserted at different chromosomal sites in the various mouse strains."

https://openalex.org/W335160991,"Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase from calf thymus has been purified to apparent homogeneity by a simple and rapid method with a recovery of 10 to 20%. The enzyme activity absolutely requires the presence of DNA. Histone further stimulates the reaction. The Km for NAD and the maximal velocity at 25 degrees C and pH 8.0 in the presence of both compounds are 55 micron and 1,400 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) of the enzyme is 5.80 S. The molecular weight is calculated to be 108,000 by sedimentation equilibrium method using a partial specific volume of 0.736 ml/g. This value is in good agreement with the molecular weight values of 115,000 and 120,000 determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively. The enzyme is colorless and its absorption spectrum shows a maximum at 280 nm. From a CD spectrum, alpha helical content is estimated to be approximately 30%. The enzyme is a basic protein having a pI value of 9.8 and is rich in lysine rather than arginine. Neutral sugar, phospholipid, and DNA are not detected in the final preparation. These data indicate that the purified enzyme is a simple globular protein composed of a single polypeptide having an approximate molecular weight of 110,000."
https://openalex.org/W1517150745,"A simple and rapid procedure is described for purification of carbamyl phosphate synthetase from the matrix fraction of rat liver mitochondria. Antibodies to the enzyme were raised in sheep and purified from antiserum by affinity chromatography on enzyme-bound Sepharose columns. When membrane-free polyribosomes, isolated from a cytosolic fraction of rat liver, were incubated in a messenger-dependent rabbit reticulocyte protein-synthesizing system in the presence of [35S]methionine, the purified antibody precipitated a product of translation representing 0.2% of total trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity. It demonstrated mobility characteristics in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels expected for a polypeptide of molecular mass approximately 5500 daltons larger than the mature mitochondrial form of the enzyme (160,000 daltons). Proteolysis of both the mature and presumptive in vitro precursor forms of the enzyme yielded respective sets of peptide fragments which gave similar patterns upon gel electrophoresis. Excess mitochondrial enzyme effectively competed with the in vitro product for interaction with anti-carbamyl phosphate synthetase antibody."

The ingestion of filtered water results in the eventual disappearance of amphibole fibers from urine. These observations provide the first direct evidence for the passage of mineral fibers through the human gastro-intestinal mucosa under normal conditions of the alimentary canal.

https://openalex.org/W1490918739,"The three-dimensional structure of a ternary complex of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and the inhibitor dimethyl sulfoxide has been determined to 4.5 A resolution independently of the apoenzyme structure. The electron density maps of both structures have been compared. The two coenzyme binding domains which form the center of the dimer molecular have retained their conformation and orientation within the molecule whereas the catalytic domains rotate and narrow the cleft between the domains. The active site becomes shielded from the solution by a combination of this rotation, local movements of a loop from residues 53 to 57 and coenzyme and substrate binding. Both subunits bind coenzyme and inhibitor to the same extent. The nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned close to the active zinc atom and the inhibitor is bound to this zinc atom. The difference between the two crystallographically independent subunits is small. The proposed mechanisms of action for the enzyme based on the apoenzyme structure are confirmed by the present investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1561853718,"A series of synthetic peptide analogs of the cardiac troponin inhibitory subunit (TN-1) phosphorylation site sequence, Arg12-Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Val-Arg18-Arg19-Ser20-Asp21-Arg22-Ala, have been tested as substrates for the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37, ATP:protein phosphotransferase). As substrates, these peptides were generally inferior to the pyruvate kinase analog peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly or its COOH-terminal amide analog. Replacing Arg-19 with alanine had only a minor effect on the kinetics of phosphorylation of the TN-1 peptide analog. In contrast, replacement of Arg-22 and Arg-18 with alanine resulted in marked enhancement and reduction of the Vmax, respectively. The results of this study have demonstrated that synthetic peptide analogs of the local phosphorylation site sequences of natural substrates may differ widely in their capacity to act as substrates for this protein kinase. In the case of the TN-1 peptide analogs, the contribution of the 4 arginine residues can be distinguished in terms of their influence on the kinetics of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2293967764,"To elucidate the reaction mechanism of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, a protohemoprotein, the binding of molecular oxygen (02) and the superoxide anion (02-) to the enzyme in its ferrous and ferric states, respectively, was investigated. The second order rate constant for the binding of 01to the ferric enzyme was determined to be 1.1 x 10” M-’ s-’ at 24°C and pH 8.0. The rate constants for the binding of Opto the ferric enzyme in the absence and presence of 0.2 mM L-tryptophan were also estimated to be 3.3 X lo6 and 2.3 X lo6 M-’ s-l, respectively, by a different procedure. The ferrous form of enzyme was generated in situ by flash photolysis of the carbon monoxide complex of the enzyme in an air-saturated buffer. It reacted with O2 to form the oxygenated enzyme which was identified on the basis of its spectrum and the isosbestic points with the ferrous enzyme. The rate constants for the binding of 0, to the ferrous enzyme in the absence and presence of 0.2 mM I.-tryptophan were determined to be 7.4 x lo6 and 6.3 x lo6 M-’ s-l at 24°C and pH 8.0, respectively. The oxygenated form thus prepared in the presence of L-tryptophan produced approximately 50 mol of Nformylkynurenine/mol of enzyme and was oxidized to the ferric form during this process. It appears that 02and the ferric enzyme were not involved in product formation because neither superoxide dismutase nor potassium cyanide inhibited product formation. These results indicated that in the presence of the organic substrate the ternary complex of enzyme l O2 l substrate can be formed either by the reaction of Oawith the ferric enzyme or that of O2 with the ferrous enzyme. Once the ternary complex is formed, the reaction proceeds using O2 until the enzyme molecule is completely oxidized to the ferric form, for which 02is indispensable to yield the ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1525957941,"Addition of Ca2+ in the presence of a nucleotide causes a change in the ESR spectra of sarcoplasmic reticulum labeled with a spin probe on the ATPase protein. The Caa+ concentration dependence of this change was studied with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles treated with Triton X-100 or sonication in order to prevent Ca’+ accumulation. In the presence of AMP-P(NH)P (adenyl-B-y1 imidodiphosphate), an ATP analog which binds but does not phosphorylate ATPase, the spectral effect occurs at Ca’+ concentrations (micromolar) producing activation of the enzyme. In the presence of ATP, the effect shifts to a higher Caa+ range (millimolar) which produces enzyme inhibition. In both cases, plots of an empirical spectral parameter versus Ca2+ concentration are consistent with a cooperative mechanism for the production of the Ca*+ effect. It is suggested that the observed spectral effects reflect conformational changes due to Ca2’ binding to sites which undergo reduction of Ca2’ affinity upon phosphorylation with ATP. Since the ESR spectra are sensitive to the occupancy of the transport sites, it can be demonstrated that, during steady state turnover, most of the ATPase is in an intermediate step after inward Ca2+ release and before recycling to a high affinity form. Nucleotide is required for any Ca” binding effect to be seen in the ESR spectrum and, in fact, spectral effects of nucleotide binding are evident in all states of the enzymatic cycle observed here. Different nucleoside moieties introduce specific modifications in the ESR spectra, suggesting a conformational basis for the different rate constants obtained with each nucleotide. Isolated vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum exhibit active transport of Ca2+ coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Clarification of the transport mechanism includes characterization of structural changes in the membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase, occurring in parallel with partial reactions of the enzyme cycle. In this regard, spin-labeling provides a useful tool for studying conformational effects in functioning systems, with little or no effect from the label itself. This is particularly true of the iodoacetamide spin label (ISL) which has been shown to be sensitive to specific conformational changes in the ATPase enzyme without affecting either the ATPase activity or Ca2+ uptake"

https://openalex.org/W2071395524,"Available evidence suggests that the propensity of digitalis glycosides to produce cardiac arrhythmias is due in part to their neuroexictatory effects. We have performed experiments in cats which support the existence of a neurogenic component in the etiology of digitalis-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Our data further indicate that the locus of this neural effect lies within an area of the medulla 2 millimeters above to 2 millimeters below the obex. These findings, when considered with the effects of polar cardiac glycosides that do not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggest that the area postrema may be the site of neural activation."

https://openalex.org/W1559307043,"Yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, with 10 mM 32Pi and 10 mM Mg2+ present at pH 7.3 TO 7.6, rapidly forms enzyme-bound pyrophosphate equivalent to about 5% of the total catalytic sties on the two enzyme subunits. The enzyme thus appears to bind PPi so as to favor thermodynamically its formation from Pi. The enzyme catalyzes a measurable equilibrium formation of free PPi at a much slower rate. Under similar conditions, the enzyme catalyzes a rapid exchange of oxygen atoms between Pi and water with the relative activation by metals being Mg2+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mn2+. Millisecond mixing and quenching experiments demonstrate that the rate of formation and cleavage of the enzyme-bound PPi is rapid enough to explain most or all of the oxygen exchange reaction."

Thus, loose-coupled muscle mitochondria might provide an important vehicle for nonshivering thermogenesis in this species."

https://openalex.org/W1594566711,Simian virus 40 T antigen binds to both single and double strand DNA. The single and double strand DNA binding activity of crude T antigen preparations was evaluated by chromatography of the antigen on DNA-cellulose columns. Crude T antigen was retained on both native and denatured DNA-cellulos columns and was eluted from both columns under similar conditions. The interaction of highly purified T antigen with single and double strand DNA was evaluated by competition experiments using a DNA filter binding assay. These experiments showed that T antigen binds preferentially to single strand calf thymus DNA by more than an order of magnitude when compared to double strand calf thymus DNA.
https://openalex.org/W1499178153,"Previous work has shown that vesicular stomatitis virus-infected Chinese hamster ovary cells contain a major high molecular weight lipid-linked oligosaccharide which is transferred en bloc to protein during the formation of the asparagine-linked complex-type oligosaccharides of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (Tabas, I., Schlesinger, S., and Kornfeld, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 716-722). We now report the characterization of a second, lower molecular weight lipid-linked oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharide portion of this molecule was isolated and its structure was determined by methylation analysis, digestion with exoglycosidases, acetolysis and Smith periodate degradation to be: (formula: see text). Several lines of evidence are presented which indicate that this lipid-linked oligosaccharide is primarily involved in the assembly of the major lipid-linked oligosaccharide rather than in the direct glycosylation of proteins."

Incubation of the SV3T3 cells with this beta-xyloside resulted in: (a) a 4- to 5-fold reduction in the molecular weight distribution of medium heparan sulfate, (b) a 10-fold increase in the total synthesis of medium heparan sulfate, and (c) a small reduction in cell growth. There was little, if any, change in either the total level of synthesis or the molecular weight distribution of cell surface heparan sulfate. The covalent association of the beta-xyloside to the medium heparan sulfate was demonstrated by an analysis of the medium heparan sulfate produced by cells grown in the presence of [35S]sulfate and the fluorogenic beta-xyloside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside. Treatment of the purified radiolabeled and fluorogenic heparan sulfate with either nitrous acid or heparitinase resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of both radiolabeled and fluorogenic material. The data presented in this paper are discussed with respect to both the structure of heparan sulfate and the putative role of heparan sulfate in cell social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1608606961,"The entire nucleotide sequence (1210-base-pair repeating units) of a defective variant of simian virus 40 is presented. Within this variant there are deletions of large portions of the wild type genome and an inversion within the remaining wild type viral sequences. In addition, the defective variant contains DNA sequences derived from the permissive monkey cells in which the virus was propagated. The monkey sequences include a portion that is homologous to sequences within highly repeated monkey DNA (alpha component) as well as portions derived from sequences that are infrequently repeated in the monkey genome. One out of every three to four of the tandem 1210-base-pair repeat units contains in addition, a duplication of a part of the monkey sequences. The sequence information defines the structures of a number of recombinational joints which result from deletions, inversions, duplications, and insertions of host sequences into the viral genome. The data demonstrate that the various recombinational events that resulted in the formation of this defective variant did not depend on extensive homology between recombining segments."

Although 25-azavitamin D3 had no effect on the response of bone to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, it did diminish the response of the intestine to that metabolite. 25-Azavitamin D3 increased liver vitamin D content and reduced the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 required to inhibit the metabolism of vitamin D3 (75 and 200 microgram) were similar to the doses of 25-azavitamin D3 required to inhibit the action of vitamin D3 in vivo (50 and 150 microgram). 25-Azavitamin D3 is thus a vitamin D antagonist, acting for the most part via inhibition of the liver 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3."

Chem. 253, 8593-8597) as the mechanism for the observed decrease in protein fluorescence of liver alcohol dehydrogenase seen with alkaline pH, or with the formation of a ternary complex with NAD+ and trifluoroethanol. In the present study, ultraviolet difference spectra confirm the presence of ionized tyrosine not only in these two cases but also in the ternary complex with NADH and isobutyramide. Our results indicate that ternary complex formation, with either oxidized or reduced coenzyme, causes a conformational change leading to partial ionization of tyrosine residues in regions of the enzyme far from the active site."
https://openalex.org/W33241803,4.1.3.7) at about the same concentration as did palmitoyl-CoA. Competitive binding studies show acetyl-CoA and ATP to displace 6- and 16-doxylstearoyl-CoA from citrate synthase but little while oxalacetate and NADPH compete very effectively. These studies may suggest binding by fatty acyl-CoA at sites apart from the acetyl-CoA binding site. The differential displacement by ATP and NADPH argues against binding of the fatty acyl-CoA at a general nucleotide binding site. The spectrum of 6-doxylstearoyl-CoA in the presence of high concentrations of citrate synthase was for an immobilized spin label; under the same conditions the spectrum for 16-doxylstearoyl-CoA was mobile. These spectral differences were interpreted in terms of a specific binding site for fatty acyl-CoA in which the portion of the fatty acyl chain proximal to the thioester was immobilized while the methyl end was allowed greater motional freedom. Phospholipid vesicles included the spin label of 16-doxylstearoyl-CoA but not that of 6doxylstearoyl-CoA in the presence of excess citrate synthase in support of the above interpretation. A model for a specific binding site for fatty acyl-CoA on citrate synthase with provision for interaction with a biological membrane is presented. Site-specific binding of fatty acyl-CoA by citrate synthase provides strong support for a physiological role for fatty acyl-CoA in the regulation of citrate synthase and by analogy for other related enzymes of lipid metabolism.
https://openalex.org/W1596673742,"Ozone-treated aqueous suspensions of natural phospholipids yield at least two types of inhibitors of human erythrocyte membrane (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. The more labile ones appear to be carbonyl-containing substances whose inhibitory properties are enhanced if ozonolysis takes place in the presence of putrescine or glycine. Other amines of similar structure are much less effective as potentiators. Semicarbazide destroys the inhibitory properties of the more labile substances and can release putrescine from the complexes it forms with the carbonyl products of ozonolysis. 3the more stable inhibitors are unaffected by putrescine, glycine, or semicarbazide. Synthetic, saturated phospholipids do not produce these inhibitors during ozonolysis."

The catalytic subunit of this enzyme was isolated to apparent homogeneity. Also, the protein inhibitor of this protein kinase was isolated from muscle. Neither physiological concentrations of cAMP nor any of these protein components had a detectable effect on protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates in the presence or absence of exogenous heme. Phosphorylation of the smallest subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 or the 90,000 to 100,000-dalton peptide associated with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 kinase activity were not affected by the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase under conditions in which exogenous heme has a pronounced effect on these reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1493616974,"Ferrate ion, a powerful oxidant which is an analog of orthophosphate ion, has previously shown some promise as a site-specific probe of enzymes which interact with phosphate compounds. In order to explore the general applicability of this reagent, it has been tested against ribonuclease A, an enzyme whose structure and active center have been well described. Treatment with a molar ratio of ferrate to enzyme of less than 20 leads to a loss of 87% of the activity. The known competitive inhibitors, 2'-cytidylic acid, inorganic pyrophosphate, and orthophosphate all protect the enzyme from inactivation. Inactivation is accompanied by a loss of the capacity to bind 2'-cytidylic acid. Ferrate inactivation at pH 5.0 is accompanied by the modification of only one amino acid. The amino acid which was identified by amino acid and sequence analyses of peptide fragments obtained by cyanogen bromide treatment and selective proteolysis proved to be histidine-119, whose essential role at the active center has long been established."
https://openalex.org/W22758029,"The time-resolved and steady state fluorescence properties were measured for pig heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase at pH 6.0 and 8.0. The fluorescence decay can be described by two rate processes, according to the functions: I(t) = 0.7e(-t/1.0) + 0.3e(-t/4.4) for the free enzyme and I(t) = 0.7e(-t/0.8) + 0.3e(-t/2.0 for the enzyme . NADH complex. Quenching by NADH of the tryptophan fluorescence is linear. The only effect of pH is to change the association constant for NADH binding; the fluorescence of the free enzyme and the fluorescence quenching by NADH, I-, and acrylamide are unaffected by pH. Thus there are no changes in conformation of the free enzyme or of the NADH complex over the range of pH 6 to 8."

https://openalex.org/W1500975732,"Abstract A spin label attached to a propionic acid group of the heme has been used to probe the heme environment of the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin in both the subunit and tetrameric forms. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of hemoglobin hybrids in which the spin label is attached to either the alpha- or beta-heme (alpha2SLbeta 2 or alpha2beta2SL) and spin-labeled isolated chains (alphaSL and betaSL) show that: 1) alpha- and beta-hemes have different environments in the tetrameric forms of oxy-, deoxy-, and methemoglobins as well as in isolated single chains; 2) when isolated subunits associate to form hemoglobin tetramers, the environment of the alpha-heme changes more drastically than that of the beta-heme; 3) upon deoxygenation of hemoglobin, the structure in the vicinity of the alpha-heme changes more drastically than that of the beta-heme; and 4) upon the addition of organic phosphates to methemoglobin, the change in the spin state of the heme irons mainly arises from beta-heme. The results demonstrate conclusively that the alpha and the beta subunits of hemoglobin are structurally nonequivalent as are their structural changes as the result of ligation. The relationship of EPR spectrum and structure of hemoglobin is discussed."
