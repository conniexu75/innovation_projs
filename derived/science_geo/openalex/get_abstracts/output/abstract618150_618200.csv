https://openalex.org/W2890523706,"The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise during the twenty-first century remains uncertain. Global-scale projections suggest that between 20 and 90 per cent (for low and high sea-level rise scenarios, respectively) of the present-day coastal wetland area will be lost, which will in turn result in the loss of biodiversity and highly valued ecosystem services1–3. These projections do not necessarily take into account all essential geomorphological4–7 and socio-economic system feedbacks8. Here we present an integrated global modelling approach that considers both the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, and the accommodation space, namely, the vertical and lateral space available for fine sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation. We use this approach to assess global-scale changes in coastal wetland area in response to global sea-level rise and anthropogenic coastal occupation during the twenty-first century. On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels. In contrast to previous studies1–3, we project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management. A global modelling approach shows that in response to rises in global sea level, gains of up to 60% in coastal wetland areas are possible, if appropriate coastal management solutions are developed to help support wetland resilience."

The challenge they pose is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumour suppressor gene in which germline loss-of-function variants predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Here we use saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Functional effects for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Over 400 non-functional missense SNVs are identified, as well as around 300 SNVs that disrupt expression. We predict that these results will be immediately useful for the clinical interpretation of BRCA1 variants, and that this approach can be extended to overcome the challenge of variants of uncertain significance in additional clinically actionable genes."
https://openalex.org/W2890807726,"Extracellular electron transfer (EET) describes microbial bioelectrochemical processes in which electrons are transferred from the cytosol to the exterior of the cell1. Mineral-respiring bacteria use elaborate haem-based electron transfer mechanisms2–4 but the existence and mechanistic basis of other EETs remain largely unknown. Here we show that the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes uses a distinctive flavin-based EET mechanism to deliver electrons to iron or an electrode. By performing a forward genetic screen to identify L. monocytogenes mutants with diminished extracellular ferric iron reductase activity, we identified an eight-gene locus that is responsible for EET. This locus encodes a specialized NADH dehydrogenase that segregates EET from aerobic respiration by channelling electrons to a discrete membrane-localized quinone pool. Other proteins facilitate the assembly of an abundant extracellular flavoprotein that, in conjunction with free-molecule flavin shuttles, mediates electron transfer to extracellular acceptors. This system thus establishes a simple electron conduit that is compatible with the single-membrane structure of the Gram-positive cell. Activation of EET supports growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and an EET mutant exhibited a competitive defect within the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Orthologues of the genes responsible for EET are present in hundreds of species across the Firmicutes phylum, including multiple pathogens and commensal members of the intestinal microbiota, and correlate with EET activity in assayed strains. These findings suggest a greater prevalence of EET-based growth capabilities and establish a previously underappreciated relevance for electrogenic bacteria across diverse environments, including host-associated microbial communities and infectious disease. The Gram-positive Listeria monocytogenes pathogen possesses a distinctive extracellular electron transfer mechanism, which is probably present in numerous ecologically diverse species of the Firmcutes phylum."
https://openalex.org/W2799920970,"Spintronics uses spins, the intrinsic angular momentum of electrons, as an alternative for the electron charge. Its long-term goal is in the development of beyond-Moore low dissipation technology devices. Recent progress demonstrated the long-distance transport of spin signals across ferromagnetic insulators. Antiferromagnetically ordered materials are however the most common class of magnetic materials with several crucial advantages over ferromagnetic systems. In contrast to the latter, antiferromagnets exhibit no net magnetic moment, which renders them stable and impervious to external fields. In addition, they can be operated at THz frequencies. While fundamentally their properties bode well for spin transport, previous indirect observations indicate that spin transmission through antiferromagnets is limited to short distances of a few nanometers. Here we demonstrate the long-distance, over tens of micrometers, propagation of spin currents through hematite (\alpha-Fe2O3), the most common antiferromagnetic iron oxide, exploiting the spin Hall effect for spin injection. We control the spin current flow by the interfacial spin-bias and by tuning the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency with an external magnetic field. This simple antiferromagnetic insulator is shown to convey spin information parallel to the compensated moment (N\'eel order) over distances exceeding tens of micrometers. This newly-discovered mechanism transports spin as efficiently as the net magnetic moments in the best-suited complex ferromagnets. Our results pave the way to ultra-fast, low-power antiferromagnet-insulator-based spin-logic devices that operate at room temperature and in the absence of magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2890271012,"Primary liver cancer represents a major health problem. It comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which differ markedly with regards to their morphology, metastatic potential and responses to therapy. However, the regulatory molecules and tissue context that commit transformed hepatic cells towards HCC or ICC are largely unknown. Here we show that the hepatic microenvironment epigenetically shapes lineage commitment in mosaic mouse models of liver tumorigenesis. Whereas a necroptosis-associated hepatic cytokine microenvironment determines ICC outgrowth from oncogenically transformed hepatocytes, hepatocytes containing identical oncogenic drivers give rise to HCC if they are surrounded by apoptotic hepatocytes. Epigenome and transcriptome profiling of mouse HCC and ICC singled out Tbx3 and Prdm5 as major microenvironment-dependent and epigenetically regulated lineage-commitment factors, a function that is conserved in humans. Together, our results provide insight into lineage commitment in liver tumorigenesis, and explain molecularly why common liver-damaging risk factors can lead to either HCC or ICC."
https://openalex.org/W2891841439,"The regular arrangements of β-strands around a central axis in β-barrels and of α-helices in coiled coils contrast with the irregular tertiary structures of most globular proteins, and have fascinated structural biologists since they were first discovered. Simple parametric models have been used to design a wide range of α-helical coiled-coil structures, but to date there has been no success with β-barrels. Here we show that accurate de novo design of β-barrels requires considerable symmetry-breaking to achieve continuous hydrogen-bond connectivity and eliminate backbone strain. We then build ensembles of β-barrel backbone models with cavity shapes that match the fluorogenic compound DFHBI, and use a hierarchical grid-based search method to simultaneously optimize the rigid-body placement of DFHBI in these cavities and the identities of the surrounding amino acids to achieve high shape and chemical complementarity. The designs have high structural accuracy and bind and fluorescently activate DFHBI in vitro and in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. This de novo design of small-molecule binding activity, using backbones custom-built to bind the ligand, should enable the design of increasingly sophisticated ligand-binding proteins, sensors and catalysts that are not limited by the backbone geometries available in known protein structures."

https://openalex.org/W2890325820,"Mixed phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL) is a high-risk subtype of leukaemia with myeloid and lymphoid features, limited genetic characterization, and a lack of consensus regarding appropriate therapy. Here we show that the two principal subtypes of MPAL, T/myeloid (T/M) and B/myeloid (B/M), are genetically distinct. Rearrangement of ZNF384 is common in B/M MPAL, and biallelic WT1 alterations are common in T/M MPAL, which shares genomic features with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We show that the intratumoral immunophenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of MPAL is independent of somatic genetic variation, that founding lesions arise in primitive haematopoietic progenitors, and that individual phenotypic subpopulations can reconstitute the immunophenotypic diversity in vivo. These findings indicate that the cell of origin and founding lesions, rather than an accumulation of distinct genomic alterations, prime tumour cells for lineage promiscuity. Moreover, these findings position MPAL in the spectrum of immature leukaemias and provide a genetically informed framework for future clinical trials of potential treatments for MPAL. A large-scale genomics study shows that the cell of origin and founding mutations determine disease subtype and lead to the expression of multiple haematopoietic lineage-defining antigens in mixed phenotype acute leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2890180880,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a widely expressed neuropeptide that has a major role in sensory neurotransmission. The CGRP receptor is a heterodimer of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) class B G-protein-coupled receptor and a type 1 transmembrane domain protein, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). Here we report the structure of the human CGRP receptor in complex with CGRP and the Gs-protein heterotrimer at 3.3 Å global resolution, determined by Volta phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy. The receptor activity-modifying protein transmembrane domain sits at the interface between transmembrane domains 3, 4 and 5 of CLR, and stabilizes CLR extracellular loop 2. RAMP1 makes only limited direct contact with CGRP, consistent with its function in allosteric modulation of CLR. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that RAMP1 provides stability to the receptor complex, particularly in the positioning of the extracellular domain of CLR. This work provides insights into the control of G-protein-coupled receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2890125899,"Current models of somatosensory perception emphasize transmission from primary sensory neurons to the spinal cord and on to the brain1-4. Mental influence on perception is largely assumed to occur locally within the brain. Here we investigate whether sensory inflow through the spinal cord undergoes direct top-down control by the cortex. Although the corticospinal tract (CST) is traditionally viewed as a primary motor pathway5, a subset of corticospinal neurons (CSNs) originating in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex directly innervate the spinal dorsal horn via CST axons. Either reduction in somatosensory CSN activity or transection of the CST in mice selectively impairs behavioural responses to light touch without altering responses to noxious stimuli. Moreover, such CSN manipulation greatly attenuates tactile allodynia in a model of peripheral neuropathic pain. Tactile stimulation activates somatosensory CSNs, and their corticospinal projections facilitate light-touch-evoked activity of cholecystokinin interneurons in the deep dorsal horn. This touch-driven feed-forward spinal-cortical-spinal sensitization loop is important for the recruitment of spinal nociceptive neurons under tactile allodynia. These results reveal direct cortical modulation of normal and pathological tactile sensory processing in the spinal cord and open up opportunities for new treatments for neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2889901471,"Sounds can arise from the environment and also predictably from many of our own movements, such as vocalizing, walking, or playing music. The capacity to anticipate these movement-related (reafferent) sounds and distinguish them from environmental sounds is essential for normal hearing1,2, but the neural circuits that learn to anticipate the often arbitrary and changeable sounds that result from our movements remain largely unknown. Here we developed an acoustic virtual reality (aVR) system in which a mouse learned to associate a novel sound with its locomotor movements, allowing us to identify the neural circuit mechanisms that learn to suppress reafferent sounds and to probe the behavioural consequences of this predictable sensorimotor experience. We found that aVR experience gradually and selectively suppressed auditory cortical responses to the reafferent frequency, in part by strengthening motor cortical activation of auditory cortical inhibitory neurons that respond to the reafferent tone. This plasticity is behaviourally adaptive, as aVR-experienced mice showed an enhanced ability to detect non-reafferent tones during movement. Together, these findings describe a dynamic sensory filter that involves motor cortical inputs to the auditory cortex that can be shaped by experience to selectively suppress the predictable acoustic consequences of movement."
https://openalex.org/W2889670015,"Higher Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW or anisocytosis) predicts incident coronary artery disease (CAD) plus all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but its predictive value for other common diseases in healthy volunteers is less clear. We aimed to determine the shorter and longer term associations between RDW and incident common conditions in participants free of baseline disease, followed for 9 years. We undertook a prospective analysis of RDW% using 240,477 healthy UK Biobank study volunteers aged 40–70 years at baseline, with outcomes ascertained during follow-up (≤9 years). Participants were free of anemia, CAD, type-2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, COPD, and any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at baseline. Survival models (with competing Hazards) tested associations with outcomes from hospital admission records and death certificates. High RDW (≥15% variation, n = 6,050) compared to low (<12.5% n = 20,844) was strongly associated with mortality (HR 3.10: 95% CI 2.57 to 3.74), adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, education level, mean cell volume and hemoglobin concentration. Higher RDW was also associated with incident CAD (sub-HR 1.67: 1.40 to 1.99), heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cancer (sHR 1.37: 1.21 to 1.55; colorectal cancer sHR 1.92: 1.36 to 2.72), especially leukemia (sHR 2.85: 1.63 to 4.97). Associations showed dose-response relationships, and RDW had long-term predictive value (≥4.5 years after assessment) for the majority of outcomes, which were similar in younger and older persons. In conclusion, higher RDW predicted onsets of a wide range of common conditions as well as mortality in a large healthy volunteer cohort. RDW is not just a short term predictor, as high levels were predictive 4.5 to 9 years after baseline in healthy volunteers. The wide range of outcomes reflects known RDW genetic influences, including diverse disease risks. RDW may be a useful clinical marker for inclusion in wellness assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2891076048,"A number of empirical and theoretical reports link altered interoceptive processing to anxiety. However, the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the two remains poor. We propose that a heightened sensibility for interoceptive signals, combined with a difficulty in attributing these sensations to emotions, increases an individual’s vulnerability to anxiety. In order to investigate this, a large sample of general population adults were recruited and completed self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility, trait anxiety and alexithymia. Results confirmed that the positive association between interoceptive sensibility and trait anxiety was partially mediated by alexithymia, such that those most at risk for clinically significant levels of trait anxiety have both significantly higher levels of interoceptive sensibility and alexithymia. A subsequent factor analysis confirmed the independence of the three measures. Altered interoceptive processing in combination with alexithymia, increased the risk for anxiety above and beyond altered interoceptive processing alone. We suggest that a heightened sensibility for interoceptive signals, combined with a difficulty in attributing these sensations to emotions, leaves these sensations vulnerable to catastrophizing interpretation. Interventions that target the attribution of bodily sensations may prove valuable in reducing anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2890495322,"Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines are considered as important interventional tools for antimicrobial resistance. Guideline compliance was poor across different countries and thus results in an inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics.To evaluate the selection, timing and duration of prophylactic antibiotic administration among surgical patients in Nekmte referral hospital.Prospective, facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st April to 30th June 2017. Data were collected using data abstraction format among surgical inpatients prescribed with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines were used as data assessment protocols. SPSS version 21.0 was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used for analysis.The median age of the study participants was 35.0 (IQR: 25-50) years with the preponderance (58.8%) of male patients. The median hospitalization period was 8.0 (IQR: 5-11) days. Majority of the participants were from the general surgical ward (60.1%). About 43% of the procedures were clean. Most of the surgical cases were gastrointestinal (39.2%). Only 10.6% of the drug selections comply with American Society of Health-System Pharmacists guideline. Surprisingly, none of the selections were compliant to the national Standard Treatment Guideline of the country. About 84% of the study participants received ceftriaxone. Majority of the prophylactic antibiotics (75.8%) were administered for greater than 24 hours and above half (52.3%) of the antibiotics were administered preoperatively. Emergent surgery procedures (AOR = 2.89, 95% CI: (1.09-9.10) and being a male patient (AOR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.07-8.98) were associated with inappropriate preoperative antibiotic administration. Patients admitted to the gynecology and obstetrics ward was less likely to receive surgical prophylaxis for greater than 24 hours (AOR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.81).Surgical antibiotic compliance was far below the guideline recommendation. Patients admitted in the gynecology and obstetrics ward were more likely to comply with the surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis duration recommendation. The timing was most likely to be inappropriate among male patients and patients on emergent surgery. Availability and awareness creation on the antibiotic drugs and the guidelines were important interventions recommended for appropriate surgical antimicrobial use."
https://openalex.org/W2889992039,"Earth and its magnetosphere are immersed in the supersonic flow of the solar-wind plasma that fills interplanetary space. As the solar wind slows and deflects to flow around Earth, or any other obstacle, a 'bow shock' forms within the flow. Under almost all solar-wind conditions, planetary bow shocks such as Earth's are collisionless, supercritical shocks, meaning that they reflect and accelerate a fraction of the incident solar-wind ions as an energy dissipation mechanism1,2, which results in the formation of a region called the ion foreshock3. In the foreshock, large-scale, transient phenomena can develop, such as 'hot flow anomalies'4-9, which are concentrations of shock-reflected, suprathermal ions that are channelled and accumulated along certain structures in the upstream magnetic field. Hot flow anomalies evolve explosively, often resulting in the formation of new shocks along their upstream edges5,10, and potentially contribute to particle acceleration11-13, but there have hitherto been no observations to constrain this acceleration or to confirm the underlying mechanism. Here we report observations of a hot flow anomaly accelerating solar-wind ions from roughly 1-10 kiloelectronvolts up to almost 1,000 kiloelectronvolts. The acceleration mechanism depends on the mass and charge state of the ions and is consistent with first-order Fermi acceleration14,15. The acceleration that we observe results from only the interaction of Earth's bow shock with the solar wind, but produces a much, much larger number of energetic particles compared to what would typically be produced in the foreshock from acceleration at the bow shock. Such autogenous and efficient acceleration at quasi-parallel bow shocks (the normal direction of which are within about 45 degrees of the interplanetary magnetic field direction) provides a potential solution to Fermi's 'injection problem', which requires an as-yet-unexplained seed population of energetic particles, and implies that foreshock transients may be important in the generation of cosmic rays at astrophysical shocks throughout the cosmos."
https://openalex.org/W2892353598,"This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) protein on early brain injury caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the relevant mechanisms in experimental rats, expecting to understand whether MANF was a potential therapeutic target for SAH treatment. A perforation model of SAH was introduced into the study. Recombinant human MANF (rh-MANF) and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor (MK2206) were used to explore the effect and the mechanisms. Multiple approaches for systemic assessment were employed in the research, including the Garcia test, the SAH grade, Evans blue (EB) dye leakage, brain-water content (BWC), the rotarod test, and the Morris water-navigation task, as were biotechniques, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. MANF was mainly expressed in rat neurons, and its expression increased significantly at 3 h after SAH induction and peaked at 24 h. Stereotactic injection of rh-MANF into the cerebroventricle significantly increased the level of MANF, p-Akt, p-mouse double minute 2 homolog (p-MDM2), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in brain tissue, whereas it down-regulated the expression of P53, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3, which indicated that neuronal apoptosis was remarkably suppressed. Expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was also suppressed by the rh-MANF injection. Furthermore, neurologic deficits, EB dye leakage, and BWC were reduced, and long-lasting neuroprotection was noted with rh-MANF administration. The antiapoptotic and blood-brain barrier (BBB) protective effect could be offset by administering MK2206. MANF could alleviate neuronal apoptosis by activating Akt-dependent prosurvival pathway and abate BBB damage via MMP-9 suppression. MANF showed not only transient but also long-lasting neuroprotective properties. The rh-MANF as a potential drug for treating SAH might be of clinical use.-Li, T., Xu, W., Gao, L., Guan, G., Zhang, Z., He, P., Xu, H., Fan, L., Yan, F., Chen, G. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor affords neuroprotection to early brain injury induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage via activating Akt-dependent prosurvival pathway and defending blood-brain barrier integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2890238467,"Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is dynamic and changes over time. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the longitudinal changes in MS lesions over time on ultra-high field MR imaging. Nine patients with MS underwent high-resolution 3D-susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and 2D-gradient-echo-T2*-weighted imaging on 7T MRI at baseline and after ~2.4 years of follow-up. Morphologic imaging characteristics, signal intensity patterns and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) values of lesions were recorded at both time points. Lesions were classified as ""iron-laden"" if they demonstrated hypointense signal on T2*-weighted images and/or SWI as well as hyperintense signal on QSM. Lesions were considered ""non-iron-laden"" if they were hyperintense on T2*/SWI and isointense or hyperintense on QSM. Total of 162 non-iron-laden and 29 iron-laden lesions were observed at baseline. No change in baseline lesion size during follow up was recorded in 92.7%; no change in lesion-vessel relationship in 86.5%; and no change in signal intensity pattern in 96.9% of lesions. Three lesions which were non-iron-laden at baseline, exhibited iron at follow-up. In two iron-laden lesions, redistribution of iron content was observed at follow-up. Two-thirds of these iron-laden lesions showed an increase in QSM at follow-up relative to baseline, and the remaining one-third exhibited decrease in QSM. Most of the newly formed lesions (11/13, 84.6%) at follow-up were iron-laden. 7T multiparametric MRI is a useful tool for tracking the evolution of MS lesions, especially with regard to changes in iron content."
https://openalex.org/W2890858305,"To investigate whether items of the SF-12, widely used to assess health outcome in clinical practice and public health research, provide unbiased measurements of underlying constructs in different demographic groups regarding gender, age, educational level and ethnicity.We included 23,146 men and women aged 18-70 of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, or Moroccan origin from the HELIUS study. Both multiple group confirmatory factor analyses (MGCFA), with increasingly stringent model constraints (i.e. assessing Configural, Metric, Strong and Strict measurement invariance (MI)), and regression analysis were conducted to establish comparability of SF-12 items across demographic groups.MI regarding gender, age and education was tested in the ethnic Dutch group (N = 4,615). In each subsequent step of testing MI, change in goodness-of-fit measures did not exceed 0.010 (RMSEA) or 0.004 (CFI). Moreover, goodness-of-fit indices showed good fit for strict invariance models: RMSEA<0.055; CFI>0.97. Regarding ethnicity, RMSEA values of metric and subsequent models fell above 0.055, indicating violation of measurement invariance in factor loadings, thresholds and residual variances. Regression analysis revealed possible age-, education- and ethnicity-related DIF. Adjustment for this DIF had little impact on the magnitude of age and educational differences in physical and mental health, but ethnic inequalities in physical health-and to a lesser extent mental health-were reduced after DIF adjustment.We found no evidence of violation of measurement invariance of the SF-12 regarding gender, age and educational level. If minor DIF would remain undetected in our MGCFA analyses, we showed that this would have negligible effect on the magnitude of demographic health inequalities. Regarding ethnicity, the SF-12 was not measurement invariant. After accounting for DIF, we observed a reduction of ethnic inequalities in health, in particular in physical health. Caution is warranted when comparing SF-12 scores across population groups with various ethnic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2890291824,"Background Disulfiram (DSF), which is used to treat alcohol dependence, has been reported to have anti-cancer effects in various malignant tumors. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects and mechanism of DSF in HNSCC. Methods Head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines (FaDu and Hep2) were used to analyze the anti-cancer effects of DSF. The anti-cancer effects of DSF were confirmed in vivo using a xenograft tumor model. Results The anti-cancer effects of DSF in HNSCC were found to be copper (Cu) dependent. Specifically, DSF/Cu markedly inhibited HNSCC at a concentration of 1 μM. After DSF/Cu administration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was remarkable starting at 0.5 μM, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of DSF/Cu on HNSCC are mediated through the formation of ROS. The levels of phospho-JNK, phospho-cJun and phospho-p38 were increased after DSF/Cu treatment while levels of phospho-Akt were decreased. These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of DSF/Cu on HNSCC cells involve ROS formation and down-regulation of Akt-signaling. Through these molecular mechanisms, DSF ultimately induce the inhibitory effects on HNSCC cell lines mainly through autophagic cell death, not apoptotic cell death. Lastly, we investigated the clinical relevance of DSF/Cu using a HNSCC xenograft animal model, which showed that tumor growth was remarkably decreased by DSF (50 mg/kg injection). Conclusion In treating patients with HNSCC, DSF may contribute to improved HNSCC patient’s survival. The characteristic anti-cancer effects of DSF on HNSCC may suggest new therapeutic potential for this medication in HNSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2892236215,"The nasal cavity hosts an array of chemoresponsive cells, including the extended olfactory system and several other cells involved in detection of and responses to irritants. Solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs), which respond to irritants and bacteria, express the transient receptor potential channel TRPM5 an essential element of the taste transduction-signaling cascade. Microvillous cells (MVCs), non-neuronal cells situated in the apical layer of the main olfactory epithelium, also express TRPM5, but their function has not yet been clarified. TRPM5-positive MVCs, like SCCs, show a cholinergic phenotype expressing choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), but none of the other elements of the bitter taste transduction cascade could be detected. We reexamined TRPM5-positive MVCs with more sensitive gene expression and staining techniques to clarify whether they rely only on TRPM5 and ChAT or express other elements of the taste/SCC transduction cascade. Analyzing existing RNA sequencing data from whole olfactory mucosa and isolated olfactory sensory neurons, we determined that several elements of the taste/SCC transduction cascade, including taste receptors, are expressed in the olfactory mucosa in cells other than olfactory sensory neurons. Immunostaining confirmed the presence TRPM5 and ChAT in a subset of cells of the olfactory mucosa, which also showed the expression of PLCB2, gustducin, and T1R3. Specifically, these cells were identified as TRPM5-positive MVCs. Furthermore, we examined whether MVCs are innervated by trigeminal fibers, similarly to SCCs. Using antibodies against trigeminal nerve markers calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, we determined that, despite the cholinergic phenotype, most MVCs in the olfactory mucosa lacked consistent trigeminal innervation. Our findings indicate that MVCs, like SCCs, express all the elements of the bitter taste transduction cascade but that, unlike SCCs, they possess only sparse trigeminal innervation. The cholinergic phenotype of MVCs suggests a modulatory function of the surrounding olfactory epithelium, through the release of acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W2892334526,"Breast cancer, one of the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide, is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 mutations were common observed in breast cancer representing potential clinical biomarkers for cancer classification and treatment. A comprehensive knowledge of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 mutations in breast cancer was still insufficient in Chinese population. In this study, the complete coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 genes were sequenced in paired breast tumor and normal tissues from 313 Chinese breast cancer patients using microfluidic PCR-based target enrichment and next-generation sequencing technology. Total 120 somatic mutations were identified in 190 of the 313 patients (60.7%), with the mutation frequency of AKT1 as 3.2%, PIK3CA as 36.4%, PTEN as 4.8%, and TP53 as 33.9%. Among these mutations, 1 in PIK3CA (p.I69N), 3 in PTEN (p.K62X, c.635-12_636delTTAACCATGCAGAT and p.N340IfsTer4) and 5 in TP53 (p.Q136AfsTer5, p.K139_P142del, p.Y234dup, p.V274LfsTer31 and p.N310TfsTer35) were novel. Notably, PIK3CA somatic mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive or PR-positive tumors. TP53 somatic mutations were significantly associated with ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive, BRCA1 mutation, Ki67 high expression and basal-like tumors. Our findings provided a comprehensive mutation profiling of AKT1, PIK3CA, PTEN and TP53 genes in Chinese breast cancer patients, which have potential implications in clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W2889980264,"Computational models of normal liver function and xenobiotic induced liver damage are increasingly being used to interpret in vitro and in vivo data and as an approach to the de novo prediction of the liver's response to xenobiotics. The microdosimetry (dose at the level of individual cells) of xenobiotics vary spatially within the liver because of both compound-independent and compound-dependent factors. In this paper, we build model liver lobules to investigate the interplay between vascular structure, blood flow and cellular transport that lead to regional variations in microdosimetry. We then compared simulation results obtained using this complex spatial model with a simpler linear pipe model of a sinusoid and a very simple single box model. We found that variations in diffusive transport, transporter-mediated transport and metabolism, coupled with complex liver sinusoid architecture and blood flow distribution, led to three essential patterns of xenobiotic exposure within the virtual liver lobule: (1) lobular-wise uniform, (2) radially varying and (3) both radially and azimuthally varying. We propose to use these essential patterns of exposure as a reference for selection of model representations when a computational study involves modeling detailed hepatic responses to xenobiotics."

Recent structural analysis and coupled mass spectrometry studies have shown that the Escherichia coli ammonium transporter AmtB specifically binds 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). Upon POPG binding, several residues of AmtB undergo a small conformational change, which stabilizes the protein against unfolding. However, no studies have so far been conducted, to our knowledge, to explore whether POPG binding to AmtB has functional consequences. Here, we used an in vitro experimental assay with purified components, together with molecular dynamics simulations, to characterize the relation between POPG binding and AmtB activity. We show that the AmtB activity is electrogenic. Our results indicate that the activity, at the molecular level, of Amt in archaebacteria and eubacteria may differ. We also show that POPG is an important cofactor for AmtB activity and that, in the absence of POPG, AmtB cannot complete the full translocation cycle. Furthermore, our simulations reveal previously undiscovered POPG binding sites on the intracellular side of the lipid bilayer between the AmtB subunits. Possible molecular mechanisms explaining the functional role of POPG are discussed.—Mirandela, G. D., Tamburrino, G., Hoskisson, P. A., Zachariae, U., Javelle, A.

https://openalex.org/W2890065023,"There has been evidence demonstrating that China has had a persistently low and below-replacement level fertility since early 1990s, causing concerns of a rapidly aging population and sustainability of the Chinese economy. To avoid adverse effects of excessively low fertility, the Chinese government has recently changed its family planning policy from ""one-child policy"" to ""two-child policy."" Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the newly initiated two-child policy is questionable if women's average desired number of children or desired fertility for their lifetime is below the threshold fertility allowed by the two-child policy. Therefore, this study argues that it would be interesting and pertinent to know women's fertility desires under the circumstances of no policy restrictions and understand major factors that may affect their desired fertility. Based on a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling survey with 2,516 women respondents in rural Shaanxi, this study tries to estimate desired fertility of rural women and evaluate the impact of important socioeconomic factors on their desired fertility. The results of this study reveal that the average lifetime desired fertility for rural women of childbearing age in Shaanxi is about 1.71, below the total fertility rate at the replacement level. The findings of this study suggest that women's marriage age, the pecuniary costs of having children, women's income forgone for having children, and social security benefits available for rural residents at retirement age, are significantly and negatively related to desired fertility. However, rural women's cultural views towards fertility are significantly but positively related to their desired fertility. This study further confirms that China has entered an era of low fertility, and thus, any policy restrictions on fertility may no longer be necessary. Instead, government programs which support childbearing and childrearing are needed to prevent excessive low fertility and rapid aging of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2891117465,"In a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme, a user may have multiple attributes, and each attribute may be shared simultaneously by many users. The decryption key of an attribute can thus be shared by many users who all possess the attribute. For monetary gain, a malicious authorized user may reveal his/her decryption key to a third party, and it is difficult to trace the owner of primitive secret key from an exposed key. At the same time, this situation may also limit commercial applications of CP-ABE systems. To solve these problems and enable fine-grained access control for the encrypted data, we propose a traceable CP-ABE scheme with attribute-level user revocation for cloud storage (TUR-CPABE). Our scheme enjoys four advantages. First, it has the ability to trace malicious users who have leaked key information from the system. Second, it supports attribute-level user revocation for malicious users and allows ABE fine-grained access control. Third, it allows secret key updates and ciphertext updates to resist collusion attacks between users. Fourth, outsourcing encryption, decryption and attribute revocation are used to reduce the computational burden on data owners, data users and the trust authority, respectively. In addition, our scheme has been proven to be secure against chosen plaintext attacks under a selective access policy based on decisional q - BDHE assumption in the standard model."
https://openalex.org/W2892265003,"Chemotactic cell migration is a central mechanism during cancer cell invasion and hence metastasis. In order to mimic in vivo conditions, we used a three-dimensional hydrogel matrix made of collagen I and a stable gradient-generating chemotaxis assay system, which is commercially available (μ-Slide Chemotaxis) to characterize epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced chemotaxis of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Surprisingly, chemotactic effects of EGF on MDA-MB-231 cells could neither be observed in the standard growth medium DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% serum nor in starvation medium. In contrast, after adapting the cells to the serum-free growth medium UltraCULTURETM, significant chemotactic effects could be measured with high sensitivity. The extremely time-stable linear gradients, generated in the chemotaxis chamber, led to consistent directional migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Dose-response experiments showed increased directional and kinetic response of MDA-MB-231 cells towards stable gradients of EGF. While EGF-guided directional migration (chemotaxis) was highly concentration-dependent with the highest response at 1.5 nM/mm EGF, we found that the chemokinetic effect induced by EGF was concentration-independent. Both, blocking the ligand-binding domain of the EGF receptor by an antibody (monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody 225) and inhibition of its kinase domain by a small molecule inhibitor (AG1478) led to a reduction in EGF-induced directed migration. The high sensitivity of the assay even allowed us to observe synergistic effects in EGF-receptor inhibition using a combination of low doses of both inhibitor types. Those results validate the fact that EGF is a potent guidance cue for MDA-MB-231 cell migration and help to understand the mechanism behind chemotaxis-driven cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2890578015,"The industrial production of long-lived charcoal products (commonly referred to as biochar) from otherwise shorter-lived logging resides (commonly referred to a slash) has been proposed as a means to increasing terrestrial carbon storage thus mitigating global warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We present a generalized model that describes the temporal dynamics of biochar carbon stocks, relative to carbon of unmodified logging residue, and evaluate the sensitivity of carbon storage to various biophysical and production parameters. Using this model, we then attribute net carbon storage to several potential biochar production scenarios, specifically engineered to use wood recovered from harvests prescribed to reduce fire hazard in mixed-conifer forests of South-central Oregon. Relative to a baseline scenario where logging residue is left to decay on site, the net carbon storage attributed to 20 years of biochar production is generally negative for the first several decades, then remains positive for several centuries at levels approximately one-fourth the total feedstock carbon processed. Positive net carbon storage and the time required for it to manifest is notably sensitive to biochar conversion efficiencies, logging residue decay rates, and alternate baseline fates of logging residue. The magnitude of net carbon storage, and the time required for it to become positive, is largely similar across range of production facility types. Moreover, the time required for net carbon storage to become positive, and its magnitude over the first 100 years is notably insensitive to biochar decomposition rates provided biochar decays at least ten-times slower than the logging residue it is made from."
https://openalex.org/W2952212450,"Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is the only technique able to determine both the enthalpy and entropy of noncovalent association in a single experiment. The standard data analysis method based on nonlinear regression, however, provides unrealistically small uncertainty estimates due to its neglect of dominant sources of error. Here, we present a Bayesian framework for sampling from the posterior distribution of all thermodynamic parameters and other quantities of interest from one or more ITC experiments, allowing uncertainties and correlations to be quantitatively assessed. For a series of ITC measurements on metal:chelator and protein:ligand systems, the Bayesian approach yields uncertainties which represent the variability from experiment to experiment more accurately than the standard data analysis. In some datasets, the median enthalpy of binding is shifted by as much as 1.5 kcal/mol.

https://openalex.org/W2891114160,"Lettuce chlorosis virus-SP (LCV-SP) (family Closteroviridae, genus Crinivirus), is a new strain of LCV which is able to infect green bean plants but not lettuce. In the present study, high-throughput and Sanger sequencing of RNA was used to obtain the LCV-SP full-length sequence. The LCV-SP genome comprises 8825 nt and 8672 nt long RNA1 and RNA2 respectively. RNA1 of LCV-SP contains four ORFs, the proteins encoded by the ORF1a and ORF1b are closely related to LCV RNA1 from California (FJ380118) whereas the 3´ end encodes proteins which share high amino acid sequence identity with RNA1 of Bean yellow disorder virus (BnYDV; EU191904). The genomic sequence of RNA2 consists of 8 ORFs, instead of 10 ORFs contained in LCV-California isolate. The distribution of vsiRNA (virus-derived small interfering RNA) along the LCV-SP genome suggested the presence of subgenomic RNAs corresponding with HSP70, P6.4 and P60. Results of the analysis using RDP4 and Simplot programs are the proof of the evidence that LCV-SP is the first recombinant of the family Closteroviridae by crossover recombination of intact ORFs, being the LCV RNA1 (FJ380118) and BnYDV RNA1 (EU191904) the origin of the new LCV strain. Genetic diversity values of virus isolates in the recombinant region obtained after sampling LCV-SP infected green bean between 2011 and 2017 might suggest that the recombinant virus event occurred in the area before this period. The presence of LCV-SP shows the role of recombination as a driving force of evolution within the genus Crinivirus, a globally distributed, emergent genus."

Using covariates included in the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services risk-adjustment model for pneumonia readmissions in a multivariable regression model for survey data, we identified predictors of 30-day readmission.We identified 629,939 index pneumonia hospitalizations with a weighted estimate of 1,472,069 nationally. Overall, 16.2% of patients were readmitted within 30 days of their hospitalization for pneumonia, with 30-day readmission rates of 12.4% in the 18-44 year age-group, 16.1% in the 45-64 year age-group, and 16.7% in the ≥65-year age-group. In risk-adjusted analyses, compared with elderly, middle-aged adults were more likely to be readmitted (risk-adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07). Mean cost per readmission was also highest for this age group at $15,976.Middle-aged adults experience substantial rates of 30-day readmission that are comparable to those over 65 years of age, with a higher cost per readmission event.

https://openalex.org/W2891691987,"In this study, we described facility-level voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) unit cost, examined unit cost variation across facilities, and investigated key facility characteristics associated with unit cost variation.We used data from 107 facilities in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Zambia covering 2011 or 2012. We used micro-costing to estimate economic costs from the service provider's perspective. Average annual costs per client were estimated in 2013 United States dollars (US$). Econometric analysis was used to explore the relationship between VMMC total and unit cost and facility characteristics.Average VMMC unit cost ranged from US$66 (SD US$79) in Kenya to US$160 (SD US$144) in South Africa. Total cost function estimates were consistent with economies of scale and scope. We found a negative association between the number of VMMC clients and VMMC unit cost with a 3% decrease in unit cost for every 10% increase in number of clients and we found a negative association between the provision of other HIV services and VMMC unit cost. Also, VMMC unit cost was lower in primary health care facilities than in hospitals, and lower in facilities implementing task shifting.Substantial efficiency gains could be made in VMMC service delivery in all countries. Options to increase efficiency of VMMC programs in the short term include focusing service provision in high yield sites when demand is high, focusing on task shifting, and taking advantage of efficiencies created by integrating HIV services. In the longer term, reductions in VMMC unit cost are likely by increasing the volume of clients at facilities by implementing effective demand generation activities."
https://openalex.org/W2891840578,"Although lichenized fungi are among the most reliable indicators of forest quality and represent a considerable part of forest biodiversity, methods maximizing completeness of their species lists per area are lacking. Employing a novel methodological approach including a multi-expert competition and a search for local hot-spot plots, we have obtained outstanding data about epiphytic lichen biota in a part of the largest Central European virgin forest reserve Uholka–Shyrokyi Luh situated in Ukrainian Carpathians. Our field research consisted of two four-day periods: (1) an overall floristic survey and a search for spots with raised lichen diversity, and (2) survey in four one-hectare plots established in lichen diversity hot-spots along an altitudinal gradient. Recorded alpha-diversities in plots ranged from 181–228 species, but estimated species richness is in the range 207–322 species. Detected gamma-diversity was 387 species; estimates are 409–484 species. 93% of the species found in the forest were recorded in plots, but only 65% outside the plots. This underlines the high-efficiency of the multi-expert competitive survey in diversity hot-spot plots. Species richness in each one-hectare plot was equal to the numbers of species obtained by floristic surveys of much larger old-growth forest areas in Central Europe. Gamma-diversity detected in the Uholka primeval forest far exceeded all numbers achieved in Central European old-growth forests. Our method appears to be both effective (it obtains a more nearly complete inventory of species) and practical (the resources required are not unreasonably large)."
https://openalex.org/W2892236584,"Background Despite the availability of copious information regarding contraceptive use benefits and the factors that influence the uptake of the services, there is little evidence revealing the lived experiences of rural women. Thus, this study was conducted with the purpose of exploring the lived experiences of women regarding contraceptive use and related benefits towards women’s empowerment. Methods Interpretative phenomenological qualitative methodology was employed to explore the lived experiences of women. Data were collected through focus group discussions and in-depth individual interviews and analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological framework including phases of data immersion, transcribing, coding, theme development and phenomenological interpretation through hermeneutic circle. Result The reported lived experiences of rural women revealed that their livelihoods greatly improved in different ways after they began to use contraceptives. The benefits included securing more time, energy and social engagements. Contraceptive use helped women postpone unwanted pregnancies and child births and engage in various income generation activities that not only boosted family incomes but also created opportunity to mobilize the resources for different expenses without waiting for the handouts from their husbands. The women’s experiences also indicated that contraceptive use improved the educational status of their daughters and they experienced improved self-image, better social standing and improved family relations. The experiences further illustrated that contraceptive use was not only emancipatory and transformative, but also created peace and stability in their lives. Conclusion The study concludes that contraceptive use, which is part of a woman’s life experience, created remarkable opportunities and achievements. One of these was that women were able to control their bodies, reproduction and fertility which resulted in a higher degree of empowerment. The control of reproduction and fertility has liberated them from worries and entrapment of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. Moreover, contraceptive use led to wider opportunities in the community, by improving their status and building a sense of empowerment. Creating awareness around the benefits of contraceptive use has the potential to improve community and national development. Based on the result, the study recommends that systems should be established to capitalize on the lessons learned about the lives of current users and expand the remarkable achievements and experiences to non-user counterparts."

We present a Bayesian framework that involves aggregating pathogenicity data across multiple in silico scores on a gene-by-gene basis and multiple evidence statistics in both quantitative and qualitative forms, and performs 5-tiered variant classification based on the resulting probability credible interval. When evaluated in 1,161 missense variants, our gene-specific in silico model-based meta-predictor yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 96.0% and outperformed all other in silico predictors. Multifactorial model analysis incorporating all available evidence yielded 99.7% AUC, with 22.8% predicted as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Use of only 3 auto-computed evidence statistics yielded 98.6% AUC with 56.0% predicted as VUS, which represented sufficient accuracy to rapidly assign a significant portion of VUS to clinically meaningful classifications. Collectively, our findings support the use of this framework to conduct large-scale variant prioritization using in silico predictors followed by variant prediction and classification with a high degree of predictive accuracy."

This study analyzed trends in major cancer statistics according to sex and severity levels in Korea from 2006 to 2013. We included eight cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid, colorectal, gastric, lung, prostate, breast, and cervical cancer), using Korea Central Cancer Registry data. Severity level was classified by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) stage as follows: localized, regional, distant, or unknown. Numbers of incident cancer cases from 2006 to 2013 were described by sex and SEER stage. We estimated up to 8-year observed survival rates of major cancers by sex and SEER stage, and provided prevalence rates by sex and SEER stage in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Although increases in new cancer cases are slowing and the total number of incident cancer cases in 2013 decreased for the first time since 2006, the number of prevalent cancer cases was 663,530 in 2013, an increase of 13.3% compared to 2011. Among the five cancers affecting both sexes, sex-related differences in 5-year observed survival rates for lung cancer were greatest in the localized stage (men, 31.9%; women, 48.1%), regional stage (men, 20.0%; women, 31.3%), and unknown stage (men, 24.3%; women, 37.5%). The sum of the proportions of localized and regional stages for thyroid and breast cancer was over 90% in 2013, while the sum of the proportions of localized and regional stages for lung cancer was only 56.7% in 2013. Differences in observed survival rates between men and women were prominent in lung cancer for all SEER stages. The reported epidemiologic data from this study can be used to obtain a more valid measure of cancer burden using a summary measure of population health."

https://openalex.org/W2891803879,"Studies have established that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathology of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI). Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) activation was reported to reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the activation of VEGFR1 by placental growth factor (PlGF) could reduce MIRI by regulating oxidative stress. Mouse hearts and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), respectively. PlGF pretreatment markedly ameliorated I/R injury, as demonstrated by reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function. The protection was associated with a reduction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Similarly, our in vitro study showed that PlGF treatment improved cell viability and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Also, activation of VEGFR1 by PlGF suppressed intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, VEGFR1 neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which preventing PlGF binding, totally blocked this protective effect. In conclusion, activation of VEGFR1 could protect heart from I/R injury by suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2891204906,"Introduction In Nigeria, malaria remains a major burden. There is the presupposition that household members could have common exposure to malaria parasite and use of long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) could reduce transmission. This study was conducted to identify factors associated with asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia and LLIN use among households of confirmed malaria patients in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to August 2016 in twelve health facilities selected from three area councils in Abuja, Nigeria. Participants were selected using multi-stage sampling technique. Overall, we recruited 602 participants from 107 households linked to 107 malaria patients attending the health facilities. Data on LLIN ownership, utilization, and house characteristics were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Blood samples of household members were examined for malaria parasitaemia using microscopy. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and logistic regression (α = 0.05). Results Median age of respondents was 16.5 years (Interquartile range: 23 years); 55.0% were females. Proportions of households that owned and used at least one LLIN were 44.8% and 33.6%, respectively. Parasitaemia was detected in at least one family member of 102 (95.3%) index malaria patients. Prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia among study participants was 421/602 (69.9%). No association was found between individual LLIN use and malaria parasitaemia (odds ratio: 0.9, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.6–1.3) among study participants. Having bushes around the homes was associated with having malaria parasitaemia (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.7, 95%CI: 1.7–4.2) and less use of LLIN (aOR: 0.4, 95%CI: 0.2–0.9). Living in Kwali (aOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.0–0.2) was associated with less use of LLIN. Conclusion High prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and low use of LLIN among household members of malaria patients portend the risk of intra-household common source of malaria transmission. We recommend household health education on LLIN use and environmental management. Study to explore the role of preventive treatment of household members of confirmed malaria patient in curbing transmission is suggested. Strategies promoting LLIN use need to be intensified in Kwali."
https://openalex.org/W2891872917,"Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disorder, manifesting with a reduction in bone mass and deterioration of the microarchitecture. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have an innate ability to differentiate into several cell types, including osteoblasts (OB). Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) is an ethanol extract from ginseng and contains a highly concentrated form of ginsenoside. GRb1 shows extensive beneficial health effects such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, modulating the immune system and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. We hypothesized that GRb1 can promote MSC differentiation into OBs and inhibit bone loss. In the present study, we aimed to address two questions: (1) Will GRb1 have a positive effect on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs? and (2) Will GRb1 halt bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats? We investigated the effects of GRb1 on viability and osteogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). Our results showed that GRb1 at concentrations of 10−8 M and 10−6 M can increase alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization and the expression of osteogenic related proteins, such as osteopontin and osteoprotegerin, while incubating rMSCs with osteogenic induction medium and GRb1. Adding GRb1 into the medium can prevent rMSCs from Oxidative damage at the concentration of 25μM H2O2. Furthermore, 40 4-month-old rats were assigned to 5 groups(8 rats per group): the basal group, the sham group, the OVX group, the high dose of GRb1 group (6 mg/kg/day) and the low dose of GRb1 group (3 mg/kg/day). Rats recrived treatment 3days after surgery and last for 14 weeks. Examinations included serum analysis, mechanical testing, Masson-Goldner trichrome staining and bone histomorphometry analysis. The results showed that OVX can lead to dyslipidemia and excessive oxidative stress, whereas GRb1 cannot significantly halt dyslipidemia and excessive oxidative stress in OVX rats. In addition, the bone density of the lumbar vertebra and femur were decreased significantly in the OVX rats, and GRb1 could not inhibit bone loss. Bone histomorphometry analysis showed that the number and width of bone trabecula of the tibia were reduced in OVX rats, and GRb1 could not prevent their occurrence. A bone biomechanics assay showed that GRb1 cannot improve the ability of bone structure to resist fracture of the femur in OVX rats. The current study demonstrated that GRb1 has an obvious effect on osteogenic differentiation in rMSCs but no obvious effect on bone loss in OVX rats. These findings indicate GRb1 has a positive effect on rMSCs but does not have an effect on bone loss in OVX rats at the concentration we used."

To investigate this further in a TB-endemic setting, we assessed interferon-gamma levels in persons with and without LTBI in Peru.We analyzed data from patients with and without a recent type 1 (spontaneous) acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were enrolled from two public hospital networks in Lima, Peru, and underwent LTBI testing using the QuantiFERON® TB Gold In-tube (QFT) assay. Participants with a positive QFT test were defined as having LTBI, whereas participants with a negative QFT test were defined as non-LTBI. Unstimulated interferon-gamma was quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the QFT nil-tube, which does not contain antigens. We compared unstimulated interferon-gamma levels between LTBI and non-LTBI groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We used proportional odds modeling for multivariable analysis.Data from 214 participants were included in this analysis. Of those, 120 (56%) had LTBI. There were no significant differences in age, sex and comorbidities between LTBI and non-LTBI participants, except for recent AMI that was more frequent in LTBI. LTBI participants had higher unstimulated interferon-gamma levels compared to non-LTBI participants (median, interquartile range; 14 pg/mL, 6.5-52.8 vs. 6.5 pg/mL, 4.5-15; P<0.01). LTBI remained associated with higher unstimulated interferon-gamma levels after controlling for age, sex, recent AMI, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, end stage renal disease, malignancy, obesity, and tobacco use (adjusted odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.9). In a sensitivity analysis that excluded participants with AMI, the association between unstimulated interferon-gamma and LTBI remained present (adjusted odds ratio; 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-8.2).LTBI was associated with higher unstimulated interferon-gamma levels. These data suggest ongoing immune activation in LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2891587217,"Background A wider angle between the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) has been suggested to induce plaque formation in the arterial system via changes in shear stress. However, the relationship between the left main coronary artery (LM)-LAD angle and LAD stenosis has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the associations between the LM-LAD and LAD-LCX angles and LAD stenosis. Methods Coronary computed tomography angiographies (CTAs) of 201 patients with suspected coronary artery disease were analyzed. Angle measurements were performed twice by experts using CTA images, and the values were averaged. The patients were divided into two groups, based on the presence of significant LAD stenosis (luminal diameter narrowing ≥50%) on CTA. Results The mean LM-LAD and LAD-LCX angles were 37.46° and 63.04°, respectively. The LM-LAD and LAD-LCX angles of the group with significant LAD stenosis were significantly wider than that of the group with nonsignificant LAD stenosis (P<0.001; P = 0.020, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, an LAD-LCX angle greater than 60° showed a trend toward predicting significant LAD stenosis (HR, 3.14; 95% CI: 0.96–1026; P = 0.058). In contrast, an LM-LAD angle greater than 40° was a significant predictor of significant LAD stenosis (HR, 12.2; 95% CI: 2.60–56.52; P = 0.001). Conclusions The results of the present study may suggest that a wider LM-LAD angle could be used to identify patients at higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Thus, close follow–up and preventive management of other risk factors may be needed in such cases."
https://openalex.org/W2950699973,"The study presents the analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup W isolates recovered in the Czech Republic in 1984-2017 and their comparison with WGS data from other countries.Thirty-one Czech N. meningitidis W isolates, 22 from invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) and nine from healthy carriers were analysed. The 33-year study period was divided into three periods: 1984-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2017.Most study isolates from IMD and healthy carriers were assigned to clonal complex cc22 (n = 10) in all study periods. The second leading clonal complex was cc865 (n = 8) presented by IMD (n = 7) and carriage (n = 1) isolates that emerged in the last study period, 2010-2017. The third clonal complex was cc11 (n = 4) including IMD isolates from the first (1984-1999) and third (2010-2017) study periods. The following clonal complex was cc174 (n = 3) presented by IMD isolates from the first two study periods, i.e. 1984-1999 and 2000-2009. One isolate of each cc41/44 and cc1136 originated from healthy carriers from the second study period, 2000-2009. The comparison of WGS data for N. meningitidis W isolates recovered in the Czech Republic in the study period 1984-2017 and for isolates from other countries recovered in the same period showed that clonal complex cc865, ST-3342 is unique to the Czech Republic since 2010. Moreover, the comparison shows that cc11 in the Czech Republic does not comprise novel hypervirulent lineages reported from both European and non-European countries. All 31 study isolates were assigned to Bexsero® Antigen Sequence Types (BAST), and seven of them were of newly described BASTs.WGS analysis contributed considerably to a more detailed molecular characterization of N. meningitidis W isolates recovered in the Czech Republic over a 33-year period and allowed for a spatial and temporal comparison of these characteristics between isolates from the Czech Republic and other countries. The most interesting finding of this study is that eight of 31 Czech isolates of N. meningitidis W belong to clonal complex cc865, which is uncommon for serogroup W. In addition, the WGS data precised the base for the update of the recommendation for vaccination in the Czech Republic."
https://openalex.org/W2892048508,"Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility is influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. To date, the majority of genetic studies of T2D have been in populations of European and Asian descent. The focus of this study is on genetic variations underlying T2D in Qataris, a population with one of the highest incidences of T2D worldwide. Results Illumina HiSeq exome sequencing was performed on 864 Qatari subjects (574 T2D cases, 290 controls). Sequence kernel association test (SKAT) gene-based analysis identified an association for low frequency potentially deleterious variants in 6 genes. However, these findings were not replicated by SKAT analysis in an independent cohort of 12,699 exomes, primarly due to the absence of low frequency potentially deleterious variants in 5 of the 6 genes. Interestingly one of the genes identified, catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1, β-catenin), is the key effector of the Wnt pathway and interacts with the nuclear receptor transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), variants which are the most strongly associated with risk of developing T2D worldwide. Single variant analysis did not identify any associated variants, suggesting the SKAT association signal was not driven by individual variants. None of the 6 associated genes were among 634 previously described T2D genes. Conclusions The observation that genes not previously linked to T2D in prior studies of European and Asian populations are associated with T2D in Qatar provides new insights into the complexity of T2D pathogenesis and emphasizes the importance of understudied populations when assessing genetic variation in the pathogenesis of common disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2889961404,"Despite the important functions of PPARγ in various cell types of the lung, PPARγ-deficiency in club cells induces only mild emphysema. Peroxisomes are distributed in a similar way as PPARγ in the lung and are mainly enriched in club and AECII cells. To date, the effects of PPARγ-deficiency on the overall peroxisomal compartment and its metabolic alterations in pulmonary club cells are unknown. Therefore, we characterized wild-type and club cell-specific PPARγ knockout-mice lungs and used C22 cells to investigate the peroxisomal compartment and its metabolic roles in the distal airway epithelium by means of 1) double-immunofluorescence labelling for peroxisomal proteins, 2) laser-assisted microdissection of the bronchiolar epithelium and subsequent qRT-PCR, 3) siRNA-transfection of PPARγand PPRE dual-luciferase reporter activity in C22 cells, 4) PPARg inhibition by GW9662, 5) GC-MS based lipid analysis. Our results reveal elevated levels of fatty acids, increased expression of PPARα and PPRE activity, a strong overall upregulation of the peroxisomal compartment and its associated gene expression (biogenesis, α-oxidation, β-oxidation, and plasmalogens) in PPARγ-deficient club cells. Interestingly, catalase was significantly increased and mistargeted into the cytoplasm, suggestive for oxidative stress by the PPARγ-deficiency in club cells. Taken together, PPARα-mediated metabolic induction and proliferation of peroxisomes via a PPRE-dependent mechanism could compensate PPARγ-deficiency in club cells."
https://openalex.org/W2891756721,"Image completion techniques are required to complete missing regions in digital images. A key challenge for image completion is keeping consistency of image structures without ambiguity and visual artifacts. We propose a novel method for image completion using image depth cue. Our method includes three major features. First, we compute the image gradient to improve image completion when searching for the most similar patches. Second, using image depth, we guide image completion by means of appropriate scale transformation. Third, we propose a global optimization patch-based method having gradient and depth features for image completion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is a potentially superior method for completing missing regions."
https://openalex.org/W2891089804,"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This condition is therefore the focus of quality initiatives, which primarily use audit and feedback to improve performance. However, feedback of quality data inconsistently affects clinician behavior. A hypothesis for this inconsistency is that a lack of comprehension of CLABSI data by decision makers prevents behavior change. In order to rigorously test this hypothesis, a comprehension scale is necessary. Therefore, we sought to develop a scale to assess comprehension of CLABSI quality metric data.The initial instrument was constructed via an exploratory approach, including literature review and iterative item development. The developed instrument was administered to a sample of clinicians, and each item was scored dichotomously as correct or incorrect. Psychometric evaluation via exploratory factor analyses (using tetrachoric correlations) and Cronbach's alpha were used to assess dimensionality and internal consistency.97 clinicians responded and were included. Factor analyses yielded a scale with one factor containing four items with an eigenvalue of 2.55 and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82. The final solution was interpreted as an overall CLABSI ""comprehension"" scale given its unidimensionality and assessment of each piece of data within the CLABSI feedback report. The cohort had a mean performance on the scale of 49% correct (median = 50%).We present the first psychometric evaluation of a preliminary scale that assesses clinician comprehension of CLABSI quality metric data. This scale has internal consistency, assesses clinically relevant concepts related to CLABSI comprehension, and is brief, which will assist in response rates. This scale has potential policy relevance as it could aid efforts to make quality metrics more effective in driving practice change."
