https://openalex.org/W1974896731,"The identification of the active sites in heterogeneous catalysis requires a combination of surface sensitive methods and reactivity studies. We determined the active site for hydrogen evolution, a reaction catalyzed by precious metals, on nanoparticulate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) by atomically resolving the surface of this catalyst before measuring electrochemical activity in solution. By preparing MoS2 nanoparticles of different sizes, we systematically varied the distribution of surface sites on MoS2 nanoparticles on Au(111), which we quantified with scanning tunneling microscopy. Electrocatalytic activity measurements for hydrogen evolution correlate linearly with the number of edge sites on the MoS2 catalyst."

Experiments performed with an atmospheric general circulation model including water isotopes support its temperature interpretation. We assessed the general correspondence between Dansgaard-Oeschger events and their smoothed Antarctic counterparts for this Dome C record, which reveals the presence of such features with similar amplitudes during previous glacial periods. We suggest that the interplay between obliquity and precession accounts for the variable intensity of interglacial periods in ice core records."
https://openalex.org/W2039845199,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver cancer, occurs mainly in men. Similar gender disparity is seen in mice given a chemical carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). DEN administration caused greater increases in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration in males than it did in females. Furthermore, ablation of IL-6 abolished the gender differences in hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. DEN exposure promoted production of IL-6 in Kupffer cells (KCs) in a manner dependent on the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88, ablation of which also protected male mice from DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Estrogen inhibited secretion of IL-6 from KCs exposed to necrotic hepatocytes and reduced circulating concentrations of IL-6 in DEN-treated male mice. We propose that estrogen-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production by KCs reduces liver cancer risk in females, and these findings may be used to prevent HCC in males."

https://openalex.org/W2017049373,"Current single-molecule detection techniques require labeling the target molecule. We report a highly specific and sensitive optical sensor based on an ultrahigh quality ( Q ) factor ( Q &gt; 10 8 ) whispering-gallery microcavity. The silica surface is functionalized to bind the target molecule; binding is detected by a resonant wavelength shift. Single-molecule detection is confirmed by observation of single-molecule binding events that shift the resonant frequency, as well as by the statistics for these shifts over many binding events. These shifts result from a thermo-optic mechanism. Additionally, label-free, single-molecule detection of interleukin-2 was demonstrated in serum. These experiments demonstrate a dynamic range of 10 12 in concentration, establishing the microcavity as a sensitive and versatile detector."

https://openalex.org/W1990044878,"The in vivo potential of neural stem cells in the postnatal mouse brain is not known, but because they produce many different types of neurons, they must be either very versatile or very diverse. By specifically targeting stem cells and following their progeny in vivo, we showed that postnatal stem cells in different regions produce different types of neurons, even when heterotopically grafted or grown in culture. This suggests that rather than being plastic and homogeneous, neural stem cells are a restricted and diverse population of progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2055276703,"Coherently moving flocks of birds, beasts or bacteria are examples of living matter with spontaneous orientational order. How do these systems differ from thermal equilibrium systems with such liquid-crystalline order? Working with a fluidized monolayer of macroscopic rods in the nematic liquid crystalline phase, we find giant number fluctuations consistent with a standard deviation growing linearly with the mean, in contrast to any situation where the Central Limit Theorem applies. These fluctuations are long-lived, decaying only as a logarithmic function of time. This shows that flocking, coherent motion and large-scale inhomogeneity can appear in a system in which particles do not communicate except by contact."
https://openalex.org/W2017742161,"Inflammation is increasingly recognized as an important component of tumorigenesis, although the mechanisms and pathways involved are not well understood. Tumor development is regulated by products of several modifier genes, but instructions for their tumor-specific expression are currently unknown. We show that the signaling through the adaptor protein MyD88 has a critical role in spontaneous tumor development in mice with heterozygous mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. We found that MyD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and has a critical role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development. This study thus reveals the important role of an innate immune signaling pathway in intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059184834,"Multiple DNA polymerases participate in replicating the leading and lagging strands of the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Although 50 years have passed since the first DNA polymerase was discovered, the identity of the major polymerase used for leading-strand replication is uncertain. We constructed a derivative of yeast DNA polymerase ϵ that retains high replication activity but has strongly reduced replication fidelity, particularly for thymine-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate (T-dTMP) but not adenine-deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate (A-dAMP) mismatches. Yeast strains with this DNA polymerase ϵ allele have elevated rates of T to A substitution mutations. The position and rate of these substitutions depend on the orientation of the mutational reporter and its location relative to origins of DNA replication and reveal a pattern indicating that DNA polymerase ϵ participates in leading-strand DNA replication."

However, the mechanism by which podoplanin induces these cellular processes including its receptor has not been elucidated to date. Podoplanin induced platelet aggregation with a long lag phase, which is dependent upon Src and phospholipase Cγ2 activation. However, it does not bind to glycoprotein VI. This mode of platelet activation was reminiscent of the snake toxin rhodocytin, the receptor of which has been identified by us as a novel platelet activation receptor, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) (Suzuki-Inoue, K., Fuller, G.

Association between CLEC-2 and podoplanin was confirmed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, their association was dependent on sialic acid on O-glycans of podoplanin. Recombinant CLEC-2 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by podoplanin-expressing tumor cells or lymphatic endothelial cells, suggesting that CLEC-2 is responsible for platelet aggregation induced by endogenously expressed podoplanin on the cell surfaces.

Several studies have reported on tumor cell-induced platelet activation, implicating that aggregation serves for tumor cell nestling, whereas released growth factors serve for angiogenesis or tumor growth. Aggrus, a sialoglycoprotein on the surface of cancer cells, which was later found to be identical to podoplanin, induces platelet aggregation (3Kato Y. Fujita N. Kunita A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T.

Podoplanin/aggrus is a type-I transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein that consists of an extracellular domain with abundant Ser/Thr residues as potential O-glycosylation sites, a single transmembrane portion, and a short cytoplasmic tail with putative sites for protein kinase C and cAMP phosphorylation (3Kato Y.

Recent investigations have indeed reinforced the notion that podoplanin/aggrus expression might be associated with tumor metastasis or malignant progression (11Mishima K. Kato Y. Kaneko M.K.

Podoplanin is also expressed abundantly on glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), after which the sialoglycoprotein was named, type I lung alveolar cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells (7Schacht V.

Podoplanin-deficient mice die at birth due to respiratory failure and have defects in lymphatic, but not blood vessel pattern formation, which are associated with diminished lymphatic transport, congenital lymphedema, and dilation of lymphatic vessels, suggesting that it is crucially involved in lymphatic vessel formation (15Schacht V. Ramirez M.I. Hong Y.K. Hirakawa S. Feng D. Harvey N. Williams M. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Oliver G. Detmar M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3546-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). However, how podoplanin regulates the formation of lymphatic vessels or tumor platelet interaction has remained totally unknown, and the identification of its pathophysiological target to which podoplanin interacts has been ardently awaited among research workers in a number of scientific fields. In this study, we sought to identify the target molecule for podoplanin on the platelet membrane since platelet aggregation can be used as a marker for their interaction. For this end, we investigated the characteristics of podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation and compared them with those of well defined platelet stimulators. In the process of physiologic thrombus formation with platelet aggregation, the first step is platelet interaction with exposed collagen fibers at sites of vessel injury (16Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Platelet adhesion and aggregation on collagen fibers and the subsequent stable clot formation are an integrated process that involves several platelet receptors and agonists such as ADP, thromboxane A2, and coagulation factors including thrombin. One of the major and powerful receptors involved herein is a collagen receptor, glycoprotein VI-FcRγ chain complex (GPVI) 2The abbreviations used are: GPVIglycoprotein VISykspleen tyrosine kinaseSLP-76SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDaPLCγ2phospholipase Cγ2CLEC-2C-type lectin-like receptor 2CHOChinese hamster ovaryIL2ssinterleukin 2 signal sequencePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLEClymphatic endothelial cellhhumanmmouserrecombinant.. The signal transduction pathway related to GPVI encompasses a number of intracellular signaling molecules, such as tyrosine kinases Src, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), an adapter protein, SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) (16Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel class of platelet activation receptor, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), which belongs to a non-classical C-type lectin, as a receptor on the platelet membrane for a platelet-aggregating snake venom, rhodocytin (17Suzuki-Inoue K.

Blood. 2006; 107: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). CLEC-2 generates activation signals depending on protein tyrosine phosphorylation including a tyrosine kinase Src, Syk, an adapter protein SLP-76, and PLCγ2 in platelets in a manner similar to GPVI (17Suzuki-Inoue K.

As a result of characterizing podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation, we found that the mode of platelet activation induced by podoplanin was reminiscent of the rhodocytin. Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether CLEC-2 serves as a physiological counterpart for podoplanin. Association between CLEC-2 and podoplanin was confirmed by flow cytometry. Moreover, recombinant CLEC-2 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by podoplanin-expressing tumor cells or lymphatic endothelial cells. These findings suggest that podoplanin stimulates platelet aggregation by interacting with CLEC-2 and that the interaction between podoplanin and CLEC-2 regulates various cellular responses related to podoplanin.

A cell line of murine colon carcinoma, Colon-26, was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). Colon-26 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Lymphatic endothelial cells were purchased from Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd.

PCR was performed using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers (the EcoRV in the forward primer and the BglII site in the reverse primer were underlined): human CLEC-2 (forward, 5′-CCGATTACACAGCGCAATTACCT-3′, reverse, 5′-GAAGATCTAGGTAGTTGGTCCAC-3′), mouse CLEC-2 (forward, 5′-CCGATTACCCAGCAAAAGTATCTA-3′, reverse, 5′-GAAGATCTAAGCAGTTGGTCCAC-3′), human podoplanin (forward, 5′-GCGATATCAGAAGGAGCCAGCACAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GGCAGATCTTGTTGACAAACCATCTTTC-3′), mouse podoplanin (forward, 5′-GTGATATCTGGGAGCGTTTGGTTCTG-3′, reverse, 5′-GGCAGATCTTGGCAAGCCATCTTTC-3′). The PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan), digested with EcoRV and BglII, purified again, and ligated to the pFUSE-hFc2 (IL2ss) vector or the pFUSE-mFc2 (IL2ss) vector (InvivoGen), which contains interleukin 2 signal sequence (IL2ss) before the ligation site to allow secretion of Fc fusion proteins. pFUSE-hFc2 (IL2ss) and pFUSE-rFc2 (IL2ss) contain human IgG Fc and rabbit IgG Fc after the ligation sites, respectively. The digested PCR product of human CLEC-2 and human podoplanin were ligated to the pFUSE-hFc2 (IL2ss) vector (hCLEC-2-hFc2, hPod-hFc2, respectively). Those of mouse CLEC-2 and mouse podoplanin were ligated to the pFUSE-rFc2 (IL2ss) vector (mCLEC-2-rFc2, mPod-rFc2, respectively). The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. The obtained construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were transfected with hCLEC-2-hFc, hPod-hFc2, mCLEC-2-rFc, mPod-rFc2 using the electroporation method (23Suzuki-Inoue K. Tulasne D. Shen Y. Shen Y. Bori-Sanz T. Inoue O. Jung S.M.

In the following day of the electroporation, the culture medium was replaced by reduced serum medium, Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). For the purification of the fusion proteins, the medium was centrifuged, and the obtained supernatant was applied to a column of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the fusion proteins were eluted by 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.0, followed by neutralization using 1 m Tris, pH 10.0. The proteins were dialyzed against PBS. Platelet Aggregation—Human or murine washed platelets at indicated concentrations were stimulated by 1.5 × 107/ml indicated cell lines, 20 μg/ml mPod-rFc2, 10 nm rhodocytin, 2 μg/ml Horm collagen, 0.5 units/ml thrombin, or 5 μm U46619. Platelet aggregation was monitored by measuring light transmission with the use of an AG-10 aggregation analyzer (Kowa, Tokyo, Japan) for 15 min under constant stirring at 1000 rpm at 37°C. The instrument was calibrated with buffer for 100% transmission. Where indicated, Me2SO, 10 μm PP3, or 10 μm PP2 was incubated with washed platelets for 5 min at 37°C before stimulation. In some experiments, 2.5 × 107/ml podoplanin-expressed cell lines were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml of the indicated recombinant proteins for 10 min at room temperature before addition to washed platelets. The final concentrations of podoplanin-expressed cell lines and that of recombinant proteins in platelet suspension were 1.5 × 107/ml and 15 μg/ml, respectively.

Briefly, human washed platelets (1 × 109/ml) were pretreated with 1 mm GRGDS peptide to inhibit platelet aggregation. Then, they were stimulated with 1.5 × 107/ml CHO cells transiently transfected with mouse podoplanin for the indicated duration times. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× ice-cold lysis buffer. Platelet lysates were precleared, and detergent-insoluble debris was clarified as described. The supernatant was dissolved with SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and Western blotted by anti-phospho tyrosine antibody (4G10). Murine washed platelets (2.5 × 108/ml) pretreated with 1 mm GRGDS were stimulated by 20 μg/ml mPod-rFc2. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and Western blotted by anti-phospho tyrosine antibody (4G10). Flow Cytometry Studies—Cells suspended in PBS (5 × 106/ ml, 100 μl) were incubated with 5 μg/ml of the first antibodies or 100 μg/ml of the recombinant proteins. Where indicated, cells were incubated sequentially with 100 nm rhodocytin and 100 μg/ml hPod-hFc2 for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, those cells were resuspended with 100 μlof PBS and stained with 3 μl of secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for 15 min. Stained cells were analyzed immediately using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were recorded and analyzed using CellQuest software. Platelet Aggregation Induced by Podoplanin Is Dependent on a Src Kinase and PLCγ2 but Not on GPVI—We investigated the characteristics of podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation and compared them with those of well defined platelet stimulators. PcDNA alone (MOCK CHO) or pcDNA encoding mouse podoplanin (mPod CHO) was transiently transfected with CHO cells, and their surface expression was confirmed by a flow cytometer (Fig. 1A, panel i). mPod CHO, but not MOCK CHO, stimulated aggregation of human platelets with a long lag phase (Fig. 1A, panel ii), suggesting that aggregation is induced by podoplanin but not by other factor in CHO cells. Moreover, anti-human podoplanin antibody (NZ-1) completely inhibited platelet aggregation, whereas anti-mouse podoplanin antibody (8F11), used as a negative control, did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by human podoplanin (3Kato Y.

Oh-hara T. Sato S. Isoe T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 921-925PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), further confirming the specific effect of podoplanin on platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation induced by mPod CHO was completely inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 but not by its inactive enentiomer PP3 (Fig. 1C). We also confirmed that CHO cells stably transfected with human podoplanin stimulate aggregation of human platelets, which was completely inhibited by PP2 but not by PP3 (data not shown). Consistent with the susceptibility to PP2, protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed during podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 1D). This experiment was performed in the presence of GRGDS peptide to inhibit platelet aggregation, but increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed in the absence of the peptide (data not shown). Whether recombinant podoplanin stimulates platelet aggregation was also examined. We generated recombinant extracellular domain of mouse podoplanin expressed as a dimeric rabbit immunoglobulin Fc domain fusion protein (mPod-rFc2) and stimulated murine platelets with the protein. To exclude the possibility that the Fc portion interacts with a stimulatory Fc receptor, FcγRIIA, we used murine platelets, which lack FcγRIIA. mPod-rFc2 also stimulated aggregation (Fig. 1E), suggesting that podoplanin, but not another cellular component, is responsible for platelet aggregation. The long lag phase before the initiation of aggregate formation and Src kinase-dependent platelet activation is reminiscent of platelet activation induced by collagen through GPVI or by the snake venom rhodocytin (18Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Kainoh M. Shin Y. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Ohmori T. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1643-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but not through G protein-coupled receptor, platelet aggregation through which is not dependent on Src kinase. Therefore, we first investigated the possibility that podoplanin activates platelets by binding to GPVI, using murine platelets deficient in GPVI-FcRγ chain complex. Podoplanin or rhodocytin, but not collagen, induced platelet aggregation in mice deficient in the GPVI-FcRγ chain complex (Fig. 2A), suggesting that GPVI is not a target protein for podoplanin. We were then prompted to determine whether podoplanin activates platelets by the mechanism similar to rhodocytin. As a receptor on the platelet membrane for rhodocytin, we have recently identified a novel class of platelet activation receptor, C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), which belongs to a non-classical C-type lectin (17Suzuki-Inoue K. Fuller G.L. Garcia A. Eble J.A. Pohlmann S. Inoue O. Gartner T.K. Hughan S.C. Pearce A.C. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D. Schweighoffer E. Zitzmann N. Morita T. Tybulewicz V.L. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Since PLCγ2isa crucial signaling molecule for rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation through CLEC-2 (17Suzuki-Inoue K. Fuller G.L. Garcia A. Eble J.A. Pohlmann S. Inoue O. Gartner T.K. Hughan S.C. Pearce A.C. Laing G.D. Theakston R.D. Schweighoffer E. Zitzmann N. Morita T. Tybulewicz V.L. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we first checked whether PLCγ2 is required for podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation. Podoplanin as well as rhodocytin induced platelet aggregation in wild type mice but not in PLCγ2-deficient mice (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, thrombin invariably induced platelet aggregation in both mice (Fig. 2B). Since all the data hitherto have suggested that podoplanin-induced platelet aggregation has a profile quite similar to that of rhodocytin, we came to a hypothesis that CLEC-2 is a physiological counterpart for podoplanin. Podoplanin Stimulates Platelet Aggregation by Interacting with CLEC-2—We next investigated the binding of recombinant CLEC-2 to podoplanin-expressing CHO cells. We utilized recombinant extracellular domain of human CLEC-2 expressed as a dimeric human immunoglobulin Fc domain fusion protein (hCLEC-2-hFc2). A fusion protein of human GPVI and human IgG Fc (hGPVI-hFc2) is used as a negative control. CHO cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA alone or pcDNA encoding mouse podoplanin. Flow cytometric analysis using a specific anti-podoplanin antibody confirmed podoplanin expression on the CHO cells (Fig. 3A, panel i). Mock-(MOCK CHO) or mouse podoplanin-transfected CHO cells (mPod CHO) were incubated with hCLEC-2-hFc2 or hGPVI-hFc2, and then specific binding was detected with FITC-labeled anti-human IgG. hCLEC-2-hFc2 (Fig. 3A, panel ii), but not hGPVI-hFc2 (Fig. 3A, panel iii), bound to podoplanin-expressing CHO cells, suggesting that CLEC-2 associates with podoplanin. Inversely, specific binding of recombinant podoplanin to CLEC-2-expressing cells was examined. To obtain CLEC-2-expressing cells, we used 293"

To determine the role that BACE1 plays in the development of Aβ-driven AD-like pathology, we have crossed PDAPP mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD overexpressing human mutated APP, onto mice with either a homozygous or heterozygous BACE1 gene knockout. Analysis of PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice demonstrated that BACE1 is absolutely required for both Aβ generation and the development of age-associated plaque pathology. Furthermore, synaptic deficits, a neurodegenerative pathology characteristic of AD, were also reversed in the bigenic mice. To determine the extent of BACE1 reduction required to significantly inhibit pathology, PDAPP mice having a heterozygous BACE1 gene knock-out were evaluated for Aβ generation and for the development of pathology. Although the 50% reduction in BACE1 enzyme levels caused only a 12% decrease in Aβ levels in young mice, it nonetheless resulted in a dramatic reduction in Aβ plaques, neuritic burden, and synaptic deficits in older mice. Quantitative analyses indicate that brain Aβ levels in young APP transgenic mice are not the sole determinant for the changes in plaque pathology mediated by reduced BACE1.

As the initiating enzyme in the generation of Aβ, BACE1 is a key drug target and would be predicted to abrogate pathologies associated with any form of Aβ. To avoid potential side effects resulting from complete loss of BACE1 activity, it is critical to determine the required degree of inhibition necessary for potential therapeutic benefit. Cognitive decline in AD is believed to be due to the progressive degeneration of synapses and neurons (13DeKosky S.T. Scheff S.W. Ann.

However, the complete characterization of age-dependent, AD-related neuropathology and neurodegeneration in human APP transgenic mice affected by BACE1-knock-out is still lacking. In particular, the role of Aβ in synaptic pathology, a plaque-independent pathology (14Terry R. Masliah E. Hansen L.A. Terry R. Katzman R. Bick K.L. Sisodia S.S.

We have used BACE1 knock-out animals crossed with PDAPP mice to define the role of Aβ in plaque, neuritic, and synaptic pathology and, thus, evaluate BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach for AD. To determine the degree of BACE1 inhibition required to impact pathology, we crossed PDAPP mice onto the heterozygous BACE1 knock-out background and examined the effects of partially reduced BACE1 on Aβ levels and on AD-like pathologies. We find that homozygous ablation of BACE1 reduces plaque and synaptic pathologies in the PDAPP mouse model. Ablation of a single BACE1 allele has only a modest effect on Aβ levels yet significantly reduces plaque and synaptic pathologies in these mice. These observations suggest that only modest inhibition of Aβ in AD patients could lead to a significant reduction of pathology.

Mice were anesthetized, and their brains were quickly removed and fixed for 48 h in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde before being processed for immunohistochemistry or dissected into sub-brain regions and snap-frozen for biochemical analyses.TABLE 1List of abbreviations for transgene genotypes Table 1 shows all the genotypes and their abbreviations for the mice analyzed in this studyPDAPP transgeneBACE1 geneAbbreviationWild typeWild typeWT/BACE(+/+)HeterozygousWild typePDAPP/BACE(+/+)Wild typeComplete knockout (2 alleles deleted)WT/BACE(–/–)HeterozygousComplete knockoutPDAPP/BACE(–/–)Wild typePartial knockout (1 allele deleted)WT/BACE(+/–)HeterozygousPartial knockoutPDAPP/BACE(+/–)HomozygousWild typePDAPPhom/BACE(+/+)HomozygousComplete knockoutPDAPPhom/BACE(–/–) Open table in a new tab Quantitation of Aβ, β-sAPP, β-Secretase Activity, and Plaque Burden—Snap-frozen cortices and hippocampi were homogenized in 5 m guanidine buffer, and levels of β-sAPP, total Aβ (Aβ1–x), and of Aβ-42 were quantitated by ELISA as described (25Johnson-Wood K.

All assays contained 10 μg of membrane protein per ml. The substrate used was recombinant bacterial maltose-binding protein fused to the C-terminal 125-amino acid sequence of the Swedish variant of APP (APP-Swe). The cleaved product was measure by ELISA using anti-bacterial maltose-binding protein capture and detected with 129sw antibody, specific for cleaved neo-epitope of β-secreted APP-Swe. Plaque burden and neuritic dystrophy were assessed by quantitative immuno-peroxidase histochemistry on free-floating, 40-μm-thick vibratome sections using the monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody 3D6 for the detection of plaques or the human specific APP antibody 8E5 for the detection of neuritic dystrophy as described (26Schenk D.

For each of these markers, six immunolabeled sections were analyzed per mouse, and the average of the individual measurements was used to calculate group medians. Quantitative Synaptophysin Immunohistochemistry—Forty-μm-thick free-floating sections were immunostained with 1:850-diluted anti-SYN antibody (Clone SY38, Dako, Carpenteria, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody following a standard protocol. Immunolabeled brain sections were assigned code numbers to ensure objective assessment and imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope mounted on a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope with Lasersharp software as described (28Masliah E.

For each mouse we obtained four confocal images (two per section) of the neocortex and two confocal images (one per section) of the hippocampal OML, each covering an area of 240 μm × 180 μm. The iris and gain levels were adjusted to obtain images with a pixel intensity within a linear range. Digitized, 8-bit images were transferred to a Macintosh computer, and the average pixel intensity of synaptophysin staining was calculated for each image with NIH Image.

Fig. 1A shows that this is also true for Aβ produced from the human APP transgene in the cortex of young PDAPP mice. Although robust levels of Aβ were detected by ELISA in the cortex of PDAPP/BACE(+/+) animals, none was detectable in cortex of PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice. This allowed us to dissect which pathological features of the PDAPP animals are due to Aβ and which are due to potential other effects of the APP transgene. Luo et al. (10Luo Y. Bolon B. Damore M.A. Fitzpatrick D. Liu H. Zhang J. Yan Q. Vassar R. Citron M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 14: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have reported that BACE1 knock-out prevented the development of amyloid plaque in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice. Because PDAPP (line 109) mice develop more aggressive plaque pathology, we wanted to determine whether BACE1 gene deletion likewise would prevent plaque formation in these animals. A qualitative assessment of the presence or absence of plaques in 13-month-old PDAPP/BACE(+/+) and PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice showed a complete absence of amyloid plaques in the mice with the latter genotype (Fig. 2, A1 and A2). The plaque burden observed in the PDAPP/BACE(+/+) mice was typical for PDAPP (109) animals at 13 months of age. At 13 months, the vast majority of Aβ in brains of PDAPP mice is deposited in amyloid plaques, and therefore, ELISA measurements of Aβ in guanidine-solubilized cortex provides another measurement of amyloid deposition (25Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). To verify that immunohistochemical analysis did not miss some forms of amyloid deposits, total Aβ load was quantitated by ELISA in solubilized cortex, which also showed a complete lack of Aβ in PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice (Fig. 1B). Thus, the production of Aβ and its deposition into plaques can be completely ablated by BACE1 gene knock-out in PDAPP mice. Dystrophic neurites co-localize with senile plaques in transgenic hAPP mice mouse models (15Masliah E. Sisk A. Mallory M. Mucke L. Schenk D. Games D. J.

Neurosci. 2004; 15: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) indicate that they form in response to the appearance of plaques. These pathologic features consist of swollen and distorted neurites, which can be visualized with APP-specific antibodies because they accumulate a variety of proteins including APP. The same animals investigated for amyloid plaques were also assessed for neuritic dystrophy (Figs. 2, B1 and B2). All of the PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice were devoid of dystrophic neurites, thus showing that BACE1 gene knock-out can also prevent plaque-dependent AD-like pathology in PDAPP mice.

https://openalex.org/W2125690951,"Recent findings of vestibular responses in part of the visual cortex--the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd)--indicate that vestibular signals might contribute to cortical processes that mediate the perception of self-motion. We tested this hypothesis in monkeys trained to perform a fine heading discrimination task solely on the basis of inertial motion cues. The sensitivity of the neuronal responses was typically lower than that of psychophysical performance, and only the most sensitive neurons rivaled behavioral performance. Responses recorded in MSTd were significantly correlated with perceptual decisions, and the correlations were strongest for the most sensitive neurons. These results support a functional link between MSTd and heading perception based on inertial motion cues. These cues seem mainly to be of vestibular origin, as labyrinthectomy produced a marked elevation of psychophysical thresholds and abolished MSTd responses. This study provides evidence that links single-unit activity to spatial perception mediated by vestibular signals, and supports the idea that the role of MSTd in self-motion perception extends beyond optic flow processing."

The proapoptotic effects of XAF1 have been attributed to both caspase-dependent and -independent means. In particular, XAF1 reverses the anti-caspase activity of XIAP, a physiological inhibitor of apoptosis. We further investigated the function of XAF1 by examining its relationship with other IAPs. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that XAF1 binds to XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, Livin, TsIAP, and NAIP but not Survivin, an IAP that prevents mitotic catastrophe and in which antiapoptotic activity is exerted through direct XIAP interaction and stabilization. We found that overexpressed XAF1 down-regulates the protein expression of Survivin. Under these conditions, Survivin expression was restored in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or a XIAP RING mutant that is defective in ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity, suggesting that XAF1 interaction activates E3 activity of XIAP and targets Survivin by direct ubiquitination. In addition, RNA interference targeting endogenous XIAP protected Survivin degradation by XAF1. Furthermore, interferon-β-mediated XAF1 induction promoted formation of an endogenous XIAP-XAF1-Survivin complex. This complex facilitated Survivin degradation, which was prevented in XAF1-/- stable clones.

Survivin is a structurally and functionally unique IAP in that it contains a single baculoviral IAP repeat and no RING domain and has evolved dual roles in mitosis and apoptosis. XIAP is a potent endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that functions by binding to and inhibiting caspases. In contrast, the physical interaction between Survivin and caspases appears to be mostly physiologically irrelevant. Instead, the mechanism of Survivin in promoting cytoprotection may lie in its ability to associate with XIAP and enhance its stability by antagonizing function of the RING E3 ligase domain (3Dohi T.

The potential link between this induction of the IAP antagonist XAF1 and the regulation of Survivin has not been determined.In this report, we investigated the relationship between XAF1 and different members of the IAP family. We found that XAF1 interacts with XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, Livin, TsIAP, and NAIP but not Survivin. In particular, the formation of the XIAP-XAF1 complex mediates Survivin down-regulation in an E3 ligase- and proteasome-dependent manner. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that IFN-β-mediated Survivin down-regulation requires XAF1 induction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Harvesting—All media were supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 unit/ml penicillin, and 1 μg/ml streptomycin (Fisher), and all cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 100-mm tissue culture grade dishes (Corning) and passaged every 48–72 h. 293T human embryonic kidney (Invitrogen), A-375 melanoma (ATCC), and SF-539 glioblastoma (Brain Tumor Research Center, University of California, San Francisco) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), with SF-539 supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 1% glutamine.

Full-length coding sequence of NAIP, TsIAP, and Survivin were subcloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA3–6myc using the BamHI and XhoI ligation sites. The primers 5′-CGGATCCATGGGACCTAAAGACAGT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCTAGGACAGGAAGGTGCGCACGCGGCTGC-3′ and were used to amplify a full-length Livin cDNA clone (Open Biosystems) using Platinum® Pfx and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified PCR product was cloned into the PCR2.1 vector using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The coding region was then subcloned into pcDNA3–6myc using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites on the primers. XAF1 was amplified using primers 5′-AGATCTATGGAAGGAGACTTCTCGGTG-3′ and 5′-ATCTAGCTGAAATTTCTCACTTGA-3′, cloned into PCR2.1 and was subcloned into pCI and pcDNA3–6myc using the BglII site on the primer and the XhoI site on PCR2.1. XIAP mutant 6myc-pcDNA3-XIAPH467A in which the replacement of His467 residue with Ala results in the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (18Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) was generated by using the Gene-Tailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen).Cells were seeded at low to medium density in 6-well plates, and transfections were performed in triplicate using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. For each of the cotransfection experiments, the total plasmid DNA transfected was maintained constant by the inclusion of the nonprotein expressing pcDNA3 vector.xaf1 shRNA Plasmid Construction and Stable Transfection—The design and construction of the shRNA clones against xaf1 was performed according to a method described previously (19Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In brief, U6 RNA PolIII promoter (D. McManus, University of Ottawa) was PCR-amplified using a forward primer (5′-AGGAGATCTGCGCAGGCAAAACGCACCAC-3′) and a variety of 96-nucleotide-long shRNA XAF1 primers as described previously (20McManus D.C. Lefebvre C.A. Cherton-Horvat G. St-Jean M. Kandimalla E.R. Agrawal S. Morris S.J. Durkin J.P. LaCasse E.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8105-8117Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) prior to cloning into a TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). The shRNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector devoid of its cytomegalovirus promoter and transfected into SF-539 cells as described above. Stable clones were selected in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen).Recombinant Adenoviral Vectors and Cell Infection—The adenoviral vectors adeno-lacZ and adeno-xaf1 were generated as reported previously (4Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GFP-RNAi-luciferase and GFP-RNAi-XIAP were gifts from Dr. Dan McManus (University of Ottawa). The design and construction of the RNAi clones against XIAP has been previously described (20McManus D.C. Lefebvre C.A. Cherton-Horvat G. St-Jean M. Kandimalla E.R. Agrawal S. Morris S.J. Durkin J.P. LaCasse E.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8105-8117Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at low density in 60–100-mm dishes and transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. Transduced cells were collected 48 h post-infection or exposed to further treatment with various agents before harvesting.Immunoprecipitation—Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-XIAP antibodies or the anti-c-Myc immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) as instructed by the manufacturer's protocol. Preimmunized nonspecific rabbit serum was used as a control.Western Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, equal amounts of SDS-solubilized samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (21Cheung H.H. Gurd J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Following protein transfer, individual proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting using the following antibodies with the stated dilutions recognizing: XAF1 at 1:500, XIAP at 1:1000, Survivin (Cell Signaling) at 1:1000, Myc tag (StressGen) at 1:1000, and β-Actin (Sigma) at 1:5000. β-Actin immunoreactivity was used as a loading control. Mouse monoclonal anti-XAF1 antibody was generated against full-length GST-XAF1 following standard techniques and recognized a reactive band at ∼34 kDa. Polyclonal anti-XIAP antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-XIAP fusion protein in RIBI adjuvant (Sigma) as described previously (4Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were reacted with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 680 (Molecular Probes) or with IRDye™800 (Rockland) at 1:10,000, and the infrared fluorescence signals were detected and analyzed using the Odyssey® infrared imaging system (LI-COR).Caspase Activity Assay—Cells were incubated in lysis buffer without protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant containing the solubilized proteins was quantified and stored at -80 °C. Caspase 3-like activity was measured in a 96-well microplate by incubating equal amount of proteins (20 or 50 μg) in the reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate DEVD-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) (BioMol). Fluorescence released from the substrate was monitored each minute at 37 °C for 60 min in a spectrofluorimeter microplate reader (POLARstar Galaxy, Fischer Scientific). Enzymatic activities were expressed as initial velocities (fluorescence intensity/min/mg) and normalized to basal controls.IFN-β Treatment—Cells were treated with vehicle or 500 units/ml recombinant IFN-β (Sigma) for 24 h and harvested for subsequent analysis.Proteasome Inhibitor Treatment—Transfected 293T cells were treated with 10 μm proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) at 20 h posttransfection for 4 h. The cells were harvested at 24 h posttransfection.RESULTSXAF1 Interacts with RING-bearing IAPs and NAIP but Not Survivin—XAF1 has been shown to bind XIAP and subsequently antagonize the anti-caspase activity of XIAP (4Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To extend this observation, we analyzed for XAF1 interactions with other members of the IAP family, specifically cIAP1, cIAP2, Livin, TsIAP, Survivin, and NAIP. After 48 h of cotransfection with expression constructs that encode for XAF1 and Myc-tagged IAPs, proteins were extracted from 293T cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. Isolated IAP complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by Western blot for the presence of XAF1. For all of the IAPs tested, with the exception of Survivin, XAF1 was found in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1), suggesting that most, but not all, IAPs interact with XAF1.An XIAP-XAF1 Complex Mediates Survivin Down-regulation—A complex of XIAP and Survivin is known to promote increased XIAP stability against ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal destruction and synergistic inhibition of apoptosis (3Dohi T. Okada K. Xia F. Wilford C.E. Samuel T. Welsh K. Marusawa H. Zou H. Armstrong R. Matsuzawa S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34087-34090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These previous results suggest that if XAF1 were to affect Survivin, it would likely be indirectly through its interaction with XIAP. Therefore, we next determined whether XAF1 might affect the formation of the XIAP-Survivin complex. Interestingly, in the absence of XAF1, we failed to detect a XIAP-Survivin interaction, whereas the presence of XAF1 promoted the formation of the XIAP-Survivin complex (Fig. 2, top panel). Moreover, XAF1 facilitated the down-regulation of overexpressed Survivin but only in the presence of XIAP overexpression (Fig. 2, lane 3 versus 4). These results indicate that XAF1 regulates the level of Survivin by modulating XIAP function.FIGURE 2An XIAP-XAF1 complex mediates Survivin down-regulation. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Survivin along with combinations of pcDNA3–6myc-XIAP, pcDNA3–6myc-XAF1, and pCI-XAF1. Cells were harvested and analyzed by Western immunoblotting (IB) for expression of Survivin, Myc-tagged proteins, and XAF1. Survivin levels were uniformly decreased in cells coexpressing XAF1 and 6myc-XIAP (lane 3). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell lysates (250 μg) with anti-c-Myc-agarose suspension (20 μl) or nonspecific rabbit serum was performed and subsequently analyzed by Western immunoblotting for Survivin. Cotransfection of cells with XAF1 and 6myc-XIAP promoted binding of Survivin to XIAP (lane 3). Results are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The E3 Ligase of XIAP Is Essential for Survivin Down-regulation by XAF1—XIAP contains a RING domain possessing E3 ligase activity that participates in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether XAF1-mediated down-regulation of Survivin might engage the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, XAF1 failed to induce Survivin degradation (Fig. 3, A and B). This result indicates that the proteasome is involved in XAF1-mediated Survivin turnover. To determine whether the RING E3 ligase of XIAP plays a role in Survivin down-regulation, we mutated the histidine at position 467 to alanine (XIAP-H467A), thereby rendering E3 ligase of XIAP inactive (18Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In accord with the concept that XIAP E3 regulates Survivin abundance, the XIAP-H467A mutant rescued Survivin degradation by XAF1 (Fig. 3, C and D). These results demonstrate that the E3 ligase activity of XIAP is essential to the XAF1-mediated down-regulation of Survivin.FIGURE 3The E3 ligase of XIAP is essential for Survivin down-regulation by XAF1.A, 293T cells were transfected with combinations of pcDNA3-Survivin, pcDNA3–6myc-XIAP, and pCI-XAF1. Transfected cells were treated with 10 μm proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 for 4 h and harvested at 24 h for analysis by Western immunoblotting. MG-132 treated cells showed greater Survivin expression levels compared with untreated cells. B, protein expression levels of Survivin from A were quantified and plotted as average ± S.E. Number of samples is indicated inside the parentheses. C, 293T cells were transfected with combinations of pcDNA3-Survivin, pCI-XAF1, and pcDNA3–6myc-XIAP or the mutant construct pcDNA3–6myc-XIAPH467A that expresses a XIAP lacking E3 ligase activity. The E3 inactive H467A mutation on XIAP rescued XAF1-mediated down-regulation of Survivin. D, protein expression levels of Survivin from C were quantified and plotted as average ± S.E. Number of samples is indicated inside the parentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate that endogenous XIAP affects physiological Survivin level in the presence of XAF1, we modulated XIAP expression level by an adenovirus that encodes for RNAi against XIAP. Although the overexpression of XAF1 down-regulates endogenous Survivin, the absence of XIAP prevented Survivin degradation (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, a physiological level of XIAP is sufficient in modulating Survivin overexpression in the presence of XAF1.FIGURE 4Endogenous XIAP affects XAF1-mediated physiological Survivin level.A, SK-N-BE2 cells were transduced with GFP-RNAi-luciferase and GFP-RNAi-XIAP for 48 h and subsequently transduced with adeno-xaf1 (lanes 3 and 4) for another 24 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were harvested and analyzed by Western immunoblotting for XIAP, XAF1, and Survivin protein expression. XAF1 overexpression was unable to down-regulate Survivin when XIAP levels were decreased (lane 4). Results are representative of at least four separate experiments. B, protein expression levels of Survivin from A were quantified and plotted as average ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)XAF1 Reverses XIAP-mediated Caspase Inhibition—As shown in Fig. 4 (lane 1 versus 3), the up-regulation of XAF1 appears to promote a reduction of XIAP protein concomitant with Survivin degradation. This is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that Survivin is able to stabilize XIAP (3Dohi T. Okada K. Xia F. Wilford C.E. Samuel T. Welsh K. Marusawa H. Zou H. Armstrong R. Matsuzawa S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34087-34090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and conversely, the loss of Survivin could lead to down-regulation of XIAP. We therefore investigated the potential contribution that this XIAP reduction has on etoposide-induced caspase activation by comparing XIAP with its E3 ligase mutant in the presence of XAF1 and Survivin. We found that irrespective of the E3 ligase status of XIAP, XAF1 was effective in reversing the inhibition of caspase activity (Fig. 5), either in the absence (lanes 4 and 5 versus 6 and 7) or in the presence of Survivin (lanes 9 and 10 versus 11 and 12). These data suggest that Survivin does not play a direct role in caspase-3 suppression. Moreover, forced XAF1 expression, either in complex with wild-type XIAP or E3 ligase mutant XIAP, results in caspase-3 activation.FIGURE 5XAF1 reverses XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition. 293T cells were transfected with combinations of pcDNA3-Survivin, pCI-XAF1, pcDNA3–6myc-XIAP, and pcDNA3–6myc-XIAPH467A for 18 h, at which point 100 μm etoposide was added for an additional 33 h. At the end of etoposide treatment, cells were harvested and prepared for caspase 3-like activity assay. Caspase 3-like activity is expressed as the percent of etoposide-induced activity in the absence of protein expressing plasmids. Numbers represent the average ± S.E. of four independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IFN-mediated Survivin Down-regulation Requires XAF1 Induction—xaf1 is an IFN-stimulated gene in which expression can be induced in certain cell lines (15Leaman D.W.

To determine whether the induction of endogenous XAF1 by IFN-β down-regulates Survivin, we treated A-375, SK-MEL-5, ACHN, OVCAR3, and OV2008 with IFN-β for 24 h. We found that in response to IFN-β, XAF1 protein expression was elevated in A-375, SK-MEL-5, and ACHN but not in OVCAR3 and OV2008 (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with a role for XAF1 in regulating Survivin levels, IFN-β treatment in A-375 and SK-MEL-5 cells, and in ACHN to a lesser extent, the induced XAF1 expression correlated with Survivin down-regulation. Conversely, the lack of XAF1 induction in OVCAR3 and OV2008 correlated with unchanged levels of Survivin protein (Fig. 6, A and B). To investigate the endogenous formation of a complex that contains XIAP, XAF1, and Survivin, we have immunoprecipitated the XIAP-containing complex in the presence or absence of IFN-β. We found that XAF1 and Survivin were parts of the complex only after IFN-β treatment (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6IFN-β-mediated Survivin down-regulation requires XAF1 induction.A, A-375, SK-MEL-5, ACHN, OVCAR3, and OV2008 cells were treated with 0 or 500 units/ml IFN-β for 24 h. B, immunoblots prepared as in A were scanned and quantified, and for each cell line, Survivin protein expression levels after IFN-β treatment were expressed as the percent of basal expression level. C, A-375 cells were treated with 0 or 500 units/ml IFN-β for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell lysates (2 mg) with anti-XIAP antibodies or nonspecific rabbit serum as a control was performed and subsequently analyzed by Western immunoblotting (IB) for XIAP, XAF1, and Survivin. An XIAP-XAF1-Survivin complex is found only in IFN-β-stimulated cells. D, the parental SF-539 and XAF1-/- shRNA stable cell lines (SF-X1, SF-X3) were exposed to 0 or 500 units/ml IFN-β for 24 h. Total protein samples were analyzed by Western immunoblotting for protein expression levels of XAF1, Survivin, XIAP, and β-actin. IFN-β failed to down-regulate Survivin in SF-X1 and SF-X3.

In higher eukaryotes, however, little is known about the distribution, method of deposition, and function of H2A.Z at promoters. Using biochemical studies, we demonstrated previously that SRCAP (SNF-2-related CREB-binding protein activator protein), the human ortholog of Swr1, could catalyze deposition of H2A.Z into nucleosomes. To address whether SRCAP directs H2A.Z deposition in vivo, promoters targeted by SRCAP were identified by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip assay. ChIP assays on a subset of these promoters confirmed the presence of SRCAP on inactive and active promoters. The highest levels of SRCAP were observed on the active SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase promoters. Detailed analyses of these promoters indicate sites of SRCAP binding overlap or occur adjacent to the sites of H2A.Z deposition. Knockdown of SRCAP levels using siRNA resulted in loss of SRCAP at these promoters, decreased deposition of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z, and a decrease in levels of SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase mRNA.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparampil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol.

Chen J.D. Ruh M. Chrivia J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SRCAP may be recruited to nucleosomes containing specific histone modifications. Histone modifications found in promoters of active genes, e.g. triMeH3K4, acetylated H2B, and acetylated H4 have been reported to be enriched in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes purified from chicken and HeLa cells (12Bruce K. Myers F.A. Mantouvalou E. Lefevre P. Greaves I. Bonifer C. Tremethick D.J. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

Biol. 2006; 26: 5325-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The loss of specific histone acetyltransferases GCN5 and Sas3 has also been reported to reduce H2A.Z deposition (5Zhang H. Roberts D.N. Cairns B.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In this study, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to analyze recruitment of SRCAP to promoters in human A549 cells. These studies demonstrate that although SRCAP is recruited to both active and inactive promoters, the highest amounts are present on active promoters. Using the SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase promoters as model systems, we report that the sites of SRCAP recruitment overlap or occur adjacent to the sites of deposition of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z. Knockdown of SRCAP expression results in decreased deposition of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z and decreased levels of SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase mRNA. These studies provide the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that SRCAP mediates in vivo deposition of H2A.Z. Antibodies—Anti-SRCAP affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against SRCAP as described (16Ruhl D.D. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Chrivia J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5671-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Other commercial antibodies were RNA polymerase II 8WG16 monoclonal (Covance Research Products), tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 polyclonal, Histone H2A.Z polyclonal, and Lys-4, Lys-7, and Lys-11 acetylated on histone H2A.Z polyclonal (Abcam) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Cell Culture—The human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC) was cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). ChIP Assay—A modified protocol was developed based on several previous reports (20Lambert J.R. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F.

Chromatin cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde and was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. The cells were harvested with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized 15 times with the tight pestle of a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The nuclei were sonicated at 12 20-s bursts with 1 min of cooling on ice in between each burst (output 5, constant setting, Branson Sonifier 450) to shear chromatin to ∼0.3–1-kb fragments. Samples were diluted 2-fold in sonication buffer and precleared to reduce nonspecific background with protein A/G-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Sonication buffer. The precleared extract was incubated overnight with 5 μg of the antibody at 4 °C. A 50-μl sample was set aside as the input sample. The immune complex was recovered with protein A/G-agarose slurry by 2 h of incubation at 4 °C. The bead complexes were washed twice for 5 min each with the following buffers in succession ordered sequence: low salt wash buffer (sonication buffer), high salt wash buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), LiCl wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Precipitated chromatin complex was eluted from beads through two 1-h incubations at room temperature with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) with vortexing every 10 min. The crosslinking (IP samples and input) was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in the presence of 250 mm NaCl and 25 ng of RNase A. The protein in the samples was digested with 50 ng of proteinase K (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at 42 °C. The DNA was extracted by phenol chloroform (pH 7.49–7.79) (Invitrogen) once and by chloroform (Sigma) once and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended in 50 μl of deionized H2O, and input samples were resuspended in 200 μl deionized H2O. PCR Analysis—The DNA from ChIP assays was analyzed by real-time PCR (DNA Engine Opticon 2 System, Bio-Rad) with 2× FastStart SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Applied Science), 500 nm forward primer, and 500 nm reverse primer that spanned the region of interest. The real-time PCR protocol was: 95 °C for 10 min for activation of FastStart Taq DNA polymerase followed by a three-step amplification (denaturation: 95 °C for 30 s, annealing: 60 °C for 30 s, and extension: 72 °C for 40 s) and a quantification program of 35 cycles. Fold changes in copy number were assessed by comparison with a linear standard curve. Primers sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Gene Expression—Total cellular RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription reactions were done on 4 μgof total RNAs, oligo-dT (Promega), and were carried out by using SuperScript™II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Specific primers for the respective genes were used in the real-time PCR reaction as a measurement of transcriptional activity. Primers sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Knockdown of SRCAP—The Dicer substrate siRNA targeting control and SRCAP used in this study were chemically synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Transfections were carried out with 40 nm by DharmaFECT 1 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol into A549 cells. The cells were harvested 72 h later for protein Western blot analysis for SRCAP as described (16Ruhl D.D. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Chrivia J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5671-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the β-actin was detected using anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). SRCAP Is Present on Both Inactive and Active Promoters—To identify human promoters that recruit SRCAP, the A549 lung carcinoma cell line, which expresses high levels of SRCAP, was used as a model system. 3J. Chrivia, unpublished observation. With these cells an anti-SRCAP antibody developed in our laboratory (16Ruhl D.D. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Chrivia J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5671-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used to perform a ChIP assay to isolate DNA that associates with SRCAP. This DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR and used to screen a human promoter array (data not shown). Several of the promoters identified in this preliminary study were reexamined by standard ChIP assay for the ability to bind SRCAP. Binding of SRCAP to the human β-globin (BG) promoter, which is inactivated during development in non-erythrocyte cells, was also examined. The results of these studies indicate that the highest levels of SRCAP are present on SP-1, FAD synthetase, and G3BP promoters. Intermediate levels of SRCAP were present on the PPM1B (protein phosphatase 1B isoform 2) promoter, and lower but detectable levels of SRCAP were present on the SLAM-7, SLC19A2, C15, TOP2A, JAK1, and BG promoters (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the amount of SRCAP present on individual promoters correlates with transcriptional activity, mRNA levels were measured for each gene (Fig. 1B). Eight of these genes (SP-1, G3BP, SLC19A2, JAK1, PPM1B, C15, TOP2A, and FAD synthetase) were considered active, as indicated by the expression of mRNA. The level of SLAM-7 and BG mRNAs was very low, indicating that these genes are transcriptionally inactive. This conclusion is supported by the results of additional ChIP assays indicating that very low levels of both RNAP II and the histone modification triMeH3K4 are present on the SLAM-7 and BG promoters (data not shown). Collectively, these studies indicate SRCAP is present on both active and inactive promoters. However, higher levels of SRCAP are recruited to a subset of active genes, e.g. SP-1, FAD synthetase, and G3BP. Profiling SRCAP Location within the SP-1 Promoter—The SP-1 promoter was chosen for further characterization because of the presence of high levels of SRCAP and because the location of the transcription start site (TSS) has been characterized in several studies (23Nicolás M. Noé V. Jensen K.B. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22126-22132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Binding sites for SRCAP and RNAP II within the SP-1 gene were identified by ChIP assay using several primer sets that span the promoter and coding regions (Fig. 2A). A peak of SRCAP binding was detected within the upstream promoter region –601 to –270 (Fig. 2A, primer sets –601/–475 and –474/–270). The anti-RNAP II antibody used in these studies detects the total pool of RNAP II including serine 5 phosphorylated RNAP II associated with initiation and serine 2 phosphorylated RNAP II associated with elongation of transcription (25Komarnitsky P. Cho E. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, two peaks were observed for the binding of RNAP II. One peak, consistent with transcriptional initiation, was located in the upstream promoter region –1109 to –750 (Fig. 2A, primer sets –1109/–983 and –859/–750). Previous studies have reported that these regions bind RNAP II and the TAF1 subunit of TFIID (24Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). A second peak occurred within the coding region that is consistent with transcriptional elongation. To rule out the possibility that the decrease in RNAP II levels observed at –601 to –165 was due to loss of specific promoter fragments, following sonication and prior to immunoprecipitation the input DNA was tested by PCR for the presence of intact promoter fragments. The results indicate that DNA within the promoter or coding regions was not degraded at any position by sonication (Fig. 2C). To test whether a similar pattern of SRCAP and RNAP II binding occurred on other genes, the G3BP (Fig. 3) and FAD synthetase (Fig. 4) promoters were analyzed. Within the G3BP promoter, where the predicted binding site for TAF1 (24Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) and the identified RNAP II binding site (similar to the SP-1 promoter) are located a considerable distance (–561) from the TSS, the SRCAP binding site was also located at a distance upstream at –294 (Fig. 3). In contrast, on the FAD synthetase promoter where the predicted TAF1 binding site (24Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) and the identified RNAP II binding sites are located close to the TSS, the SRCAP binding site also occurred close to the TSS (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4SRCAP and RNAP II binding on theFAD synthetasepromoter.A, ChIP assays were performed to determine relative amounts of RNAP II and SRCAP bound at the indicated positions within the FAD synthetase promoter. The amount of DNA present at each position is presented as relative binding level compared with the amount of DNA amplified using primer set –691. B, a schematic of the location of peaks of SRCAP and RNAP II binding and the location of the binding of the TAF1 subunit of TFIID described previously (24Kim T.H. Barrera L.O. Zheng M. Qu C. Singer M.A. Richmond T.A. Wu Y. Green R.D. Ren B. Nature. 2005; 436: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) relative to the TSS. The graph represents the results and the S.E. of three independent ChIP experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SRCAP Is Recruited Adjacent to the Sites of triMeH3K4 Deposition—Nucleosomes containing H2A.Z have been found to be enriched in the histone modification triMeH3K4 (19Viens A. Mechold U. Brouillard F. Gilbert C. Leclerc P. Ogryzko V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5325-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggested that the location of triMeH3K4 might provide a signal for recruitment of SRCAP to the SP-1 promoter. ChIP studies indicated that triMeH3K4 deposition extensively overlapped the upstream RNAP II binding site. It did not, however, overlap substantially with the SRCAP binding site, suggesting that it does not mark specific promoter locations that recruit SRCAP (Fig. 5). The Peak of Acetylated H2A.Z Deposition Occurs Adjacent to the Peak of SRCAP Binding—Recent studies indicate the deposition of acetylated H2A.Z occurs at active promoters (7Millar C.B. Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 12Bruce K. Myers F.A. Mantouvalou E. Lefevre P. Greaves I. Bonifer C. Tremethick D.J. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5633-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Myers F.A. Lefevre P. Mantouvalou E. Bruce K. Lacroix C. Bonifer C. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4025-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This observation led us to ask whether SRCAP mediates deposition of acetylated H2A.Z at the SP-1 promoter. To test this hypothesis, ChIP assays were carried out using an antibody that recognizes acetylated H2A.Z (Fig. 6A). These studies indicated that acetylated H2A.Z levels within the SP-1 promoter are uniform over a wide region, –3457 to –1109, with a slight peak at –1241 and two prominent peaks at –859 and +7 directly adjacent to but not overlapping the peak site of SRCAP binding. Consistent with reports of acetylated H2A.Z distribution on other genes, greatly reduced levels of acetylated H2A.Z were also observed in the coding region of the SP-1 (12Bruce K. Myers F.A. Mantouvalou E. Lefevre P. Greaves I. Bonifer C. Tremethick D.J. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5633-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Myers F.A. Lefevre P. Mantouvalou E. Bruce K. Lacroix C. Bonifer C. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4025-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ChIP experiments were also carried out using antibodies raised against an internal peptide of H2A.Z that recognizes acetylated and non-acetylated H2A.Z. The pattern of total H2A.Z deposition mirrored the pattern observed with one obtained using the antibody against acetylated H2A.Z, except the prominent peaks at –859 and +7 were missing (Fig. 6A). The most plausible explanation for this difference is that acetylated H2A.Z contributes only a small pool of the total H2A.Z deposited at the SP-1 promoter. The pattern of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z deposition at the G3BP and FAD synthetase promoters was also determined. Similar to the SP-1 promoter, within the G3BP promoter the highest amount of acetylated H2A.Z was deposited at sites (G3BP –561 and G3BP +79 in Fig. 6B), which flanked the site with the highest SRCAP binding. The sites of H2A.Z deposition (G3BP –561, –294, and +79 in Fig. 6B) coincided with or flanked the peak site of SRCAP deposition. In contrast to the SP-1 and G3BP promoters, within the FAD synthetase promoter, the sites with the highest levels of H2A. Z and acetylated H2A.Z deposited (FAD –691, –87, and +225 in Fig. 6C) coincided with the sites of SRCAP binding. Knockdown of SRCAP Expression Results in Loss of Acetylated H2A.Z at the SP-1, G3BP, and FAD Synthetase Promoters—To test whether SRCAP plays a role in deposition of acetylated H2A.Z at promoters, SRCAP levels were knocked down using siRNA. Western blot analysis indicated that SRCAP levels in A549 cells transfected with SRCAP siRNA decreased to less than 10% of the level observed in cell transfected with nonspecific control siRNA. In contrast, the SRCAP siRNA did not affect expression of β-actin (Fig. 7A). In further support of the specificity of the SRCAP knockdown, transfection of a second nonspecific control siRNA did not result in a decrease of SRCAP levels (data not shown). In parallel studies, the ability of the SRCAP siRNA to decrease SRCAP levels at the SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase promoters was also assessed by ChIP assays. These studies indicate that an ∼60% decrease in SRCAP levels associated with these promoters occurred following treatment with SRCAP siRNA compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 7B). Treatment with SRCAP siRNA induced within the SP-1 promoter a 60% decrease in H2A.Z deposition at position –1241 and a 60% decrease in acetylated H2A.Z deposition at position –859 (Fig. 8). Deposition of acetylated H2A.Z at the second peak (SP-1 +7) was also reduced by 70% (supplemental sFig. 1). Within the G3BP promoter, treatment with SRCAP siRNA reduced at G3BP –561 deposition of H2A.Z by 80% and deposition of acetylated H2A.Z by 60%. Deposition of acetylated H2A.Z at the second peak (G3BP +79 in Fig. 6B) also was reduced by 60% (supplemental sFig. 1). Within the FAD synthetase promoter, treatment with SRCAP siRNA resulted in a 60% decrease in deposition of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z at FAD –87 (Fig. 8). Knockdown of SRCAP Expression Results in Decreased SP-1, G3BP, and FAD Synthetase mRNA Expression—To determine whether loss of SRCAP recruitment altered transcription, SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase mRNA levels were measured in A549 cells transfected with control and SRCAP siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 9, treatment with SRCAP siRNA resulted in an ∼50% decrease in the level of SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase mRNA compared with cells treated with control siRNA. In contrast, treatment with the SRCAP siRNA did not effect either expression of β-actin protein (Fig. 7A) or β-actin mRNA levels (Fig. 9). Previous studies done in our laboratory using transient transfection approaches indicated that SRCAP plays a role in activation of transcription. Consistent with this role, in a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model, SRCAP co-localized with RNAP II to several sites on polytene chromosomes (26Eissenberg J. Wong M. Chrivia J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the resolution of techniques used in these studies precluded determination of whether SRCAP bound to promoters, coding regions, or other chromosomal sites. To determine whether SRCAP was associated with promoters it was necessary to identify potential target genes. Studies in S. cerevisiae report the presence of H2A.Z on approximately two-thirds of the genes. Despite these results, Swr1 has been detected on only a small number of genes (5Zhang H. Roberts D.N. Cairns B.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), suggesting that in human cells SRCAP might also be present on a small number of promoters. Therefore, rather than examining SRCAP levels on randomly selected genes, ChIP-on-chip analysis was performed to screen the entire genome for promoters targeted by SRCAP. It should be noted that a promoter array was screened, not a whole genome array, and as a consequence, non-promoter regions targeted by SRCAP were not detected. Data from these studies indicate that in A549 cells about 10% of promoters are targeted by SRCAP. From the promoters identified in this study, 10 were reexamined by standard ChIP analysis. This analysis indicates that SRCAP is associated with the promoters of both active and inactive genes. Further, the amount present on individual promoters does not appear to depend strictly on whether a gene is active, because the BG and SLAM-7 genes, which are inactive, have comparable levels of SRCAP as the JAK1 gene, which is active. Interestingly, the highest levels of SRCAP were found on promoters of three active genes (SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase). The presence of highest levels of SRCAP on active promoters might reflect the rapid turnover of nucleosomes observed at a number of other promoters and the specific need to redeposit H2A.Z to maintain optimal promoter architecture for activation of transcription. The SRCAP knockdown experiments indicated a correlation between loss of SRCAP at promoters and loss of deposition of H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z. Although these results do not directly demonstrate that SRCAP mediates deposition of H2A.Z, they indicate a critical role of SRCAP in this process. This is supported by the results of the ChIP assays that indicated the sites for H2A.Z deposition and SRCAP binding substantially overlap within the G3BP and FAD synthetase promoters. Because SRCAP mediates H2A.Z deposition in vitro (16Ruhl D.D. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Chrivia J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5671-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that SRCAP is involved in deposition in vivo, especially given the fact that no other proteins (except orthologs of SRCAP in other species) have been identified with this activity. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the S. cerevisiae ortholog of SRCAP has also been demonstrated to deposit H2A.Z at promoters. In contrast, H2A.Z deposition and the SRCAP binding sites did not substantially overlap in the SP-1 promoter. This result would suggest that at least in some cases SRCAP bound at the promoter is able to interact with adjacent nucleosomes and cause deposition of H2A.Z. Such interactions would be consistent with the documented ability of coactivators and transcription factors to interact with chromatin and general transcription factors at adjacent sites and indeed at sites located several thousand base pairs away. Alternatively, in the case of the SP-1 promoter, deposition of H2A.Z might occur at the SRCAP binding site with other remodeling events leading to dispersion of H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes. SRCAP binding occurs in a relatively small region of the SP-1 promoter, nucleotides –601 to –270. This region is located between the upstream binding site for RNAP II/TAF1 positioned at –834 and the transcription start site. Several mechanisms might be used to direct SRCAP recruitment to this region, including histone modifications and binding of specific transcription factors. Although triMeH3K4 is found at active promoters and enriched in nucleosomes containing H2A.Z (19Viens A. Mechold U. Brouillard F. Gilbert C. Leclerc P. Ogryzko V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5325-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the lack of overlap with the SRCAP binding site within the SP-1 promoter suggests that this modification does not represent a bona fide targeting site for recruitment of SRCAP. Other histone modifications are enriched in nucleosomes containing H2A.Z, including triMeH3K27 and triMeH3K9 (19Viens A. Mechold U. Brouillard F. Gilbert C. Leclerc P. Ogryzko V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5325-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These modifications, however, have been associated with heterochromatin and are unlikely to play a role in targeting SRCAP to active promoters. The finding that recruitment of SRCAP also occurs adjacent to sites of recruitment of RNAP II/TAF1 in the G3BP and FAD synthetase promoters is intriguing. Although speculative, it is possible that components of these different complexes interact and provide a method for co-localization to sites within promoters. Deposition of acetylated H2A.Z was also found to overlap or flank the sites of SRCAP binding. Studies using a SRCAP transgenic Drosophila model indicate that SRCAP recruits the histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein) to chromatin (26Eissenberg J. Wong M. Chrivia J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that deposition and acetylation of H2A.Z occur by a SRCAP CBP complex. Studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that the highest levels of H2A.Z are deposited at inactive promoters. H2A.Z is lost following activation, suggesting a model in which the SWR-C complex is preferentially associated with inactive promoters (3Raisner R.M. Hartley P.D. Menenghini M.D. Bao M.Z. Liu C.L.

An alternative model is that the SWR-C complex is present at active promoters, where it catalyzes deposition of non-acetylated H2A.Z, which becomes acetylated, or that it catalyzes deposition of acetylated H2A.Z. Reports from other laboratories are conflicting in regard to whether H2A.Z is acetylated prior to deposition into chromatin (6Babiarz J.E. Halley J.E. Rine J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Keogh M. Mennella T.A. Sawa C. Berthelet S. Krogan N.J. Wolek A. Podolny V. Carpenter L.R. Greenblatt J.F. Baetz K. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our finding that SRCAP is present at active promoters and that knockdown of SRCAP expression results in loss of deposition of acetylated H2A.Z supports the second model. From our data, however, it is not possible to determine whether non-acetylated H2A.Z is first deposited and then acetylated or whether acetylated H2A.Z is deposited directly. Despite the ability to knock down the total cellular level of SRCAP by 90%, we were unable to decrease SRCAP levels at the SP-1, G3BP, and FAD synthetase promoters greater than 60%, which indicates that the SRCAP complex is stabilized at these promoters. This loss was paralleled by a corresponding 60–80% loss of H2A.Z deposition and a 40–50% decrease in mRNA levels. These findings are consistent with those obtained in S. cerevisiae, in which the loss of H2A.Z or deletion of Swr1 represses transcription (5Zhang H. Roberts D.N. Cairns B.R. Cell. 2005; 123: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the decreased transcription observed results solely from the loss of H2A.Z incorporation or whether the loss of other SRCAP activities is a contributor. This latter possibility is suggested by our studies indicating that SRCAP contains several additional domains capable of activating transcription independent of the histone exchange reaction (17Monroy M.A. Schott N.M.

In summary, previous to this work it was known that in transient transfection assays SRCAP functions to activate transcription (17Monroy M.A. Schott N.M. Cox L. Chen J.D. Ruh M. Chrivia J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Johnston H. Kneer J. Chackalaparampil I. Yaciuk P. Chrivia J. J. Biol.

The current work completes the picture as to how SRCAP may regulate transcription. It demonstrates for the first time that SRCAP is located at endogenous promoters and provides for several genes a detailed map of the location of SRCAP with respect to the RNAP II binding site and the transcription start site. These studies also provide the first evidence that SRCAP regulates transcription of endogenous chromatin bound promoters (this was not demonstrated in previous studies using transient transfection reporter genes). Finally, these studies provide the first link in vivo between SRCAP and deposition of H2A.Z. We are especially grateful to Dr. David Tremethick for providing the H2A.Z antibody for our preliminary studies. Download .pdf (.33 MB) Help with pdf files"

The rate coefficients generally increase as the temperature is lowered. We examined the reasons for this temperature dependence through a combined experimental and theoretical study of the reactions of O( 3 P) atoms with a range of alkenes. The factors that control the rate coefficients were shown to be rather subtle, but excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental results and microcanonical transition state theory calculations based on ab initio representations of the potential energy surfaces describing the interaction between the reactants."

Ribonucleoprotein particles primarily composed of major vault protein (MVP) are highly expressed in cells that encounter xenobiotics. However, a clear biologic function for MVP is not established. We report here that MVP is rapidly recruited to lipid rafts when human lung epithelial cells are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and maximal recruitment is dependent on bacterial binding to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. MVP was also essential for optimal epithelial cell internalization and clearance of P. aeruginosa . These results suggest that MVP makes a substantial contribution to epithelial cell–mediated resistance to infection."

The core protein with leucine-rich repeats, characteristic of the leucine-rich-repeat superfamily, binds collagen fibrils and regulates its structure. In addition, we believe that lumican sequestered in the pericellular matrix interacts with cell surface proteins for specific cellular functions. Here we show that bacterial lipopolysaccharide sensing by the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway and innate immune response is regulated by lumican. Primary cultures of lumican-deficient (Lum-/-) macrophages show impaired innate immune response to lipopolysaccharides with lower induction of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6.

Innate immunity is the earliest evolved and most primitive defense mechanism that a host organism uses to detect and destroy pathogens invading tissues without extensive damage to the host barrier (1Jr. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6061) Google Scholar). Recent studies have led to an understanding of the elaborate host defense mechanisms that are in place at the cell surface (2Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev.

The extracellular domain of these TLRs have leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs found in diverse proteins such as the ancient resistance plant proteins (R proteins), Drosophila Toll proteins (6Nurnberger T. Brunner F. Kemmerling B. Piater L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), and mammalian ribonuclease inhibitor. These LRR motifs bind DNA, RNA, and protein ligands including those derived from invading microorganisms. In the cytoplasm, a family of cytosolic LRR proteins, the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins bind PAMPs and promote innate immune signaling (7Chamaillard Inohara McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Ultimately, these pathways lead to the phosphorylation of IκB kinase, nuclear translocation, and the activation of NF-κB. The NF-κB transcription factor up-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbicidal activities (8Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

Du X. Poltorak A. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 277-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS sensing begins with binding of monomeric LPS to LPS-binding protein in the blood and its transfer to CD14 (11Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). A secreted serum protein, CD14, is linked to the cell membrane of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. CD14 binds and transfers LPS molecules to the TLR4 transmembrane signaling complex at the cell surface (12Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Dedrick R.L. Nat.

Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The LPS recognition complex also requires soluble MD-2 protein, heat shock proteins, and additional factors that remain to be identified (2Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).LPS recognition by the host triggers the biosynthesis of a variety of inflammation mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and other co-stimulatory molecules (15Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3282) Google Scholar). TNFα is the cytokine prototype often used to assess host innate immune response. Produced locally, these innate immune response mediators help to clear infections. However, unrestricted systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteins can lead to severe sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. Host response to infection and bacterial endotoxins is being investigated at multiple levels to define events that lead to sepsis and septic shock. Understanding the molecular events from pathogen recognition to inflammation mediators is becoming important in the treatment of sepsis and in identifying patients at risk. For example, polymorphisms in genes encoding heat shock proteins, TNFα and IL-1 receptor antagonist, mediators of pathogen recognition and inflammation, have been linked to genetic predisposition to sepsis (16Waterer G.W.

Our study of an ECM protein lumican introduces a new modulator of host response to inflammation and sepsis.Lumican is one of 12 or more related proteoglycans of the LRR protein superfamily (19Hocking A.M.

Proteins. 2000; 38: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Lumican is expressed in a variety of stromal mesenchymal ECM of barrier tissues, such as the skin, cornea, and intestine (22Chakravarti S. Glycoconj.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We have previously investigated a structural role for lumican in binding collagen fibrils and regulating their lateral growth (24Ezura Y. Chakravarti S. Oldberg A. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. J.

The lumican-null mice (Lumtm1/chak, referred to as Lum-/- here) have structurally abnormal collagen fibrils in the cornea, skin, and tendon and consequent functional defects such as corneal opacity and skin and tendon fragility (23Chakravarti S.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3365-3373PubMed Google Scholar). In a keratitis model we showed that IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα was not induced optimally in the injured cornea of Lum-/- mice. Furthermore, healing of corneal wounds was delayed compared with wild type controls. That study pointed to a functional impairment in innate immune inflammatory processes in the Lum-/- mice (28Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that lumican has a specific role in innate immune response, aiding host sensitivity to LPS. Mice deficient in lumican are resistant to LPS-mediated septic shock and death and impaired in their ability to induce TNFα, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines upon exposure to LPS. Consequently, this study uncovers a novel role for lumican, an ECM protein, in pathogen recognition and innate immune response, the host's first line of defense against invading microorganisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsUltra pure Escherichia coli (0111:B4) LPS was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Salmonella typhimurium LPS, Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PGN), N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine hydrate (MDP), and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt (poly I:C) were purchased from Sigma. The phosphorothioate CpG-DNA, ODN1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT) and recombinant mouse TNF-α were from Operon and BIOSOURCE, respectively. Recombinant lumican (rLum) was prepared using a human lumican cDNA insert in pSecTag2 vector in HEK-293 cells (28Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Mouse Husbandry and Experimental TreatmentLumican-null mice (Lumtm1/chak or Lum-/-) were generated earlier by targeted gene disruption in 129Sv/J embryonic stem cells, and a 129Sv/J male chimera was crossed directly with a CD1 female to transfer the lumican null mutation into the CD1 strain as described earlier (23Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The null mutation was maintained in the CD1 strain for several years (>50 generations). All experiments investigating the effects of the null mutation were performed using gender-matched Lum+/+ (or Lum+/-) and Lum-/- littermates generated by intercrossing heterozygous animals unless stated otherwise. The Lum-/- CD1 strain was also crossed to C57BL/6J, and heterozygous progeny were backcrossed to the parental strain for 12 generations over the last two years for additional analysis of the Lum-/- phenotype in the C57BL/6J background. All animals were housed in the Johns Hopkins University specific pathogen-free mouse facility under conditions that were approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Three different LPS doses were tested (16.7, 20, and 26 μg/g bodyweight), and the lowest dose was selected because it was sufficient to induce septic shock in wild type mice. LPS from S. typhimurium or E. coli 0111:B4 in saline or saline alone as control was administered as intraperitoneal injections. The mice were weighed daily for up to 5 days. For the cytokine analyses, the serum was harvested 32 h after treatment and stored at -20 °C until use.HistologyTissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (6 μm thick) for conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining.Cell Culture TechniquesPrimary Cultures—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from E14 embryos (29Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to attach for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then transferred to DMEM F-12 plus 1% FBS. All MEF cultures were used between passages 2 and 6. To culture primary macrophages, a solution of 4% thioglycollate was injected into the peritoneal cavity (1 ml/mouse) of 6–8-week-old male mice, and the peritoneal lavage was harvested 4 days later. Cells were plated in RPMI 1640 medium and 1% fetal bovine serum at an initial density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well for 24-well plates or 5 × 104 cells/well for 96-well plates. After 24 h non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were treated with specific PAMPs in fresh medium.Cell Lines—HEK-293 cells (Invitrogen), 293-rLum (stable transfectants expressing recombinant lumican, rLum), and HEK-293 expressing TLR4, MD2, and CD14 (293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14, InviroGen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% of 100× antibiotic antimycotic (Sigma).Cytokine MeasurementsSelected cytokines were measured by standard sandwich enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the serum or cell culture medium. Solid phase sandwich mouse ELISA kits for TNFα and IL-6, with 3 pg/ml sensitivity, were obtained from BioSource International, Inc. Total protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad), or final density of plated cells was measured using Aqueous One solution (Promega). We used a bead-based assay for profiling multiple cytokines from a single sample (30Lash G.E. Scaife P.J. Innes B.A. Otun H.A. Robson S.C. Searle R.F. Bulmer J.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 2006; 309: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Beadlyte® Mouse Multi-Cytokine Flex Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used for profiling of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNFα, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor from the serum. We acquired 100 assay points per cytokine for each sample using the Luminex® 100 IS System. Results are presented as median fluorescence intensity. Recombinant cytokines were used as standard controls.Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from peritoneal macrophages and MEFs. The expression of lumican and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh, an internal reference gene) was determined by qRT-PCR using iQ™SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). The threshold cycle difference, ΔCτ, was defined as CτGapdh - CτLum, and relative expression was defined as 2ΔCτ. The following primers were used: for Lum, 5′-TCGAGCTTGATCTCTCCTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGTCCCAGGATCTTACAGAA-3′ (reverse); for Gapdh, 5′-TTGTCTCCTGCGACTTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATT-3′ (reverse).Binding of rLum to Lum-/- MacrophagesPeritoneal macrophages (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with rLum (20 μg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (as a control) at room temperature for 1 h, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 mm 3,3′-dithiobis sulfosuccinimidyl propionate at room temperature for 2 h. The presence of rLum in the cell extract (M-Per lysis buffer, Pierce) was quantified by ELISA. Macrophage extracts of rLum-treated and appropriate control cells were added to wells precoated with a goat polyclonal anti-lumican antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and washed, and the presence of rLum was detected using a rabbit polyclonal against rLum (29Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (R&D Systems) was used as the secondary antibody to determine the amount of rLum retained in wells as previously described (28Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).LPS Binding AssayCorning Costar 96-well plates (polystyrene, with black walls, Fisher) were coated with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml rLum in 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 2.5 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween, rLum-coated and uncoated wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. FITC-labeled E. coli LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.0625–1 μg/ml in Hanks' balance salt solution (100 μl/well) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by 3 washes. Fluorescence was measured by a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with 485 nm for excitation and 525 nm for emission wavelengths. Experiments were replicated twice, and results are shown as relative fluorescence units normalized to a set of reference wells.Lumican-CD14 InteractionsConditioned medium from 293-rLum and 293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14 were used in ex vivo pulldown assays to determine binding between rLum and the LPS receptor complex. The 293-rLum and 293-hTLR4/MD2-CD14 cells were co-cultured (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) for 24 h. Individual cell types were grown separately as controls. The medium was harvested and incubated with Probond™ nickel-resin (Invitrogen) equilibrated under native conditions with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4 °C to allow for specific binding of rLum to the resin. The resin was washed with native wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl). Resin-bound proteins were eluted using increasing concentrations of imidazole, pH 6.0 (50–250 mm). Eluted samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-lumican (29Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), anti-TLR4, anti-CD14 (Abcam) primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and the ECL (Pierce) detection kit.ImmunoprecipitationElicited primary macrophages were harvested from the peritoneal lavage of wild type mice, and total protein was extracted using the M-PER extraction kit (Pierce). A preparation of protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was used for immunoprecipitating lumican using rabbit anti-lumican or goat anti-lumican as described previously (28Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a positive control, CD14 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-CD 14 antibody (ab25090, Abcam) and with a rabbit pre-immune serum as a negative control. The immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and CD14 was detected by immunoblotting (BAF982, R&D Systems).Statistical MethodsTo assess the significance of the differences between two groups we used unpaired, 2-tailed Student's t test with the assumptions of equal variance. We considered a p value ≤ 0.05 as statistically significant. A log rank test (Graphpad Prism software) was used to compare survival differences in Lum+/+ and Lum-/- mice after LPS treatment.RESULTSLum-/-Mice Are Hypo-responsive to Bacterial LPS—To investigate the effects of lumican deficiency on innate immune functions, we tested the response of Lum-/- mice to LPS-induced septic shock. After testing three different doses, we selected a dose of 16.7 μg/g of body weight LPS since it was sufficient to induce septic shock and death in Lum+/+ mice. Seven-week-old Lum-/- and Lum+/+ littermates were given a single intraperitoneal injection of E. coli or S. typhimurium LPS. Within 24–36 h, Lum+/+ appeared visibly sick, showing piloerection, hunching, closed eyes, and lethargy. On the other hand, Lum-/- mice appeared healthy with little sign of distress (data not shown). Approximately 50–70% of Lum+/+ mice died 3 days after E. coli or S. typhimurium LPS injection (Fig. 1A). In contrast, only 10–25% of Lum-/- mice died at day 3, showing overall higher survival. A log rank test indicated that the survival trend between Lum-/- and Lum+/+ mice treated with E. coli or S. typhimurium LPS was significantly different (p = 0.039). E. coli LPS in general caused higher lethality in both Lum+/+ and Lum-/- mice. None of the saline-injected control mice died during the study (not shown).Mice were harvested at 32 h after LPS to assess immune response. This time point was selected since significant numbers of animals in the wild type group died after this point, and most pro-inflammatory genes would be induced by this point. Histology of the spleen from Lum+/+ mice challenged with LPS (E. coli) revealed florid follicular hyperplasia with germinal centers, tingible body macrophages, and a predominance of immunoblasts and plasmacytoid cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, histology of LPS-challenged Lum-/- mouse spleen showed minimally reactive follicles, lacking germinal centers or other histological features typically associated with an immune response. To further investigate if reduced mortality in Lum-/- mice was due to a subdued inflammatory response, a multiplex cytokine analysis was performed using serum harvested from mice 32 h after the LPS challenge. The results revealed poor induction of TNF-α, interferon-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-10 in Lum-/- mice (Fig. 2). The induction of TNFα in the serum was further confirmed by independent ELISA tests (data not shown).FIGURE 2Lower inductions of cytokines in the serum of Lum-/- compared with Lum+/+ mice after a systemic challenge of LPS. Cytokines were measured by multiplex cytokine analysis in age- and gender-matched mice (n = 4 per treatment) 32 h after a single injection of S. typhimurium (LPS-S) or E. coli LPS (LPS-E). The Lum-/- mice show poor induction of TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-10 in response to LPS-S or LPS-E. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Groups were considered statistically different when p ≤ 0.05 (2-tailed equal variance Student's t test), *, p ≤ 0.05; #, p ≤ 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LPS-induced Innate Immune Functions Are Impaired in Lum-/-Macrophages—Macrophages play a major role in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in host innate immune response. To determine whether the increased survival of the Lum-/- mice in response to systemic LPS exposure was due to impaired macrophage functions, peritoneal macrophages were exposed to E. coli LPS, and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-6 (Fig. 3), was measured by ELISA. The LPS dose-dependent increase in TNFα was significantly lower in Lum-/- macrophages compared with wild type macrophages (Fig. 3A). The temporal induction of TNFα and IL-6 was further measured; TNFα was induced within 1 h and continued to increase after 4 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 3B). IL-6 increased 4 h after LPS treatment in Lum+/+ macrophages (Fig. 3C). The timing of TNFα and IL-6 induction in the Lum-/- cells was similar to Lum+/+. However, the extent of induction at the later time points in particular was significantly lower in the Lum-/- cells.FIGURE 3Innate immune response to LPS is impaired in Lum-/- peritoneal macrophages.A, peritoneal lavage macrophages from Lum+/+ and Lum-/- CD-1 mice cultured for 24 h were treated with E. coli LPS at the doses indicated followed by measurements of TNFα in the medium by ELISA. Mean ± S.E. of two cell culture well measurements is shown. Lum-/- macrophages show significantly lower TNFα induction by LPS as compared with Lum+/+ macrophages. B, TNFα induction was measured over time after treating macrophages with 10 ng/ml of E. coli LPS. Compared with their wild type counterparts, Lum-/- macrophages showed lower induction of TNFα (mean ± S.E., n = 3). C, IL-6 was measured (mean ± S.E., n = 3) by ELISA from the medium of macrophages treated with 10 ng/ml of LPS. Compared with Lum+/+ macrophages, Lum-/- cells produced significantly lower amount of IL-6 at 4 h. D, induction of TNFα by LPS was measured in peritoneal macrophages from the C57BL/6J strain. TNFα (mean ± S.E., n = 3) was lower in Lum-/- than Lum+/+ macrophages at each LPS dose tested. E, exogenous recombinant lumican (rLum) partially rescued LPS-mediated TNFα induction in Lum-/- C57BL/6J macrophages (mean ± S.E., n = 3). The addition of rLum increased LPS-mediated TNFα induction in Lum-/- macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Higher rLum doses inhibited LPS-mediated TNFα induction in Lum+/- (lumican-positive control) macrophages possibly by competing with endogenous lumican. There was no induction of TNFα by rLum alone (not treated with LPS). *, p ≤ 0.05 (2-tailed Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further tested innate immune functions of Lum-/- mice bred into a second genetic background, C57BL/6J. Macrophages from Lum-/- C57BL/6J also showed significantly lower induction (p < 0.05) of TNFα in response to E. coli LPS (Fig. 3D).Because lumican deficiency reduced response to LPS, we questioned if exogenous lumican would restore LPS sensitivity to Lum-/- macrophages. We tested our hypothesis by measuring LPS-mediated TNFα induction in macrophages isolated from lumican-deficient (Lum-/-) and lumican-expressing (Lum+/-) C57BL/6J mice. The addition of exogenous recombinant lumican core protein (rLum) showed a consistent increase in TNFα induction in Lum-/- macrophages (Fig. 3E). However, in Lum+/- macrophages, excess rLum (2–4 μg) had an inhibitory effect on TNFα induction by LPS. This could be due to a competition between endogenous lumican and exogenous rLum for LPS. Rescue experiments with macrophages isolated from Lum-/- and Lum+/+ mice of the CD-1 strain yielded similar results (data not shown). The rLum protein alone did not"

We show that, following global exposure to glutamate, mitochondrial changes are spatially and temporally coincident with dendritic bead formation. During oxygen-glucose deprivation, mitochondrial depolarization precedes mitochondrial collapse, which in turn is followed by dendritic beading. These events travel as a wave of activity from distal dendrites toward the neuronal cell body. Despite the spatiotemporal relationship between dysfunctional mitochondria and dendritic beads, mitochondrial depolarization and cytoplasmic ATP depletion do not trigger these events. However, mitochondrial dysfunction increases neuronal vulnerability to these morphological changes during normal physiological activity. Our findings support a mechanism whereby, during glutamate excitotoxicity, Ca2+ influx leads to mitochondrial depolarization, whereas Na+ influx leads to an unsustainable increase in ATP demand (Na+,K+-ATPase activity). This leads to a drop in ATP levels, an accumulation of intracellular Na+ ions, and the subsequent influx of water, leading to microtubule depolymerization, mitochondrial collapse, and dendritic beading. Following the removal of a glutamate challenge, dendritic recovery is dependent upon the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential, but not on a resumption of ATP synthesis or Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Thus, dendritic recovery is not a passive reversal of the events that induce dendritic beading. These findings suggest that the degree of calcium influx and mitochondrial depolarization inflicted by a neurotoxic challenge, determines the ability of the neuron to recover its normal morphology.

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles with their trafficking and elongated morphology being regulated by neuronal (11Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li Z. Okamoto K. Hayashi Y. Sheng M.

Neurochem. 2006; 97: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) activity. It appears that mitochondrial transport, morphology, and function are affected by physiological processes such as synaptic transmission and pathological processes such as excitotoxicity.Despite the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction and dendritic beading are both initiated by glutamate excitotoxicity, these events are believed to be independent due to their distinct requirements for Ca2+ (1Tymianski M.

Moreover, dendritic beading occurs much more rapidly than Ca2+-dependent excitotoxic cell death (2Hasbani M.J. Hyrc K.L. Faddis B.T. Romano C. Goldberg M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 154: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3Swann J.W. Al-Noori S. Jiang M. Lee C.L. Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Although Ca2+-induced excitotoxicty and Na+-induced dendritic beading appear to be distinct, both processes are activated simultaneously by excitotoxic stimuli. Indeed, NMDA receptors are permeable to both ions and are implicated in both processes (5Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Ward M.W. Kushnareva Y. Greenwood S. Connolly C.N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), yet the spatial and temporal relationship between these events have not been examined.The role of mitochondria in excitotoxicity is well established (15Nicholls D.G. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), but how they relate to dendritic beading is unknown. Interestingly, previous studies have observed the existence of “hollow” beads that were devoid of cytosol (4Ikegaya Y. Kim J.A. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4083-4093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Al-Noori S. Swann J.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Oliva Jr., A.A. Lam T.T. Swann J.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8052-8062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the existence of “membraneous structures” within some beads has been observed in situ. These inclusions were attributed to the presence of autophagic vesicles or secondary lysosomes (7Hall G.F. Chu B. Lee G. Yao J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial changes in morphology have been reported to occur following exposure to glutamate (11Rintoul G.L. Filiano A.J. Brocard J.B. Kress G.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7881-7888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the structures observed within beads might, in fact, be dysfunctional mitochondria, with altered morphology.To investigate the temporal and spatial regulation, and ionic dependence, of these events, we performed time-lapse microscopy on hippocampal neurons during an excitotoxic challenge. Using this approach, we have monitored changes in mitochondrial morphology and function, and correlated this to the formation of dendritic beads. We find that these responses are related temporally and spatially, with the majority of beads containing a dysfunctional mitochondrion. Furthermore, the morphological recovery of neurons appears to depend on the degree of mitochondrial damage during the insult. However, mitochondrial changes appear to be secondary to a perturbation in neuronal microtubules as a result of cytoplasmic water influx.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—pECFP-C1 and pDsRed2-Mito vectors were purchased from Clontech (BD Biosciences).

Hippocampi from 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were dissected and cut into small pieces with a scalpel. Tissue was suspended in 5 ml of filter-sterilized buffer comprising (mm) 116 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 0.5 EDTA, and 25 d(+)-glucose (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml papain and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Tissue was then transferred to 2 ml of fresh buffer (supplemented with 10 mg/ml ovomucoid and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and triturated with a series of flame-polished glass Pasteur pipettes of decreasing tip diameter. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 2 min and the pellet resuspended in culture medium consisting of Neurobasal-A Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% (v/v) B-27 (Invitrogen) and 2 mm l-glutamine at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were plated at a density of 3.8 × 104 cells/cm2 onto sterilized coverslips or 8.3 × 104 cells/cm2 onto white 96-well plates pretreated with poly-d-lysine (15 μg/ml in borate buffer; pH 8). Cultures were incubated in culture medium and maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 5 days, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (final concentration 10 μm) was added to inhibit glial cell proliferation. Experiments were performed after 9–13 days (no differences due to age were observed) in vitro at room temperature in HEPES-buffered saline comprising (mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 d(+)-glucose (pH 7.4), supplemented with 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin. For ion replacement solutions, NaCl or CaCl2 were replaced with equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine or MnCl2, respectively. Hypertonic buffer was achieved by the addition of 200 mm sucrose. A rapid shift into hypotonic buffer was achieved by a 2-fold dilution of HEPES-buffered saline into HEPES buffer lacking NaCl, to achieve a 67 mm final concentration of NaCl.Neuronal Transfection—Hippocampal cultures were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitate technique as previously described (18Jiang M. Deng L. Chen G. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA/Ca2+-phosphate precipitate was prepared by diluting (per coverslip) 2 μl of 1 mg/ml plasmid DNA in 20.5 μl of filter-sterilized TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) followed by addition of 2.5 μl of filter-sterilized HEPES-buffered CaCl2 (2.5 m CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The resulting solution was added dropwise to 25 μl of filter-sterilized 2× HEPES-buffered saline (273.8 mm NaCl, 9.9 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 42.0 mm HEPES, 11.1 mm d(+)-glucose, pH 7.2) and vortexed (3 s). The precipitate solution was incubated in the dark at room temperature and briefly vortexed every 2 min for a total of 30 min. The resulting precipitate was dispersed over a neuron-seeded coverslip in one well of a 24-well cell culture plate containing 250 μl of culture medium supplemented with 2 mm kynurenic acid. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h to allow for settling and endocytosis of the precipitate. Treated coverslips were then washed in 1 ml of acidic wash medium (culture medium equilibrated to 10% CO2 and supplemented with 2 mm kynurenic acid) for 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before being returned to the original culture medium. Cells grown in 96-well plates were transfected as above using one-fourth of the stated volumes per well. Experiments were performed 24–48 h post-transfection.Epifluorescent Microscopy—Cultures cotransfected with pECFP-C1 and pDsRed2-Mito were loaded with rhodamine 123 (1 μg/ml in HEPES-buffered saline) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Quantification of mitochondrial polarization was achieved using ratiometric JC-1 imaging (1 μg/ml, 15 min at 37 °C in the dark). Cells were subsequently washed, sealed into a non-perfusion chamber, and imaged using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and a 40× PL Fluotar or 100× PL APO objective lens on a Leica DM-IRB inverted microscope using OpenLab 5.0.1 software (Improvision, UK). Images were collected as follows: CFP (excitation 430 ± 25, emission 470 ± 30), DsRed (excitation 527 ± 23, emission 630 ± 60), rhodamine 123 (excitation 500 ± 20, emission 535 ± 30), and JC-1 (excitation 492 ± 18, emission 630 ± 60 [polarized]/535 ± 30 [depolarized]) presented as excitation 630/emission 535 multiplied by 100. For quantitative analysis, areas of interest containing dendritic beads or mitochondria were selected and the skeletal length/diameter and/or fluorescence intensities measured for each time point using Volocity 3.7 software (Improvision, UK). Values were normalized to a starting value of 100 and mean ± S.E. values calculated accordingly.Cytoskeletal Detection—Neurons were fixed (3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 15 min) and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 10 min). Actin staining was achieved using Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma, 50 μg/ml). MAP2 distribution was probed using 2 μg/ml monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibodies (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, 1 μg/ml).In Situ ATP Assay—Cultures transfected with PcDNA3lucLL/V were incubated in HEPES-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm d-luciferin plus appropriate drugs where necessary. Bioluminescence was monitored using a LB96V microplate luminometer using WinGlow software (Berthold Technologies). Luminescence values were normalized to a starting value of 100 and the mean ± S.E. values of the percentage difference from vehicle control calculated accordingly.Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation—Cultures cotransfected with pECFP-C1 and pDsRed2-Mito were loaded with rhodamine 123 and imaged as detailed above. Cells were sealed into a non-perfusion chamber and incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid comprising (mm) 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d(+)-glucose, supplemented with 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin and bubbled with 95:5% O2:CO2. Oxygen-glucose deprivation was achieved by replacing standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid with an identical artificial cerebrospinal fluid in which d(+)-glucose was replaced with equimolar sucrose and bubbled with 95:5% N2:CO2. All oxygen-glucose deprivation experiments were carried out at 37 °C.RESULTSMitochondrial Dysfunction and Neuritic Beading Occur Synchronously and Exhibit Spatial Overlap in Response to Glutamate Excitotoxicity—To examine changes in mitochondrial morphology and depolarization, simultaneously with dendritic structural changes, hippocampal neurons were transfected with mitochondrically targeted DsRed and cytoplasmic CFP. Mitochondrial depolarization was monitored using rhodamine 123. Tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) was included in all experiments to avoid secondary glutamate release following the generation of action potentials.During an excitotoxic challenge with glutamate (100 μm) and glycine (10 μm)(G/G), four events occur simultaneously; 1) mitochondria depolarize immediately (as evidenced by a transient increase in rhodamine 123 fluorescence) (Fig. 1). 2) Mitochondrial morphology collapses. Dynamically, this appears as if mitochondria are stretched out on an elastic support that was severed at several points simultaneously. Thus, mitochondria appear to collapse into short, rounded structures with a reduced length and an increased girth. 3) Beads form along dendrites as focal swellings with reduced volume present between beads (supplemental materials Movie 1). To analyze the temporal sequence of events, quantitative measurements for each parameter were determined using Volocity (Improvision) software. From this analysis, it can be seen that mitochondrial collapse (monitored as reduced length), mitochondrial depolarization, and dendritic beading (monitored as increased width) are initiated immediately and simultaneously (Fig. 1B). Within the window of time used (6 s between image collection), all dendritic mitochondria appeared to depolarize simultaneously, suggesting that differential rates of mitochondrial dysfunction do not determine the site of beading. 4) Dendritic beading has been proposed to correlate with a drop in cytoplasmic [ATP] (5Takeuchi H.

Brain Res. 2004; 1030: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using a cytoplasmic luciferase reporter construct (17Manfredi G. Yang L. Gajewski C.D. Mattiazzi M. Methods. 2002; 26: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to monitor cytoplasmic [ATP], we observed a rapid depletion of ATP within the time scale (15 min) of dendritic beading (Fig. 1C)(n > 50).G/G induced beading and mitochondrial dysfunction are blocked by antagonists of glutamate receptors (10 μm MK801 plus 20 μm CNQX). Furthermore, G/G treatment in the presence of either MK801 or CNQX, or glutamate receptor activation by either NMDA/glycine (100 μm/10 μm), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (100 μm), or kynurenic acid (100 μm), revealed that all the ionotropic glutamate receptors are capable of inducing dendritic bead formation in hippocampal neurons (supplementary materials Fig. 1).An apparent overlap of dysfunctional (depolarized and morphologically collapsed) mitochondria and dendritic beads is evident (Fig. 1A and supplemental Movie 1). However, dysfunctional mitochondria are not exclusively localized to beads, so it is likely that some mitochondria may associate with beads by chance. To determine the existence of mitochondria within beads as predicted by chance, we estimated the average mitochondrial density to be 0.082 ± 0.003 (mean ± S.E.: 82 dendrites, 6 neurons) mitochondria/μm of dendrite and the average bead length to be 4.42 ± 0.08 μm (mean ± S.E.: 541 beads, 10 neurons). Thus, 36.3 ± 1.3% of beads would be expected to contain a dysfunctional mitochondrion by chance. Quantification of the observed overlap reveals that 92.3 ± 1.1% (mean ± S.E.: 572 beads, 13 neurons) of dendritic beads are associated with dysfunctional mitochondrion. This is likely to be an underestimate, as unlabeled, or out of focus mitochondria are not included in the analysis. Thus, dysfunctional mitochondria appear to be preferentially associated with sites of dendritic beading following G/G treatment.Sequence of Events during Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation—Glutamate has been shown to mediate neuronal injury during ischemia. Using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) as an in vitro model for ischemia, glutamate release (20Fujimoto S. Katsuki H. Kume T. Kaneko S. Akaike A. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 50: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), mitochondrial depolarization, ATP depletion (21Almeida A. Delgado-Esteban M. Bolanos J.P. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and dendritic beading (22Zhang S. Boyd J. Delaney K. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5333-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have been observed. OGD is able to trigger neuronal injury by localized synaptic NMDA receptor activation (23Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 22-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hasbani M.J. Schlief M.L. Fisher D.A. Goldberg M.P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether these events exhibited the same spatial and temporal relationship during OGD, as observed during global G/G treatment. To avoid secondary effects due to the generation of action potentials, 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin was included.As expected, mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial collapse, and dendritic beading occurred in response to OGD (Fig. 2; supplemental Movie 2). Again, almost all beads (91.1 ± 1.8% (mean ± S.E.: 256 beads, 8 neurons) contained a dysfunctional (depolarized and collapsed) mitochondrion. Although the spatial correlation between mitochondrial collapse and beading during OGD is identical to that of G/G treatment, the temporal profile was different. The time required for the initiation of these events varied between experiments from ∼30 min to 6 h of OGD (n = 10). This most likely represents the time required for individual neuronal responses to be induced rather than experimental deviation. This is evident in the variability of individual neurons to undergo mitochondrial depolarization within an individual experiment (rhodamine 123 labeling, supplemental Movie 2). However, once initiated, the events followed a similar temporal order with mitochondrial depolarization (set at t = 0) preceding mitochondrial collapse and the initiation of beading (t = 7–26 and 61–74 min, respectively).FIGURE 2Temporal profile of dendritic changes during oxygen-glucose deprivation. Hippocampal neurons (DIV 10–14) were transfected with cDNAs encoding Mito-DsRed and CFP. Neurons were pre-loaded with rhodamine 123 and transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (+0.5 μm tetrodotoxin). Prior to treatment (left panel) neurons exhibit no dendritic beading. Following OGD dendritic beading is evident (right panel). The time course for mitochondrial depolarization (filled circles), mitochondrial collapse (filled triangles), and dendritic beading (filled squares) is depicted as a function of distance from the cell soma (y axis) and time (x axis). For further information, see supplementary Movie 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Particularly striking is the observation that mitochondrial depolarization, within an individual neuron, occurs sequentially, and rapidly, traveling from distal dendrites toward the cell body (Fig. 2, supplemental Movie 2). Similarly, both mitochondrial collapse and dendritic beading occur sequentially from distal dendrites toward the cell body. To illustrate this, an analysis of these events from a single neuron at individual beading sites relative to the distance from the cell body reveals both the temporal relationship between mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial collapse, and dendritic beading (Fig. 2) and illustrates how these events migrate toward the cell body (n > 5).Role of Mitochondrial Depolarization and ATP Depletion in Dendritic Beading—Given the localization of dysfunctional mitochondria to sites of dendritic beads, combined with the observation that mitochondrial depolarization precedes the other events during OGD, we postulated that mitochondrial depolarization might be responsible for bead formation. To address this, mitochondria were depolarized by the addition of a protonophore (FCCP, 1 μm). To avoid any unforeseen secondary effect due to glutamate receptor activation, glutamate receptor antagonists (10 μm MK801, 20 μm CNQX) and tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) were included in these experiments. Given the putative relationship between [ATP] and dendritic beading (5Takeuchi H. Mizuno T. Zhang G. Wang J. Kawanokuchi J. Kuno R. Suzumura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10444-10454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Ikegami K. Kato S. Koike T. Brain Res. 2004; 1030: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C), we investigated whether beading would occur following mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent ATP depletion. In neurons treated with FCCP, mitochondria depolarized as expected (not shown), but no mitochondrial collapse or dendritic beading was observed (Fig. 3A), despite the rapid drop in cytoplasmic [ATP] (Fig. 3B). Thus, neither mitochondrial depolarization, nor a drop in intracellular [ATP], is sufficient to induce dendritic beading.FIGURE 3Effect of mitochondrial depolarization on dendritic beading. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with either cDNAs encoding Mito-DsRed (MR) and CFP (A) or luciferase constructs (B). Mitochondria were depolarized using 1 μm FCCP in the presence of 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin and the glutamate receptor antagonists, 10 μm MK801, and 20 μm CNQX. Scale bar = 30 μm. B, cytoplasmic ATP levels were determined using cytoplasmic luciferase. Values were obtained (in triplicate) from ∼25,000 cells and represent percentage change (mean ± S.E.) from control (vehicle) conditions (n > 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, when mitochondria depolarize in response to G/G, this occurs in the presence of significant sodium and calcium influx. Therefore, we investigated whether both events (mitochondrial depolarization and ion influx) were required to induce dendritic beading. Ion influx was initiated by plasma membrane depolarization using 50 mm KCl and mitochondrial depolarization was induced by oligomycin/FCCP treatment. Oligomycin was included to prevent ATP consumption by mitochondria. Secondary effects due to glutamate release were prevented by the inclusion of tetrodotoxin, MK801, and CNQX. As expected, neither treatment alone induced dendritic beading. However, when combined, extensive dendritic beading is evident (Fig. 4) (n > 5). Thus, dendritic beading may be induced by a combination of mitochondrial depolarization (or the subsequent failure of ATP synthesis) and ion (sodium and/or calcium) influx. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction renders neurons vulnerable to normally innocuous ionic challenges.FIGURE 4Mitochondrial depolarization increases neuronal vulnerability to intracellular ion influx. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with cDNA encoding CFP. Neurons were treated (30 min) with KCl (50 mm), oligomycin/FCCP (1 μg/ml and 1 μm, respectively), or a combination of KCl and oligomycin/FCCP, as indicated, and imaged to detect dendritic bead formation.

https://openalex.org/W2038663652,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that hydrolyzes amyloid-β (Aβ) and insulin, which are peptides associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and diabetes, respectively. Our previous structural analysis of substrate-bound human 113-kDa IDE reveals that the N- and C-terminal domains of IDE, IDE-N and IDE-C, make substantial contact to form an enclosed catalytic chamber to entrap its substrates. Furthermore, IDE undergoes a switch between the closed and open conformations for catalysis. Here we report a substrate-free IDE structure in its closed conformation, revealing the molecular details of the active conformation of the catalytic site of IDE and new insights as to how the closed conformation of IDE may be kept in its resting, inactive conformation. We also show that Aβ is degraded more efficiently by IDE carrying destabilizing mutations at the interface of IDE-N and IDE-C (D426C and K899C), resulting in an increase in Vmax with only minimal changes to Km. Because ATP is known to activate the ability of IDE to degrade short peptides, we investigated the interaction between ATP and activating mutations. We found that these mutations rendered IDE less sensitive to ATP activation, suggesting that ATP might facilitate the transition from the closed state to the open conformation. Consistent with this notion, we found that ATP induced an increase in hydrodynamic radius, a shift in electrophoretic mobility, and changes in secondary structure. Together, our results highlight the importance of the closed conformation for regulating the activity of IDE and provide new molecular details that will facilitate the development of activators and inhibitors of IDE."

This pattern of anisotropy is inconsistent with simple models of corner flow in the mantle wedge. Although several models, including slab rollback, oblique subduction, and deformation of water-rich olivine, have been proposed to explain trench-parallel anisotropy, none of these mechanisms are consistent with all observations. Instead, small-scale convection driven by the foundering of dense arc lower crust provides an explanation for the trench-parallel anisotropy, even in settings with orthogonal convergence and no slab rollback."

We have constructed a partial cDNA library from the mRNA of Ophiophagus hannah (king cobra) venom gland tissue and identified five new genes encoding proteins belonging to the three-finger toxin family of snake venom proteins. We have isolated and characterized one of these beta-sheet containing proteins with a mass of 7012.43 +/- 0.91 Da from the venom. The protein was nonlethal up to a dose of 10 mg/kg when injected intraperitoneally into Swiss albino mice. However, it induces labored breathing and death at a dose of 100 mg/kg. It does not show any hemolytic or anticoagulant activity. It caused a dose-dependent decrease of heart rate in vivo (anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats) and also ex vivo (Langendorff isolated rat heart). This is in contrast to classical cardiotoxins from snake venom that increase the heart rate in animals. Radioligand displacement studies showed that this protein targets beta-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity (Ki) of 5.3 and 2.3 microM toward beta1 and beta2 subtypes, respectively, to bring about its effect, and hence, it was named as beta-cardiotoxin.

Notably, the crystal structure of the gp41 core reveals that the positively charged residue Lys574 in the NHR of HIV-1 gp41 lines in the left wall of the cavity and forms a conserved salt bridge with negatively charged residue Asp632 in the CHR (Fig. 1C) (6Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The residue Lys574 is highly conserved among all HIV-1 isolates (19Dong X.N. Xiao Y. Dierich M.P. Chen Y.H. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 75: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and its substitution with alanine (Ala) could severely attenuate HIV-1 replication (20Mo H.

Virology. 2004; 329: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), highlighting its importance for the interhelical interactions between the NHR and CHR. We have recently identified several small compounds, e.g. two N-substituted pyrrole derivatives, NB-2 and NB-64, as novel HIV-1 entry inhibitors, which inhibit HIV-1 fusion and entry at low micromolar concentration by interfering with the gp41 6-HB formation and disrupting the α-helical conformation (21Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The loss of anti-HIV activity in the absence of the COOH groups of NB-2 and NB-64 suggests that the acid group may play an important role in mediating antiviral activity. Computer-aided molecular docking analysis has shown that NB-2 and NB-64 fit inside the hydrophobic cavity and their COOH groups interact with the positively charged residue Lys574 to compete with the negatively charged residue Asp632 for forming the salt bridge (21Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, NB-2 and NB-64 may bind to the gp41 hydrophobic cavity region through hydrophobic and ionic interactions and block the formation of the fusion-active gp41 core, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry (21Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This data suggests that the salt bridge between Lys574 and Asp632 may play a critical role in interhelical interactions between NHR and CHR to form a 6-HB and may serve as a key target for developing HIV-1 entry inhibitors. In this report, we investigated the functions of Lys574 by mutational analysis and biophysical approaches. We found that non-conservative substitutions of Lys574 can completely abolish Env-mediated virus entry and severely impair the conformation and stability of the 6-HB modeled by N36 and C34 peptides derived from the NHR (residues 546–581) and CHR (residues 628–661), respectively. We also showed that this residue determines the potency of N-peptide (N36) to inhibit HIV-1 infection. Construction of HIV-1 Env Mutants—The plasmid encoding HIV-1 HXB2-Env was obtained from Dr. Kathleen Page and Dr. Dan Littman through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. A panel of HXB2-Env mutants (K574R, K574D, K574E, and K574V) were generated by mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing. The primers used for construction of HIV-1 Env mutants were designed and synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of HIV-1 Pseudovirus—HIV-1 pseudovirus was developed as previously described (21Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob.

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding wild-type or mutant HXB2-Env and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) by using FuGENE 6 reagents (Roche Applied Science). Supernatants containing HIV-1 pseudovirus were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used for infection of U87-T4-CXCR4 cells. Single-cycle Infection Assay—Briefly, U87-T4-CXCR4 cells were plated at 104 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight. The supernatants containing pseudovirus were added to cells and incubated overnight. The culture was re-fed and incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed using lysis reagent included in a luciferase kit (Promega). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units were determined immediately in the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). Synthesis of Wild-type and Mutant Peptides—Peptides N36 (residues 546–581, SGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQ ARIL) and its mutants (K574R, K574D, K574E, and K574V) and C34 (residue 628–661, WMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELL) were synthesized by a standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method in the MicroChemistry Laboratory of the New York Blood Center. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The concentration of peptides was determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficient ϵ (280 nm) of 5500 and 1490 mol/liter-1 cm-1 based on the number of tryptophan (Trp) residues and tyrosine (Tyr) residues (all the peptides tested contain Trp and/or Tyr), respectively (23Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). All peptides were dialyzed against PBS prior to CD and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—An N-peptide (N36 or its mutant) was incubated with the C-peptide (C34) at 37 °C for 30 min (the final concentrations of N-peptide and C-peptide were 10 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2). The isolated N- and C-peptides were also tested. CD spectra of these peptides and peptide mixtures were acquired on Jasco spectropolarimeter (model J-715, Jasco Inc., Japan) at room temperature using a 5.0-nm bandwith, 0.1-nm resolution, 0.1-cm path length, 4.0-s response time, and a 50-nm/min scanning speed. The spectra were corrected by subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. The α-helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (-33,000 degrees cm2 dmol-1) according to Refs. 24Shu W.

To determine the reversibility, the peptide mixtures were cooled to 10 °C and kept in the CD chamber at 10 °C for 30 min, followed by monitoring of thermal denaturation as described above. The melting curve was smoothened, and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated using Jasco software utilities as described previously (26Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation was analyzed by fitting the CD data to a simple two-state model according to Equation 1 (27Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Θ=ΘN+mNT+(ΘD+mDT)exp[ΔHvh/R(1/Tm−1/T)]1+exp[ΔHvh/R(1/Tm−1/T)](Eq. 1) Where θ is the observed signal at 222 nm, θN and θD are the native and denatured baseline intercepts, mN and MD are the native and the denatured baseline slops, T is the temperature, ΔHvh is the van't Hoff enthalpy, R is the gas constant, and Tm is the temperature of the transition midpoint. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a MicroCal high sensitivity VP-ITC instrument (Northampton, MA). Solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. Briefly, 0.25 mm C34 dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) was injected into the chamber containing 15 μm N36 or its mutants, respectively. The time between injections was 8 min and the stirring speed was 394 rpm. The heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting C34 into PBS buffer and subtracted from the heats produced in the corresponding peptide-peptide binding experiments. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using MicroCal Origin software (version 7.0). Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (N-PAGE)—N-PAGE was carried out to determine the 6-HB formation between the N- and C-peptides as described previously (28Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, an N-peptide (N36 or its mutant) was mixed with peptide C34 at a final concentration of 40 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixture was loaded onto a 10 × 1.0-cm precast 18% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) at 25 μl/per well with an equal volume of Tris glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen). Gel electrophoresis was carried out with 125 V constant voltage at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a FluorChem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—A capture ELISA as previously described (29Jiang S. Lin K. Zhang L. Debnath A.K. J. Virol. Methods. 1999; 80: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used to detect the formation of 6-HB between the N- and C-peptides. Briefly, 2 μg/ml IgG purified from rabbit antisera developed against the N36·C34 complex was pre-coated onto wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate (Corning Costar) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 2% nonfat milk, a mixture formed by an N-peptide (N36 or its mutant) and C34 at equimolar concentrations (2 μm) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by four washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Captured 6-HB was detected by sequential addition of NC-1, a mouse mAb specific for 6-HB that was developed in our laboratory, and biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Tecan US). Measurement of HIV-1 Infectivity—The inhibitory activity of N-peptides on infection by a laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain (IIIB) was determined as previously described (21Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 104 MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of the peptides at graded concentrations overnight. Then the culture supernatants were removed and fresh media were added. On the fourth day post-infection, 100 μl of culture supernatants were collected from each well, mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100, and assayed for p24 antigen by ELISA. Briefly, the wells of polystyrene plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex Technology, Chantilly, VA) were coated with HIVIG in 0.85 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight, followed by washes with PBS-T buffer (0.01 m PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and blocking with PBS containing 1% dry fat-free milk (Bio-Rad Inc.). Virus lysates were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After extensive washes, anti-p24 mAb (183–12H-5C), biotin-labeled anti-mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were added sequentially. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 n H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan). Recombinant protein p24 (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) was included for establishing a standard dose-response curve. Substitutions of Lys574 with Non-conserved Residues Completely Abolish Env-mediated Virus Entry—To define the function of residue Lys574 for HIV infectivity, we replaced Lys574 with a conserved arginine residue (Arg) or non-conserved residue aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), or valine (Val) by mutagenesis. The point mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and the expression of HIV-1 Env glycoprotein was confirmed by radioactive immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). We then determined the effects of these mutations on Env-mediated viral entry by using a single-cycle complementation system. As shown in Fig. 2, the pseudovirus with conservative substitution (K574R) could retain its infectivity on U87-T4-CXCR4 cells, similar to the wild-type virus. However, the pseudoviruses with non-conserved substitutions (K574D, K574E, or K574V) completely lost their capacity to infect target cells. This result suggests that residue Lys574 of HIV-1 gp41 is essential for virus entry. Substitutions of Lys574 with Non-conserved Residues Severely Impair 6-HB Stability—The peptides N36 and C34 were initially used to solve the crystal structure of fusion-active gp41 core (6Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism how non-conservative Lys574 substitutions determine Env-mediated HIV-1 infectivity, we used CD spectroscopy, a classic technique to measure the secondary structure conformation, such as α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil, of a protein or a peptide in liquid phase, to analyze the interaction of C34 with the wild-type and mutant N36. Consistently, CD spectra of the isolated N36 showed random coil structures, but the mixture of N36 and C34 at equimolar concentration resulted in formation of a conformation with high α-helicity, characterized by a typical saddle-shaped negative peak in the far UV region of CD spectrum and a significantly increased molar ellipticity (θ) at 222 nm (Fig. 3A). The CD spectra of all mutant N36 peptides indicated that they could interact with C34 to form 6-HB as shown by the induction of α-helical signals (Fig. 3B), but the α-helicity induced by K574D and K574V mutant peptides significantly decreased. To test the stability and reversibility of each 6-HB formed by N- and C-peptides, we performed thermal denaturation analysis by monitoring the signal at 222 nm of the peptide mixture when the temperature was slowly raised from 10 to 90 °C at a scan rate of 2 °C/min, then cooled to 10 °C for 30 min and heated to 90 °C again. The melting curves for each peptide combination and their thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Surprisingly, whereas conservative substitution in N36 (K574R) did not significantly affect the stability of its complex with the peptide C34, the Tm values of 6-HB bearing non-conservative substitutions in N36 (K574D, K574E, or K574V) dramatically decreased. These results suggest that non-conservative substitutions of Lys574 can severely attenuate the stability of 6-HB. The majority (73–89%) of the 6-HBs formed by binding of C34 to N36 and its mutants were reversible when tested by thermal denaturation, except the 6-HB formed by C34 and K574V, which only had about 40% reversibility (Table 1). All the far-UV CD spectroscope signals appeared to be cooperative and the transitions were relatively sharp. The reversible thermal denaturation could be fitted into a two-state model (native and denature) based on the nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. 4) (27Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar).TABLE 1The α-helicity and thermal stability of six-helix bundles formed between N- and C-peptides N- and C-peptides were complexed at 10 μm in PBS (pH 7.0) for CD measurement.Peptide complex[θ]222Helix content (%)TmaThe apparent Tm values were estimated from the thermal dependence of CD signal at 222 nmEnthalpybThe reversibility was calculated by comparing the enthalpy of the first and the second heating scans at a scan rate of 2 °C/min from 10 to 90 °CReversibility°Ckcal mol–1%Wild-type Asn36/C34–29,46789.363.825.588.5Mutants K574R/C34–31.09794.266.226.388.9 K574D/C34–16,17649.043.812.973.2 K574E/C34–24,00672.750.520.386.7 K574V/C34–13,48040.853.211.440.3a The apparent Tm values were estimated from the thermal dependence of CD signal at 222 nmb The reversibility was calculated by comparing the enthalpy of the first and the second heating scans at a scan rate of 2 °C/min from 10 to 90 °C Open table in a new tab We then used an ITC to determine the binding affinity of the representative N-peptides to C34. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, whereas the binding constant of wild-type N36 and its conserved mutant (K574R) was 3.06 × 106 and 1.86 × 106 m-1, respectively, non-conserved K574D and K574V mutants had reduced binding affinity (4.86 × 105 and 1.45 × 104 m-1, respectively), consistent with their thermal stability measured by CD spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, the titration experiments revealed the stoichiometry of the binding of C34 with N36 and its mutants is 1:0.3–0.4, rather than 1:1. It was reported that N-peptides have the tendency to aggregate in phosphate solutions (5Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 31Lu M. Ji H. Shen S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4433-4438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, N36 and its mutants may be present in phosphate buffers in multiple forms, e.g. monomers, trimers (32Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Trivedi V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5299-5309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 21755-21762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and aggregates. The kinetic transition of these forms (monomers ↔ trimers ↔ aggregates) is dependent on the peptide concentration, i.e. the peptide solution with a higher concentration has a greater chance of forming aggregates. To reduce the aggregation, we prepared the peptide stock solutions at the lowest possible concentrations (e.g. 0.5 mg/ml). Furthermore, the stock solutions were centrifuged at high speed (10,000 × g) and the supernatants were collected for measuring the peptide concentration and used for the CD and ITC experiments. Although the major aggregates in the peptide solutions were removed by high speed centrifugation before measuring the peptide concentration, there may still be some microaggregates present, which may not be able to interact with C34. Therefore, the actual concentration of the monomeric N36 peptide in solution that can interact with C34 is lower than expected. This may explain why the stoichiometry of the binding of C34 with N36 and its mutants from the titration experiments is not 1:1.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters of C34 binding to Asn36 and its mutantsMolar ratioΔHTΔSΔGKkcal mol-1m-1Wild-type N36/C340.33–44.8–31.4–13.43.06 × 106Mutants K574V/C340.30–14.5–6.44–8.061.45 × 104 K574R/C340.30–32.5–20.8–11.71.86 × 106 K574D/C340.33–18.9–9.91–8.994.86 × 105 Open table in a new tab Substitutions of Lys574 with Non-conserved Residues Change the Conformation of Six-helix Bundles—We previously developed a N-PAGE-based method to visualize the 6-HB formed by N"

However, incorporation of Anx-A5 transformed them into potent nucleators, with significantly greater activity than those made from ACP without PS. The ability of Anx-A5 to enhance the nucleation and growth of mineral appears to stem from its ability to form two-dimensional crystalline arrays on PS-containing monolayers.

To elucidate the roles of these components of the nucleational core of MVs, we incorporated them into synthetic complexes, which were investigated for their ability to induce and propagate mineral formation when incubated in SCL. In this report, we focus on the contributions of the various MV annexins, comparing their mineral forming activities when incorporated into synthetic complexes. Although in previous studies, we used a simple KCl-KPi buffer to make CPLX to reconstruct the nucleational core (29Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Wuthier R.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in vivo, where MVs form, a more complex ionic environment occurs. Therefore, in this study we used an intracellular phosphate buffer (ICP) (30Wuthier R.E. Rice G.S. Wallace J.E. Weaver R.L. LeGeros R.Z. Eanes E.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with an electrolyte content similar to that observed in ultrafiltrates of lysates of isolated growth plate chondrocytes (9Wuthier R.E.

Synthesis of ACP, CPLX, and Annexin-containing Complexes—A 4× stock emulsion of PS was prepared by drying 5 mg of PS in chloroform under N2 to form a thin film in a test tube.

The tube was then sonicated for 1–2 min at 25 °C in a water bath to form a uniform emulsion of small unilamellar vesicles. To make the PS-CPLX, 75 μl of the 4× PS stock emulsion were mixed with 225 μl of ICP buffer, and then 6 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 was added dropwise with rapid stirring over a 5–10-min period to form the insoluble complex, which was harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at ∼15,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended by sonication in 300 μl of SCL. To prepare the annexin-containing complexes, native proteins (chicken cartilage from ∼20,000 metatarsals, Anx-A5, Anx-A2, and Anx-A6; chicken liver, Anx-A5; human placenta, Anx-A5) were purified as previously described (8Genge B.R.

Protein levels were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by Coomassie Blue staining of gels. Aliquots containing 75–225 μg of the native Anx isolates were added to 75 μl of the 4× PS stock solutions, and the final volume was adjusted to 300 μl before adding the CaCl2 to precipitate the complex as above. These complexes were assayed for mineralization activity. As a control, PS was omitted, and the 100 mm CaCl2 stock was added dropwise into the ICP buffer with rapid stirring over a 5–10-min period to form ACP. As another control, purified native annexins were prepared in the ICP buffer (without PS); CaCl2 was then added to form Anx-A5-ACP complexes, which were harvested by centrifugation. As a further control to ensure that the observed turbidity was due to mineral formation and not to simple aggregation of the seeded complexes, Pi was omitted from the calcifying medium to preclude mineral formation. Mineralization Assay—Mineral formation was monitored by light scattering (33Brecevic L. Furedi-Milhofer H. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1972; 10: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using the multiwell microplate assay system described previously by Wu et al. (23Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Dunkelberger D.G.

Using this method, an increase of 0.1 A at 340 nm is roughly equivalent to precipitation of ∼10% of the total Ca2+ in the SCL. SCL contained 2 mm Ca2+ and 1.42 mm Pi in addition to 104.5 mm Na+, 133.5 mm Cl–, 63.5 mm sucrose, 16.5 mm TES, 12.7 mm K+, 5.55 mm glucose, 1.83 mm HCO–3, 0.57 mm Mg2+ (9Wuthier R.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1977; 23: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of the CPLX- (and ACP)-forming reaction mixtures and resuspensions, 60–80 μl of these nucleators were added to 1 ml of SCL followed by brief sonication to yield uniform suspensions. Quadruplicate samples (140 μl) from each 1-ml suspension were distributed into four wells of a 96-well half-area Costar microplate; turbidity measurements were made and recorded automatically at 15-min intervals for 12–16 h using a Labsystems iEMS MF microplate reader (Needham Heights, MA). Prior to each absorbence reading, the plate reader automatically agitated the sample to ensure that all particulate matter was resuspended (34Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When Pi was omitted from SCL, there was no significant increase in turbidity at 340 nm over the entire incubation period, regardless of which nucleator was introduced into the medium. Thus, the observed increase in turbidity is due to mineral formation and not to simple aggregation of the nucleation components. Analysis of the Kinetics of Mineral Formation—The kinetics of mineral formation was analyzed using the method of Genge et al. (34Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This method involves first derivate analysis of mineral formation curve (the plot of absorbence at 340 nm versus incubation time) to precisely measure 1) the time needed to induce mineral formation (TI), 2) the average rate of mineral formation during the rapid formation period (RMFR), and 3) the nucleation potential (NP)((RMFR/TI) × 100), a sensitive measure of the ability of each factor to induce and support mineral formation. This method, illustrated in Fig. 2, shows both a mineral formation curve and its first derivative (dA/dT) to illustrate how TI, RMFR, and NP were calculated. In addition, as described in the legend to the figure, a five-parameter logistic curve-fitting algorithm was used to quantify the maximal amount of mineral formed (AMFMax). The effects of the different factors (e.g. PS, the different annexins, ACP, etc.) on these four nucleational parameters enabled an accurate evaluation of how each contributed to the mineral formation process. Effect of Annexin Level Used in Forming PS-CPLX Nucleators—Although Anx-A5 is known to be a component of the nucleational core (23Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Dunkelberger D.G. LeGeros R.Z. Concannon B. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4404-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and to stimulate MV mineralization (34Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was not clear how much of the protein was required. To answer this question, the mineralizing activity of annexin-free PS-containing complexes (PS-CPLX) and those containing graded amounts of avian liver Anx-A5 (ALAnx-A5) were compared. In the absence of ALAnx-A5, the addition of 60 or 80 μl of PS-CPLX to SCL formed much less mineral than was seen in the presence of the Anx (Fig. 3, A and B). Induction times were slow (13–15 h), and the rate of rapid mineral formation, the nucleation potential, and the total amount of mineral formation were less than one-third of that seen with ALAnx-A5-containing complexes (Table 1).TABLE 1Influence of seeding level and level of incorporated avian liver annexin-5 on key parameters in the induction of mineral formation by PS-CPLXParameterLevel of avian liver AnxA5 in nucleator/ml of SCL (seeding volume 60 μl)0 μg/ml15 μg/ml30 μg/ml45 μg/mlTI (h)15.33 ± 0.145.63 ± 0.15-93.86 ± 0.05-103.21 ± 0.04-10RMFR0.0352 ± 0.00040.1250 ± 0.0012-80.136 ± 0.003-80.135 ± 0.003-8NP0.230 ± 0.0052.23 ± 0.08-73.59 ± 0.10-94.25 ± 0.09-9AMFMax0.167 ± 0.0020.435 ± 0.008-80.497 ± 0.006-90.495 ± 0.006-9Analyses4444Level of avian liver AnxA5 in nucleator/ml of SCL (seeding volume 80 μl)0 μg/ml20 μg/ml40 μg/ml60 μg/mlTI (h)12.97 ± 0.314.00 ± 0.05-73.19 ± 0.07-82.72 ± 0.07-8RMFR0.042 ± 0.0010.129 ± 0.002-80.149 ± 0.003-80.147 ± 0.003-8NP0.324 ± 0.0163.23 ± 0.07-84.67 ± 0.18-75.43 ± 0.27-6AMFMax0.160 ± 0.0040.511 ± 0.004-90.571 ± 0.010-80.597 ± 0.012-8Analyses4444 Open table in a new tab Incorporation of increasing levels of ALAnx-A5 into the PS-CPLXs produced progressively more active nucleators. For example, incorporating 15, 30, and 45 μg of ALAnx-A5 into the complex added at 60 μl/ml of SCL, reduced the induction times by 2.7-, 4.0-, and 4.8-fold, and increased the nucleation potential by 9.7-, 15.6-, and 18.5-fold, respectively, compared with the annexin-free PS-CPLX controls (Fig. 4, A and B). Although ALAnx-A5 increased the rate of rapid mineral formation 3.5–4.0-fold and the maximal amount of mineral formation 2.5–3.0-fold, they appeared to have nearly reached their maximal values at these levels (Fig. 4, C and D). Increasing the volume of nucleator from 60 to 80 μl/ml of SCL led to small further increases in mineralizing activity. Half-maximal effects were obtained at only ∼5 μg of ALAnx-A5 in PS-CPLX/ml of SCL (∼140 nm). Thus, only low levels of Anx-A5 were sufficient to significantly stimulate mineralization of the PS-CPLX. Effect of Different Classes of Annexins—MVs have been shown to contain three classes of annexins: Anx-A5, Anx-A6, and Anx-A2; however, their direct effects on mineral formation had not been previously examined. Nor had annexin A5s from different sources been compared. Therefore, these were incorporated into both ACP and PS-CPLX nucleation complexes prepared from ICP buffer, and their effects on the rate and amount of overall mineral formation as well as the various nucleation parameters were compared. As is evident from Fig. 5, the effects of the various annexins on mineral formation induced by ACP (left panels A, C, E, G, and I) as opposed to PS-CPLX (right panels B, D, F, H, and J) were quite different. As previously noted, annexin-free PS-CPLX had low mineral-forming activity, inducing mineral formation only after ∼10 h. Incorporation of all three Anx-A5s and Anx-A6 into PS-CPLX caused much quicker induction and more rapid mineral formation (Fig. 5, B, D, F, and H); however, Anx-A2 (Fig. 5J) had minimal effect. Of the three MV annexins, avian cartilage Anx-A5 (ACAnx-A5) was the most potent activator of mineralization, shortening the induction time by 5.8-fold and increasing the nucleation potential by 13.5-fold as well as doubling the rate and amount of maximal mineral formation (Table 2, top). The stimulatory effects of the other Anx-A5s and avian cartilage Anx-A6 (ACAnx-A6) on PS-CPLX were less, but still highly significant.FIGURE 5Effect on mineral formation of incorporation of annexins into PS-CPLX and ACP complexes. Annexin-PS-CPLXs were made as described in Fig. 3, except that 50 μlof4× PS was emulsified in 150 μl of ICP buffer, which contained either no protein (control) or 150 μg of one of the following: ACAnx-A5 (A and B), ALAnx-A5 (C and D), HPAnx-A5 (E and F), ACAnx-A6 (G and H), or ACAnx-A2 (I and J). The volume was adjusted to 200 μl, 4 μl of 100 mm CaCl2 (2 mm final Ca2+ concentration) was added and stirred, and the precipitate was centrifuged and resuspended in 200 μl of SCL. Samples of the resuspension (80 μl) were diluted to 1 ml SCL, and quadruplicate 140 μl aliquots were transferred to the 96-well microplates for a mineralization assay. As a control, ACP was prepared as above using 200 μl of the ICP buffer to which the CaCl2 was added. Shown are mineral formation profiles (A at 340 nm versus incubation time; circles) and the accompanying rate of mineral formation (dA/dh; triangles) for each of the tested annexins.

Although both ACAnx-A5 and ALAnx-A5 accelerated the onset of mineral formation, human placental annexin-A5 (HPAnx-A5) did not (cf. Fig. 5, A, C, and E), and both ACAnx-A6 and avian cartilage annexin-A2 (ACAnx-A2) delayed the onset of mineral formation (Fig. 5, G and I). ACAnx-A5 had the highest nucleation potential but had little effect on the rate of rapid mineral formation or the amount of maximal mineral formation when compared with the no-annexin control (Table 2, bottom). ALAnx-A5 caused slower induction of mineral formation than ACAnx-A5 but a somewhat higher amount of maximal mineral formation. In contrast, HPAnx-A5 not only did not accelerate onset of mineral formation by ACP but caused significant reductions in the rate of mineral formation, the nucleation potential, and the maximal amount of mineral formation. ACAnx-A2 also significantly slowed the onset of mineral formation, reducing the rate and amount of mineral formation when compared with the no-annexin control. On the other hand, ACAnx-A6 caused an even greater inhibition of ACP-induced mineral formation. It slowed the induction time by ∼45% and reduced the rate of rapid mineral formation by 24%, the nucleation potential by 47%, and the maximal amount of mineral formation by 18%. The inhibitory effect of ACAnx-A6 on ACP-nucleated mineral formation was opposite its stimulatory effect on PS-CPLX mineral formation. The distinct effect that the various annexins have on the nucleation potential and the time needed for induction of mineral formation is illustrated in Fig. 6. Here the marked enhancement of mineral formation (nucleation potential) by the Anx-A5s, and especially by cartilage Anx-A5, is contrasted with the lack of effect of Anx-A2. Also note the inverse relationship between the nucleation potential and induction time. Also note how the combination of PS with ACP to form the ICP-based PS-CPLX (Fig. 6A) clearly reduced the nucleation potential and lengthened the induction time when compared with the ACP control (Fig. 6B). Comparison of the two panels shows that with both PS-CPLX and ACP, Anx-A5 markedly increased the rate of mineral formation and shortened the time needed to trigger its onset. The primary purpose of this study was to elucidate the specific role that Anx-A5 plays in the induction and propagation of MV mineral formation. This quantitatively major protein is a known component of the nucleational core of MVs (29Wu L.N. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Wuthier R.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, since there are two other annexins present (Anx-A2 and Anx-A6), another objective was to define the contributions that each made to the nucleational core. We determined their effects on mineralization when incorporated into a variety of synthetic biomimetic nucleational complexes (simple binary annexin-ACP complexes as well as ternary annexin-PS-CPLXs). Our studies reveal that Anx-A5 plays two major roles in regulating mineral formation from PS-CPLX; it strongly accelerates the onset of mineral formation, and it significantly increases its rate. The first issue that needed to be addressed was how much Anx-A5 was needed to activate the PS-CPLX. We found that incorporation of 15–45 μg of avian liver Anx-A5 into PS-CPLX seeded into 1 ml of SCL was sufficient to cause marked shortening of the induction time as well as major increases in the rate and amount of mineral formation. Impressively, the nucleation potential was increased 10–20-fold. Half-maximal increases were obtained with only 5 ± 1 μg of the annexin/ml of SCL. This would amount to only one Anx-A5 for ∼5000 PS-CPLX units. Considering this low stoichiometric relationship, it is evident that a catalytic mechanism must be involved. How did the annexins do this? To answer this question, it is necessary to understand the basic structure of PS-CPLX. Electron microscopic examination reveals that it forms extended planar two-dimensional bilayers (40 ± 2 Å thick) rather than vesicular structures (10Peress N.S. Anderson H.C. Sajdera S.W. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1974; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Wuthier R.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 19: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The packing arrangement of the PS-CPLX head groups at the surface of the membrane probably is hexagonal, but the area occupied by each head group is currently unknown. Based on the condensation that is known to occur in the presence of Ca2+, it would be expected to be in the range of 40–55 Å2 (36Demel R.A. Paltauf F. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8659-8665Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

However, it is clear that there are key differences between the regulation of the RP and non-RP growth genes. Induction of the non-RP growth genes does not appear to involve Rap1, Abf1, or Crf1 (21Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M.

Furthermore, the kinetics of non-RP growth gene induction by nutrient addition are slightly different from kinetics for RP gene induction (6Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2,: E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Jorgensen P. Rupes I. Sharom J.R. Schneper L. Broach J.R. Tyers M.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13,: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). One clue to the mechanism underlying non-RP growth gene regulation has been the computational identification of two sequence motifs, termed ribosomal RNA processing element (RRPE) and polymerase A and C (PAC), that are overrepresented in non-RP growth promoters (6Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2,: E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Wade C. Shea K.A. Jensen R.V. McAlear M.A. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 296,: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The RRPE was initially identified via computational analysis of a set of growth-related genes (24Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Tavazoie S. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296,: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), whereas PAC was identified in promoters of polymerase II transcribed genes that encode RNA polymerase I and III subunits (25Dequard-Chablat M. Riva M. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266,: 15300-15307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work from independent laboratories has shown that RRPE and PAC can confer nutrient regulation to reporter genes (6Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2,: E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Slattery M.G. Heideman W. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6,: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Wade C. Shea K.A.

Cell. 2003; 2,: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although these cis-acting elements are thought to play an important role in bringing quiescent cells into a state of rapid growth, the trans-acting regulatory proteins that bind to and act at these sequences have remained elusive. Our preliminary work revealed a specific RRPE-binding protein in yeast extracts. We then used gel shift assays to screen a panel of 6144 ORF-GST fusions generated by Martzen et al. (27Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286,: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) roughly following the strategy reported by Hazbun and Fields (28Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1,: 538-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This approach successfully yielded an RRPE-binding protein, Stb3. Furthermore, we found that Stb3 binds to RRPE-containing promoters in vivo. Loss of Stb3 impeded the nutrient induction of many, but not all, non-RP growth genes. Taken together, our results establish a biological and biochemical role for Stb3 and identify an RRPE-binding protein involved in the induction of non-RP growth genes by glucose. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The cells were grown in either YPD or SC medium with 2% glucose (29Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194,: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The strains were: BY4742 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and 13527 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 stb3Δ::KanMX) (Research Genetics, Huntsville AL); DLY6 (BY4742 in which Stb3 is chromosomally tagged with 3× Myc as described (30Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11,: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)). 64 GST-ORF fusion pools, containing 96 strains each, were a generous gift from Eric Phizicky (27Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286,: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). YDR169C-TAP (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 HIS3 STB3-Tap::HIS3) Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). (A more detailed description of the experimental procedures is provided in the supplemental materials.) Screening of GST Fusion Proteins and Gel Shift Assays—Purification and gel shift assays of these pools were as described (28Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1,: 538-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Phizicky E.M. Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Xing F. Shull N.P. Van Slyke C.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180,: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used for pool screening contained a triple repeat of RRPEs (AAAAATTT). For other experiments probes correspond to a NSR1 promoter segment containing a single PAC element flanked by RRPEs: 5′-GG TGG TGA AAA ATT TGC AAG GGC AGC TCA TCG CAA GAA CGA AAA ATT TCA ATC C-3′ (RRPEs are underlined; PAC is underlined italics). When mutated, RRPE sequences were AcgAAcgT and PAC sequences were CcagaC. In addition, a double-stranded oligonucleotide from the CLN3 promoter was used as a control competitor. This oligonucleotide is referred to as UR, unrelated. Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Labeled cRNA was mixed with hybridization controls, hybridized to Yeast Genome S98 Arrays (Affymetrix), washed, and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400. The arrays were scanned using an Agilent GeneArray Scanner and Microarray Suite 5.0, and .CEL files were analyzed using DCHIP 1.3 (33Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98,: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The intensity values were normalized across 12 independent microarrays using the invariant set normalization method of DCHIP (34Li C. Wong W. Parmigiani G. Garrett E. Irizarry R. Zeger S. The Analysis of Gene Expression Data: Methods and Software. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York, 2003: 120-141Crossref Google Scholar). Model-based analysis including log2 transformation of expression indexes using the perfect match only model was performed using values from two independent microarrays for each time point/condition. The microarray data are shown in detail in Excel files (supplemental Table S1). Microarray data has been deposited at the GEO website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with accession number GSE8379. RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—RNA was separated by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed as described previously (35Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Parviz F. Heideman W. EMBO J. 1998; 17,: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Northern blots were probed with ATC1 (+161 to +720), NOP14 (+100 to +621), YMR244W (+121 to +661), and a 600-bp SacI fragment from U2 to confirm uniform loading. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were conducted as described in Ref. 36Newcomb L.L. Hall D.D. Heideman W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22,: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Samples were collected from quiescent cells grown for 3 days in YPD and also at 10 min after glucose addition and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. After extract preparation, the clarified sonicated samples were incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 50-μl suspensions for 16 h. Cross-links were reversed by incubating overnight at 65 °C, and the samples were treated with proteinase K and DNase-free RNase A for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). PCR primers were: NSR1, -400/+50 upstream, 5′-GAA GAA AGA CGA CAG CAA TTC-3′, and downstream, 5′-CAAGAAGGAAGTTAAGGCTTC-3′; DBP10, -400/+50 upstream, 5′-TGC CAC TAT CAC GTT GTC AAA-3′, and downstream, 5′-TCT CGA AGA TCA AGA CGA CAA-3′; ADH4, +582/+899 upstream, 5′-GGC TAC TAA CGG TGG GGA AAT CGG AGA C-3′, and downstream, 5′-GCA CAG GCA TCG GTG ATT GGG TTA GAG GC-3′. Evidence for an RRPE-binding Protein—If RRPEs act as regulatory elements controlling the transcription of genes in response to glucose, then there should be at least one yeast protein that specifically interacts with RRPE sequences. To test this, we used gel shift assays to detect protein binding to a radio-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe chosen from the NSR1 promoter sequence. We chose this sequence as a test oligonucleotide because NSR1 is a non-RP growth gene that is induced ∼8-fold within 10 min of fresh medium addition (9Slattery M.G. Heideman W. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6,: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Xue Z. Melese T. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4,: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Moy T.I. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13,: 2118-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, this region contains a single PAC sequence flanked by two RRPE sequences. We found that this probe produced several nonspecific bands along with a single RRPE-specific band when added to a wild type yeast extract (Fig. 1, arrow). This band was judged specific because it was competed by an excess of cold competitor but was not competed when the RRPEs in the cold oligonucleotide were destroyed by point mutations. Furthermore, the band was not observed with a labeled probe carrying the mutated RRPEs but was observed with a probe in which the PAC element had been altered. This sequence-specific RRPE-protein complex was observed with a variety of RRPE containing gel shift probes (not shown). Although the probe shown in Fig. 1 did not produce obvious PAC element complexes, we did observe these in experiments using tandem PAC probes (not shown). Stb3 Binds to RRPEs—To identify RRPE-binding proteins, we used a collection of strains originally constructed in the laboratories of Phizicky, Grayhack, and Fields (27Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286,: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 31Phizicky E.M. Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Xing F. Shull N.P. Van Slyke C. Montagne R.K. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350,: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These strains express individual GST fusions for each of 6144 yeast ORFs. Sixty-four pools of affinity purified GST fusion proteins were tested for RRPE binding activity using a previously reported gel shift approach (28Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1,: 538-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) modified to produce more stringent binding conditions. These pools were screened with a synthetic DNA probe containing three RRPEs arranged in tandem. This screen yielded only three candidate pools, and Pool 53 produced the most prominent band (Fig. 2A). This band showed strong competition with an unlabeled RRPE probe but not with an unlabeled oligonucleotide carrying a mutated RRPE (ΔRRPE). We saw no competition with an unrelated cold oligonucleotide derived from the CLN3 promoter (UR). This shows that Pool 53 contains a putative RRPE-binding protein with sequence specificity. Screening within Pool 53 identified Stb3 as the RRPE-interacting protein. Stb3 binds to a complex containing Sin3 and Rpd3 (39Kasten M.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256,: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40Kalkum M. Krutchinsky A. Zhang J. Meagher M. Roeder R.G. Chait B.T. Proceedings of the 49th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Chicago, Illinois, May 27-31, 2001, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY. 2001; Google Scholar). Purified GST-Stb3 produced a very strong, specific gel shift band using either the tandem repeat RRPE probe used in our screen (not shown) or with the NSR1 promoter probe containing the pair of RRPEs flanking a PAC element (Fig. 2B). Binding of GST-Stb3 to the NSR1 DNA probe was completely dependent on RRPE sequences but did not require the PAC sequences (Fig. 2B). Adding a 100-fold excess of unlabeled NSR1 probe effectively competed away the prominent gel shift band produced by purified GST-Stb3. However, the cold oligonucleotide was unable to bind and compete if it contained point mutations within the RRPE sequence (ΔRRPE). In contrast, mutations in the PAC sequence (ΔPAC) did not affect competition. In addition to testing the ability of GST-Stb3 to bind to RRPEs, we examined the ability of the normal Stb3 in yeast protein extracts to form complexes with the RRPE-containing probe from NSR1 (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 1, this probe produced several complexes with yeast cell extracts; however, only one of them appeared to be specific. This specific Stb3-dependent band, indicated by the arrow, was consistently absent with stb3Δ extracts (Fig. 3A). This experiment also showed that addition of glucose to post-log cells did not alter the intensity of this band. When we tested extracts from a strain expressing a chromosomally Myc-tagged Stb3, we found that the gel shift band had slightly reduced mobility (Fig. 3B, lower shaded arrow) and was dramatically super shifted in the presence of Myc antibodies (upper shaded arrow). We conclude that the Stb3 protein is directly associated with the protein-DNA complex. Stb3 in Vivo—ChIP assays demonstrated in vivo binding of Stb3 at two different non-RP growth promoters that contain RRPEs: NSR1 and DBP10 (Fig. 4). This binding was affected by nutrients, being higher in the presence of glucose. A fragment from the open reading frame of ADH4, used as a control, was not immunoprecipitated, nor did we see enrichment of NSR1 or DBP10 promoter DNA in immunoprecipitates from untagged control extracts. If Stb3 plays a role in the transcriptional response to glucose, then the loss of Stb3 should diminish this response. To test this we used Northern blots to follow the glucose induction of NSR1 and DBP10 (Fig. 5). This showed that loss of Stb3 reduced the glucose induction of both genes, with DBP10 induction being more Stb3-dependent than induction of NSR1. These two probes suggest that Stb3 plays a role in glucose induction but cannot account for all of the response. To obtain a large scale view of the effect that STB3 deletion has on gene induction, we used Affymetrix microarrays to compare the induction of transcripts in wild type and stb3Δ cells as glucose was added to quiescent 3-day cultures. Within 10 min of glucose addition, a set of 1355 genes were induced by at least 2-fold over post-log expression levels (Fig. 6A and supplemental Table S1). This corresponds well to previously reported gene sets induced by nutrient repletion (6Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2,: E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Radonjic M. Andrau J.C. Lijnzaad P. Kemmeren P. Kockelkorn T.T. van Leenen D. van Berkum N.L. Holstege F.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18,: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Slattery M.G. Heideman W. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6,: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11,: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3679) Google Scholar). As can be seen by the heat map, the induction of some transcripts was little affected by loss of Stb3, whereas for others, STB3 deletion had a substantial impact. To further confirm that STB3 deletion blocks glucose induction of some transcripts, we probed the Northern blot shown in Fig. 5 with probes for YMR244w, ATC1, and NOP14. Our microarray experiment showed that glucose induction of these transcripts was Stb3-dependent; the Northern blots confirmed this (Fig. 5). To get a better picture of this effect, the ratio of glucose induction in stb3Δ versus glucose induction in wild type cells was determined for each of the 1355 transcripts and plotted as a histogram (Fig. 6B). If glucose induction of a transcript was unaffected by loss of Stb3, then the log2 ratio is zero. The values falling to the left of zero reflect reduced glucose induction in stb3Δ mutants, whereas positive ratios reflect increased glucose induction in the stb3Δ mutants. As can be seen, the mode falls at a log2 value of approximately -0.5, which corresponds to a 1.4-fold reduction in the glucose response in the stb3Δ mutant. For ∼550 of the genes, deletion of STB3 reduced glucose induction by 1.5-fold or more (supplemental Table S1). The list of 1355 genes induced by glucose contains genes with and without RRPEs. If Stb3 regulates transcription by binding to RRPE elements, then there should be an association between Stb3 dependence and the presence of RRPEs in the promoters of these genes. We compared sets of genes that were strongly affected by STB3 deletion to sets of genes that were relatively Stb3-independent (Fig. 6C). Consistent with our model, the percentage of genes having at least one promoter RRPE jumped from 22% for Stb3-independent genes to 61% for the genes that showed the greatest Stb3 effect. Stb3 as an RRPE-binding Protein—The addition of fresh medium to quiescent yeast cells causes the rapid induction of a very large gene set of genes (6Wang Y. Pierce M. Schneper L. Guldal C.G. Zhang X. Tavazoie S. Broach J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2,: E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Radonjic M. Andrau J.C. Lijnzaad P. Kemmeren P. Kockelkorn T.T. van Leenen D. van Berkum N.L.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6,: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A large fraction of the genes induced by nutrients tend to play a role in protein synthesis and cellular growth. One set of these genes encodes RPs themselves, whereas another set is involved in other aspects of protein synthesis. These have sometimes been referred to as the ribosome biogenesis genes, but they actually cover a broader range of functions; we have referred to this latter set as the non-RP growth genes (9Slattery M.G. Heideman W. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6,: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is not known how glucose induces the non-RP growth genes, but several groups have identified the RRPE and PAC elements in the promoters of these genes. In this work, we initially demonstrated the presence of an RRPE binding activity in yeast cell extracts. We then went on to clearly identify Stb3 as an RRPE-binding protein. Loss of Stb3 affects the glucose induction of a large group of RRPE-containing genes. Stb3 and Gene Regulation—Our results show that Stb3 plays a role in the transcriptional response to glucose repletion, but they also raise questions about the regulatory mechanism. The ChIP experiments indicate that glucose causes binding of Stb3 to the promoter regions of Stb3-dependent genes, a process that correlates with glucose activation of these genes. This suggests that glucose addition permits Stb3 to become associated with RRPEs to turn on gene expression. Stb3 was originally identified in a two-hybrid screen for Sin Three Binding proteins (39Kasten M.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256,: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40Kalkum M. Krutchinsky A. Zhang J. Meagher M. Roeder R.G. Chait B.T. Proceedings of the 49th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Chicago, Illinois, May 27-31, 2001, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY. 2001; Google Scholar). This is significant because the Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase has been implicated in the repression of non-RP growth genes in response to stresses including nutrient depletion (41Loewith R.

Cell. 2004; 16,: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, the discovery of Stb3 as an RRPE-binding protein may provide a link with nutrient sensing pathways already being investigated. Although genes affected by Stb3 were more likely to have RRPEs in their promoters than Stb3-independent genes, a substantial fraction of the Stb3-dependent genes had no identifiable RRPE sequences, and the glucose induction of some genes with multiple promoter RRPE sequences were not affected by the loss of Stb3. These results are most easily explained by proposing that Stb3 plays a part in a process that involves multiple, redundant components. For example, some genes may be regulated by glucose through the actions of multiple pathways and/or transcription factors. For these, the loss of Stb3 alone might have little impact. It is also possible that Stb3 binds to sites that are not readily identified as RRPEs. In this case, a gene might be regulated via Stb3 and yet have no identifiable RRPEs. Although it is clear that proteins such as Sfp1 play a role in regulating the non-RP growth genes containing RRPEs and PACs, direct interaction between Sfp1 and the PAC or RRPE motifs has not been found, despite numerous attempts (26Fingerman I. Nagaraj V. Norris D. Vershon A.K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2,: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This has led to the speculation that Sfp1 regulates these genes indirectly through another DNA-binding protein. Thus, it is possible that Stb3 lies downstream of Sfp1 and that the two proteins interact. Additional work will be needed to test this. Speculation—The RRPE sequence of AAA(A/T)TTTT is distinct from many of the well studied cis-regulatory elements. Similarly, Stb3 is a distinct protein with no readily recognizable structural domains that suggest function or mechanism. It may be that Stb3 represents a novel class of DNA-binding proteins.

A now classic example of these signaling activities is the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm through an intracellular channel that is gated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) 4The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIns(1,3,4)P3inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphateITPK1inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinaseIns(1,3,4,6)P4inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphateIns(3,4,5,6)P4inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphateIns(1,3,4,5,6)P5inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphateeITPK1E. histolytica ITPK1hITPKH. sapiens ITPK1HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyALSAdvanced Light SourcegmITPK4Glycine max ITPK1 homologue.4The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIns(1,3,4)P3inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphateITPK1inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinaseIns(1,3,4,6)P4inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphateIns(3,4,5,6)P4inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphateIns(1,3,4,5,6)P5inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphateeITPK1E. histolytica ITPK1hITPKH. sapiens ITPK1HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyALSAdvanced Light SourcegmITPK4Glycine max ITPK1 homologue.

Additional roles are continually being discovered: inositol phosphates have recently been shown to be critical to the activity of RNA-editing enzymes (3Macbeth M.R. Schubert H.L. Vandemark A.P. Lingam A.T. Hill C.P. Bass B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), to participate in telomere maintenance (4York S.J. Armbruster B.N. Greenwell P. Petes T.D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4264-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and to be the phosphate donors in certain protein phosphorylation events (5Saiardi A. Bhandari R. Resnick A.C. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 2004; 306: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is of critical interest, therefore, to establish the regulatory mechanisms that govern the metabolism of inositol phosphates. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate E. histolytica ITPK1 H. sapiens ITPK1 high pressure liquid chromatography Advanced Light Source Glycine max ITPK1 homologue. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate E. histolytica ITPK1 H. sapiens ITPK1 high pressure liquid chromatography Advanced Light Source Glycine max ITPK1 homologue. An interesting feature of inositol phosphate metabolism is the promiscuity with which several key kinases phosphorylate multiple substrates (6Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: Pt. 3, 551-Pt. 3, 555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ITPK1 (also known as inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase) adds either a 5- or 6-phosphate to Ins(1,3,4)P3 and also attaches a 1-phosphate to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (6Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: Pt. 3, 551-Pt. 3, 555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang L. Reece J. Gabriel S.E. Shears S.B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (inositol phosphate structures shown in Fig. 2). These reactions have been demonstrated to be reversible: ITPK1 can also dephosphorylate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 back to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (8Ho M.N. Y. Yang X. Carew M.A. Zhang T. Hua L. Kwon Y.U. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An especially puzzling aspect of this phenomenon is that dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 by human ITPK1 is stimulated, rather than competitively inhibited, by one of its alternate substrates, Ins(1,3,4)P3 (8Ho M.N. Y. Yang X. Carew M.A. Zhang T. Hua L. Kwon Y.U. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that mammalian ITPK1 reversibly phosphorylates both Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 takes on special significance because the two substrates occur in separate branches of the metabolic pathway (9Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Nogimori K. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11167-11176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is formed in a metabolic cycle with Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, whereas Ins(1,3,4)P3 is formed by a kinase/phosphatase pathway as a consequence of receptor-dependent phospholipase C activity. The metabolic coupling of these two distinct pathways has been demonstrated in cells (10Yang X. Rudolf M. Carew M.A. Yoshida M. Nerreter V. Riley A.M. Chung S.K. Bruzik K.S. Potter B.V. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18973-18980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The metabolic interaction between ITPK1 substrates is of particular biological significance because Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 decouples calcium-activated chloride channels from activation by cytoplasmic Ca2+ (11Ho M.N.Y. Shears S.B. Current Topics in Membranes. Academic Press, London2002: 345-363Google Scholar). In this way Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 regulates a range of biological processes, including salt and fluid secretion, neurotransmission, and insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (8Ho M.N. Y. Yang X. Carew M.A. Zhang T. Hua L. Kwon Y.U. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. Curr.

Recently it was shown that changes in ITPK1 expression influence Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels, possibly modulating the phenotypic severity of the cystic fibrosis condition (7Yang L. Reece J. Gabriel S.E. Shears S.B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Changes in ITPK1 expression have also been reported to affect tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death (14Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, Miller et al. (15Miller G.J. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Hurley J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) described the crystal structure of an ITPK1 homologue in Entamoeba histolytica (eITPK1). This structure revealed an unusually versatile catalytic cleft that possesses little or no stereospecific constraints. Ligand binding was further proposed to be unaffected by either the presence of hydroxyl groups or by their orientation (i.e. equatorial versus axial); up to 18 inositol phosphate analogues could be modeled into the active site (15Miller G.J. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Hurley J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most of these characteristics of eITPK1 were proposed to apply to Homo sapiens ITPK1 (hITPK1) (15Miller G.J. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Hurley J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, other data indicated that there are limitations in the extent to which this information can be exploited to improve our molecular understanding of the human enzyme. For example, the ligand specificity of hITPK1 depends on the stereochemistry of the inositol ring and the orientation of its hydroxyl groups (16Riley A.M. Deleu S. Qian X. Mitchell J. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Most important of all, the eITPK1 structure did not offer any rationalization for how Ins(1,3,4)P3 can stimulate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation by mammalian ITPK1. In fact, in the current study we demonstrate that this characteristic has evolved specifically in higher organisms; we show that Ins(1,3,4)P3 does not activate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation in ITPK1 homologues from soybean and in E. histolytica. Moreover, we describe the crystal structure of the human enzyme and identify structural features likely to contribute to this and other important differences in the catalytic activities of different homologues of ITPK1. A rapid Escherichia coli expression, purification, and crystallization procedure for hITPK1 has been developed. Human ITPK1 was cloned into an MH4 vector (17Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Godzik A. Deacon A.M. Mathews I. Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Klock H.E. McMullan D. Shin T. Vincent J. Robb A. Brinen L.S. Miller M.D. McPhillips T.M. Miller M.A. Scheibe D. Canaves J.M. Guda C. Jaroszewski L. Selby T.L.

A. 2002; 99: 11664-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) by PCR and expressed in the HK100 strain of E. coli. Briefly, 12 × 65-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C in a Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation fermenter (18Lesley S.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and hITPK1 expression was induced by the addition of 0.02% l-arabinose for 3 h. Proteins were extracted by sonication into 20 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 10 mm imidazole, with 1 Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 45 min. The recombinant enzyme was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography and eluted into a buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm TCEP, 100 mm imidazole. S-200 size exclusion chromatography followed. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced by inhibition of methionine biosynthesis (19Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and subsequently purified in the same manner as the native protein. Protein was concentrated in a Centriprep 15 10-kDa concentrator (Amicon) prior to crystal screening. Native protein was concentrated to 15-22 mg/ml for crystallization trials, whereas selenomethionine protein appeared insoluble beyond 12 mg/ml and was used at this concentration. 480 crystallization conditions were set up in Greiner low profile 96-well sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at two temperatures (4 and 20 °C) (conditions described in Ref. 17Lesley S.A. Kuhn P. Godzik A. Deacon A.M. Mathews I. Kreusch A. Spraggon G. Klock H.E. McMullan D. Shin T. Vincent J. Robb A. Brinen L.S. Miller M.D. McPhillips T.M. Miller M.A. Scheibe D. Canaves J.M. Guda C.

A. 2002; 99: 11664-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Full-length ITPK1 failed to crystallize despite extensive coarse crystallization screening and showed some proteolytic degradation during purification and storage. Proteolytic products, presumably a consequence of the action of endogenous E. coli proteases, were analyzed by mass spectroscopy, and sequences corresponding to the truncated products were cloned back into the MH4 vector. The construct composed of residues 1 to 335 proved amenable to crystallization and was used in subsequent structural studies. Crystals grew in 2 weeks at 4 °C after mixing the protein solution 1:1 with, and subsequently equilibrating against, a reservoir solution of 0.2 m citrate, pH 5.6, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 m potassium/sodium tartrate. Further crystals were obtained by screening around this condition. Nucleotide complexes were obtained by co-crystallization with either 1 mm ATP or AMPPNP (Sigma), along with 5 mm MnCl2. Crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol. Data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) beamlines 5.0.2 and 5.0.3. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar) and the CCP4i suite (21Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. ITPK1 was initially phased using a three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment on selenomethionine-derivative protein, and the structure was subsequently solved using Solve/Resolve (22Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Subsequently, non-isomorphous structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (23Storoni L.C.

Open table in a new tab All in vitro assays of inositol phosphate metabolism were performed as previously described (28Qian X. Mitchell J. Wei S.J. Williams J. Petrovich R.M. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For these experiments, recombinant hITPK1 was prepared after expression in Sf9 cells as previously described (28Qian X. Mitchell J. Wei S.J. Williams J. Petrovich R.M. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except that the gene was first shuttled into the pDEST605 kinase vector, which also contains a green fluorescent protein reporter gene that was then used to generate bacmid insect viral DNA (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously described (28Qian X. Mitchell J. Wei S.J. Williams J. Petrovich R.M. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An expressed sequence tag clone encoding gmITPK4 was obtained from the Public Soybean Data Base (Biogenetic Services, Brookings, SD). PCR amplifications were performed with a 5′-primer containing a SmaI restriction site and the 3′-primer containing XhoI. PCR products were digested and ligated into pGEX4T-1 (encoding an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag), which was used to transform competent TOP10 bacterial cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were lysed, and protein was purified using glutathione S-transferase-Sepharose beads. Recombinant ITPK1 from E. histolytica was generously provided by Dr. Greg Miller (Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada). [32P-1]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was made by phosphorylating Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) using ITPK1, after which the product was HPLC-purified. Intersubstrate Phosphate Transfer Activity of hITPK1—We investigated the mechanism by which Ins(1,3,4)P3 stimulates Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation (Figs. 1 and 2). Dephosphorylation assays used Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 in which the 1-phosphate was [32P]-labeled. When incubated with ADP, hITPK1 dephosphorylated [32P-1]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to yield unlabeled Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. As Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was not detectable in the HPLC profiles shown in Fig. 1, the accumulation of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 product was separately verified using [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 as substrate (data not shown). Note that there was no release of [32P]Pi when [32P-1]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was dephosphorylated to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (Fig. 1A). Instead, [32P]-labeled ATP accumulated (Figs. 1, A and B), which was separately verified using a luciferase reporter assay (data not shown). This is the first demonstration that the 1-phosphate from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 is transferred to ADP rather than being released to the medium as inorganic phosphate by ITPK1. The addition of non-radiolabeled Ins(1,3,4)P3 to these reactions increased the rate of dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 despite the fact that both are substrates of ITPK1 (Fig. 1A). This is a biologically significant phenomenon that enables Ins(1,3,4)P3 to regulate Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 accumulation in vivo (8Ho M.N. Y. Yang X. Carew M.A. Zhang T. Hua L. Kwon Y.U. Chung S.K. Adelt S. Vogel G. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Shears S.B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it has not previously been rationalized at a molecular level. We now show that Ins(1,3,4)P3 considerably reduced the quantity of [32P]ATP that accumulated when [32P-1]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was dephosphorylated (Fig. 1, A and B). Instead, the [32P]1-phosphate that was removed from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was now transferred to Ins(1,3,4)P3, thereby forming [32P]InsP4 (Fig. 1, A and B). It has been known for some time that ITPK1 shows both 5- and 6-kinase activities toward Ins(1,3,4)P3 (29Abdullah M. Hughes P.J. Craxton A. Gigg R. Desai T. Marecek J.F. Prestwich G.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22340-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Using[3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 we confirmed that two [3H]InsP4 isomers were formed, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (Fig. 1, C and D). The above results imply that Ins(1,3,4)P3 can bind to an enzyme-ATP state faster than ATP can be exchanged for ADP. Thus, the enzyme may return to its ADP state more quickly (ready for another cycle of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation) if enzyme-bound ATP is used to phosphorylate Ins(1,3,4)P3. Note also that a small amount of newly formed [32P]InsP4 was itself dephosphorylated to a [32P]-labeled InsP3, which consistently eluted one fraction after ATP (Fig. 1B). The assays described above contained a physiologically relevant concentration of ADP (1 mm) (30Soboll S. Scholz R. Heldt H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) but no ATP. In further experiments, non-radioactive ATP was added to 5 mm and it is striking that there was only a 30% decrease in both the extent of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation and the rate of [32P] transfer from Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (Fig. 1E) compared with incubations containing 1 mm ADP and no ATP. These results support our hypothesis that there is a relatively slow rate of exchange of bulk phase ATP with either enzyme-bound ADP or enzyme-bound [32P]ATP. Clearly, the intersubstrate phosphate transfer activity of ITPK1 occurs even in the presence of physiologically relevant levels of adenine nucleotides (i.e. [ATP] > [ADP]) (30Soboll S. Scholz R. Heldt H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Simultaneous binding of both Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to the same active site seems implausible because of the topological and electrostatic constraints imposed by the binding pocket (described below). In order for the same phosphate to be transferred between different substrates via the same binding site, a sequential reaction model has been proposed (Fig. 2A). The efficient operation of this proposed nucleotide-mediated intersubstrate phosphate transfer may be facilitated by the enzyme withholding the nucleotide from the bulk phase during this series of reactions (Fig. 2B). Homologues of hITPK1 from Plant and Protozoa Dephosphorylate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 but Ins(1,3,4)P3 Does Not Stimulate This Reaction—Although the inositol phosphate kinase activity of eITPK1 has been well documented in previous reports (15Miller G.J.

It is particularly notable that the rate of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 dephosphorylation was not stimulated by Ins(1,3,4)P3 (Fig. 3A). This is an important functional difference between eITPK1 and hITPK1 and may represent a divergence in cellular function. Homologues of hITPK1 are also present in plants (32Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Plant enzymes have higher homology with hITPK1 than does eITPK1 (Fig. 4C). The plant enzymes are also functionally more similar to hITPK1 in that neither show physiologically significant kinase activity toward Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Table 2 and Ref. 32Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), unlike eITPK1 which shows robust Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity (31Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore felt useful information could be obtained by comparing some of the characteristics of hITPK1 with a plant homologue.FIGURE 4Sequence and structural comparisions between hITPK1 and eITPK1.

RGS2 mRNA up-regulation by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is a potentially important negative feedback mechanism in blood pressure homeostasis, but how it occurs is unknown. Here we demonstrate that group VIA phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (iPLA<sub>2</sub>β) plays a pivotal role in Ang II-induced RGS2 mRNA up-regulation in VSMC by three independent approaches, including pharmacologic inhibition with a bromoenol lactone suicide substrate, suppression of iPLA<sub>2</sub>β expression with antisense oligonucleotides, and genetic deletion in iPLA<sub>2</sub>β-null mice. Selective inhibition of iPLA<sub>2</sub>β by each of these approaches abolishes Ang II-induced RGS2 mRNA up-regulation. Furthermore, using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrate that restoration of iPLA<sub>2</sub>β-expression in iPLA<sub>2</sub>β-null VSMC reconstitutes the ability of Ang II to up-regulate RGS2 mRNA expression. In contrast, Ang II-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation and Ang II receptor expression are unaffected. Moreover, in wild-type but not iPLA<sub>2</sub>β-null VSMC, Ang II stimulates iPLA<sub>2</sub> enzymatic activity significantly. Both arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidylcholine, products of iPLA<sub>2</sub>β action, induce RGS2 mRNA up-regulation. Inhibition of lipoxygenases, particularly 15-lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenases, but not cytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenases inhibits Ang II- or AA-induced RGS2 mRNA expression. Moreover, RGS2 protein expression is also up-regulated by Ang II, and this is attenuated by bromoenol lactone. Disruption of the Ang II/iPLA<sub>2</sub>β/RGS2 feedback pathway in iPLA<sub>2</sub>β-null cells potentiates Ang II-induced vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that iPLA<sub>2</sub>β participates in Ang II-induced transcriptional up-regulation of RGS2 in VSMC."

Stable analogs of intermediate states were generated using AMPPCP as a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog and AlFx as a phosphate analog, following conditions established for Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1). Characteristic digestion patterns obtained for different analog intermediates show that CopA undergoes domain rearrangements very similar to those of SERCA1. Digestion sites were identified on the loops connecting the A-domain and the transmembrane helices M2 and M3 as well as on that connecting the N-terminal metal binding domain (NMBD) and the first transmembrane helix, Ma. These digestion sites were protected in the E1P·ADP and E2P analogs, whereas the M2–A-domain loop was cleaved specifically in the absence of ions to be transported, just as in SERCA1. ATPase activity was lost when the link between the NMBD and the transmembrane domain was cleaved, indicating that the NMBD plays a critical role in ATP hydrolysis in T. maritima CopA. The change in susceptibility of the loop between the NMBD and Ma helix provides evidence that the NMBD is associated to the A-domain and recruited into domain rearrangements and that the Ma helix is the counterpart of the M1 helix in SERCA1 and Mb and Mc are uniquely inserted before M2.

Ion homeostasis is essential in all living organisms. Gradients for sodium and potassium across the cell membrane provide energy for action potentials. Calcium is the most commonly used ion for regulation of protein function. Zinc, ferrous, and copper ions, whereas they are toxic when present in excess, are indispensable cofactors for a variety of proteins, including enzymes involved in the respiratory chain (1Grotz N. Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In maintaining the concentrations of these physiologically important ions, P-type ATPases play a principal role (2Kühlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). P-type ATPases translocate specific ions against their electrochemical gradient across membranes using free energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis. Based on the primary structures, the P-type ATPase family can be divided into five branches, which are referred to as type I–V (4Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). PIB-type, a subgroup of PI-type, and PII-type ATPases constitute the major part of the family. PIB-type ATPases transport heavy metal ions, such as Cu+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ (5Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas PII-type ATPases are specific to H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+ (3Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys.

The ATPase consists of 3 cytoplasmic domains termed P (phosphorylation), N (nucleotide binding), and A (actuator) and 10 (M1–M10) transmembrane helices, some of which contain acidic residues that constitute high affinity binding sites for ions transported (6Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). With PIB-type ATPase, atomic structures have been determined for only cytoplasmic domains (12Dmitriev O. Tsivkovskii R. Abildgaard F. Morgan C.T. Markley J.L. Lutsenko S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9949-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is now clear that PIB-type ATPases also comprise 3 cytoplasmic domains and their core structures are very similar to those of SERCA1 (13Sazinsky M.H. Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11161-11166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Sazinsky M.H. Agarwal S. Argüello J.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9949-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although there are significant differences in the regions seemingly important for domain interaction (14Sazinsky M.H. Agarwal S. Argüello J.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9949-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, PIB-ATPases are distinguished from other P-type ATPases by the presence of a N-terminal metal binding domain (NMBD), typically consisting of a variable (1 to 6) repeat of a CXXC motif (5Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Also the transmembrane domain is clearly different. In contrast to PII-ATPases that have 10 transmembrane helices, PIB-ATPases contain only 8: the 4th to 8th bear similarity to M2 to M6 of the PII-type ATPases (2Kühlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas the 1st to 3rd are specific (referred to as Ma-Mc here). sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase N-terminal metal binding domain n-decyl-β-d-maltoside phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride bathocuproine disulfonate adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight enzymatic state of CopA at pH 7.0 with no heavy metal ions present 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate dithiothreitol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Given these differences in structure, the ion-translocation mechanism might also be different. The ion-translocation cycle of PII-ATPases is conventionally explained by the E1/E2 theory (15Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 16Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The transmembrane ion-binding sites have high affinity for transported ions in E1 and low affinity in E2; they face the cytoplasm in E1 and the lumen or extracellular medium in E2. Transported ions are occluded in the transmembrane binding sites in a phosphorylated intermediate (E1P) and released into the lumen (or extracellular medium) during the transition to E2P. Thus, it is well established that the reaction cycle of a PII-type ATPase consists of at least four intermediate states, namely, E1/E2 and their phosphorylated states (E1P/E2P), and is accompanied by large scale domain rearrangements (9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast, our understanding of the mechanism of PIB-ATPases is poor, and we do not know if they undergo similar domain rearrangements, or what role the NMBD provides. We have approached these issues by utilizing limited proteolysis, which has proved very successful with SERCA1 (19le Maire M. Lund S. Viel A. Champeil P. Møller J.V. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and play central roles in copper homeostasis in diverse organisms from bacteria to human, and their malfunctioning lead to abnormal copper ion levels in cells. For instance, human Cu+-ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, are implicated in Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively (25DiDonato M. Sarkar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Cox D.W. Moore S.D.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have expressed and purified a CopA homolog from Thermotoga maritima (NCB accession number AE000512) (27Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H.

It is one of the simplest Cu+-ATPases, consisting of 726 amino acids with a single CXXC motif in its NMBD. We performed limited digestions of CopA using various proteases and found papain the most useful. The results show that the cytoplasmic domains of CopA undergo rearrangements quite similar to those observed with SERCA1 and that the NMBD plays an important role in ATP hydrolysis, and participates in domain rearrangements during the reaction cycle. Subcloning the CopA Gene—T. maritima CopA gene (TM0317) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as template and 5′-sense oligonucleotide primer containing a restriction site for XhoI (5′-CACCAGCTCGAGAATGAGCGATCAGAAAACG-3′, the restriction site is underlined) and 3′-reverse complement primer with EcoRI site (5′-TTCGAATTCTCACTCTCTCACCC-3′). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI, ligated into the vector pBAD/His (Invitrogen) cut with the same restriction enzymes. This vector introduces an N-terminal sequence extension MGGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSR. This construct was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α for DNA sequencing and Top10 (Invitrogen) for overexpression. Overexpression of CopA in E. coli—The transformed Top10 was grown in Luria Bertani medium at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.7 and the production of the recombinant protein was then induced by the addition of l-arabinose at a final concentration of 0.01% (w/v). The cells were harvested 6 h later by centrifugation (typically 2.5 g of wet weight per 1 liter of media), washed with a buffer containing 100 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, suspended in a buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, and stored at –80 °C until needed. Protein Purification—Frozen cell suspension was thawed, supplemented with 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and passed through a Microfluidizer M110-EH (Microfluidics International Corp., Newton, MA) three times at 120 MPa to disrupt cells and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 8 h, and the pellet was suspended in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm MOPS·NaOH, pH 7.0, and stored at –80 °C. The microsomal fraction thus obtained was diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with the same buffer and incubated at 75 °C for 1 h. After adding 0.05% (w/v) n-decyl-β-d-maltoside (DM), the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was suspended in a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0. DM was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 170,000 × g for 1 h. The DM extract (typically 25 ml) was then mixed with 10 ml of Co2+ metal affinity resin (Clontech), pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DM, and 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, and gently stirred for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was next packed in a column and washed successively with 100 ml of the same buffer. The bound protein was finally eluted with 50 ml of the same buffer including 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mg/ml (w/v) E. coli total lipid (Avanti, Alabaster, AL). Fractions containing proteins were immediately supplemented with 2 mm DTT and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a 50,000 cut-off membrane (PALL, East Hills, NY). Imidazole was removed by dialysis against a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0. Purified CopA was frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Prior to any use, 2 mg/ml CopA was incubated in a solution supplemented with 2 mg/ml E. coli total lipid and 2 mm DTT for 1 h to activate Cu+-ATPase activity. ATPase Assay—Activated CopA was diluted in a buffer (ATPase assay medium) containing 3.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm cysteine, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm NaN3, 20 μm CuCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm MES-triethanolamine, pH 6.0 (60 °C), and allowed to hydrolyze ATP for 10 min, unless otherwise stated. The pH at 60 °C was calculated based on the measurement at room temperature and pKa/°C conversion factor of 0.011 for MES (28Good N.E. Izawa S. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 24: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cu+-independent ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 0.5 mm bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) instead of CuCl2, which was always subtracted to obtain the Cu+-dependent ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis was terminated by lowering the temperature to 4 °C and the released Pi was determined according to Lanzetta et al. (29Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Vmax and Km were calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee plot. For examining effects of AlFx on Cu+-ATPase activity, purified CopA (1 mg/ml or 6.33 μm) was preincubated in a buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm AlCl3, 2 mm potassium fluoride, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of various additives. They were 20 μm CuCl2 (E1·Cu+), 20 μm CuCl2 and 1 mm ADP (E1P·ADP), or 0.5 mm BCS (E2P). This mixture was diluted by ×20 with the ATPase assay medium. ATPase activity was measured for 5 min of reaction time. Proteolysis—Purified CopA (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with 0.5 mg/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) at 30 °C in a buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) DM, 1 mg/ml E. coli total lipid, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm cysteine, and 20% (w/v) glycerol, 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, with additives specific to each intermediate. They were 0.5 mm BCS (likely to be a mixture of E1 and E2; abbreviated as Eemp), 10 μm CuCl2 (E1·Cu+), 10 μm CuCl2, 2.5 mm AMPPCP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 (E1·Cu+·AMPPCP), 10 μm CuCl2, 0.1 mm AlCl3, 2 mm potassium fluoride, and 1 mm ADP (E1·Cu+·AlFx·ADP) or 0.5 mm BCS, 0.1 mm AlCl3, and 2 mm KF (E2·AlFx). Prior to digestion, CopA was reacted with these ligands by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h; papain was activated by incubation in a buffer containing 5 mm cysteine and 1 mm DTT and 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0. Proteolysis was terminated by adding 2 mm E64. The activity of papain in the various conditions was measured with N-α-benzoyl-l-Arg-p-nitroanilidine as the substrate and found to be virtually constant. For SDS-PAGE, 2.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added immediately and then the specimen was diluted three times with a modified Laemmli sample buffer containing 3% (w/v) SDS and 10 mm DTT. Twelve μl of each sample thus obtained was loaded onto a 10–20% gradient gel for SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. For quantitative analyses, the densities of stained bands were measured using a luminescent image analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). SERCA1 was digested following previous reports (21Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Danko S.

They were 0.4 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (E1·2Ca2+); 3.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm AMPPCP (E1·2Ca2+·AMPPCP); 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm AlCl3, 2 mm potassium fluoride, and 1 mm ADP (E1·2Ca2+·AlFx·ADP); 1 mm EGTA (E2), or 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm AlCl3, and 2 mm potassium fluoride (E2·AlFx). Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were reacted with these ligands by incubation at 25 °C for 1 h and digestion was initiated by adding proteases. Two mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride was used to terminate proteinase K digestion. All other manipulations were identical to those with CopA. Mass Spectrometry—Intact CopA and its fragments obtained by papain digestion were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in a Protein Biology System IIc (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). Samples (0.45 mg/ml protein, 0.5 μl) were applied directly onto each H50 (hydrophobic surface) Protein-Chip array spot and dried for 30 min at room temperature. Surfaces on the spot were washed twice with 5 μl of H2O and dried. One μl of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was then added on each spot and allowed to air-dry. Mass spectra were collected with 120 laser shots of each spot. Miscellaneous Methods—Genomic DNA was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of CopA—CopA from T. maritima, a hyper-thermophile, with hexahistidine tag attached to the N terminus was overexpressed in E. coli. To isolate the protein, the microsomal fraction was incubated at 75 °C followed by solubilization with DM. These treatments had no appreciable effect on Cu+-ATPase activity. Treatment with n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, C12E8, or N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide inactivated CopA. DM and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside solubilized the ATPase at >90% and kept the ATPase activity unchanged for more than a week at 4 °C. The enzyme was subsequently purified by Co2+-affinity column chromatography, typically at >90% purity (supplemental Fig. S2). Cu+/Ag+-ATPase Activity—Cu+/Ag+-ATPase activity of purified CopA was first measured with various concentrations of cysteine present, because ATPase activities of PIB-ATPases are stimulated by thiolates (31Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 32Mitra B. Sharma R.

Acta. 2007; 1768: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of CopA showed strong dependence on cysteine concentration with a maximum activity at 10 mm (Cu+-ATPase) or 5 mm (Ag+-ATPase) independent of the metal ion concentration (Fig. 1A). Cysteine of a higher concentration impaired the activities. The dependence of ATPase activity on metal ion concentration was therefore examined in the presence of 10 (Cu+) or 5 mm (Ag+) cysteine. Cu+-independent ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 0.5 mm BCS, a chelator of Cu+, and found to be 0.06–0.08 μmol min–1 mg–1. This number corresponds to about a half of the activity when no heavy metal is included (filled circles in Fig. 1A). It was always subtracted to obtain the Cu+-dependent ATPase activity. Ag+-ATPase activity was examined in the presence of 0.5 mm BCS to eliminate the effects of contaminating copper ions. Cu+ dependence of Cu+-ATPase activity was well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation (Km = 3.1 μm; Vmax = 1.9 μmol min–1 mg–1) in the presence of 10 mm cysteine at 60 °C. This Vmax value corresponds to a turnover rate of 2.6 s–1, which is similar to that reported for A. fulgidus (2.0 s–1; Ref. 35Rice W.J. Kovalishin A. Stokes D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the absence of cysteine, the maximum activity of 0.81 μmol min–1 mg–1 was found at 3 μm CuCl2; at higher concentrations, Cu+-ATPase activity was reduced (Fig. 1B). CopA also showed Ag+-dependent ATPase activity with Km and Vmax of 2.1 μm, 0.90 μmol min–1 mg–1 (5 mm cysteine) and 0.4 μm, 0.38 μmol min–1 mg–1 (without cysteine), respectively. Higher concentrations of Ag+ did not inactivate the ATPase activity even in the absence of cysteine (Fig. 1C). Cu+-ATPase activity of CopA reached the maximum at 60 °C and was 4.4% of the maximum at 30 °C (Fig. 3D). Data at various temperatures from 30 to 60 °C fell on a straight line in the Arrhenius plot (EA = 21.3 kcal K–1 mol–1; inset in Fig. 1D), indicating that the ATP hydrolysis at 30 °C is the same reaction as that at 60 °C. Kinetic properties of the ATPase activity of CopA expressed and purified without His tag were the same, although the purity of the preparation was somewhat inferior (data not shown). Formation of Stable Fluoroaluminate Complexes of CopA—A key to characterize an enzyme is to find a way to stabilize it in intermediate states. With the members of haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, including P-type ATPases, AlFx is one of the most useful phosphate analogs (36Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In fact, AlFx can fix SERCA1 in states analogous to E1 ∼ P and E2 ∼ P and abolish ATPase activity (37Troullier A. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined Cu+-ATPase activity of CopA to see if AlFx treatment produces a stable complex. As shown in Table 1, the ATPase activity was almost completely suppressed by incubating CopA (1 mg/ml or 6.33 μm) for 1 h in a solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm AlCl3, 2 mm potassium fluoride in the presence of either 20 μm Cu+, 1 mm ADP, and 20 μm Cu+, or 0.5 mm BCS. Under these conditions, CopA is expected to form E1·Cu+·AlFx, E1·Cu+·AlFx·ADP, and E2·AlFx complexes, respectively, which mimic the E1 ∼ P, E1 ∼ P·ADP, and E2 ∼ P states. When Mg2+ is omitted in forming the E1·Cu+·AlFx·ADP complex, ATPase activity decreased only slightly (∼15%), suggesting that the formation of the stable enzyme·AlFx complex requires Mg2+. Cu+-independent ATPase activity was not affected by AlFx treatment.TABLE 1Effects of AlFx on Cu+-ATPase activity of CopAConditionsCu+-ATPase activityaUntreated CopA has an ATPase activity of 1.88 μmol min-1 mg-1.Rate constantbFirst-order kinetics was assumed.InhibitioncInhibition by AlFx treatment.RestorationdRestoration by dilution of ×20 with the assay medium containing no AlFx.%of untreated CopAmin-120 μm Cu+, 0.1 mm AlFx, 1 mm MgCl240.220.0220 μm Cu+, 1 mm ADP, 0.1 mm AlFx, 1 mm MgCl230.190.020.5 mm BCS, 0.1 mm AlFx, 1 mm MgCl250.160.0220 μm Cu+, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm MgCl210020 μm Cu+, 1 mm ADP, 0.1 mm AlFx84a Untreated CopA has an ATPase activity of 1.88 μmol min-1 mg-1.b First-order kinetics was assumed.c Inhibition by AlFx treatment.d Restoration by dilution of ×20 with the assay medium containing no AlFx. Open table in a new tab The time course of inhibition by AlFx treatment was measured to estimate the proportion of the complexed ATPase AlFx at any given time. The decay of Cu+-ATPase activity fitted well to firstorder kinetics with the rate constants listed in Table 1 (“inhibition”). According to these parameters, for example, more than 99.9% of CopA is expected to form the E2·AlFx complex in 1 h. ATPase activity was examined by measuring the amount of liberated phosphate. This requires dilution of the aliquot (usually 20 times) and some reaction time in a buffer devoid of ligands. A problem could arise if the ligands dissociate during the reaction time. In fact, AlFx-treated CopA transferred into the ATPase assay medium gradually regained Cu+-ATPase activity with the rate constants listed in Table 1 (“restoration”). A reaction time of 5 min appeared to be appropriate, as 92% of ATPases would remain complexed and inactive at 5 min after dilution. The Cu+-ATPase activity listed in Table 1 represents, therefore, an average over the reaction time of 5 min. Proteolysis of SERCA1 Using Papain—To examine if papain digestion is useful for monitoring domain movements in P-type ATPases, we subjected SERCA1 to papain digestion in five different states, namely, E2, E1·2Ca2+, E1·2Ca2+·AMPPCP, E1·2Ca2+·AlFx·ADP, and E2·AlFx. Proteinase K digestion was also carried out for comparison. The digestion patterns and the rate constants of degradation of the 110-kDa polypeptide (i.e. native enzyme) with proteinase K were identical to those previously reported (20Juul B. Turc H.

https://openalex.org/W2050608574,"Although human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the primary cause of cervical cancer, the molecular mechanism by which HPV induces cervical cancer remains largely unclear. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis with mass spectrometry to study protein expression profiling between HPV16-positive cervical mucosa epithelial H8 cells and cervical cancer Caski cells to identify 18 differentially expressed proteins. Among them, retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (RbAp48) was selected, and its differentiation expression was verified with both additional cervical cancer-derived cell lines and human tissues of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. Suppression of RbAp48 using small interfering RNA approach in H8 cells significantly stimulated cell proliferation and colony formation and inhibited senescence-like phenotype. Remarkably, H8 cells acquired transforming activity if RpAp48 was suppressed, because H8 cells stably transfected with RbAp48 small interfering RNA led to tumor formation in nude mice. In addition, overexpression of RbAp48 significantly inhibited cell growth and tumor formation. This RbAp48-mediated transformation of HPV16 is probably because of the regulation by RbAp48 of tumor suppressors retinoblastoma and p53, apoptosis-related enzymes caspase-3 and caspase-8, and oncogenic genes, including E6, E7, cyclin D1 (CCND1), and c-MYC. In brief, RbAp48, previously unknown in cervical carcinogenesis, was isolated in a global screen and identified as a critical mediator controlling the transforming activity of HPV16 in cervical cancer."

Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), but several details are still controversial. The Q-cycle involves separate catalytic sites on opposite sides of the membrane for oxidation of QH2 and reduction of ubiquinone (Q, quinone). The work function is provided by a bifurcation of electron transfer at the quinol-oxidizing site (the Qo-site). The first electron is transferred to a high potential chain (the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, cytochrome c1, and cytochrome c), and the second to a low potential chain, consisting of heme bL and heme bH in cytochrome b, which delivers electrons to the quinone reduction site (Qi-site). Some of the work from the first electron transfer is stored in the strong reducing potential of an unstable semiquinone intermediate formed at the Qo-site. This provides the driving force for reduction of Q, or of ubisemiquinone (SQ), in the Qi-site, and for generation of the proton gradient. Controversial aspects of the Qo-site mechanism (10Mulkidjanian A.Y. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2007; 6: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Crofts A.R. Lhee S. Crofts S.B. Cheng J.

At the Qi-site, Q is thought to be reduced to QH2 in two sequential one-electron reactions, with a sequence that depends on the initial occupancy. With the pool initially oxidized (Eh,7 ∼ 200 mV) the quinone is reduced to SQ, which is then the acceptor for the second electron reaching the site after a subsequent turnover of the Qo-site. The SQ can also be formed as a stable intermediate on redox titration (12Robertson D. Prince R. Bowyer J. Matsuura K. Dutton P. Ohnishi T. J. Biol.

For the Qi-site, a natural quinone substrate has been modeled as the occupant in “native” structures and is presumed to be the oxidized (Q) form. However, the reaction cycle involves all three forms, Q, SQ, and QH2, and an understanding of the mechanism requires identification of ligands for each. The structures suggest three potential side chains as ligands, His-201, Asp-228, and Ser-205 (in bovine numbering). Unfortunately, several different configurations have been observed in crystallographic structures, involving direct H-bonds and H-bonds mediated through H2O molecules, in several different combinations (17Kolling D.R.J.

More recently, applications of pulsed EPR have allowed a more detailed analysis of structure local to the SQ (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A. Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol.

We have shown using X-band ESEEM that the SQ at the Qi-site of the bc1 complex of R. sphaeroides interacts with a nitrogen atom identified as the Nϵ or Nδ of a histidine side chain. This assignment could only be based on an estimate of the quadrupole coupling constant for the interacting 14N, because the X-band ESEEM spectra failed to provide the complete nuclear quadrupole tensor. In the structures from Berry and co-workers (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A. Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a histidine serves as an H-bond donor through the Nϵ atom to one of the quinone carbonyls, leading us to suggest that the histidine identified in the R. sphaeroides enzyme by EPR is most probably His-217, equivalent to His-201 in the bovine mitochondrial complex. The nitrogen assigned to His-217 possesses unpaired electron spin density, which implies the existence of an atomic bridge through the H-bond for the transfer of spin density from the SQ to this protein nitrogen. We did not detect in the X-band 14N ESEEM spectra any major contributions with comparable unpaired spin density from other nitrogens in the SQ environment (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I.

We have also identified three exchangeable protons likely involved in H-bonds to the SQ, which were visualized by substitution of 1H2O by 2H2O. Two of these showed large anisotropic hyperfine couplings consistent with out-of-plane H-bonds to carbonyl O atoms of the SQ. The third proton showed lower hyperfine coupling, which we considered to be compatible with either an involvement of Asn-221 (which is the R. sphaeroides equivalent to Ser-205) in an H-bond with a methoxy O atom (see model in Fig. 1) or an H-bond to H2O (32Dikanov S.A.

Powder-type ESEEM spectra of native proteins in frozen solution are limited in their information content because of the nuclear quadrupole interactions (nqi) of 14N magnetically coupled with the SQs, which has a nuclear spin, I = 1 (33Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The nqi require special relationships between the nuclear Zeeman frequency and isotropic hyperfine constant for optimal resolution of the peaks from well defined transitions. These requirements limit interpretation because of the following two effects: (i) only partial information about hyperfine and quadrupole tensors of those 14N nuclei that generate resolved lines can be obtained, and (ii) contributions from anisotropic weakly coupled nuclei may be completely suppressed. These uncertainties can, in principle, be overcome through experiments at different microwave frequencies (leading to proportional variations of nuclear Zeeman frequency), or by using proteins labeled isotopically with 15N, which possesses I = ½. Here we report the first studies of the SQ at the Qi-site of the bc1 complex, using 14N S-band ESEEM with the native protein, and two-dimensional X-band ESEEM with the complex uniformly labeled with 15N atoms, with the specific aim of characterizing the interaction of the semiquinone with nitrogen atoms in the protein environment in greater detail. Preparation of Isolated bc1 Complex—The bc1 complex was isolated from chromatophores prepared from R. sphaeroides strain GBH6 and purified following protocols described previously (17Kolling D.R.J.

The concentration of chromatophores was adjusted to give an absorbance of ΔA562-577 nm = 1.2, and solubilization was performed for 1 h. Unless otherwise indicated, the bc1 complex was used without added cryoprotectants, because Me2SO or glycerol decreased the amplitude of the Qi-site semiquinone signal. Protein isotopically labeled with 15N was prepared from R. sphaeroides grown in Sistrom media as described previously (36Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B.

Construction of Mutations at Asn-221—Conventional PCR-based protocols proved troublesome with the segment of DNA encoding the Asn-221 because of a very high GC ratio. A modification of the three-stage protocol previously developed (35Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16280-16288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used. Forward and reverse primers, which flanked the entire region, were used in conjunction with complementary mutagenic primers in two steps, PCR1 and PCR2, to generate intermediate sequences of similar length that overlapped and were complementary in the region of interest. These were then extended by a third step in which they acted both as primers and templates, and the product of this reaction was further amplified by a fourth step, PCR3. The flanking regions contained restriction sites previously engineered in the plasmid, through which the product could be clipped out and reincorporated into the mutagenic plasmid. A detailed protocol will be provided in the context of a more extensive paper dealing with the properties of these strains. Generation of Semiquinone at the Qi-site—Protocols used to generate semiquinone were as described previously (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A. Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol.

In the experiments shown, the samples were reduced by ascorbate, and the concentrations of the bc1 complex (monomer) in samples used for EPR were in the range 300-500 μm. Kinetic Measurements of Cytochrome Changes—Changes in concentration of heme bH were measured in a single beam kinetic spectrophotometer designed and constructed in-house, as described previously (7Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), but with updated electronics interface and software. Experimental details are included in the figure legends. X-band EPR Measurements—The EPR and ESEEM experiments were carried out using an X-band Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer with an Oxford CF 935 cryostat. Several types of ESEEM experiments with different pulse sequences were employed, with appropriate phase cycling schemes to eliminate unwanted features from experimental echo envelopes. Among them are two-, three-, and four-pulse sequences. In the two-pulse field-sweep experiment (π/2-τ-π-τ-echo), the intensity of the echo signal at fixed interval, τ, between two microwave pulses with spin vector rotation angles π/2 and π is measured as a function of magnetic field. In the one-dimensional three-pulse experiment (π/2-τ-π/2-T-π/2-τ-echo), the intensity of the stimulated echo signal after the third pulse is recorded as a function of time, T, at constant time, τ. The Fourier transformation of this echo envelope gives the ESEEM spectrum with the frequency ordinate ν (as shown in Fig. 2). In the two-dimensional four-pulse experiment (π/2-τ-π/2-t1-π-t2-π/2-τ-echo, also called HYSCORE), the intensity of the stimulated echo after the fourth pulse was measured with t2 and t1 varied and τ constant. Such a two-dimensional set of echo envelopes gives, after Fourier transformation, a spectrum with two frequency coordinates ν1 and ν2 (as in Fig. 3). The spectrum shows correlations between nuclear frequencies from two manifolds with opposite electron spin projections belonging to the same nucleus, with equal resolution in each frequency coordinate. The data are usually presented as contour plots to show the peak positions in the spectra arising from different nuclear spin interactions. S-band ESEEM—The S-band EPR experiments were performed on a home-built pulsed S-band EPR spectrometer (38Weber A. Rohrer M. Törring J.T. Prisner T.F. Ziessow D. Lubitz W. Lendzian F. Proceedings of the 29th Congress AMPERE/13th ISMAR, August 2-7, 1998. 2. 1998: 1138Google Scholar). The experiment was controlled with Xepr software via an ELEXSYS console, including SpecJet and PatternJet (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany.) The probe was an ER 4118CF liquid helium flow cryostat with a Flexline (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) cavity holder and a home-built bridged-loop-gap resonator. The frequency of the microwave source was ∼3.4 GHz, which corresponds to the resonance field ∼129 mT for paramagnetic species with g-factor ∼2. Spectral processing of one-dimensional and two-dimensional ESEEM patterns was performed using WIN-EPR software (Bruker). The Tensor of Nuclear Quadrupole Interaction—Nuclei with spin I > ½ possess a nonspherical charge distribution characterized by a nuclear quadrupole moment, Q. The tensor of nqi is a traceless tensor describing the interaction of a nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric field gradient of the surrounding electrons. Its matrix elements (Equation 1) are defined as in Ref. 70Slichter C.P. Principles of Magnetic Resonance.3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1990: 485-502Google Scholar, Qij=eQVij/(2I(2I−1)h)(Eq. 1) where Vij are the components of the electric field gradient tensor, e, the electron charge, and i,j = x,y,z. For the 14N nucleus with the nuclear spin I = 1 (Equation 2). Qij=eQVij/2h(Eq. 2) To fully describe the nqi tensor in a principal axes system one needs only two parameters called the quadrupole coupling constant (Equation 3), K=e2qQ/4h(Eq. 3) and the asymmetry parameter shown in Equation 4, η=(Vxx−Vyy)/Vzz(Eq. 4) with |Vzz| ≥ |Vyy| ≥ |Vxx|, and Vzz = eq. The q is defined as the electric field gradient in the same units as e, and h is Plank's constant. The value of η lies between 0 and 1, and in the case of axial symmetry one obtains |Vxx| = |Vyy| and η = 0. With these definitions the principal values of the nqi tensor (in frequency units) are equal to that shown in Equation 5, Qzz=2K, Qyy=−K(1−η), Qxx=−K(1=η)(Eq. 5) The distribution of the electrons depended on the configuration of the bonds around the nitrogen and its occupancy, i.e. it is determined by the type of the chemical group containing the nitrogen. Therefore, the nqi tensors of the 14N atoms in the different chemical groups are strictly individual and can therefore be used for identification and characterization of the nitrogen. In this study the nqi tensor of the nitrogen involved in the interaction with the SQ was derived using S-band ESEEM. Factors Influencing 14N Powder ESEEM Spectra—The 14N nucleus interacting with an unpaired electron spin S = ½ can produce up to six lines in an ESEEM spectrum. These lines are from transitions between three nuclear energy sublevels in each of the two electron spin manifolds with mS = +½ or -½. Because of the different dependence on orientation, not all transitions contribute equally to the spectra in ESEEM measurements of amorphous samples (as in the case of the frozen suspensions of the bc1 complex used in these experiments). The ESEEM spectrum expected from 14N with predominantly isotropic hyperfine coupling A is governed by the ratio between the effective nuclear frequency in each mani-fold, νef±, given by νef± = |νI ± A/2|, and the quadrupole coupling constant, K (33Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). If νef±/K ∼ 0, i.e. νef± ≅ 0 (the situation is called a cancellation condition, because νI ≅ A/2) then the three nuclear frequencies from a corresponding manifold will be close to three pure nuclear quadrupole resonance frequencies of 14N transitions between the energy levels defined by the principal values of the nqi tensor in Equation 5 (Equation 6). ν+=K(3+η) ν−=K(3−η) ν0=2Kη(Eq. 6) In this case, three narrow peaks at the frequencies shown in Equation 6 will be present in the powder ESEEM spectra. These frequencies possess the property ν+ = ν- + ν0 and can appear in spectra up to a ratio of νef±/K ∼ 0.75-1. If νef±/K > 1, only a single line without pronounced orientation dependence from each corresponding manifold is expected. This line is produced by a transition at the maximum frequency, which is actually a double-quantum transition between the two nuclear outer states with mI =-1 and 1. The frequency of this transition is well described by Equation 7 (33Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Y.D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), νdq±=2(νef±2+κ)1/2(Eq. 7) where κ = K2(3 + η2). Two other single-quantum transitions, involving the central level with mI = 0, usually do not show any resolved peaks because of significant orientation dependence from quadrupole interaction. 14N ESEEM—The SQ in frozen solution of native (with the 99.63% of 14N natural abundance) and 15N-labeled bc1 complex has the same line width ∼0.8-0.85 mT in X-band continuous wave EPR and in field sweep ESE spectra. This is because the primary contribution to the line shape is given by g-tensor anisotropy, which largely masks the influence of 14N/15N substitution at weakly coupled nitrogen nuclei. Fig. 2 shows the 14N X-band three-pulse ESEEM spectrum of the SQ in the Qi-site of the native bc1 complex reported and analyzed in detail in our previous work (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I.

This spectrum exhibits two lines at frequencies 1.7 and 3.1 MHz. These two frequencies produce cross-peaks in two-dimensional ESEEM spectra and thus belong to opposite electron spin manifolds of a 14N nucleus. They were assigned to double-quantum transitions νdq± from two manifolds (see Equation 7). Formal application of Equation 7 to the observed frequencies using νI = 1.06 MHz, corresponding to an external magnetic field 345 mT, gives A = 0.8 MHz and κ = 0.43 MHz2. Assuming that 0 ≤ η ≤ 1, these lead to K = 0.35 ± 0.3 MHz, and give νef±/K ratios ∼ 4.2 and 1.9 (i.e. >1), respectively, providing support for the assignment of both frequencies to a single 14N, and for the analytic procedure used. The estimate of K with an accuracy of ∼20% allows its assignment to the protonated nitrogen of an imidazole residue (17Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A. Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, for a complete description of the nqi tensor, and its unambiguous assignment, direct determination of both quadrupole parameters, K and η, would be desirable. These values could be determined directly from ESEEM experiments satisfying the cancellation condition νef ≈ 0 at one of the manifolds. For hyperfine coupling A = 0.8 MHz, the cancellation condition is reached at 14N Zeeman frequency νI ∼ 0.4 MHz, but this requires an experiment at S-band, with microwave frequency ∼3 GHz. Fig. 2 also shows the S-band three-pulse ESEEM spectrum of the SQ in the bc1 complex obtained at magnetic field 121.9 mT, corresponding to νI = 0.375 MHz. The spectrum contains three intense narrow peaks at 1.14, 1.03, and 0.09 MHz, and a broader line of lower intensity at 1.95 MHz. This spectrum has a shape typical of spectra recorded near cancellation conditions and allows for an immediate assignment of the narrow peaks to three nqi frequencies (see Equation 6) from the manifold with νef- ≈ 0 and of the 1.9 MHz line to a double-quantum transition from the opposite manifold. Application of Equations 6 and 7 gives the following values: K = 0.36 MHz, η = 0.17, and A = 0.75 MHz, which are consistent with the previous assignment of the nitrogen observed to the imine or amine nitrogen of the imidazole ring from a His residue. The values allow us to perform a more complete"

Recently we have described a FRET-based method to directly monitor activation of Gi-proteins in living cells (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). For the α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) this approach has proved useful to differentiate among the agonists, antagonists, inverse and partial agonists of different chemical structures (2Nikolaev V.O.

This method revealed that partial agonists switch α2A-AR into multiple conformational states, thereby inducing Gi-protein responses of distinct efficacies and kinetics (2Nikolaev V.O. Hoffmann C.

However, this method has not been used to analyze pharmacological properties of the ligands of other Gi-coupled receptors. Here, we perform an extensive validation of this FRET-based approach and analyze a series of newly discovered endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) ligands.Morphine plays an important role in the therapy of acute and chronic pain. Exogenously delivered morphine acts in the body by activating different subtypes of opioid receptors, including μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors (5Corbett A.D. Henderson G. McKnight A.T. Paterson S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S153-S162Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Jordan B. Devi L.A. Br. J. Anaesth. 1998; 81: 12-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Most pharmacological effects of morphine appear to be mediated via MOR present on cells of neuronal and immune systems. These receptors are classical seven-transmembrane proteins that couple to the Gi class of heterotrimeric G-proteins, activating a signaling cascades, which is responsible for the antinociceptive effects of morphine (7Mansour A. Watson S.J. Akil H. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 69-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Over the last decades, suggestions have accumulated that morphine present in mammalian tissues and fluids comes not only from an exogenous or dietary origin, but may also be biosynthesized de novo. Recent studies have unequivocally proven the existence of a mammalian morphine biosynthetic pathway, which consists of at least 19 steps and is different in its early steps from that occurring in plants (8Boettcher C. Fellermeier M. Boettcher C. Drager B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8495-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Poeaknapo C. Schmidt J. Brandsch M. Drager B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14091-14096Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous morphine biosynthesis takes place in mammals, their cells and tissues are constantly exposed to certain amounts of morphine and its precursors (10Zhu W. Ma Y. Cadet P. Yu D. Bilfinger T.V. Bianchi E. Stefano G.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 117: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Kodaira H. Lisek C.A. Jardine I. Arimura A. Spector S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).However, only a few reports describe pharmacological properties of the individual intermediates of the morphine biosynthetic route. Both (R)- and (S)-reticulines, for instance, have been shown to exhibit hypotensive (12Dias K.L. Da Silva Dias C. Barbosa-Filho J.M. Almeida R.N. De Azevedo Correia N. Medeiros I.A. Planta Med. 2004; 70: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), antiaggregant (13Chen J.J. Chang Y.L. Teng C.M. Chen I.S.

Ethnopharmacol. 1998; 62: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) effects. Salutaridine has only been characterized as a partial agonist at γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptors (15Kardos J. Blasko G. Simonyi M. Szantay C. Arzneimittelforschung. 1984; 34: 1758-1759PubMed Google Scholar), whereas natural (-) thebaine is poorly antinociceptive in mice (16Aceto M.D. Harris L.S. Abood M.E. Rice K.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, oripavine and codeinone have almost similar analgesic potential as morphine and cause a withdrawal syndrome, which can be suppressed by morphine and vice versa (17Aceto M.D. Bowman E.R. Harris L.S. May E.L. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1989; 95: 578-631PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yeh S.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1981; 254: 223-240PubMed Google Scholar). Morphinone has been described as a toxic morphine metabolite and a MOR agonist (19Fang S. Takemori A.E. Portoghese P.S. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the action of morphine precursors via MOR might be expected, no investigations have compared their pharmacological properties in one experimental system to answer the question, whether and to which extent these endogenously occurring compounds can activate MOR and its cognate Gi-proteins.Here, we apply Gi-FRET technique to monitor activation of MOR in single intact cells and compare pharmacological effects of the key intermediates of the mammalian morphine biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrate that several close morphine precursors, late in the biosynthetic pathway can activate MOR in living cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubstances—Codeine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), morphine (Merck), (R,S)-norlaudanosoline (Sigma), thebaine (Sanofi Synthelabo, Paris, France), and all opioid peptides (Sigma) are commercially available.

Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm naltrexone or unlabeled naloxone. The reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through GF/F glass fiber filters (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany).35S-GTPγS Binding—The assays were performed essentially as described by Traynor and Nahorski (21Traynor J.R. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 848-854PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of membrane protein in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3 μm guanosine diphosphate and 100 pm 35S-GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were incubated with different concentrations of morphine or Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-N-Methyl-Phe-Gly-ol (DAMGO). After 1-h incubation at 30 °C the samples were rapidly filtered through GF/F.FRET Measurements of Gi-Protein Activation—Coverslips with adherent cells were washed once, maintained in a physiological buffer A (containing 144 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) at room temperature, and placed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with 100× oil immersion objective, Polychrome IV light source, beam splitter dichroic long path 505 nm, photometric detection system (Till Photonics, Gaefelfing, Germany), and analog to digital converter (Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments). FRET was monitored as the emission ratio FYFP/FCFP upon 436 nm excitation (filters YFP 535 ± 15 nm, CFP 480 ± 20 nm). For each measurement, emission values were corrected for bleedthrough, direct YFP excitation, and photobleaching as described (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 22Vilardaga J.P. Bunemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nature Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).The expression ratio of G-protein subunits was systematically monitored by comparing YFP (α-subunits) and CFP (βγ-subunits) emissions and kept similar in all experiments. Based on single cell fluorescence, Gα-YFP expression was typically limiting for the heterotrimer formation and less than 2 pmol/mg membrane protein. To study agonist-dependent changes in FRET, single cells were continuously superfused with buffer A alone or containing different substances using a computer-assisted solenoid valve-controlled rapid superfusion device (ALA-VM8; ALA Scientific Instruments). Data sampling and analysis were performed using a personal computer software Clampex 8.1 (Axon Instruments), Origin 6.1 (Microcal), and Prism 4.0 (GraphPad).RESULTSReal-time Monitoring of MOR-induced G-protein Activation—To study the pharmacological effects of different ligands at MOR, we decided to develop a real-time monitoring system to measure MOR-mediated Gi-protein activation. To do so, we monitored FRET between fluorescently labeled subunits of heterotrimeric Gi-proteins (Fig. 1A). The αi1-subunit was labeled with YFP in position 91/92, whereas the γ2-subunit of a β1γ2-complex was C-terminally labeled with CFP (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In intact living HEK293 cells expressing human MOR, addition of micromolar morphine concentrations resulted in a fast decrease of FRET with a half-life of ∼1.4 s (Fig. 1B) comparable with the kinetic rates measured for Gi-activation by α2A-AR (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 2Nikolaev V.O. Hoffmann C. Bunemann M. Lohse M.J. Vilardaga J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The decrease in FRET between CFP and YFP fused to Gγ2 and Gαi1 subunits of the trimeric G-protein complex was reversible upon withdrawal of morphine (Fig. 1B), reflecting ligand-dependent conformational rearrangements in the G-protein heterotrimeric complex (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4Frank M. Thumer L. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).To confirm the specificity of the FRET signal for MOR activation, we performed three different experiments. First, we stimulated HEK293a cells not transfected with MOR with morphine or its precursors and were not able to see any signal (data not shown). Next, we treated morphine-stimulated MOR-expressing cells with a specific receptor antagonist naloxone, which completely blocked the effect of morphine, whereas naloxone given alone did not produce any change in FRET (Fig. 1C). Finally, treatment of MOR-expressing cells with non-opioid ligands such as clonidine or norepinephrine did not affect the FRET signal (supplemental Fig. 1A). We further analyzed the kinetics of the onset and offset of morphine-induced FRET signals and found that MOR inhibition with naloxone led to a much faster inactivation of G-proteins than monitored upon washout of morphine (Fig. 1D). To test, whether our experimental system can distinguish the effects of partial agonists, we used a well known MOR partial agonist buprenorphine, which could partially block the effect of morphine on Gi-protein activation and showed ∼50% change in FRET as compared with morphine (Fig. 1E).Validation of the FRET Method for MOR-induced G-protein Activation—Next, we sought to validate our FRET-based approach by testing how accurately it can report G-protein activation. For this, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the FRET results with the data obtained from a classical [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Both methods were used to measure concentration-response dependencies for the full MOR agonist DAMGO and the strong partial agonist morphine (Fig. 2A). The two experimental approaches yielded curves with almost identical EC50 values, which were in good agreement with previously reported values for MOR (20Thompson C.M. Wojno H. Greiner E. May E.L. Rice K.C. Selley D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Lee K.O. Akil H. Woods J.H. Traynor J.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 378: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have previously demonstrated that concentration-response curves for α2A-AR-mediated G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channel activation were superimposable with measurements of Gi-protein activation by FRET (1Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Validation of the FRET approach for measuring pharmacological properties of MOR ligands. A, concentration-response dependencies of the FRET signal measured in cells stimulated with full agonist DAMGO and strong partial agonist morphine were compared side-by-side with the data from [35S]-GTPγS binding assays for these ligands. Data from at least three to four independent experiments are shown (mean ± S.E.). EC50 values for FRET measurements were 6.4 ± 0.8 nm for morphine and 1.0 ± 0.2 nm for DAMGO; for [35S]-GTPγS binding assays -7.0 ± 0.2 nm and 1.0 ± 0.2 nm, respectively. B–E, effects of major opioid peptides on the Gi-FRET. 10 μm morphine and the peptides in following saturating concentrations were used: 100 nm DAMGO (B); 100 nm Met-enkephalin (Met-Enkeph.) (C); 100 nm α-endorphin (α-Endorph.) (D); and 10 μm β-endorphin (β-Endorph.) (E). Representative traces of at least four experiments are shown. F, kinetics of the FRET signal produced by 1 μm β-endorphin (β-Endorph.) with subsequent washout of the peptide (wash) or wash-in of 10 μm naloxone (β-End + Nal). t0.5 values are presented in G as mean ± S.E. (n = 4-7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our FRET approach has also allowed to distinguish between full agonists and partial agonists at MOR. Morphine as a partial agonist produced significantly smaller effects than the full synthetic agonist DAMGO (Fig. 2, A and B). In line with this observation, naturally occurring opioid peptides such as Met-enkephalin and α-endorphin also stimulated the Gi-protein activity to a higher extent than morphine (Fig. 2, C and D). Among the endogenous opioid peptides, only β-endorphin at high concentration demonstrated about the same amplitude as morphine (Fig. 2E). The extent of MOR activation by natural opioid peptides was very similar to the biochemical data from GTPγS binding assays reported previously (25Saidak Z. Blake-Palmer K. Hay D.L. Northup J.K. Glass M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Washout of these opioid peptides did not rapidly deactivate G-proteins consistent with their high affinity for the receptors. We analyzed the kinetics of G-protein inactivation after β-endorphin treatment upon washout of the peptide and receptor inhibition by naloxone (Fig. 2, F and G). Interestingly, the FRET signals showed very slow offset kinetics even upon naloxone treatment, suggesting a high affinity of β-endorphin at MOR. Taken together, the FRET measurements performed with morphine and opioid peptides and side-by-side comparison with [35S]GTPγS data confirmed that our FRET-based approach represented a highly sensitive and specific method to monitor the ligand-induced MOR activation in living cells and could be used to analyze the pharmacological properties of different full and partial agonists at the receptor.Analysis of Morphine Precursors and Their Efficacy at MOR—Using Gi-protein activation as a measure of ligand efficacy at the receptor level we studied pharmacological effects of several intermediates of the mammalian morphine biosynthetic pathway. Starting from the very early precursors of morphine such as norlaudanosoline (tetrahydropapaveroline) and reticulines, we first stimulated the cells with saturating concentrations of a precursor (10 or 100 μm) and subsequently applied 10 μm morphine to determine the efficacy of different compounds at MOR signal (Fig. 3). (R,S)-Norlaudanosoline and (S)-reticuline at concentrations up to 100 μm did not produce any significant activation of Gi-proteins. In contrast, (R)-reticuline, a precursor with a (R)-configuration of the C-1 atom, typical for morphine and other morphinans (C-9 in morphine), demonstrated already a small FRET signal with amplitude of ∼16% of the maximal morphine response. Closure of the C-12–C-13 chemical bond in salutaridine dramatically increased the ability to activate MOR signaling (∼54% of morphine).FIGURE 3Different morphine precursors activate Gi-proteins with distinct efficacies. Representative FRET-ratio traces (n = 3–6) for each substance are shown together with its chemical structure and position in the biosynthetic pathway (indicated by arrows). HEK293a cells expressing human MOR and fluorescently tagged Gi-subunits were first stimulated with saturating concentrations of a precursor (for norlaudanosoline, reticulines, salutaridine, salutaridinol, thebaine, and codeine 100 μm were used; oripavine, codeinone, and morphinone were applied at 10 μm) and subsequently with 10 μm morphine to determine a relative efficacy for each compound. The changes in FRET reflecting MOR-dependent Gi-protein activation (ΔFYFP/FCFP) are normalized to the maximal response induced by morphine. Relative efficacies for all compounds are summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Salutaridinol, an intermediate in the two-step enzymatic conversion of salutaridine to thebaine, had a lower efficacy than salutaridine, which was close to that of (R)-reticuline, suggesting that the presence of a hydroxyl at the C-7 position of salutaridinol (not typical for other morphinans) reduced the ability to activate the receptor. In line with this observation, 7-episalutaridinol, which does not participate in mammalian morphine biosynthesis (8Boettcher C. Fellermeier M. Boettcher C. Drager B. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8495-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), did not cause any FRET signal (supplemental Fig. 1B). Another morphine precursor thebaine, which stood in the biosynthetic pathway after salutaridinol, had a higher partial agonist efficacy demonstrating over 70% of Gi-protein activation (Fig. 3).All further morphine precursors (codeinone, oripavine, and morphinone) except for codeine, which had significantly weaker partial agonistic properties, were as efficacious in terms of FRET signal amplitude as morphine. In contrast to opioid peptides, the signals of all individual morphinans were reversible upon the washout. However, addition of morphine on top of codeinone, oripavine, and morphinone did not produce any further increase in FRET, suggesting that these compounds activate the receptors as much as morphine (Fig. 3). The efficacies of the different compounds measured with the FRET assay are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Binding properties, relative efficacies, and potencies of morphine biosynthetic precursors at μ-opioid receptor (MOR) Amplitudes of the FRET signal for each substance at saturating concentrations (10 μm for morphinone, oripavine, and codeinone; 100 μm for other compounds) are presented as a percent of the maximal response produced by 10 μm morphine (Emax).

Analysis of the EC50 values, i.e. the concentrations at which a half-maximal activation of Gi was achieved, for each individual substance revealed that the potencies of the compounds were inversely proportional to the amplitude of the FRET signal (Fig. 4, Table 1). For two distant morphine precursors, (R)-reticuline and salutaridinol, concentration-response dependencies could not be measured because of their small signals. Other morphinans, which activated MOR less than morphine, had potencies in the following order: thebaine ≅ codeine > salutaridine. Codeine, a much less potent partial agonist than morphine, demonstrated almost 1000-fold higher EC50 values, suggesting that extremely high concentrations of this alkaloid were necessary to achieve an effect comparable with that of morphine (Fig. 4, Table 1).FIGURE 4Comparison of relative efficacies and potencies of major morphine biosynthetic precursors. Concentration-response dependencies for morphine and its precursors were derived from Gi-FRET experiments. The changes in FYFP/FCFP ratio were measured at different concentrations of morphine and precursors and normalized to the maximal signal evoked by 10 μm morphine. The data are from 4–6 independent experiments, mean ± S.D. EC50 values are presented in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The analysis of the EC50 values for strong partial agonists having the same amplitude as morphine was intriguing to compare their activating potential for MOR signaling systems. Both oripavine and codeinone, intermediates of two parallel branches of the biosynthetic conversion of thebaine to morphine in mammals, had high nanomolar EC50 values (200–300 nm, ∼40-fold less potent than morphine). Morphinone, however, was significantly more potent and only 4–5-fold less efficacious than morphine (Fig. 4).To compare the potencies of the compounds at Gi-protein activation with their affinities at MOR, we performed receptor binding experiments to determine Ki values for different morphine precursors. The cells used in this study expressed 2.4 ± 0.6 pmol MOR per mg membrane protein (n = 6, mean ± S.E.), which corresponds to ∼40 amol (240,800) receptors per cell. Ki values obtained from competitive binding displacement experiments were in general quite close to the EC50 values measured by the FRET assay (Table 1), suggesting a moderate amount of spare receptors. This comparison further suggests that our Gi-FRET assay faithfully reports Gi-protein activation and can be used to investigate the pharmacological properties of compounds acting at G-protein coupled receptors.DISCUSSIONIn this study we present a FRET-based approach to monitor MOR-mediated Gi-protein activation in intact living cells and use this method for pharmacological characterization of"

Hence it is unclear whether Tyr29, Tyr31, and other residues in the conserved C-terminal region of SLN regulate SERCA as a result of direct contact with the enzyme. This work has applied solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) in alliance with conventional biochemical methods to investigate whether the conserved tyrosine residues of SLN participate in a regulatory interaction with SERCA1a within phospholipid membranes. From a combination of structural, dynamic, and functional measurements of SLN and SERCA1a, it is shown that Tyr29 and Tyr31 of SLN make contact with the luminal face of the enzyme and that all five of the residues RSYQY contribute toward the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and calcium transport. The work also provides some evidence that the luminal region of SLN together with the cytoplasmic domain of PLB inhibits SERCA1a more effectively than either region alone, consistent with the superinhibitory effect observed when SLN and PLB are co-expressed with the enzyme (9Asahi M. Sugita Y. Kurzydlowski K. De Leon S. Tada M. Toyoshima C. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100,: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle contractility by SLN and, in view of the close similarities of SERCA1a and SERCA2a, are also likely to be relevant to the regulation of cardiac calcium cycling. Materials—Synthetic SLN (>95% pure) was purchased from Activotec SPP Ltd., University of Southampton. The protein was uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled at Tyr29 and uniformly 13C-labeled at Tyr31. A second SLN sample (>95% pure) was labeled with 2Hatthe α-position of Val20.[α-13C-Tyr3]NAc-RSYQY and unlabeled derivatives were purchased from Peptide Protein Research Ltd., Fareham, UK. The detergent n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) was purchased from Melford Laboratories, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (tetrasodium salt) (BAPTA) was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of SR Microsomes and Further Purification of SERCA1a—SERCA1a was purified from fast-twitch rabbit skeletal muscle according to a method adapted from East and Lee (17East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21,: 4144-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). First, SR microsomes were prepared from 100 g of muscle tissue by differential centrifugation. A fraction of the intact SR vesicles was retained for calcium uptake measurements, and the remainder was treated with sodium cholate and subjected to density gradient centrifugation to yield membranes containing ∼100 mg of ∼90% pure SERCA1a as characterized by SDS-PAGE on a 10% resolving gel. Protein concentrations were calculated using an adaptation of the Lowry method (18Waterborg J.H. Matthews H.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 7-9Crossref Google Scholar). Reconstitution of SERCA1a and SLN—Purified SERCA1a was reconstituted into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) membranes at a lipid to protein (l/p) molar ratio of 160:1, using an adaptation of methods described previously (19Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342,: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107,: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Hughes E. Middleton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278,: 20835-20842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SLN was co-reconstituted with SERCA1a into DOPC membranes at a lipid/SLN/SERCA1a molar ratio of 160:10:1 or 160:3:1 (21Hughes E. Middleton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278,: 20835-20842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the reconstitution of SLN alone, DOPC and SLN were dissolved in 50:50 chloroform/methanol at an l/p molar ratio of 53:1 and dried to a thin film as described above. Samples were rehydrated in 10 mm phosphate, pH 7, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a bench top microcentrifuge. SLN was visualized on Coomassie Blue-stained 15% Tris-Tricine gels according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166,: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). Apparent molecular weights were determined using ultra low molecular weight markers (1.06, 3.5, 6.5, 14.2, 17, and 26.6 kDa). Activity Measurements—Specific Ca2+-ATPase activity was quantified as the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) liberated upon ATP hydrolysis at 37 °C, as described previously (21Hughes E. Middleton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278,: 20835-20842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake by SR microsomes was measured on a Carey Eclipse fluorimeter by monitoring the change in fluorescence of the calcium indicator BAPTA in a method adapted from Refs. 20Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107,: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Karon B. Nissen E. Voss J. Thomas D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227,: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. SR microsomes were added to Ca2+ uptake buffer (10 mm PIPES, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.1) containing 50 μm BAPTA and 0.25 μm carbonylcyanide p-trifluorome-thoxyphenylhydrazone and CaCl2 to the desired final calcium concentration in an assay volume of 2 ml. The final protein concentration was 20 μg/ml. The reaction was initiated with ATP to a final concentration of 4 mm, and the fluorescence was monitored at an emission wavelength of 370 nm after excitation at 299 nm, over a time course of 5-10 min. SR microsomes were opened and reformed in the presence of NAc-RSYQY according to the following procedure. A 0.5-ml volume of SR (2 mg/ml protein) in Ca2+ uptake buffer was incubated on a shaker at room temperature overnight in the presence of 1 mg/ml C12E8 (control) or 1 mg/ml C12E8 plus 200 μm NAc-RSYQY. 200 mg of washed and equilibrated XAD2 resin was then added to remove the detergent. Samples were returned to the shaker for a further 4 h before carrying out Ca2+ uptake measurements. (C12E8 was omitted from samples used for measuring the effect of NAc-RSYQY on the cytoplasmic domain of Ca2+ATPase.) Free calcium was calculated from a method adapted from Tatulian et al. (24Tatulian S.A. Chen B. Li J. Negash S. Middaugh C.R. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41,: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using the calculation [Ca2+]i = Kd × (Ff - Fi)/(Fi - Fs), where F is the BAPTA fluorescence measured and subscripts f, i, and s represent the fluorescence for free calcium, the ith addition of calcium, and the saturating level of calcium, respectively. A Kd value of 203 nm was assumed for the calculations. Fluorescence values were taken during the uptake assay using measurements after the addition of known amounts of calcium and before addition of ATP to initialize the reaction. The fluorescence values obtained were substituted into the above equation, and the linear part of the resulting graph was used to convert added calcium to free calcium. Membranous Na+/K+-ATPase was purified from pig kidney microsomal membranes, and enzymatic activities and protein concentrations were determined as described previously (25Klodos I. Esmann M. Post R.L. Kidney Int. 2002; 62,: 2097-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Esmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156,: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—SR samples (50 μl) at a protein concentration 100 μg/ml in PIPES buffer, before and after treatment with C12E8 and/or Bio-Beads, were applied to glow-discharged 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids. A negative stain (2% uranyl acetate) was applied prior to visualizing by electron microscopy using a Tecnai 10 microscope. Solid-state NMR Measurements—NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 9.3 tesla. The sample temperature was 4 or 30 °C. The diameter of the NMR sample rotor was 4 mm, and the spinning rate ranged from 4 to 8 kHz, maintained automatically to within ±1 Hz. Typical conditions for CP-MAS experiments were a 1H 90° excitation pulse length of 4.0 μs, Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization from 1Hto 13C at a contact times of 1-5 ms using a matched 1H field of 65 kHz, continuous wave proton decoupling at a field of 85 kHz during signal acquisition, and a 2-s recycle delay. Two-dimensional dipolar assisted rotational resonance spectra (27Takegoshi K. Nakamura S. Terao T. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001; 344,: 631-637Crossref Scopus (780) Google Scholar) were recorded with 128 hypercomplex points in the indirect dimension with a mixing time of 50 ms during which the proton field was adjusted to the spinning frequency of 8 kHz. Two-dimensional C-H DIP-SHIFT spectra were recorded using the constant time experiment described elsewhere (14Mascioni A. Karim C. Barany G. Thomas D. Veglia G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41,: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), at a spinning rate of 7822 kHz. The indirect dimension of the two-dimensional spectra was constructed as followed. A series of n = 8 free induction decays was recorded, each after allowing the 13C magnetization to evolve under the influence of C-H dipolar interactions for up to 1 cycle of sample rotation (tr) at eight regular intervals t incremented by 18.6 μs, where 0 ≤ t ≤ tr. In practice this was achieved using frequency-switched Lee-Goldberg homonuclear decoupling during the evolution interval. The free induction decays were Fourier-transformed into 1024 points, and the intensity values at each equivalent point in the eight spectra were normalized to the value at t = 0 and corrected for T2 relaxation by multiplication of each point by a factor exp(t/T2), substituting a value of T2 such that the intensity values at t = 0 and t = 8 were equal to 1. The eight spectra (Sn) were then replicated and concatenated (S1,S2... S8,S1,S2... S8, etc) to give a 1024 × 128 matrix, which was Fourier-transformed in the indirect dimension to produce the pseudo two-dimensional spectra, with the 13C chemical shift information in the direct dimension and C-H dipolar coupling information in the indirect dimension. C-H dipolar spectra corresponding to different sites in SLN were obtained as vertical slices through the two-dimensional spectra at specific chemical shifts. Simulations of the C-H spectra in terms of the rate of rotational diffusion of SLN or the aromatic ring dynamics of Tyr29 and Tyr31 were carried out as described previously (28Hughes E. Clayton J.C. Middleton D.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44,: 4055-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 2H NMR spectrum of [α-2H-V20]SLN in DOPC bilayers was obtained with MAS at 12.5 kHz using the quadrupole echo experiment (29Davis J.H. Jeffrey K.R. Bloom M. Valic M.I. Higgs T.P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 42,: 390-394Crossref Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) with the two delays τ1 and τ2 set to one full period of sample rotation. Preliminary Characterization of SLN—In previous work it was shown that SLN is capable of forming tetramers, pentamers, and possibly higher aggregates in intact liposomes (30Hellstern S. Pegoraro S. Karim C.B. Lustig A. Thomas D.D. Moroder L. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 30845-30852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) Here, the oligomeric state of SLN in DOPC membranes at an l/p molar ratio of 53:1 was explored using NMR measurements of molecular dynamics. The rate of rotational diffusion of SLN within the lipid bilayer is inversely proportional to the cube of the transmembrane diameter of the rotating species. Synthetic SLN, with the α-position of residues Tyr29 and Tyr31 labeled with 13C and the α-position of Val19 labeled with 2H, was incorporated into DOPC membranes, and the overall rotational mobility of SLN was probed using 13C and 2H solid-state magicangle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments. The spectra are sensitive to motional averaging of the 2H quadrupolar anisotropy or the 1H-13C dipolar anisotropy as a result of rotational diffusion of SLN with a rotational correlation time τRSLN in the range 10-4-10-6 s. The spectra indicated that neither the dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropies were scaled markedly by motional averaging (Fig. 1, a and b), suggesting either that τRSLN was slower than 10-4 s or that the C-2H and C-H bonds were oriented so as to be insensitive to rapid rotational diffusion (as demonstrated by the simulated line shapes in Fig. 1, a and b). It is calculated that the transmembrane diameter of a species with τRSLN{&gt;}10−4s is on the order of 50 Å or more (31Cady S.D. Goodman C. Tatko C.D. DeGrado W.F. Hong M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129,: 5719-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By comparison, PLB pentamers have a transmembrane diameter of ∼30 Å (32Oxenoid K. Chou J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102,: 10870-10875Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), so it follows that here the NMR data are consistent with SLN aggregates with an oligomeric number of much greater than 5. Detergent-solubilized SLN ran as a monomer on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, however, and bands corresponding to larger species were not observed (Fig. 1c) suggesting that any oligomers present were not stable in detergent. Moreover, when a sample of SLN in DOPC membranes (at an l/p molar ratio of 53:1) was treated with the cross-linking agent p-azido-phenylglyoxal monohydrate as described previously (30Hellstern S. Pegoraro S. Karim C.B. Lustig A. Thomas D.D. Moroder L. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276,: 30845-30852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Tris-Tricine gels again showed no evidence of cross-linked oligomers (data not presented). Given that the presence of oligomers could not be confirmed by biochemical methods, an alternative interpretation of the NMR data is that SLN remains monomeric but tilted in the membrane with the transmembrane helix rotated to allow the C-2H and 13C-H bonds to make angles of close to 0° with respect to the axis of molecular rotation (usually parallel with the bilayer normal). Rapid rotation of the SLN monomer about this axis would not then average the dipolar and quadrupolar anisotropies. Such a model supports recent experiments that showed SLN to be tilted by ∼23° in the membrane (33Buffy J.J. Traaseth N.J. Mascioni A. Gor'kov P.L. Chekmenev E.Y. Brey W.W. Veglia G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45,: 10939-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interactions between SLN and SERCA1a—NMR and functional experiments were next carried out to establish whether SLN and SERCA1a interact with each other in the DOPC membranes. ATP hydrolysis measurements indicated that reconstituted SERCA1a retained calcium-dependent activity, but in the presence of a 3-fold excess of SLN there was a slight reduction in Vmax. When in a 10-fold excess over SERCA1a, SLN shifted the activity curve to the right and depressed Vmax by about 25%, indicating that high concentrations of SLN lowered both the calcium affinity and maximal rate of transport of SERCA1a (Fig. 2a). The functional information therefore implies that a physical interaction takes place between the two proteins in membranes suitable for NMR analysis. The interaction between SLN and SERCA1a was probed from the perspective of the conserved tyrosine residues Tyr29 and Tyr31 of SLN within DOPC membranes (at an l/p ratio of 53:1) using 13C SSNMR methods to observe the physical and dynamic properties of the tyrosine rings in the presence and absence of SERCA1a. Peaks in the 13C spectrum of DOPC membranes containing [U-13C-Tyr29/Tyr31]SLN were assigned to the two tyrosine aromatic spin systems by inspection of two-dimensional 13C-13C dipolar correlation spectra (Fig. 2b, black spectrum). The peaks for the ϵ-carbon site for Tyr29 and Tyr31, at ∼120 and ∼115 ppm, respectively, were almost fully resolved in the one-dimensional spectrum, as were the peaks for the ζ-carbon sites of the two tyrosines. Small changes in the tyrosine side group chemical shifts and a broadening of the peaks were observed when SLN was reconstituted in a 3-fold excess over SERCA1a (Fig. 2b, blue spectrum), suggesting that Tyr29 and Tyr31 undergo conformational changes or experience a change in the microenvironment when the enzyme is present in the membrane. In the presence of SERCA1a several of the peaks for the aromatic residues (including the Tyr31ϵ cross-peak) appear to be split, consistent with SLN existing in multiple environments or physical states. One explanation for the peak splitting is that the spectrum represents free and SERCA-bound species of SLN in slow exchange. Alternatively, peak splitting could occur if SLN undergoes a slow transformation between different conformations induced by the presence of SERCA1a. NMR experiments on SLN and PLB in oriented lipid bilayers and detergent micelles by Veglia and co-workers (33Buffy J.J. Traaseth N.J. Mascioni A. Gor'kov P.L. Chekmenev E.Y. Brey W.W. Veglia G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45,: 10939-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Traaseth N.J. Buffy J.J. Zamoon J. Veglia G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45,: 13827-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have identified multiple conformations or topologies of both proteins. The authors postulated the presence of a pre-existing equilibrium between so-called R and the T conformational states apparent in the cytoplasmic domain of PLB prior to SERCA binding (35Zamoon J. Nitu F. Karim C. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102,: 4747-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and suggested that the dynamics of the SLN transmembrane domain may facilitate a similar topological interconversion of SLN that could be important for recognition by SERCA. The spectra obtained here support the existence of two or more conformations of SLN in unoriented lipid bilayers that are reflected partially in the C-terminal region of the protein. Specific associations of the tyrosine side groups with residues within SERCA1a might impair the mobility of the aromatic rings. A two-dimensional C-H DIPSHIFT experiment was therefore used to measure the 1H-13C dipolar anisotropy for the aromatic carbons of Tyr29 and Tyr31 to specifically monitor the dynamics of the SLN tyrosine rings in the absence and presence of SERCA1a. The dipolar anisotropy at the ortho- and meta- positions of the aromatic rings is sensitive to the rate of ring reorientation resulting from rotation about the Cβ-Cγ bond. Experimental spectra for [U-13C-Tyr29/Tyr31]SLN in the absence and presence of SERCA1a were compared with simulated spectra calculated for different rates of ring reorientation. The entire aromatic range of the spectrum was simulated, but in principle the 1H-13C anisotropy measured only for the ortho-ring positions (i.e. the ϵ-positions of Tyr29 and Tyr31) would be sufficient to estimate the ra"

Specific single molecule recognition events were observed with antibodies against loop 6–7, loop 8–9, and loop 13–14, demonstrating the extracellular orientation of these subdomains.

However, knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of this protein and of the dynamics at the molecular level is rather limited.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise substrate-binding domains have not yet been defined. In this study, we have speculated that a region before residue 380 might play an important role in high affinity glucose binding, because the mutations at residues 292 and 355 in human SGLT1 lead to the hereditary disease glucose-galactose malabsorption (19Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G879-G882PubMed Google Scholar, 20Martin M.G. Turk E. Lostao M.P. Kerner C. Wright E.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). SGLT1 possesses 14 conserved cysteine residues, and there is evidence indicating that the existence of (at least) two disulfide bonds is important for functioning of this transporter (21Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3565-3570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Turner R.J. George J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Disulfide groups play a key role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of a protein by forming intra- and interchain disulfide bonds. In addition, free sulfhydryl groups often have important catalytic or regulatory roles. So far, there is evidence showing one disulfide bridge between residues Cys255 and Cys511 in human SGLT1 (23Gagnon D.G. Bissonnette P. Lapointe J.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In rabbit SGLT1 there are three large extramembranous loops or surface subdomains (loop 6–7, loop 8–9, and loop 13–14) that contain cysteine residues and therefore are potential sites for bringing the transmembrane helices 4 and 5 close to the transmembrane helices 10–13. Thereby, a vestibule containing a glucose recognition site might be formed similar to the results from the γ-aminobutyric acid transporters, showing that three surface loops form a pocket in which the substrate initially binds to the transporters (24Tamura S. Nelson H. Tamura A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28712-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To prove this assumption, the investigations using single-molecule AFM were further expanded to study the binding of epitope-specific antibodies to surface domains of SGLT1 during d-glucose translocation. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis, uptake assays, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were employed to strengthen this study. The results clearly show that the region between aa 339 and 361 in loop 8–9, especially residues Cys351 and Cys361, are involved in glucose binding. There is also evidence for a disulfide bridge between Cys255 and Cys608 in rabbit SGLT1. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the potential of AFM techniques in combination with biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the structure and function of subdomains of SGLT1. Thereby, considerable insight is provided into the arrangement of transmembrane helices and the substratebinding pocket of the rabbit SGLT1. This is important information for understanding the mechanism of action of this carrier protein. Materials—All of the chemicals were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma unless other sources are indicated. Immunopurified polyclonal antibodies QIS30 (subdomain I), PAN2-2 (subdomain II), and PAN3-2 (subdomain III) were raised against oligopeptides from the amino acid sequences aa 243–272 (loop 6–7, i.e. the loop between the transmembrane helices 6 and 7), aa 339–356 (loop 8–9), and aa 606–630 (loop 13–14) of rbSGLT1 (rabbit isoform), respectively, as described before (6Lin J. Kormanec J. Homerova D. Kinne R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Lin J.T. Kormanec J. Wehner F. Wielert-Badt S. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys.

The specificity of the interaction of the antibodies with the supposed epitopes has been shown in independent previous immunohistochemistry studies where surface labeling of the cells could be prevented in the presence of the peptides used for their generation. Mutagenesis of SGLT1 cDNA and Plasmid Construction—All of the mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a Chameleon™ double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following primers with mutated nucleotides (underlined) were used for mutagenesis: C225A, 5′-CCTCCATCCCACAGAAGGCCTACACCCCAAGGGAAGACGCC-3′; C345A, 5′-CCTGTACACAGACAAAGTTGCCGCCGTCGTGCCCTCGG-3′; C351A, 5′-GCCTGCGTCGTGCCCTCGGAAGCTGAGAGATACTGTGGCACC-3′; C355A, 5′-GCCCTCGGAATGTGAGAGATACGCTGGCACCAGGGTTGGC-3′; C361S, 5′-GGCACCAGGGTTGGCTCCACCAACATTGCCTTCCC-3′; C560A, 5′-GCATCTCTATCG-TCTGGCCTGGAGCCTACGTAATAGC-3′; and C608A, 5′-GGCGGGCCTATGACCTGTTTGCTGGGCTGGACCAGGATAAGGG-3′. For preparation of mutants, plasmid pSGLT1 (2207 bp of rabbit DNA) was used as a template. After site-directed mutagenesis all of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned from plasmid pSGLT1 into expression plasmid pHook™-2 (Invitrogen) with appropriate enzymes. Final plasmids were purified with a Qiagen endotoxin-free plasmid maxi kit. Cell Cultures and Transient Transfection—G6D3 cells or cell line stably transfected with the rabbit SGLT1 (25Lin J.T. Kormanec J. Wehner F. Wielert-Badt S. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and COS-7 cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks (Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The G6D3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing high glucose (25 mm) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× minimal essential medium, 25 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 400 μg/ml paneticin G420 (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany). The COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% l-glutamine. The culture media were renewed three times a week, and the cells were subcultured at 80% confluence. Cell passages below 15 were used for all experiments. For AFM investigation, the G6D3 cells were seeded on 22-mm2 poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and the experiments were performed within 1–4 days of seeding the cells. COS-7 cells were grown in 6-well culture plates to 70–80% confluence before transfection. Transient transfection was performed by using the activated dendrimer transfection reagent SuperFect™ (Qiagen) as described earlier (16Novakova R. Homerova D. Kinne R.K. Kinne-Saffran E. Lin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection was tested in COS-7 cells that were simultaneously transfected with the pHook™-2lacZ control plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under identical conditions (Invitrogen). The post-transfection period for an optimal expression of β-galactosidase was 48 h. The transfection was performed as described in the manufacturer's manual, and ∼35–40% efficiency was found for the wild type and all mutants. Transport Studies—Na+/d-glucose cotransport activity of transiently transfected COS-7 cells (wild type and mutants) was assessed by examining α-[14C]methyl glucoside (AMG) uptake at 37 °C in Na+-containing Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) medium as described previously for Chinese hamster ovary cells (25Lin J.T. Kormanec J. Wehner F. Wielert-Badt S. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Prior to the transport assay, COS-7 cells cultured in 6-well plates were incubated in a d-glucose-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C to reduce the intracellular glucose concentration to a nonsignificant level. Uptakes of AMG were carried out at a concentration of 0.02 mm AMG (containing 2 μCi of 14C-labeled AMG). The maximum uptake rate of wild type was 2.8 ± 0.3 nmol (mg protein)–1 (15 min)–1. The results were expressed as percentages of AMG uptake of the wild type (mean values ± S.D., n = 6). In kinetic measurements for the determination of the apparent Km AMG (mmol/liter), two concentrations of substrate, i.e. 0.1 mm (S1) and 3 mm (S2) were used. The results were expressed as mean values ± S.D. (n = 3). The calculations were performed as described earlier (16Novakova R. Homerova D. Kinne R.K. Kinne-Saffran E. Lin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For determination of the free thiol groups on the surface of SGLT1, MTSET (a thiol-reactive compound) was used. The transiently transfected wild type COS-7 cells and mutants were incubated with 1 mm MTSET for 12 min before performing AMG uptake assays in Na+-KRH medium containing 1 mm MTSET. The results are presented as a percentage of inhibition compared with the uptake in the control buffer (without MTSET) with respective cells and were obtained from measurement repeated in triplicate (mean values ± S.D., n = 4). To demolish possible intramolecular disulfide bonds of SGLT1, 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) were added in the AMG uptake assays of the transiently transfected COS-7 cells (wild type and mutants). The results were expressed as percentages of inhibition compared with the uptake of the respective cells in the buffer without DTT and were obtained from measurement performed in duplicate (mean values ± S.D., n = 3). Conjugation of Antibodies to AFM Tips—Conjugation of immunopurified subdomain antibodies (i.e. QIS30, PAN2-2, and PAN3-2) to AFM tips via a flexible PEG-cross-linker, generating subdomain I tip, subdomain II tip, and subdomain III tip, respectively, were done similarly as described previously (27Hinterdorfer P. Baumgartner W. Gruber H.J. Schilcher K. Schindler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3477-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In brief, AFM tips were first functionalized with ethanol-amine by an overnight incubation with ethanolamine hydrochloride solubilized in Me2SO. Then the heterobifunctional PEG linker (aldehyde-PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide) was covalently bound to the amino groups on the tip surface via the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester function. Next, the specific antibodies were coupled via the aldehyde function to the PEG-conjugated AFM tips (28Ebner A. Wildling L. Kamruzzahan A.S.M. Rankl C. Wruss J. Hahn C.D. Hölzl M. Kienberger F. Blaas D. Hinterdorfer P. Gruber H.J. Bioconjug. Chem. 2007; 18: 1176-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The tips were finally washed in the AFM working buffer and stored in the cold room. This method provides tips to which only a few antibodies, functionally separated from each other, are attached. These tips have been used successfully in single-molecule recognition studies (7Puntheeranurak T. Wildling L. Gruber H.J. Kinne R.K. Hinterdorfer P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Hinterdorfer P. Baumgartner W. Gruber H.J. Schilcher K. Schindler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3477-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—All AFM experiments were performed using a magnetically driven dynamic force microscope (Agilent 5500 AFM; Agilent Technologies, Tempe, AZ) in the Na+-containing KRH medium except where Na+-free medium was stated. For the detection of antibody-SGLT1 recognition, force distance cycles were performed at room temperature using ligand-coated cantilevers (rectangular cantilever; Veeco Instruments, Mannheim, Germany) with 0.02 n/m nominal spring constants in the conventional contact force spectroscopy mode as described previously (7Puntheeranurak T. Wildling L. Gruber H.J. Kinne R.K. Hinterdorfer P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Spring constants were determined according to the thermal noise method (29Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3320) Google Scholar). Force distance cycles were recorded at the cell surfaces with the assistance of a CCD camera for positioning the AFM cantilever. An AFM tip carrying antibody was first approached (trace) and then retracted (retrace) from a cell surface, and the deflection angle of the cantilever was measured as a function of the z position. The deflection is proportional to the interaction force according to f = kΔz (Hook's law, k is the spring constant of the cantilever, Δz is the deflection up (+) or down (–) of the cantilever). The sweep-amplitude of the force-distance cycles was 1000 nm at 1 Hz sweep rate. Up to 500–1000 force-distance cycles were performed for each area on the surface of cells, in the average four different cells for each condition, i.e. initial condition, ligand addition, and washout condition. For ligand addition, 0.3 μm free antibodies (QIS30, PAN2-2, and PAN3-2) and 10 mm d-glucose were separately applied in different conditions. The binding probability for each condition was derived and expressed as the mean value ± S.E. (n = 1500–4000). The statistical significance was tested using a Student's t test. Several experiments were performed, and one typical experiment for each condition is shown. Analysis of force distance cycles was performed using Matlab version 6.5 (Math Works, Natick, MA) as previously described (27Hinterdorfer P. Baumgartner W. Gruber H.J. Schilcher K. Schindler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3477-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 30Baumgartner W. Hinterdorfer P. Schindler H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 82: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation for MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopy— The rbSGLT1 was purified by immunoprecipitation from G6D3 cells as previously described (25Lin J.T. Kormanec J. Wehner F. Wielert-Badt S. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The extracted protein was then incubated with 10 milliunits of peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently precipitated with CHCl3/MeOH (31Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). The protein pellets were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS at 90 °C for 5 min in two conditions, i.e. in the absence or presence of 5 mm DTT. Cysteine residues were then biotinylated using 10 mm maleimide-PEO2-biotin (molecular weight, 525.6; Pierce) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding excess l-cysteine HCl and followed by SDS-PAGE. The SGLT1 protein was digested with modified trypsin (20 μg/ml) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were extracted twice with acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (66:33:0.1, v/v/v) solution and subsequently dried and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 6.5. The detrimental effects of proteases were avoided by treating the protein with 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Diagnostics). The peptides were then purified with avidine coupled agarose, and the biotinylated peptides were then eluted with acetonitrile/water (60:45, v/v) containing 5% formic acid. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—The sample was spotted onto the MALDI plate and air-dried at room temperature. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager MALDI system (PE-Biosystems). MALDI peptide spectra were collected by using the linear delayed mode (100 ns) with 94% grid voltage (guide wire voltage) and 0.05% low mass gate, 500. The spectra were externally calibrated with insulin, thioredoxin, and apomyoglobin (PE-Biosystems). Orientation of Three Subdomains Determined by Antibodies Coupled to AFM Cantilevers—AFM force spectroscopy was employed to verify the surface topology of subdomain I (loop 6–7), subdomain II (loop 8–9), and subdomain III (loop 13–14) (Fig. 1). rbSGLT1-transfected G6D3 cells, which overexpress SGLT1 on the cell surface (25Lin J.T. Kormanec J. Wehner F. Wielert-Badt S. Kinne R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were used as a cell model for this investigation. Using three different AFM tips primed with epitope-specific antibodies, i.e. subdomain I tip, subdomain II tip, and subdomain III tip (see “Experimental Procedures”), force-distance cycles were performed at a fixed lateral position above the cells in Na+-containing KRH medium. The principle of single-molecule recognition force detection of the ligand-receptor complex on living G6D3 cells by using AFM has been described previously (7Puntheeranurak T. Wildling L. Gruber H.J. Kinne R.K. Hinterdorfer P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Specific recognition events were observed with a unique characteristic from the force signal, as illustrated by a typical force curve using the subdomain I tip (Fig. 2A). The recognitions diminished in the presence of specific subdomain I antibodies in solution (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the antibody coupled to the cantilever only reacts with SGLT1 and no other proteins. Specific unbinding events that can be prevented by free antibodies were also observed when epitope-specific antibodies against subdomain II and subdomain III were coupled to the AFM tips. The binding probabilities (probability to find an unbinding event in force distance cycles) from several experiments were derived. From typical experiments (n = 3 for subdomain I and II, n = 9 for subdomain III), a binding probability of subdomain I, II, and III antibodies on G6D3 cells of 9.5 ± 0.7, 8.0 ± 1.9, and 10.6 ± 0.7%, respectively, were observed, (Fig. 2, C, D, and E, first bars). For confirmation of the specific recognition of SGLT1 by the antibodies, blocking experiments by injecting free antibodies were performed. Binding probability decreased to 2.1 ± 0.2% when free subdomain I antibodies were present in the medium and subsequently recovered to 6.9 ± 0.7% after wash-out of the antibodies (Fig. 2C). Likewise, the binding probabilities decreased to 1.7 ± 0.5 or 3.6 ± 0.9% when free subdomain II and III antibodies were injected. After subdomain II and III antibodies were subsequently removed the binding probabilities increased again to 4.9 ± 1.5 and 6.6 ± 2.3%, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). From these results it can be concluded that the epitopic regions of the subdomain I, II, and III of SGLT1 are localized extracellularly in living cells.FIGURE 2Recognition of SGLT1 on the surface of intact cells by AFM tips carrying epitope-specific antibodies (subdomain I, II, and III).

The results are shown in Table 1. The interaction force between subdomain III and SGLT1 was 95.2 ± 9.9 pN, which is in agreement with previous investigations (7Puntheeranurak T. Wildling L. Gruber H.J. Kinne R.K. Hinterdorfer P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the unbinding forces between the subdomain I antibody and SGLT1 and between the subdomain II antibody and SGLT1 were slightly lower (61.9 ± 2.2 and 60.7 ± 6.2 pN, respectively) (n = 3).TABLE 1Binding probabilities and unbinding forces of SGLT1 antibodiesAntibodiesBinding probabilityaBinding probability and maximum unbinding force from several independent experiments with four locations on fours cells for each experiment.

Recently, it was shown that FGF-1, similarly to FGF-2 (16Sheng Z. Lewis J.A. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40153-40160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), contains an additional C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (17Wesche J. Malecki J. Wiedlocha A. Ehsani M. Marcinkowska E. Nilsen T. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6071-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All nucleocytoplasmic traffic occurs through the nuclear pore complexes. Molecules smaller than ∼40 kDa may diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complexes, whereas transport of larger structures are mediated by nuclear transport receptors of the importin-β and -α families (18Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 19Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W.

These receptors shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol and transfer multiple cargo molecules in a signal-mediated and energy-dependent way. Several nuclear export receptors have been characterized, which mediate export of different types of RNA as well as protein cargo (20Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Exportin-1/CRM (chromosomal region maintenance)-1 exports cargo containing a Leu-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) initially identified in the HIV-1 Rev protein and in protein kinase A inhibitor (21Fischer U.

So far, more than 75 experimentally validated Leu-rich NESs have been identified (NESbase version 1.0 (available on the World Wide Web) (23la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M.

Exportin-1-dependent transport is blocked by leptomycin B (LMB), a Streptomyces metabolite that covalently attaches to a cysteine residue adjacent to the NES recognition motif in the central region of exportin-1 (24Petosa C.

Cell. 2004; 16: 761-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The accessibility of the NES to the nuclear export machinery can be regulated by conformational shifts in the protein structure or by masking the NES by overlapping binding of additional factors (25Wood M.J.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, have been found to influence the accessibility of nuclear trafficking signals (27Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M.

Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Malecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This export was blocked by LMB, suggesting that phosphorylated FGF-1 is actively exported from the nucleus by exportin-1. However, no NES responsible for the export has been identified within the FGF-1 molecule. We here demonstrate a functional and transferable FGF-1 NES, which contains hydrophobic amino acids of both crucial and moderate importance to nuclear export. Additionally, we provide evidence that FGF-1 is able to form a complex with exportin-1 and RanGTP both in vitro in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vivo by employing a peroxisomal targeting assay (30Nilsen T. Skjerpen C.S. Olsnes S. Celis J.E. Carter N.P. Simons K. Small V.J. Hunter T. Shotton D.M. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook, Elsevier, Inc., Amsterdam. 2006: 275-278Google Scholar). The complex formation is phosphorylation-dependent, and this modification, which is known to occur in the nucleus, may be a signal for regulated FGF-1 export from the nuclei.

The plasmid pQE60-CRM-1 was provided by Dr. Petosa (EMBL Grenoble, France). pQE32-Ran-Q69L (32Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to construct the FGF-1 mutants L149A/V151A, F146A, L147A, and I144A/L145A/F146A. pcDNA3-myc-FGF-1-S130D-pts was constructed by inserting the cDNA for FGF-1 into the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3 vector, where the Myc tag was added to the C terminus of FGF-1 by PCR. The peroxisomal targeting signal (pts), consisting of the three amino acids SKL, was then added to the C terminus by PCR. Finally, the point mutation S130D was added by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. pcDNA3-myc-FGF-1 S130D I144A/L145A/F146A pts was constructed by substituting Ile144, Leu145, and Phe146 to alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with pcDNA3-myc-FGF-1-S130D-pts as a template. Similarly, pcDNA3-myc-FGF-1-S130A-pts was constructed by substituting Ser130 for alanine. Cell Cultures—NIH/3T3 cells were propagated in Quantum 333 medium containing 1% calf serum. COS and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 μg/ml) were added, and cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant FGF-1 was expressed from pET21d in the E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) PlysS and purified using a heparin column, HiTrap Heparin HP (GE Health care). An E. coli strain TG1 containing pQE60-CRM-1 and an E. coli strain M15 [pREP4] containing pQE32-Ran-Q69L were used to express exportin-1/CRM-1 and Ran-Q69L, respectively. The proteins were subsequently purified on aNi2+ chelating column (GE Healthcare). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described previously (29Wiedlocha A. Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Malecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In Vivo FGF-1 Phosphorylation—When the NIH/3T3 cell monolayer was ∼60% confluent, the cells were starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum. Starvation was continued in phosphate-free DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum for 6 h. Then 25 μCi/ml [33P]phosphate was added, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h. Appropriate reagents, recombinant FGF-1 (100 ng/ml), and heparin (10 units/ml) were then added, and the cells were incubated for 6 h to allow FGF-1 to translocate into the cytosol and nucleus. The cells were washed twice in HEPES buffer and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. After scraping the cells off the plastic and a 5-min centrifugation at 15,800 × g, the supernatant was collected and designated the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was sonicated in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated the nuclear fraction. Heparin-Sepharose was then added, and the samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C in order to adsorb the growth factor. After washing twice in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, the samples were treated with trypsin (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in order to remove contaminating factors. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Cell Fractionation—NIH/3T3 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to the addition of [35S]methionine-labeled FGF-1. The incubation was continued for 6 h, and then growth factor remaining at the cell surface was removed with 1 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) for 10 min on ice. The cells were rinsed in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and then further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in DMEM. The cytosolic fraction was purified by permeabilizing the plasma membrane by digitonin (20 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature and then for 30 min on ice. The medium containing the cytosol was collected and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The cell remnants were then treated with 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures for 15 min on ice, scraped off the plastic, and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,800 × g. The supernatant, containing the membrane fraction, was removed, and the nuclear pellet was sonicated in 600 μl of lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation for 15 min at 15,800 × g, the supernatant was collected and designated the nuclear fraction. All fractions were finally treated with heparin-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, and the absorbed material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Activation of Signaling Pathways—NIH/3T3 cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h and then treated with growth factor (5 ng/ml) and heparin (10 units/ml) for either 15 min or 6 h. The cells were lysed in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies or anti-Erk1/2 for loading control. Between each detection step, the membranes were stripped in stripping buffer. Measurements of DNA Synthesis and Cell Proliferation—The measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to stimulation with growth factors was performed as described by Klingenberg et al. (35Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Rapak A. Munoz R. Falnes P. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11164-11172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For cell proliferation studies, NIH/3T3 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well, serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C, and then treated with 10 units/ml heparin and wild type or mutant FGF-1 for up to 72 h. 50 ng/ml FGF-1 was added at the time points 0, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h. The cells were counted using a Coulter counter (Beckman Z1) at the time points 0, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h. Co-immunoprecipitation—[35S]Methionine-labeled wild type or mutant FGF-1 (1.0 μg), Ran-Q69L-His (0.75 μg), and exportin-1 (0.75 μg) were mixed in 400 μl of PBS containing 5 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. An anti-His antibody (800 ng/sample) was attached to protein A-Sepharose and added to the samples followed by 4 h of incubation at 4 °C. After sedimentation, supernatants were collected, and the beads were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The supernatants were incubated with heparin-Sepharose to adsorb unbound [35S]methionine-labeled FGF-1 and analyzed as above to ensure that sufficient labeled growth factor had been added to each sample. In Vivo Export Assay—HeLa or COS cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips and, when the cell monolayer was ∼50% confluent, transfected with the plasmids pRev-1.4-GFP, pRev-NES-GFP, or pRev-FGF-NES-GFP using the FuGENE 6 reagent, as described by the manufacturer. After expression of the GFP fusion proteins for 48 h, the cells were incubated for 3 h with either actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or LMB (3 ng/ml) or left untreated. To ensure that cytoplasmic GFP was a result from nuclear export and not newly translated proteins, cycloheximide (15 μg/ml) was added to all wells 30 min prior to additional treatments. The coverslips were then washed once in PBS and fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde on ice. After two additional washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. The images were prepared by Adobe Photoshop 7.0. For cell fractionation, transfected HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and the soluble fraction was designated the cytoplasmic fraction. The insoluble fraction was washed in lysis buffer and sonicated, and the soluble fraction was designated the nuclear fraction. In Vivo Protein-Protein Interaction Assay by Peroxisomal Targeting—HeLa cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and transfected with the appropriate constructs when ∼50% confluent. Following protein expression for 24 h at 37 °C, the plasma membrane was permeabilized for 10 min with a 40 μg/ml concentration of the cholesterol-specific detergent digitonin. The peroxisomal membranes do not contain cholesterol and will remain intact upon this treatment. Cytosolic material is washed out in PBS for 3 × 5 min, the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 50 min at 4 °C, and the reaction was quenched by incubation for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl. The cholesterol-deficient peroxisomal membranes are then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked for 20 min with 5% fetal calf serum to avoid subsequent nonspecific antibody binding. Finally, the cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY), and the images were prepared by Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (San Jose, CA). Characterization of the Putative Nuclear Export Sequence by Amino Acid Substitutions—Upon visual examination of the amino acid sequence of FGF-1, we noticed a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus (144ILFLPLPVSSD-Stop) that resembles the loose consensus of Leu-rich NESs. In order to determine whether this sequence is involved in the export of FGF-1 from the nucleus, we substituted hydrophobic amino acids in this sequence with alanine, as indicated in Table 1.TABLE 1Amino acid substitutions in the putative FGF-1 nuclear export sequenceDesignationSequenceFGF-1 wild type144ILFLPLPV151FGF-1-I 144A/L145A/F146A144AAALPLPV151FGF-1-F146A144ILALPLPV151FGF-1-L147A144ILFAPLPV151FGF-1-L149A/V151A144ILFLPAPA151 Open table in a new tab Initially, we substituted the three hydrophobic amino acids at the N-terminal part of the putative NES (Ile144, Leu145, and Phe146) for alanine. We also constructed the single mutant FGF-1-F146A. To study the transport (translocation) of exogenous FGF-1 to the cytosol and nucleus of cells, we have established a method that relies on the phosphorylation of FGF-1. FGF-1 possesses a single phosphorylation site, Ser130, which can be phosphorylated by PKCδ (29Wiedlocha A. Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Malecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Klingenberg O. Wiedlocha A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since PKC is only found in cytosol and nucleus of cells and not in endosomes, phosphorylation of exogenously added FGF-1 indicates that it was translocated across cellular membranes to reach the cytosol/nucleus. Wild type and mutated growth factors were added to serum-starved and 33P-preloaded NIH/3T3 cells, and the growth factor was allowed to translocate into the cytosol/nucleus for 6 h. The cells were then fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and the growth factor was adsorbed to heparin-Sepharose, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Finally, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. All phosphorylated wild type FGF-1 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1A, lane 1). On the other hand, the phosphorylated mutants were only found in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). Phosphorylated wild type FGF-1 was detected in the nucleus when the nuclear export was inhibited by LMB (Fig. 1A, lane 4). To further analyze the hydrophobic cluster of amino acids, we exchanged leucine at position 147 for alanine. Also, here all phosphorylated FGF-1 L147A was trapped in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Finally, we studied the nuclear export of phosphorylated FGF-1 when the two most C-terminal hydrophobic amino acids were mutated. Modifying similar hydrophobic amino acids within an NES have efficiently abolished nuclear export of other proteins (22Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 23la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We constructed FGF-1-L149A/V151A and analyzed the subcellular localization after internalization and phosphorylation. In contrast to the mutants described above, phosphorylated FGF-1-L149A/V151A was detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 1C, lane 7). Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) inhibits the translocation of exogenous FGF-1 to cytosol/nucleus (6Malecki J. Wiedlocha A. Wesche J. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4480-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To ensure that the phosphorylation of FGF-1 occurred in cytosol/nucleus and therefore reflects proper translocation, Baf A1 was used as a negative control for all mutants. No phosphorylated FGF-1 was detected in any of the subcellular fractions when Baf A1 was present, here demonstrated in Fig. 1B, lane 1. The data above demonstrate that the active nuclear export was abolished when the most N-terminal hydrophobic residues (Ile144, Leu145, Phe146, and Leu147) were mutated. Substituting the C-terminal residues (Leu149 and Val151) also decreased the export rate significantly. NES Mutations Trap FGF-1 in the Nucleus—The level of phosphorylated FGF-1 peaks ∼6 h after adding growth factors to cells, and it then decreases during the following hours (34Malecki J. Wesche J. Skjerpen C.S. Wiedlocha A. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that in vivo treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, increased the lifespan of intracellular (cytosolic), phosphorylated FGF-1 (29Wiedlocha A. Nilsen T. Wesche J. Sorensen V. Malecki J. Marcinkowska E. Olsnes S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Increased lifespan was also observed in the presence of LMB, where the phosphorylated growth factor was trapped in the nucleus. This suggests that FGF-1 is dephosphorylated in the cytosol following the phosphorylation-induced rapid nuclear export. It follows from this that the FGF-1 mutants with impaired nuclear export should be detectable in the nucleus for a longer period than the wild type. To test this, the cells were first allowed to internalize FGF-1 for 6 h, washed with a high salt/low pH buffer to remove growth factors attached to the cell surface and then incubated for 4 or 8 h more. As expected, phosphorylated wild type FGF-1 was not detectable after the chase periods (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, phosphorylated FGF-1-Leu149/Val151 was still present in the cytoplasmic sample after a 4-h chase period (Fig. 1C, lane 8). The mutants where Phe146 had been substituted for alanine were still detectable in the nuclear fraction even after an 8-h chase period (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). In the presence of LMB, both wild type and mutant growth factors were retained in the nuclear fraction after an 8-h chase (Fig. 1C, lanes 10–12). Controls for pure fractions were performed by analyzing 10 μl of cytoplasmic and nuclear samples by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Erk1/2 (cytosolic) and anti-lamin A (nuclear) antibodies. No cross-contamination was observed (Fig. 1D). The data indicate that the hydrophobic residues within the presumed FGF-1 NES are crucial for a"

Picomolar affinity antibodies, approaching the association limit of protein-protein interactions, have been discovered for highly potent antigens, but even such high-affinity binders have off-rates sufficient to negate therapeutic efficacy. To cross this affinity threshold, antibodies that tether their targets in a manner other than reversible non-covalent interaction will be required. Here we report the design and construction of an that forms an irreversible complex with a protein antigen in a metal-dependent reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2032372502,"We have studied the regulation of the caspase-Activated DNase (CAD) by its inhibitor, ICAD. To study the role of ICAD short and long splice forms ICAD-S and ICAD-L, respectively, in vivo, we constructed chicken DT40 cell lines in which the entire coding regions of ICAD alone or ICAD plus CAD were deleted. ICAD and ICAD/CAD double knock-outs lacked both DNA fragmentation and nuclear fragmentation after the induction of apoptosis. We constructed a model humanized system in which human ICAD-L and CAD proteins expressed in DT40 ICAD/CAD double knock-out cells could rescue both DNA fragmentation and stage II chromatin condensation. ICAD-S could not replace ICAD-L as a chaperone for folding active CAD in these cells. However, a modified version of ICAD-S, in which the two caspase-3 cleavage sites were replaced with two tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sites (ICAD-S2TEV) and which was therefore resistant to caspase cleavage, did inhibit CAD activation upon induction of apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, ICAD-L2TEV was functional as a chaperone for the production of active CAD in DT40 cells. In extracts prepared from these cells, we were able to activate CAD by cleavage of ICAD-L2TEV with TEV protease under non-apoptotic conditions. Thus, ICAD appears to be the only functional inhibitor of CAD activation in these cell-free extracts. Taken together, these observations indicate that ICAD-S may function together with ICAD-L as a buffer to prevent inappropriate CAD activation, particularly in cells where ICAD-S is the dominant form of ICAD protein.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death leading to the elimination of damaged, harmful, or unwanted cells in a wide range of organisms (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), which is now known as ICAD-L. ICAD-L is a mandatory chaperone that must be present during the translation of CAD, as the CAD polypeptide formed in the absence of ICAD-L is unable to fold into an active conformation (4Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). After completing its chaperone function in promoting the folding of CAD on the ribosome, ICAD-L remains bound, functioning as an inhibitor of CAD and preventing its activation. During apoptosis, CAD is activated when ICAD-L is cleaved by caspase-3 (5Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 12Liu X. Zou H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4401-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Once CAD is released from the fragmented ICAD, two molecules of CAD form a homodimer, which cleaves the DNA (15Woo E.J.

There are two forms of ICAD protein in cells, ICAD-L/DFF-45 and ICAD-S/DFF35 (DNA fragmentation factor 35 kDa) (4Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Sakahira H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkin N.A. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most studies have focused on ICAD-L; and the function of ICAD-S remains obscure. ICAD-S does not appear to function as a chaperone for CAD folding, as it does not support the production of active CAD if it is expressed in ICAD-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (18Nagase H. Fukuyama H. Tanaka M. Kawane K. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ICAD-S was able to work as an inhibitor for CAD in vitro (16Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ICAD-S in rat neurons prevents CAD activation (20Chen D. Stetler R.A. Cao G. Pei W. O'Horo C. Yin X.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38508-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, no ICAD-L protein was detected in this system, making it unclear just how CAD had been chaperoned, how ICAD-S had become associated with CAD, and what its specific function in the cell might be. In addition, tissue-specific differences in the quantity of ICAD-L and ICAD-S have been observed (17Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Sakahira H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkin N.A. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Chen D. Stetler R.A. Cao G. Pei W. O'Horo C. Yin X.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38508-38517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies show that the ratio of ICAD-L and ICAD-S can be regulated in a single cell type (21Li X. Wang J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To better define the role of ICAD-S in CAD regulation, we constructed a single knock-out of ICAD and a double knock-out of ICAD plus CAD in chicken DT40 cells. The double knock-out was constructed starting with a CAD knock-out cell line described previously (11Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We then constructed a humanized system in which human CAD (hCAD) was expressed in DT40 cells either alone or in combination with human ICAD-L (hICAD-L), human ICAD-S (hICAD-S), or both. This system recapitulated the normal regulation of apoptotic DNA fragmentation in the knock-out cells. In this system, ICAD-L could efficiently act as an inhibitory chaperone for CAD, but ICAD-S on its own was not able to support the synthesis of active CAD. Nonetheless, ICAD-S could inhibit CAD after cleavage of ICAD-L, thus showing its inhibitor function in vivo. Our data therefore demonstrate that although CAD must be synthesized with the help of ICAD-L as a chaperone and inhibitor, later ICAD-L can be efficiently replaced by ICAD-S, which works as an inhibitor but not as a chaperone for CAD in vivo. Thus, ICAD-S may act as a buffer in certain systems to ensure that CAD is kept inactive until a sufficient burst of caspase activity is generated. Cell Culture—The chicken B cell lymphoma DT40 cell line was cultured at 39 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% chicken serum (Invitrogen). Targeted Disruption of the ICAD Gene—To construct the ICAD knock-out we isolated a phage containing chicken ICAD genomic region (GenBank™ accession number EF632343) through screening of a λ FIX II DT40 genomic library. We completely removed the 2.7-kb ICAD open reading frame in DT40 cell lines using a targeting vector containing a 2.1-kb 5′-arm and a 3.4-kb 3′-arm from the noncoding regions. A selection cassette flanked with loxP sites (22Arakawa H. Lodygin D. Buerstedde J.M. BMC Biotechnol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was placed between the 5′ and 3′ ICAD noncoding regions in the targeting vector. For the first targeting, a cassette consisting of the puromycin resistance gene (puro) and the thymidine kinase (tk) gene flanked by mutant loxP sites (loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette) was used. This was constructed by cloning the Herpes simplex virus tk gene from the plasmid pBT/SP-TK (gift of Adrian Bird) into the loxP-puro-loxP cassette in pLoxPuro vector (22Arakawa H. Lodygin D. Buerstedde J.M. BMC Biotechnol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For the second targeting, a loxP-puro-loxP cassette lacking tk coding sequences was used. The knock-out constructs were linearized before transfection into DT40 cells. Stable cell lines were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). After the first targeting, the loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette was removed by Cre-recombinase expressed from transiently transfected vector pCAGGS-Cre (23Araki K. Araki M. Miyazaki J. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were diluted and grown for 6-7 days to obtain individual colonies without drug selection. Next, cells were replica-plated in media with and without drug to identify clones that had lost the marker due to removal of loxP drug resistance cassette. Throughout the knock-out construction procedure, each step was confirmed by Southern blotting. Isolation of Human ICAD-L and CAD cDNAs—Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated, and 5 μg was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Next, specific primers (Sigma-Genosys, Pampisford, UK) for hCAD (5′-AGCTCTAGAATGCTCCAGAAGCCC-3′,5′-AGCAAGCTTTCACTGGCGTTTCCG-3′) and hICAD-L (5′-AGCTCTAGAATGGAGGTGACCG-3′,5′-AGCGAATTCCTATGTGGGATCCTG-3′) were used to amplify human cDNAs encoding hICAD-L and hCAD. hICAD-S was constructed in a PCR reaction using hICAD-L as a template and the following primers: 5′-ATAAGAAGCGGCCGCATGGAGGTGACCGGG-3′ and 5′-ATGGGCGGCCGCTCAGTGACCCTGGTTTCCGCCCACCTCCAAATCCTGACTAGATAAGCTC-3′. Constructing hICAD-L and hICAD-S with Two TEV Sites (hICAD-L2TEV and hICAD-S2TEV)—The caspase-3 sites in hICAD-L and hICAD-S were replaced with TEV protease cleavage sites (24Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) using the strategy shown in Fig. 5. The insertion of the first TEV proteasesite was achieved after the synthesis with DNA Polymerase IKlenow fragment (New England Biolabs) using long oligonucleotides 5′-GCTTGGATATCCCAAGAGTCCTTTGATGTAGAGAACCTCTACTTCCAGAGCGACAGCGGGGCAGGGTTGAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGGACAGATCTTCTTTCAGCTGCCTGGCCACATTCTTCCACTTCAACCCTGCCCCGC-3′. To insert this fragment, an EcoRV site was engineered in the hICAD-L protein by point mutation without a resulting amino acid change using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The second site was partly synthesized with a DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment using oligonucleotides 5′-GCCTCTTGTCAAAGCAGGAAGAGTCCAAAGCTGCCTTTGGTGAGGAGGTGGAGAACCTCTACTTCCAGAGCGACACGGGTATCAGCAGAGAGACCTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-CCTGACTAGATAAGCTCAGCTCTGGAGCCTGCTTCTCCCTCAGTGCAGTAAGGATGTGGCTCGCCAGCGCAACGTCCGAGGAGGTCTCTCTGCTG-3′. The reaction product required the further extension by PCR with primers 5′-GCCTCTTGTCAAAGCAGGAAGAGTCCAAAGCTGCCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGACTAGATAAGCTCAGCTCTGGAGCCTGCTTCTCCCTCAG-3′. hICAD-S2TEV was constructed using a strategy similar to that for hICAD-S in a PCR reaction using hICAD-L2TEV as a template. Annexin V Assay—The progress of cells into apoptosis upon its induction with 10 μm etoposide was assessed with Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Fragmentation and DNA Condensation Assay—DT40 cells were grown to a concentration of 5 × 105/ml prior to the addition of etoposide (10 μm) to induce apoptosis. Aliquots of cells harvested at 0, 2, and 4 h were then used to isolate genomic DNA for fragmentation assay as described previously (25Korfali N. Ruchaud S. Loegering D. Bernard D. Dingwall C. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1030-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or for microscopy analysis. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The slides were analyzed using a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) as described previously (26Vagnarelli P. Hudson D.F. Ribeiro S.A. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Spence J.M. Lai F. Farr C.J. Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Anti-DFF45/ICAD N-terminal antibody (Sigma) was used (1:500) to detect human ICAD protein. Monoclonal antibody to human α-tubulin (clone B512) from Sigma was used at a 1:4000 concentration as a loading control. Assay for in Vitro Activation of CAD—Cytosolic extracts were prepared from DT40 cell lines in exponential growth. The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then in KPM buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). No protease inhibitors were added. The pellet was lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles and sonication and then centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Each reaction used 75 μg of extract protein/2 μg of plasmid DNA in CAD buffer (27Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) plus an ATP regenerating system (28Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 (200 units, Calbiochem) or TEV protease (20 units, Invitrogen) were added to the reaction with the cell extract and plasmid DNA and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After the reaction, plasmid DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and run on a 1.5% agarose gel. Construction of ICAD and ICAD/CAD Double Knock-outs in DT40 Cells—To study the function of ICAD and CAD in DT40 cells we constructed ICAD and ICAD/CAD double knock-outs, the latter starting with a CAD knock-out cell line described previously (11Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DT40 cells are characterized by a high frequency of homologous recombination (29Winding P. Berchtold M.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 249: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The ICAD pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced in DT40 cells (21Li X. Wang J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), producing ICAD-L and ICAD-S mRNAs similar to those described previously in mouse and human (17Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Sakahira H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkin N.A. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ICAD gene (located on chromosome 21 at location 3.727.659-3.730.862) has 6 exons (Fig. 1A). We designed an ICAD knock-out strategy that results in complete removal of the ICAD open reading frame. To do this, we constructed a targeting vector with a selection cassette (loxP-puro-tk-loxP) inserted between ICAD 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions (Fig. 1A). The cassette was flanked by mutant loxP sites to allow its removal by Cre-recombinase (22Arakawa H. Lodygin D. Buerstedde J.M. BMC Biotechnol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The removal of the cassette allows marker recycling so that only a single knock-out vector was required to disrupt both alleles. After transfection with the ICAD targeting vector, clones (Table 1) were isolated using puro as a selectable marker. Correct targeting was recognized by Southern blot analysis with a 5′-external probe, using BglII-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). The probe recognized a 5.3-kb band corresponding to a DNA fragment from the intact ICAD allele (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) plus a 15.5-kb band corresponding to the integrated loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). The correct integration was further verified with an ICAD 3′-external probe (data not shown). As a result, heterozygous clones with the genotype ICAD+/-*/CAD+/+ and ICAD+/-*/CAD-/- were isolated (the asterisk indicates alleles containing the tk gene). The total targeting efficiency of homologous recombination was 32% for isolating these ICAD+/- heterozygotes.TABLE 1List of cell lines used and constructed in this studyCell line no.Stable cell line nameGenotypeStably expressed proteinsMade from cell line no.

Hamzeh F. Moore S. Nicholas J. Ambinder R.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4786-4793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the negative selection of DT40 cells with ganciclovir was not effective (data not shown). To remove the loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette, ICAD+/-*/CAD+/+ and ICAD+/-*/CAD-/- clones were transiently transfected with vector pCAGGS-Cre expressing Cre-recombinase. The clones with removed cassette were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 5′-external probe (Fig. 1B) recognized the shift from 15.5 to 11.0 kb that occurred as a result of the removal of the 4.5-kb loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). As a result, clones with the genotype ICAD+/-/CAD+/+ and ICAD+/-/CAD-/- were isolated. The removal efficiency of the loxP-puro-tk-loxP cassette was 11%, so lack of the tk selection did not prove to be a significant impediment. We used an ICAD targeting vector with a loxP-puro-loxP cassette for the second targeting. The resulting drug-resistant clones were confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1B). The 5′-external probe recognized the disappearance of the 5.3-kb band corresponding to the intact ICAD allele and appearance of the 13.5-kb band corresponding to the fragment bearing the integrated loxP-puro-loxP cassette (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). The targeting efficiency for the second ICAD allele was 11%. To determine whether apoptosis proceeds normally in the ICAD and ICAD/CAD double knock-out cell lines, both were tested for the presence of phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the plasma membrane following treatment with etoposide (31Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can be detected using the binding of Annexin V (32Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of Annexin V-positive cells was tested in the wild type, ICAD, and ICAD/CAD double knock-outs after the induction of apoptosis with etoposide (Fig. 2). There was a small background amount of Annexin V-positive cells at time 0 in all cell lines. The number of Annexin V-positive cells increased dramatically 2 h after apoptosis was induced by etoposide, with nearly half of the cells becoming apoptotic at this point. By 4 h most cells were Annexin V-positive, with only minimal changes in the cultures thereafter. No difference in the kinetics of phosphatidylserine exposure was observed among the wild-type, ICAD-/-, and ICAD-/-/CAD-/- cells, indicating that deletion of the ICAD gene, either singly or in combination with CAD has no effect on the kinetics of cell death induction. In preliminary experiments, the cell death rate measured by trypan blue exclusion appeared to be lower in ICAD and ICAD/CAD double knock-outs (data not shown). That is consistent with another study in which mouse thymocytes lacking DFF45/ICAD-L were reported to be more resistant to several proapoptotic stimuli (33Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E. Xu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Thomas D.A. Du C. Xu M. Wang X. Ley T.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38185-38192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that CAD accelerates cellular demise after caspases have been activated. Oligonucleosomal DNA Fragmentation and Stage II DNA Condensation Are Absent in DT40 Knock-out Cells Lacking ICAD or ICAD Plus CAD—Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was undetectable in the ICAD knock-out and ICAD/CAD double knock-out cells upon induction of apoptosis with etoposide (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-15). In contrast, DNA fragmentation preceded efficiently in wild type DT40 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). The CAD knock-out had been characterized previously in DT40 and shown to lack DNA fragmentation (11Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This indicates that ICAD protein is absolutely required as a chaperone, which is consistent with results obtained in certain cells from ICAD knock-out mice (13Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Chromatin condensation was also affected in ICAD knock-out and ICAD/CAD double knock-out cells (Fig. 3B). Stage II chromatin condensation was absent in both knock-out cell lines upon induction of apoptosis. Only peripheral (stage I) chromatin condensation was observed. The knock-out phenotype resembled the DT40 CAD knock-out characterized previously (11Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis with etoposide for longer than 4 h did not result in DNA fragmentation or stage II chromatin condensation in any of these knock-out cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, CAD nuclease is required for stage II DNA condensation in DT40 cells, and stage I DNA condensation must be driven by another mechanism. Human ICAD and CAD Proteins Can Rescue the DNA Fragmentation Phenotype of DT40 ICAD-/-/CAD-/- Cells—To test whether ICAD/CAD function as an independent module for chromatin processing in apoptosis, as suggested by current models, we used the ICAD/CAD double knock-out cells to construct humanized DT40 cell lines expressing human ICAD and CAD (Table 1). DNA fragmentation and stage II chromatin condensation upon induction of apoptosis were completely rescued in ICAD/CAD double knock-out cell lines expressing hICAD-L and hCAD (Fig. 3A, lines 16-18, and B). This humanized cell line provided the basis for our further studies of the role of ICAD-S in CAD regulation. ICAD-S Does Not Work as a Folding Chaperone for CAD in Vivo—Given that hICAD-L plus hCAD could reconstitute the DNA destruction system in DT40 ICAD-/-/CAD-/- cells, we asked whether a similar rescue could be obtained using hICAD-S in place of hICAD-L (Table 1). After the induction of apoptosis by etoposide, hICAD-S was cleaved in these cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). However, no DNA fragmentation could be detected in these cell lines (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). Furthermore, chromatin condensation did not proceed beyond stage I, with small balls of chromatin distributed around the nuclear periphery (Fig. 4B). Therefore, hICAD-S cannot replace hICAD-L as a chaperone in vivo for the folding of active CAD. ICAD-S Inhibits CAD in Vivo—Importantly, ICAD is essential not only for the folding of active CAD but also for its subsequent inactivation until an appropriate apoptotic stimulus is detected. We therefore used the humanized cell system to test whether ICAD-S can act as an inhibitor of CAD in vivo (Table 1). To do this, we constructed a form of hICAD-S that was resistant to clea"

Katrin Schafer and Yun Ying will probably never cross paths. But if the 48-year-old biological anthropologist at the University of Vienna, Austria, and the 82-year-old physics educator at Southeast University in Nanjing, China, chanced to meet at a conference on global undergraduate education in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, they might recognize each other as kindred spirits.

Both Schafer and Yun are convinced that their students—native speakers of German and Chinese, respectively—need to possess a solid grasp of English to succeed as scientists or even lay claim to being scientifically literate citizens of the world. The hegemony of English is just one of many forces shaping undergraduate STEM education. This special issue looks at the topic by focusing on the lives of Schafer, Yun, and 10 other faculty members in a dozen countries on six continents. The group is meant to be representative of scientists teaching large numbers of undergraduates around the world. The list is skewed toward the most industrialized countries but also includes those in which the scientific infrastructure is developing rapidly. An accompanying map presents some basic information about higher education in each country.

Despite the vast differences in the makeup of their students, the policies that govern higher education, and the cultural and economic factors that shape the profession, these scientists speak in surprisingly similar voices. In story after story, they point to lagging interest and poor preparation in science among students, insufficient resources, heavy professional burdens, and antiscience attitudes in society at large. Yet there are patches of light among those dark clouds. Each faculty member has managed to bring science to life for students in exciting and innovative ways. They are also engaged in myriad activities outside the classroom—from informal science education to election campaigns—aimed at spreading knowledge and the values of scientific thinking.

For an additional perspective, Science invited three distinguished educators to explore the issues facing undergraduate STEM education. Excerpts of their comments appear in this issue; the complete discussion is available at [www.sciencemag.org/sciext/undergrad_education07][2]. This issue also marks the debut of the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment Journal Club, as well as three Teaching Resources.

We hope that you'll find the entire package compelling enough to alter your own worldview of undergraduate education. If it does, please let us know at [www.sciencemag.org/sciext/eletters][3].
