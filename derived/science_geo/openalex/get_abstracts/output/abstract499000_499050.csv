https://openalex.org/W2079574859,"Astrocytes perform crucial supportive functions, including neurotransmitter clearance, ion buffering, and metabolite delivery. They can also influence blood flow and neuronal activity by releasing gliotransmitters in response to intracellular Ca(2+) transients. However, little is known about how astrocytes are engaged during different behaviors in vivo. Here we demonstrate that norepinephrine primes astrocytes to detect changes in cortical network activity. We show in mice that locomotion triggers simultaneous activation of astrocyte networks in multiple brain regions. This global stimulation of astrocytes was inhibited by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists and abolished by depletion of norepinephrine from the brain. Although astrocytes in visual cortex of awake mice were rarely engaged when neurons were activated by light stimulation alone, pairing norepinephrine release with light stimulation markedly enhanced astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling. Our findings indicate that norepinephrine shifts the gain of astrocyte networks according to behavioral state, enabling astrocytes to respond to local changes in neuronal activity."

Traditional network models with stochastically assigned synapses cannot reproduce this behavior. Here we introduce a class of cortical architectures with strong and random excitatory recurrence that is stabilized by intricate, fine-tuned inhibition, optimized from a control theory perspective. Such networks transiently amplify specific activity states and can be used to reliably execute multidimensional movement patterns. Similar to the experimental observations, these transients must be preceded by a steady-state initialization phase from which the network relaxes back into the background state by way of complex internal dynamics. In our networks, excitation and inhibition are as tightly balanced as recently reported in experiments across several brain areas, suggesting inhibitory control of complex excitatory recurrence as a generic organizational principle in cortex."

This learning, however, is sensitive to system changes such as the neural activity used for control. The ultimate utility of neuroplasticity in real-world neuroprostheses is thus unclear. Adaptive decoding methods hold promise for improving neuroprosthetic performance in nonstationary systems. Here, we explore the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: nonstationary recordings of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task using semistationary neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference from native motor networks.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) create novel functional circuits for action that are distinct from the natural motor system (Carmena, 2013Carmena J.M. Advances in neuroprosthetic learning and control.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001561Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Motor BMIs map recorded neural activity into a control signal for an actuator via an algorithm (the “decoder”). Feedback of the actuator movement creates a closed-loop system, allowing the user to modify their behavior in a goal-directed way. Many studies found that the relationship between neural activity and movement changes substantially between natural movements and BMI control (Taylor et al., 2002Taylor D.M. Tillery S.I.

These changes are likely due in part to key differences between the natural motor and BMI systems, such as different sensory feedback (Suminski et al., 2009Suminski A.J. Tkach D.C. Hatsopoulos N.G.

Increasing evidence also shows that neural activity changes in closed-loop BMI control are related to operant conditioning of neural activity facilitated by biofeedback (Fetz, 2007Fetz E.E.

Plasticity has also been associated with the formation of decoder-specific patterns of cortical activity with respect to movement (a “cortical map”) with properties akin to a motor memory trace (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These cortical maps are highly stable, rapidly recalled, and—once formed—resistant to interference from learning other BMI decoders. We refer to these collective properties as “neuroprosthetic skill,” reflecting performance and neural representations that are robust over time and resistant to interference. Learning may also facilitate the formation of BMI-specific control networks. Learning-related changes in cortical (Ganguly et al., 2011Ganguly K. Dimitrov D.F. Wallis J.D. Carmena J.M. Reversible large-scale modification of cortical networks during neuroprosthetic control.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and corticostriatal plasticity (Koralek et al., 2013Koralek A.C. Costa R.M. Carmena J.M. Temporally precise cell-specific coherence develops in corticostriatal networks during learning.Neuron. 2013; 79: 865-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) show specificity for BMI control neurons. The development of skilled BMI control has also been associated with reduced cognitive effort, linked to the formation of a control network distributed broadly across cortex (Wander et al., 2013Wander J.D. Blakely T. Miller K.J. Weaver K.E. Johnson L.A. Olson J.D. Fetz E.E. Rao R.P.N. Ojemann J.G. Distributed cortical adaptation during learning of a brain-computer interface task.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 10818-10823Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Together, this body of work suggests that neuroplasticity may create a specialized BMI control network that allows skillful control. The robust control attained via neuroplasticity may be particularly useful for neuroprosthetic applications, but several factors could limit the feasibility of such learning in real-world systems. In particular, cortical map formation has been shown to be sensitive to the details of the BMI system, such as the neurons input into the decoder and decoder parameters. Training new decoders regularly, even with the same neural ensemble, eliminated cortical map formation and the associated performance improvements. After a decoder was learned, removing units from the BMI ensemble also led to significantly reduced performance (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, studies tracking subjects’ performance for weeks to months using daily decoder retraining and nonstable neural ensembles show day-to-day variability in performance (Taylor et al., 2002Taylor D.M.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Maintaining well-isolated, highly stable neural activity for the multiyear lifespan of a neuroprosthesis is infeasible with existing recording techniques; therefore, the ultimate utility of neuroplasticity in these settings is uncertain. Learning’s sensitivity to changes in the BMI system highlights the fact that closed-loop BMI performance is determined by collaboration between the brain and decoding algorithm. Much as neural adaptation has proven beneficial, recent work shows the potential promise of adaptive decoders to improve performance. Closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA)—modification of decoder parameters based on closed-loop performance (Dangi et al., 2013Dangi S. Orsborn A.L. Moorman H.G. Carmena J.M.

Advantages of closed-loop calibration in intracortical brain-computer interfaces for people with tetraplegia.J. Neural Eng. 2013; 10: 046012Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CLDA may be particularly useful for compensating for nonstationary neural recordings (Li et al., 2011Li Z. O’Doherty J.E. Lebedev M.A. Nicolelis M.A.L. Adaptive decoding for brain-machine interfaces through Bayesian parameter updates.Neural Comput. 2011; 23: 3162-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and has been shown to produce high-performance BMI control for many months independent of stationary neural recordings (Gilja et al., 2012Gilja V. Nuyujukian P. Chestek C.A. Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Fan J.M. Churchland M.M. Kaufman M.T. Kao J.C. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. A high-performance neural prosthesis enabled by control algorithm design.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Decoder adaptation could potentially be used to facilitate and maintain learning in the presence of changing neural inputs to the BMI. However, relatively little is known about how neural and decoder adaptation might interact, and whether cortical maps can form and be maintained in such a two-learner system. Changing decoder parameters could, for instance, create a “moving target” that disrupts formation of stable neural solutions. Early work shows that neural plasticity can occur alongside adaptive decoders (Taylor et al., 2002Taylor D.M. Tillery S.I. Schwartz A.B. Direct cortical control of 3D neuroprosthetic devices.Science. 2002; 296: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar), but the formation of stable, rapidly recalled cortical maps and BMI-specialized neural circuits in two-learner systems has yet to be explored. Attaining and maintaining neuroprosthetic skill with nonstationary decoders and neural ensembles will be important for the ultimate feasibility of leveraging beneficial neuroplasticity in real-world prostheses. Beyond changes in neural recordings, real-world neuroprostheses must also be robust to changes in control context. Much like our natural limbs, neuroprostheses will ultimately be used for a myriad of behaviors and in coordination with existing motor and cognitive functions. Tasks that activate brain areas near or overlapping with those used for BMI control, however, may cause performance disruptions. BMI learning and control to date have primarily been studied when subjects control a BMI isolated from other tasks. Learning and associated cortical map formation might be critical for achieving performance that can transfer across contexts. In this study, we test the feasibility of combining neural and decoder adaptation to achieve and maintain neuroprosthetic skill in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: (1) nonstationary recorded neural activity, and (2) changing control contexts. Two nonhuman primates controlled a two-dimensional cursor using neural activity in motor cortices in the absence of overt arm movements. The stability constraints on neural inputs to the BMI were relaxed by using multi-unit and/or channel-level activity, and the population of units contributing to the decoder was intermittently changed over time. CLDA was used to both improve initial performance of the decoder, and to maintain performance in the presence of nonstationary recordings. We asked whether neuroprosthetic skill would develop in such a system, and explored the interaction between neural and decoder adaptation. To further test the formation of skilled control in this two-learner system and explore the potential benefits of such a skill, we then studied BMI control in a simultaneous BMI and native arm control task. Our findings suggest that leveraging both neural and decoder adaptation may be useful for achieving robust, flexible neuroprosthetic control that can be maintained long term. To explore whether beneficial neuroplasticity and cortical map formation can occur in a two-learner BMI system, we developed a neuroprosthetic training paradigm to exploit both neural and decoder adaptation (Figure 1A). Our approach used infrequent and minimal CLDA (Figure 1B), interspersed with long periods of fixed decoders. CLDA was used on day 1 to improve initial closed-loop performance. Subsequent practice with a fixed decoder provided the opportunity for neural adaptation and skill consolidation. In the event of a performance drop, or shift in the recorded neural activity (e.g., a unit contributing to the decoder was lost), brief periods of CLDA were used to adjust the decoder (see Table S1 available online and Experimental Procedures). We implemented our CLDA method in two nonhuman primates performing a two-dimensional self-paced delayed center-out reaching task under neuroprosthetic control (Figures 1C–1E, see Experimental Procedures). Subjects were first trained to perform the task with their native arm (manual control, MC) in an exoskeleton. In BMI control, both monkeys performed the task irrespective of overt native arm movement; their arms were positioned outside of the task workspace used for MC. BMI control was implemented with a position-velocity Kalman filter (KF) controlled by small ensembles of multi-unit or channel-level activity (hereafter all referred to as units; see Experimental Procedures). Initial decoders were typically trained using passive observation of cursor movements (see Experimental Procedures). CLDA was performed using the SmoothBatch (Orsborn et al., 2012Orsborn A.L. Dangi S. Moorman H.G. Carmena J.M. Closed-loop decoder adaptation on intermediate time-scales facilitates rapid BMI performance improvements independent of decoder initialization conditions.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng. 2012; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or Re-FIT (Gilja et al., 2012Gilja V. Nuyujukian P. Chestek C.A. Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Fan J.M. Churchland M.M. Kaufman M.T. Kao J.C. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. A high-performance neural prosthesis enabled by control algorithm design.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) algorithm for monkeys J and S, respectively. Although these CLDA methods are capable of providing high-performance decoders using decoder adaptation alone, initial CLDA was usually performed just until the subject was able to successfully navigate the cursor across the workspace. This allowed ample room for improvement driven by neural adaptation. However, the degree of initial adaptation varied across series (see below). Task performance showed clear improvements across days in both monkeys (Figure 2A). Cursor trajectories were also refined, with a reduction in the average movement error (Figures 2A and B). CLDA on day 1 substantially improved performance beyond that achieved with the initial decoder. Performance continued to improve after the decoder was held fixed on subsequent days. Intermittent CLDA was able to compensate for performance drops and changes in the neural ensemble, and performance improvements continued after midseries modifications. Subjects also showed intraday learning that was retained across days (Figure 2C). That is, there was little to no re-learning on days when the decoder was held static with a stable neural ensemble. These trends held across multiple series performed by both subjects (Figure 2D). A comparison of performance on day 1 (after initial adaptation; “Early”) with the maximum performance achieved during the series (“Late”) shows significant improvements in all behavioral measures (one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test; p < 0.05). Subjects showed gradual refinement of cursor control, with continued improvements in movement errors and success rates even after task success (percent correct) reached a plateau (Figure 2A). These improvements were absent when CLDA was used each day to maximize performance starting from varying initial decoders that used differing neural ensembles. Whereas CLDA could achieve high task performance, movement kinematics showed no improvements (Figures S1A and S1B). Daily performance also showed variability commonly observed with daily retraining (e.g., Taylor et al., 2002Taylor D.M. Tillery S.I. Schwartz A.B.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This finding confirms that observed learning was not purely reflective of increased practice in BMI and highlights the importance of some degree of neural and decoder stability for learning. However, there are several possible explanations for the lack of learning with daily CLDA. These experiments not only applied CLDA more often, but also made more abrupt decoder changes day-to-day (by retraining from a new seed daily) and varied the neural ensembles. Alternately, CLDA may saturate performance, making additional improvements infeasible. To better understand these factors, we ran an additional experiment with monkey J where CLDA was run continuously each day starting from the previous day’s parameters with a semistationary neural ensemble (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The subject showed gradual performance improvement (Figure S1E), suggesting that frequent CLDA, in and of itself, may not disrupt learning. It also further shows the potential for performance improvements beyond that attained by initial CLDA. These findings imply that a two-learner BMI might achieve higher performance than CLDA or neural adaptation alone. Finally, to further verify that learning was decoder specific, we tested performance with novel decoders with monkey J. Closed-loop performance dropped significantly when using unpracticed test decoders (Figures S1C and S1D). Similar to previous studies (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), these perturbations were reversible and high levels of performance quickly returned when learned decoders were reinstated. We next explored neural activity underlying task improvements and robust recall of performance. The directional tuning of units contributing to the BMI cursor was assessed each day within learning series (see Experimental Procedures) to determine how the relationship between cursor movement and neural activity changed over time. Figures 3A–3C show cosine tuning curve fits for three example units for 4 days within a learning series. Unit tuning properties (modulation depth and preferred direction; subsequently denoted as MDU and PDU, respectively) changed gradually over the course of a series for the majority of units within the ensemble (Figure 3D). To quantify learning-related neural tuning changes at the population level, we performed a direction tuning map analysis (Ganguly and Carmena, 2009Ganguly K. Carmena J.M. Emergence of a stable cortical map for neuroprosthetic control.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000153Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The fitted tuning curves for the BMI ensemble for each day form a cortical map. We performed pairwise correlations among the daily maps within a learning series (see Experimental Procedures). Maps were more strongly correlated to one another late in learning, showing the stabilization of a neural representation (Figure 3E). The average correlation of each day’s map with all others, which reflects the degree of map stability, increased late in learning, with a time course very similar to the task performance improvements (Figure 3F). Similar changes and stabilization of unit activity were also observed when continuous CLDA was performed (Figures S1F–S1K). Together, these behavioral and neural results show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur with semistationary BMI circuits. Moreover, both performance improvements and cortical map formation were not sensitive to midseries changes in the BMI ensemble. Recorded units were only partially stationary, showing slight variability in waveforms and firing properties during native arm movements (Figure S2). Cortical maps computed in arm movement and visual observation tasks did not show stabilization trends for monkey J (Figures S2A–S2C), suggesting that the emergence of a stable map in BMI control cannot be attributed to this recording variability. Furthermore, cortical map stability and behavioral improvements were not impeded by small ensemble membership changes (Figure S2H). Little is known about how learning might be distributed across a two-learner BMI system. We thus examined the relationship between neural and decoder adaptation. We hypothesized that stable neural representations would form regardless of the initial amount of CLDA, but that the degree to which the subject improved performance after initial CLDA would influence the degree of neural adaptation.

Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by low IQ and behavioral deficits, reaching a prevalence of 1%–3% worldwide. This is a devastating brain disorder in which many patients are unable to care for themselves, placing a tremendous emotional and economic burden on families and society (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2004Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Economic costs associated with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, and vision impairment—United States, 2003.MMWR Morb.

SYNGAP1/Syngap1 (now referred to as Syngap1 for simplicity) is among the most commonly mutated genes in sporadic ID.

Considering the relatively high prevalence of sporadic ID in the population, the surprising frequency of pathogenic Syngap1 mutations in enriched patient populations suggest that there are tens-of-thousands of undocumented individuals carrying these mutations. Affected individuals also have a high incidence of childhood seizures and autism spectrum disorder. Syngap1 haploinsufficiency has been causally linked to epileptic encephalopathy, a devastating and often fatal form of childhood epilepsy that dramatically impairs cognitive development (Carvill et al., 2013Carvill G.L. Heavin S.B. Yendle S.C. McMahon J.M. O’Roak B.J. Cook J. Khan A. Dorschner M.O. Weaver M. Calvert S. et al.Targeted resequencing in epileptic encephalopathies identifies de novo mutations in CHD2 and SYNGAP1.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These recently identified patients with epileptic encephalopathy and Syngap1 mutations also share ID and autism spectrum disorder comorbidities. Thus, proper Syngap1 gene dosage is essential for the normal development of human cognition and appears to modify important aspects of neural excitability and sociability. The Syngap1 heterozygous knockout mouse line (Syngap1+/−) has emerged as a robust model to understand the patho-neurobiology that underlies reduced cognitive ability and neural hyperexcitability in sporadic ID and epilepsy. Syngap1+/− mice display significant cognitive, emotional, and social abnormalities, which supports the idea that inactivating mutations of this gene directly cause cognitive impairment (Berryer et al., 2013Berryer M.H.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that damage to developing glutamatergic neurons may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in Syngap1 mutants. However, a causal link between cognitive defects in Syngap1 haploinsufficiency and developing glutamatergic neurons has not been shown. The change in glutamatergic neuron synapse development could be an inconsequential secondary outcome arising from dysfunction in other cell subtypes. Indeed, elegant studies in models of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have shown that a single pathogenic mutation can affect the function of various cell types in the brain (Chao et al., 2010Chao H.T. Chen H. Samaco R.C. Xue M. Chahrour M. Yoo J. Neul J.L. Gong S. Lu H.C.

A role for glia in the progression of Rett’s syndrome.Nature. 2011; 475: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that multiple cell types are sufficient to drive cognitive, behavioral, and/or electrophysiological abnormalities in the CNS of NDD models. Thus, it remains unclear if altered development of glutamatergic neurons contributes importantly to cognitive deficits in Syngap1 mutants. In addition, it is not known if other neuronal subtypes are also sufficient to drive cognitive abnormalities in these mice. Complete restoration of Syngap1 protein expression (SynGAP) in adult mutants has no detectable benefit on behavior and cognition, demonstrating that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency is a disorder of brain development (Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J. Miller C.A. et al.Pathogenic SYNGAP1 mutations impair cognitive development by disrupting maturation of dendritic spine synapses.Cell. 2012; 151: 709-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all currently reported baseline neurophysiological abnormalities observed in young glutamatergic neurons of Syngap1+/− mice, such as enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, are transiently expressed during development (Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, it also remains unclear how Syngap1 mutations in development affect adult brain function. Indeed, because the abnormal cognition persists throughout life, these findings suggest that there are undiscovered neurophysiological abnormalities in adult mice that arise from abnormal brain development and reflect abnormal cognition. To explore causal links between Syngap1 dysfunction in developing glutamatergic neurons, stabilized changes to adult brain function, and altered cognitive ability, we combined cell-type specific and inducible conditional mouse lines with behavioral endophenotyping and electrophysiology. Using this approach, we found that germline Syngap1 mutations induced a persistent form of stabilized cortical hyperexcitability that lasted into adulthood. Remarkably, this was caused exclusively by abnormal function of developing glutamatergic neurons located in the forebrain, because no phenotypic role for Syngap1 in neurons that release GABA was apparent. Unexpectedly, abnormalities in developing glutamatergic neurons caused an emergent, secondary disruption to glutamatergic synaptic strength in adult neurons that reliably predicted the presence of reduced cognition. These data demonstrate that altered neurodevelopmental processes in a single sensitive cell type can perpetuate brain dysfunction into adulthood by altering excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance through a disruption of synaptic homeostasis. We sought to investigate how altered brain development in Syngap1+/− mice disrupts the function of the adult CNS. First, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) paired with video monitoring to examine spontaneous cortical activity in mutants (Figure 1A), which revealed frequent and widespread cortical discharges of high amplitude in mature Syngap1+/− mice (>12 weeks), but not in wild-type (WT) littermates. These epileptiform discharges were intermittent, ranging in frequency from 1 to 681/hour (average 81/hr). However, they did not coincide with any significant motor events. Interestingly, cortical generalized seizures with myoclonic features have also been reported in patients with Syngap1 loss of function mutations (Berryer et al., 2013Berryer M.H. Hamdan F.F. Klitten L.L. Møller R.S. Carmant L. Schwartzentruber J. Patry L. Dobrzeniecka S. Rochefort D. Neugnot-Cerioli M. et al.Mutations in SYNGAP1 cause intellectual disability, autism, and a specific form of epilepsy by inducing haploinsufficiency.Hum. Mutat. 2013; 34: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and with lower cognitive ability (Carvill et al., 2013Carvill G.L. Heavin S.B. Yendle S.C. McMahon J.M. O’Roak B.J. Cook J. Khan A. Dorschner M.O. Weaver M. Calvert S. et al.Targeted resequencing in epileptic encephalopathies identifies de novo mutations in CHD2 and SYNGAP1.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We reasoned that cortical hyperexcitability might reflect a reduced seizure threshold in adult mutants. A flurothyl-induced activation paradigm (Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J. Miller C.A. et al.Pathogenic SYNGAP1 mutations impair cognitive development by disrupting maturation of dendritic spine synapses.Cell. 2012; 151: 709-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) revealed a clear reduction in seizure threshold in two distinct Syngap1 haploinsufficient mouse lines (Figure 1B). To determine if network hyperexcitability in mutants was preserved in ex vivo preparations, we performed fast voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging in acute brain slices derived from adult Syngap1 animals. Slices from adult Syngap1+/− mice resulted in significantly larger signals throughout the cortex when compared to slices derived from WT littermates (Figure 1C). Because SynGAP is a potent regulator of glutamatergic synapse function (Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J.

SynGAP regulates synaptic strength and mitogen-activated protein kinases in cultured neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 4344-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that elevated unitary synaptic strength in cortical pyramidal neurons contributes to slice hyperexcitability. To test this idea, we measured miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in acute slices prepared from WT or Syngap1+/− mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). Interestingly, mEPSCs were normal in young cortical neurons (Figures 2C–2E). However, by adulthood, there was an increase in both the amplitude and frequency of the events (Figures 2F–2H). We also patched neurons in slices derived from the Syngap1+/lx-st mice. Neurons from this mouse line also exhibited enhanced mEPSC function in Layer 2/3 neurons (Figures 2I–K). To determine if the E/I ratio was disrupted in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we acquired miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from neurons in slices derived from adult Syngap1+/− or WT littermates. There was a reduction in mIPSC amplitude in conventional Syngap1+/− mice (Figure 2L), but no change in mIPSC properties in the Syngap1+/lx-st mice (Figure 2M). However, because excitatory unitary synaptic strength was increased in both models relative to GABAergic neuron synaptic transmission, this is consistent with an elevated E/I ratio in mature mPFC cortical neurons in mice with Syngap1 haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, L2/3 neurons were hyperexcitable in response to evoked neurotransmitter release (Figure S1 available online). We next measured electrically isolated excitatory and inhibitory evoked responses from individual L2/3 pyramidal cells in mPFC slices from adult WT and Syngap1 mutants (Figures S1A–S1C). There was no significant effect of peak excitatory responses in the basal pathway, although there was an increase in the slope of the input/output curve (Figures S1D and S1E). Importantly, evoked E/I balance was significantly shifted in both pathways (Figures S1L and S1M), which is consistent with our mEPSC/mIPSC data and supports the conclusion that L2/3 neurons are hyperexcitable in Syngap1 mutants. To this point, our measurements have been restricted to synaptic properties of L2/3 pyramidal neurons. However, there are other possible cellular causes of network hyperexcitability, such as alterations to the function of distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons in the superficial cortex (Figure 2B). Therefore, we probed Syngap1 mutants for changes in two major subtypes of cortical GABAergic neurons. To label Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in the Syngap1+/− background, we crossed Syngap1+/− mice that also contained the Ai9 Cre-dependent reporter allele (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar) with PV+-ires-Cre driver mice (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005Hippenmeyer S. Vrieseling E. Sigrist M. Portmann T. Laengle C. Ladle D.R. Arber S. A developmental switch in the response of DRG neurons to ETS transcription factor signaling.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e159Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). tdTomato+ (TD+) neurons from both genotypes exhibited properties consistent with those of PV+ neurons (Table S1; Helm et al., 2013Helm J. Akgul G. Wollmuth L.P. Subgroups of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in layers 2/3 of the visual cortex.J.

Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There were no genotype differences in firing properties of these cells at PND 14 (Figure 3B). In contrast, there was a substantial decrease in firing rate in PV+ neurons in Syngap1+/− mice by 6 weeks of age (Figure 3C), which was consistent with cortical hyperexcitability. Interestingly, by 9 weeks of age, the difference between genotypes was no longer significant (Figure 3D). We next measured unitary synaptic strength onto PV+ neurons in mature animals. Overall, there was a small reduction in mEPSC amplitude in PV+ neurons (Figure 3E). However, this was only present in males (two-way ANOVA for PV+ mEPSC amplitude: genotype effect, F(1,61) = 6.00, p = 0.02; sex effect F(1,61) = 5.01, p = 0.03; genotype∗sex F(1,61) = 4.72, p = 0.03). In contrast, there was no sex-genotype interaction in L2/3 pyramidal cell mEPSC properties (two-way ANOVA for L2/3 neuron mEPSC amplitude: genotype effect, F(1,102) = 11.22, p = 0.0011; sex effect, F(1,102) = 6.24, p = 0.014;genotype∗sex, F(1,102) = 0.054, p = 0.81. Two-way ANOVA for L2/3 neuron mEPSC frequency: genotype effect, F(1,102) = 17.42, p = 0.0000629; sex effect, F(1,102) = 0.003, p = 0.96;genotype∗sex, F(1,102) = 0.35, p = 0.55; combined data). Thus, PV+ neurons may contribute to hyperexcitability at some stages of development, but individual changes in cellular and synaptic properties in these neurons do not stabilize in the fully mature CNS. We next probed for potential cellular disruptions in somatostatin-positive (SST+) local inhibitory neurons. Surprisingly, there were no genotype effects in any major cellular or synaptic measures in adult (>9 weeks) SST+ neurons (Figures 3F–3I; Table S1). There was a robust increase in action potential width of these neurons. However, this is a relatively minor physiological disruption with an unknown impact on network function (Table S1). Together, these data indicate that critical measures of inhibition are largely unaffected in the fully mature superficial cortex of Syngap1 mutants. Increased pyramidal cell excitatory synaptic strength appeared to be a reliable signature of altered neurophysiological function in the mutant cortex, suggesting that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency is principally a disease of altered glutamatergic neuron function. However, an abundance of SynGAP protein is found in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in various cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, including heavy expression in the striatum (Moon et al., 2008Moon I.S.

Therefore, we explored the behavioral contribution of in vivo Syngap1 dysfunction in distinct cellular populations. In the first set of experiments, we crossed the conditional knockout line (Syngap1+/fl; Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H.

Importantly, SynGAP is a neuron-enriched gene (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

SynGAP levels were reduced in the hippocampus, but not striatum, in extracts taken from Emx1-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice (Figure 4B). Importantly, a reduction in SynGAP protein levels was also observed in the frontal cortex (Figure S2). The behaviors displayed by Emx1-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice were indistinguishable from those of conventional Syngap1 mutants. Relative to WT littermates, EMX1-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice spent more time in the open arm of the elevated plus maze (Figure 4C), were hyperactive in the open field (Figure 4D), and failed to spontaneously alternate (Figure 4E). Conventional Syngap1 Het mice had deficits in remote (30 day old) fear memory (Figure S3), allowing us to include an additional measure of cognition in the behavioral battery. Again, similar to conventional Syngap1 mutants, Emx1-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice exhibited a remote memory deficit (Figure 4F). We next assessed adult seizure threshold. Consistent with the behavioral endophenotyping results, the Emx1-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice also had a reduced seizure threshold (Figure 4G) that was qualitatively similar to conventional germline Syngap1 mutants (Figure 1B). To induce haploinsufficiency in developing GABAergic neurons, we next crossed Syngap1 conditional knockout mice to Gad2-ires-Cre driver mice (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D. Fu Y. Lu J.

A reduction in SynGAP expression in the striatum, but not hippocampus, confirmed haploinsufficiency in the target neuronal population (Figure 4I). Unexpectedly, SynGAP levels in the hippocampus of Gad2-Cre mice increased slightly. Therefore, we also probed SynGAP expression levels in the frontal cortex of Gad2-Cre;Syngap1+/fl mice. There was no change in SynGAP expression (Figure S2), which is consistent with low expression of SynGAP in cortical GABAergic neurons (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang W. Vazquez L. Apperson M. Kennedy M.B. Citron binds to PSD-95 at glutamatergic synapses on inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 96-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite SynGAP expression being reduced in GABAergic neurons in the CNS, including the striatum, there were no changes in behavior or seizure threshold (Figures 4J–4N). If disruptions to forebrain glutamatergic neurons are the primary driver of the endophenotype in Syngap1+/− mice, then rescuing the mutation exclusively in this population should protect animals from developing behavioral abnormalities. To test this, we crossed EMX1- or GAD2-ires-Cre driver mice to the Syngap1 conditional rescue line (Syngap1+/lx-st; Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J.

https://openalex.org/W1994083272,"Sleep spindles are major transient oscillations of the mammalian brain. Spindles are generated in the thalamus; however, what determines their duration is presently unclear. Here, we measured somatic activity of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) cells together with axonal activity of reciprocally coupled inhibitory reticular thalamic cells (nRTs) and quantified cycle-by-cycle alterations in their firing in vivo. We found that spindles with different durations were paralleled by distinct nRT activity, and nRT firing sharply dropped before the termination of all spindles. Both initial nRT and TC activity was correlated with spindle length, but nRT correlation was more robust. Analysis of spindles evoked by optogenetic activation of nRT showed that spindle probability, but not spindle length, was determined by the strength of the light stimulus. Our data indicate that during natural sleep a dynamically fluctuating thalamocortical network controls the duration of sleep spindles via the major inhibitory element of the circuits, the nRT."

Both long-term synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning require de novo RNA and protein synthesis (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009Costa-Mattioli M. Sossin W.S. Klann E. Sonenberg N.

A large body of work has shown that activity-dependent endocytosis and AMPA receptor recycling mediate diverse forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity (Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Synaptic AMPA receptor plasticity and behavior.Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, Newpher and Ehlers, 2008Newpher T.M. Ehlers M.D. Glutamate receptor dynamics in dendritic microdomains.Neuron. 2008; 58: 472-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, the transient induction and tight regulation of Arc levels have been proposed to tune synaptic strength by adjusting postsynaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors. Notably, once induced, Arc undergoes rapid protein turnover (Rao et al., 2006Rao V.R. Pintchovski S.A. Chin J. Peebles C.L. Mitra S. Finkbeiner S. AMPA receptors regulate transcription of the plasticity-related immediate-early gene Arc.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), ensuring a discrete temporal window for Arc-dependent plasticity. Across phylogeny, protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates many aspects of synapse function (DiAntonio and Hicke, 2004DiAntonio A. Hicke L. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of the synapse.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Mabb and Ehlers, 2010Mabb A.M. Ehlers M.D. Ubiquitination in postsynaptic function and plasticity.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 179-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). At mammalian hippocampal synapses, long-term alterations in synaptic activity cause global changes in the composition of postsynaptic proteins via the UPS (Ehlers, 2003Ehlers M.D. Activity level controls postsynaptic composition and signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus requires a balance between protein synthesis and proteasomal degradation (Fonseca et al., 2006Fonseca R. Vabulas R.M. Hartl F.U. Bonhoeffer T. Nägerl U.V. A balance of protein synthesis and proteasome-dependent degradation determines the maintenance of LTP.Neuron. 2006; 52: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting that newly synthesized plasticity proteins are subject to ubiquitin-dependent turnover for reliable synapse function. Additionally, a variety of activity-induced proteins, including Arc, are degraded by the UPS (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Rao et al., 2006Rao V.R. Pintchovski S.A. Chin J. Peebles C.L. Mitra S. Finkbeiner S. AMPA receptors regulate transcription of the plasticity-related immediate-early gene Arc.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Arc is targeted for UPS degradation and how Arc turnover is coupled to endocytic function remain poorly defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Triad3A/RNF216 ubiquitinates Arc and promotes its proteasomal degradation. Using live-cell imaging and biochemical analysis, we show that Triad3A localizes to clathrin-coated pits and controls Arc turnover. Overexpression of Triad3A reduces levels of Arc, resulting in an increased abundance of synaptic AMPA receptors. Conversely, loss of Triad3A leads to elevated Arc levels and downregulation of AMPA receptors. Furthermore, overexpression of Triad3A prevents homeostatic synaptic scaling and mGluR-dependent synaptic depression, whereas in the absence of Triad3A, these Arc-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity are mimicked and occluded. Thus, degradation of Arc by clathrin-localized Triad3A regulates synaptic strength by limiting the endocytic trafficking of AMPA receptors. Such spatial control of protein degradation at synapses provides a mechanism for limiting the duration of plasticity protein action in response to bouts of activity. The translation of Arc mRNA is rapidly induced by synaptic activity in an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent manner in vivo (Lyford et al., 1995Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F.

Worley P.F. Selective targeting of newly synthesized Arc mRNA to active synapses requires NMDA receptor activation.Neuron. 2001; 30: 227-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We recapitulated this manipulation in vitro by treating cultured hippocampal neurons with 4-aminopyridine (4AP), a blocker of Kv1 family K+ channels, together with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist bicuculline (4AP/Bic), to enhance synaptic and network activity (Kawashima et al., 2009Kawashima T. Okuno H. Nonaka M. Adachi-Morishima A. Kyo N. Okamura M. Takemoto-Kimura S. Worley P.F. Bito H. Synaptic activity-responsive element in the Arc/Arg3.1 promoter essential for synapse-to-nucleus signaling in activated neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Using this protocol, Arc protein expression is robustly induced (Figure S1A available online) (Kawashima et al., 2009Kawashima T. Okuno H. Nonaka M. Adachi-Morishima A. Kyo N. Okamura M. Takemoto-Kimura S. Worley P.F. Bito H. Synaptic activity-responsive element in the Arc/Arg3.1 promoter essential for synapse-to-nucleus signaling in activated neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The 4AP/Bic-induced increase in Arc protein was prevented by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX; 2 μM) (Figure S1A). Following its induction by 4AP/Bic, Arc protein rapidly decays in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (Figure S1A), indicating the robust degradation of newly synthesized Arc. To measure the half-life of newly synthesized Arc following increased neuronal activity, we performed pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments in cortical neurons. Newly synthesized Arc was radiolabeled with 35S-cysteine/methionine (35S-Cys/Met) under conditions of elevated activity (4AP/Bic). Neurons were then chased by incubation with unlabeled amino acids over time (Figure 1A). With elevated synaptic activity, we observed robust induction, followed by a rapid decay of labeled Arc protein. The half-life of newly synthesized Arc protein was 45 ± 10 min (Figure 1A), which is consistent with previous observations (Rao et al., 2006Rao V.R. Pintchovski S.A. Chin J. Peebles C.L. Mitra S. Finkbeiner S. AMPA receptors regulate transcription of the plasticity-related immediate-early gene Arc.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To test whether the rapid degradation of Arc is mediated by the UPS, we incubated cortical neurons with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 μM, 1 hr), following treatment with 4AP/Bic. In addition to the induction of Arc protein by synaptic activity (3-fold induction compared to TTX, p < 0.05), Arc levels were further augmented upon treatment with MG132 (Figures S1B and S1C; 1.5-fold relative to 4AP/Bic alone, p < 0.05). We also observed increased Arc levels on MG132 treatment by immunocytochemical staining of hippocampal neurons (Figures S1D and S1E). Endogenous Arc protein was robustly induced and ubiquitinated in cortical neurons following treatment with 4AP/Bic (Figure 1B). A similar increase in total and ubiquitinated Arc occurred in mouse hippocampus in vivo following seizure induction using pilocarpine (Figure 1C). Thus, upon increased activity, Arc protein is rapidly synthesized but then quickly degraded by the UPS both in vitro and in vivo. To identify binding partners that regulate Arc degradation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length Arc as bait against a mouse brain complementary DNA (cDNA) library. We identified a strong interaction between Arc and the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase Triad3A/RNF216 (Figure S1F). Analysis of isolated clones mapped the interaction to the N-terminal domain of Triad3A upstream of the RING-IBR-RING domain (amino acids 201–470) and the C-terminal domain of Arc encompassing the spectrin-like homology repeats (amino acids 94–382) (Figure 1D). Triad3A was initially identified as a RING domain ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in the ubiquitination of toll-like receptors (Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Triad3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Triad3A is the major splice variant of Triad3, which encodes five splice variants, Triad3A–Triad3E (Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Triad3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Among these splice variants, Triad3A is most highly expressed in brain (Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Triad3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), including hippocampus, neocortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum (Figures S1G and S1H). Biochemical fractionation indicated the presence of Triad3A protein in both presynaptic vesicle (S3) and postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions, although abundance in the PSD fraction was lower (Figure 1E). When coexpressed in HEK293T cells, myc-tagged Arc coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-tagged Triad3A and vice versa (Figure 1F). In addition, endogenous Arc protein coimmunoprecipitated with Triad3A from hippocampal extracts of mice on induction of Arc by pilocarpine-induced seizures (Figure 1G). After transfecting human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with Arc and increasing amounts of Triad3A cDNA, immunoblot analysis indicated a progressive loss of Arc protein with increased Triad3A (Figure 2A). In addition, coexpression of myc-Arc with hemagglutinin (HA)-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) revealed robust Arc ubiquitination in the presence of Triad3A (Figure 2B). In contrast to wild-type Triad3A, expression of mutant Triad3A lacking the second RING domain (Triad3A-ΔR2) did not promote Arc ubiquitination (Figure 2B). The predominant Triad3 isoforms in the brain are Triad3A, -3D, and -3E (Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Triad3A, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), splice variants that differ only in their N-terminal domains (Figure S2A, top panel). Although variably spliced, Triad3C, Triad3D, and Triad3E encode for the same protein (Figure S2A, top panel). Both Triad3A and Triad3B, but not Triad3C, promoted Arc ubiquitination (Figure S2A). Whereas Triad3A and Triad3B strongly induced Arc ubiquitination, the related RING-IBR-RING E3 ligase parkin did not (Figure S2A). Moreover, we did not detect ubiquitination of Arc upon coexpression with other known E3s that are expressed in the brain including Ube3a, Smurf1, Smurf2, and NEDD4-1 (Figure 2C). Previously, Ube3a was identified as a ubiquitin E3 ligase for Arc (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In contrast to Triad3A, we were unable to detect Ube3a-dependent Arc ubiquitination (Figure 2C), similar to recent findings (Kühnle et al., 2013Kühnle S. Mothes B. Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. Role of the ubiquitin ligase E6AP/UBE3A in controlling levels of the synaptic protein Arc.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 8888-8893Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, expression of wild-type Ube3a, but not the catalytically inactive mutant Ube3a (C883A), reduced Arc protein levels (Figure S2B), as previously reported (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Compared to Triad3A, which efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with Arc, we were unable to detect an interaction between Ube3a and Arc in HEK293 cells (Figure 2D). However, we did observe a weak interaction between endogenous Ube3a and Arc in hippocampal neurons (Figure S2C). Knockdown of Triad3A in hippocampal neurons did not increase the interaction between Arc and Ube3a, suggesting that Triad3A does not compete with Ube3a for Arc binding (Figure S2C). Using in vitro ubiquitination assays, we found that Triad3A efficiently ubiquitinated full-length recombinant Arc, whereas Ube3a did not (Figure 2E; compare lanes 4 and 8). We then purified a fragment of Arc (amino acids 132–396) that lacks the N-terminal coiled coil and endophilin-3 binding domains and was previously demonstrated to be a Ube3a substrate in vitro (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Both Triad3A and Ube3a could ubiquitinate this Arc fragment (Figure 2F). However, unlike the high-molecular-mass polyubiquitinated smear observed with full-length Arc (Figure 2E), we observed a small ∼7 kDa shift in molecular weight to an apparent single species (Figure 2F). Finally, cortical neurons from Ube3am−/p+ mice were examined for Arc K48-linked polyubiquitination using a K48 linkage-specific antibody that recognizes the predominant ubiquitin chain associated with proteasome-dependent degradation (Newton et al., 2008Newton K. Matsumoto M.L. Wertz I.E. Kirkpatrick D.S. Lill J.R. Tan J. Dugger D. Gordon N. Sidhu S.S. Fellouse F.A. et al.Ubiquitin chain editing revealed by polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies.Cell. 2008; 134: 668-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed an increase in Arc protein levels in Ube3am−/p+ cortical neurons compared to wild-type neurons as previously described (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) (Figure 2G). However, we also detected an increase in K48-linked Arc ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that Arc is still capable of being ubiquitinated in the absence of Ube3a (Figure 2G). To determine which region of Arc serves as the target for Triad3A-dependent ubiquitination, we coexpressed Flag-Triad3A and HA-Ub with various Arc deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC), endophilin-3 binding domain (ΔEB), and spectrin-repeat homology domains (ΔSRH) (Figure 3A). Deletion of the SRH domain of Arc abolished ubiquitination by Triad3A (Figure 3A). To identify the lysine residue(s) of Arc that is (or are) ubiquitinated by Triad3A, we performed mass spectrometry on purified Arc following in vitro ubiquitination with Triad3A. His-tagged Arc was purified from insect cells, and Flag-tagged Triad3A was isolated from HEK293 cells (Figure S3A). When screening various E2 proteins, we found that both UbcH5 and UbcH7 efficiently supported Triad3A-dependent ubiquitination of Arc in vitro (Figure S3B). We then performed in vitro Arc ubiquitination assays in the presence of E1, E2 (UbcH7), recombinant His-Arc, Flag-Triad3A, and purified ubiquitin lacking internal lysines (Figure S3C). Arc was purified under denaturing conditions, resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie blue (Figure S3C), band isolated, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion for liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Our analysis identified four lysines (K55, K136, K268, and K293) as sites of ubiquitination (Figure 3B). Of these sites, lysines 55 and 268 were ubiquitinated by Triad3A in more than one experiment (Figure 3B). We next mutated candidate lysine residues and coexpressed Arc mutants with Triad3A in HEK293 cells. Single-site mutation of each of the four lysines (K55A, K136A, K268A, and K293A) had no effect on Triad3A-induced ubiquitination (Figure 3C). However, we noted the presence of a conserved lysine residue adjacent to K268 that was not identified in the mass spectrometric analysis. Indeed, whereas Arc-K268A and Arc-K269A were each robustly ubiquitinated by Triad3A, mutation of both residues to alanine almost completely abolished Triad3A-induced ubiquitination (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained with a lysine-to-arginine double mutant Arc-K268R/K269R (data not shown). We then coexpressed wild-type Arc (Arc-WT) or Arc-K268R/K269R (hereinafter referred to as Arc-KR) in HEK293 cells and performed 35S-Cys/Met metabolic labeling and pulse-chase analysis. Introduction of K268R and K269R mutations significantly slowed Arc degradation (Figures 3D and 3E). Since Arc decay was still observed in the Arc-KR mutant, we mutated all lysines of Arc (K55R/K136R/K268R/K269R/K293R) that were identified as being ubiquitinated (referred to as Arc-ALL) and monitored decay of protein levels following cyclohexamide treatment (Figure S3D). As expected, Arc-KR levels decayed slower than Arc-WT (Figure S3D). However, we did not observe a difference in decay between Arc-KR and Arc-ALL, suggesting that K268 and K269 are the primary sites of Arc ubiquitination (Figures S3D and S3E). The continued degradation of Arc-KR and Arc-ALL could be due to the presence of a strong predicted PEST motif that is located at the C terminus of Arc (Rao et al., 2006Rao V.R. Pintchovski S.A. Chin J. Peebles C.L. Mitra S. Finkbeiner S. AMPA receptors regulate transcription of the plasticity-related immediate-early gene Arc.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To examine the role of endogenous Triad3A in regulating Arc stability, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) for loss-of-function analysis. We identified two short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences that efficiently reduced Triad3A protein levels (Figure S4). Expression of these shRNAs in hippocampal neurons decreased Triad3A immunostaining by approximately 75% (Figures S4C and S4D). Lentiviral transduction of Triad3 shRNA resulted in a significant reduction of endogenous Triad3A relative to a scrambled shRNA control (Figure S4E). We next examined Arc expression elicited by 4AP/Bic in hippocampal neurons transduced with Triad3 shRNA (Figure 4A) and observed an increase in Arc accumulation compared to scrambled control (2.6 ± 0.4 fold increase, p < 0.05; Figures 4A and 4B). Along with an increase in Arc, Triad3A levels were slightly decreased with 4AP/Bic, potentially due to Triad3A autoubiquitination. Following induction by 4AP/Bic, degradation of 35S-labeled Arc was significantly slower in neurons expressing Triad3 shRNA, compared to neurons expressing a scrambled control shRNA (Figures 4C and 4D). Immunoblot analysis of total Arc from radiolabeled lysates confirmed the persistence of Arc following 4AP/Bic in neurons lacking Triad3A (Figure 4C). In further experiments, we monitored endogenous Arc in hippocampal neurons upon Triad3A overexpression or knockdown in the presence or absence of elevated synaptic activity (Figure 4E). As expected, 4AP/Bic treatment increased Arc levels within 4 hr (Figures 4E and 4F). In neurons with reduced levels of Triad3A, activity-induced Arc levels were increased by 2-fold (Figures 4E and 4F). Coexpression of RNAi-resi"

A defective mucus barrier in animal models allows bacterial contact with the intestinal epithelium and results in spontaneous colitis. A defective mucus barrier is also a key feature of active ulcerative colitis (UC). Alterations in the immune compartment due to intestinal bacterial breach in mice lacking the colon mucus barrier have not been characterized and correlated to active UC.To characterize alterations in the immune compartment due to intestinal bacterial breach in Muc2-/- mice, which lack the colon mucus barrier, and correlate the findings to active UC.Bacterial contact with colon epithelium and penetration into colon tissue was examined in Muc2-/- mice and colon biopsies from patients with active UC using fluorescence microscopy and qPCR. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, CD103+ dendritic cell subsets and macrophages in colon from Muc2-/- mice and biopsies from UC patients were quantitated by flow cytometry.Inflamed UC patients and Muc2-/- mice had bacteria in contact with the colon epithelium. Bacterial rRNA was present in colonic mucosa in humans and Muc2-/- mice and in the draining lymph nodes of mice. Inflamed Muc2-/- mice and UC patients had elevated colon neutrophils, T cells and macrophages while a reduced frequency of CD103+ DCs was present in the inflamed colon of both mice and humans.The parallel features of the colon immune cell compartment in Muc2-/- mice and UC patients supports the usefulness of this model to understand the early phase of spontaneous colitis and will provide insight into novel strategies to treat UC."
https://openalex.org/W2148998821,"Bilateral integration of sensory and associative brain processing is achieved by precise connections between homologous regions in the two hemispheres via the corpus callosum. These connections form postnatally, and unilateral deprivation of sensory or spontaneous cortical activity during a critical period severely disrupts callosal wiring. However, little is known about how this early activity affects precise circuit formation. Here, using in utero electroporation of reporter genes, optogenetic constructs, and direct disruption of activity in callosal neurons combined with whisker ablations, we show that balanced interhemispheric activity, and not simply intact cortical activity in either hemisphere, is required for functional callosal targeting. Moreover, bilateral ablation of whiskers in symmetric or asymmetric configurations shows that spatially symmetric interhemispheric activity is required for appropriate callosal targeting. Our findings reveal a principle governing axon targeting, where spatially balanced activity between regions is required to establish their appropriate connectivity."

For example, doublecortin (Dcx) knockdown but not knockout shows a neocortical neuronal migration phenotype. Here we report that in utero electroporation of shRNA, but not siRNA or miRNA, to Dcx demonstrates a migration phenotype in Dcx knockouts akin to the effect in wild-type mice, suggesting shRNA-mediated off-target toxicity. This effect was not limited to Dcx, as it was observed in Dclk1 knockouts, as well as with a fraction of scrambled shRNAs, suggesting a sequence-dependent but not sequence-specific effect. Profiling RNAs from electroporated cells showed a defect in endogenous let7 miRNA levels, and disruption of let7 or Dicer recapitulated the migration defect. The results suggest that shRNA-mediated knockdown can produce untoward migration effects by altering endogenous miRNA pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2048067345,"An increase in intramuscular adipocyte tissue (IMAT) is associated with glucose dysregulation, decreased muscle strength, and increased risk of disability. Unfortunately, the mechanisms stimulating intramuscular adipogenesis remain unclear. We found that dexamethasone (Dex) administration to mice with injured muscles stimulates the accumulation of IMAT. To identify precursors of these adipocytes, we isolated satellite cells and fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) from muscle; satellite cells did not differentiate into adipocytes even following Dex treatment. In contrast, Dex stimulated FAP differentiation into adipocytes. In vivo, we transplanted purified FAPs from transgenic, EGFP mice into the injured muscles of C57/BL6 mice and found that Dex administration stimulated adipogenesis from FAP-EGFP. The increase in adipogenesis depended on Dex-induced inhibition of interleukin-4 (IL-4). In the injured muscle of IL-4-knockout mice, the levels of adipocytes were increased, while in the injured muscles of Dex-treated mice with IL-4 injections, adipogenesis was suppressed. In cultured FAPs, IL-4 inhibited Dex-induced conversion of FAPs into adipocytes; this did not occur in FAPs expressing knockdown of the IL-4 receptor. Thus, we concluded that glucocorticoids stimulate FAPs to differentiate into adipocytes in injured muscles. This process is blocked by IL-4, suggesting that interfering with IL-4 signaling could prevent adipogenesis in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2086351006,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) that deacetylate histone and nonhistone proteins play crucial roles in a variety of cellular processes. The overexpression of HDACs is reported in many cancer types and is directly linked to accelerated cell proliferation and survival. However, little is known about how HDAC expression is regulated in cancer cells. In this study, we found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 promoters are regulated through collaborative binding of transcription factors Sp1/Sp3 and epigenetic modulators, including histone H3K4 methyltransferase SET1 and histone acetyltransferase p300, whose levels are also elevated in colon cancer cell lines and patient samples. Interestingly, Sp1 and Sp3 differentially regulate HDAC1 and HDAC2 promoter activity. In addition, Sp1/Sp3 recruits SET1 and p300 to the promoters. SET1 knockdown (KD) results in a loss of the H3K4 trimethylation mark at the promoters, as well as destabilizes p300 at the promoters. Conversely, p300 also influences SET1 recruitment and H3K4me3 level, indicating a crosstalk between p300 and SET1. Further, SET1 KD reduces Sp1 binding to the HDAC1 promoter through the increase of Sp1 acetylation. These results indicate that interactions among transcription factors and epigenetic modulators orchestrate the activation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 promoter activity in colon cancer cells."

Because canonical PCNA-binding proteins such as replicative DNA polymerases lack the TD motif and/or B+4 residues, they are not destroyed. TDG is a glycosylase that acts in the first step of base excision repair (BER) to remove thymine, uracil, and certain modified cytosine residues when they are paired with guanine, generating an abasic (AP) site. Subsequent processing by AP endonuclease and other BER enzymes restores the AP site to cytosine. TDG is product-inhibited due to irreversible binding to AP sites, but TDG SUMOylation decreases its affinity for DNA, facilitating its removal from AP sites (25.Hardeland U. Steinacher R. Jiricny J.

In animals, Tet proteins serially oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxymethylcytosine. TDG removes 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxymethylcytosine from DNA via the conventional BER pathway, leading to cytosine demethylation (30.He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z. Liu P. Wang Y. Tang Q. Ding J. Jia Y.

Mice lacking TDG die at embryonic day 11.5, probably due to a failure to establish and maintain epigenetic gene expression programs during cell and tissue differentiation (42.Cortellino S. Xu J.

Embryonic lethal phenotype reveals a function of TDG in maintaining epigenetic stability.Nature. 2011; 470: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Here, we show that TDG is a CRL4Cdt2 substrate with a highly conserved PIP degron. When damaged DNA was incubated in Xenopus egg extract, TDG was targeted for destruction dependent on CRL4Cdt2, PCNA, and the TDG PIP degron. Interestingly, the PIP degron of TDG deviates from the consensus sequence by one amino acid, and changing the degron to the consensus dramatically enhanced the efficiency of TDG destruction. The addition of non-degradable TDG to egg extract did not affect S phase progression, but this might be due to an inhibitor of TDG activity in the extract. During frog development, TDG protein accumulated late in gastrulation, and its abundance was down-regulated by CRL4Cdt2, probably as a result of S phase destruction. However, expression of non-degradable TDG in frog embryos had no detectable effects on S phase progression or development. Our results identify TDG as the first bona fide DNA repair protein targeted by CRL4Cdt2 and suggest that TDG might be inhibited in S phase by multiple redundant mechanisms. High-speed supernatant (HSS) of Xenopus egg extract and nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) were prepared as described previously (45.Lebofsky R. Takahashi T. Walter J.C. DNA replication in nucleus-free Xenopus egg extracts.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 521: 229-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Before use, NPE was diluted by 40–60% with egg lysis buffer (ELB; 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7). All extracts were supplemented with an energy regeneration mix (2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 5 μg/ml creatine kinase). HSS was also supplemented with nocodazole (3–5 μg/ml), and diluted NPE was supplemented with an additional 10 mm DTT. All experiments in Xenopus egg extract were performed in a 2:1 mixture of diluted NPE to HSS, unless otherwise noted. For damage-dependent TDG destruction assays, NPE and HSS were mixed together prior to the start of the experiment. After the addition of recombinant TDG (see below), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-damaged DNA was added to trigger DNA repair and CRL4Cdt2 function. MMS-damaged plasmid or linear DNA was generated as described previously (46.Stokes M.P. DNA damage-induced replication arrest in Xenopus egg extracts.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, MMS-damaged plasmid was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/μl in egg extract to trigger TDG destruction. For all destruction assays, TDG was added to egg extract at a concentration of 1 ng/μl (20 nm). Linear, MMS-damaged DNA was coupled to beads, and beads were recovered as described previously (22.Havens C.G. Walter J.C. Docking of a specialized PIP box onto chromatin-bound PCNA creates a degron for the ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cdt2.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In experiments examining DNA-bound TDG, methyl ubiquitin (2 mg/ml; Boston Biochem) was included to allow monoubiquitylation on multiple sites while blocking polyubiquitin chain formation and subsequent proteolysis. Where indicated, CRL4Cdt2 function was inhibited with a previously described p21 peptide (47.Arias E.E. Walter J.C. PCNA functions as a molecular platform to trigger Cdt1 destruction and prevent re-replication.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 200 μm. MG132 (1 mm; Boston Biochem) was used where indicated to inhibit the proteasome. For DNA replication assays and replication-dependent TDG destruction assays, DNA replication in egg extract (HSS/NPE) was monitored as described previously (45.Lebofsky R. Takahashi T. Walter J.C. DNA replication in nucleus-free Xenopus egg extracts.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 521: 229-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA was first incubated in HSS, which facilitates DNA licensing, and then diluted NPE (40–60% with ELB) was added to trigger replication initiation. DNA replication was measured via the incorporation of radiolabeled dATP into high molecular weight DNA, as measured by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (45.Lebofsky R. Takahashi T. Walter J.C. DNA replication in nucleus-free Xenopus egg extracts.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 521: 229-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TDG was added with the diluted NPE at the start of replication. Where indicated, licensing was inhibited with 400 nm geminin (48.Wohlschlegel J.A. Inhibition of eukaryotic DNA replication by geminin binding to Cdt1.Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) added to HSS. Eggs were fertilized according to published protocols (49.Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2010: 99-100Google Scholar) and stored in 0.1× MMR containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Embryos were staged according to the Nieuwkoop and Faber anatomical stages (50.Bowes J.B. Snyder K.A. Segerdell E. Gibb R. Jarabek C. Noumen E. Pollet N. Vize P.D.

Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Science, New York1994Google Scholar). 20 pg of TDG mRNA (10 nl at 2 ng/μl in water) was microinjected into each cell of dejellied stage 2 embryos in 0.1× MMR + 5% Ficoll containing gentamycin (50 μg/ml) at 18 °C. Embryos were allowed to heal in 0.1× MMR + 5% Ficoll containing gentamycin for 1–2 h at 18 °C and then stored in 0.1× MMR containing gentamycin at 14 °C until they reached N-F stage 7, after which development was monitored at 23 °C. Frozen embryos were lysed via homogenization with a pipette tip and light vortexing in embryonic lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, supplemented with a Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor tablet; 15 μl/embryo). Yolk proteins were removed via centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The soluble fraction was recleared of yolk proteins with a second spin. In a typical experiment, 30–40 embryos were injected with WT or ΔPIP mRNA, and at each developmental time point, two embryos were frozen to prepare extract for blotting or mRNA extraction. By the end of the experiment, there were at least five embryos left. In five repetitions of the experiment, 98 of 108 WT-injected, 137 of 148 ΔPIP-injected, and 135 of 149 uninjected embryos showed no phenotype through at least stage 14. RNA was purified from Xenopus embryos using the RNAqueous® total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Five embryos were pooled per time point, lysed in 300 μl of lysis/binding solution, and cleared by centrifugation at 21,130 × g at 4 °C for 30 min prior to RNA purification. cDNA were synthesized using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and quantitative PCR was performed using the iTaqTM Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for TDG were designed and validated (5′-GTTACAATTCTGCCCTTGGA-3′, 5′-TGCCCATTAAACTCTGCATT-3′). All samples were normalized to Hprt1 (5′-TGGGAGGTCACCATATTG-3′, 5′-CTTGTCACTGTTGCGGTT-3′). The TDG gene was amplified from cDNA generated from unfertilized eggs using primers 5′-GCTAAGGATCCATGGAGGCCCAGGACCCAAGC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTCTCGAGTCAAGCGTTGCTGCCTCCTTGC-3′ (Operon/Eurofins Genomics). The TDG gene was inserted into a modified pET28 vector that contains a Prescission Protease (GE Healthcare) cleavage site for expression in bacteria or into a pCS2+ vector for mRNA production at BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) sites in the respective vector. TDG point mutants were generated with a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). To prepare mRNA for microinjections, pCS2+TDG plasmid was linearized with a NotI (New England Biolabs) overnight digest and purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). mRNA was prepared using the mMessage mMachine Sp6 kit (Ambion) and purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Purified mRNA was ethanol-precipitated and diluted in RNase-free water. To obtain native, functional TDG, expression of His-tagged TDG was induced in Arctic Express cells (Agilent) with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at 15 °C, and TDG was purified in batch. Cells were lysed via sonication in lysis buffer (750 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm PMSF (Amresco), 1 mm benzamidine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and cleared via centrifugation at 30,000 × g. Soluble His-tagged TDG was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 1 h and washed twice with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and once with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (aprotinin and leupeptin were omitted from these wash buffers).

https://openalex.org/W2094880366,"Hef is an archaeal protein that probably functions mainly in stalled replication fork repair. The presence of an unstructured region was predicted between the two distinct domains of the Hef protein. We analyzed the interdomain region of Thermococcus kodakarensis Hef and demonstrated its disordered structure by CD, NMR, and high speed atomic force microscopy (AFM). To investigate the functions of this intrinsically disordered region (IDR), we screened for proteins interacting with the IDR of Hef by a yeast two-hybrid method, and 10 candidate proteins were obtained. We found that PCNA1 and a RecJ-like protein specifically bind to the IDR in vitro. These results suggested that the Hef protein interacts with several different proteins that work together in the pathways downstream from stalled replication fork repair by converting the IDR structure depending on the partner protein."
https://openalex.org/W2059898382,"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that perform lipid and reactive oxygen species metabolism. Defects in peroxisome biogenesis cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs). The most severe PBD, Zellweger syndrome, is characterized in part by neuronal dysfunction, craniofacial malformations, and low muscle tone (hypotonia). These devastating diseases lack effective therapies and the development of animal models may reveal new drug targets. We have generated Drosophila mutants with impaired peroxisome biogenesis by disrupting the early peroxin gene pex3, which participates in budding of pre-peroxisomes from the ER and peroxisomal membrane protein localization. pex3 deletion mutants lack detectible peroxisomes and die before or during pupariation. At earlier stages of development, larvae lacking Pex3 display reduced size and impaired lipid metabolism. Selective loss of peroxisomes in muscles impairs muscle function and results in flightless animals. Although, hypotonia in PBD patients is thought to be a secondary effect of neuronal dysfunction, our results suggest that peroxisome loss directly affects muscle physiology, possibly by disrupting energy metabolism. Understanding the role of peroxisomes in Drosophila physiology, specifically in muscle cells may reveal novel aspects of PBD etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2072520011,"Development of cardiac dysfunction is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis. Increasing evidence shows that gender determines the degree of inflammatory response of the host and that females tolerate sepsis better than males. It is unknown whether gender affects the cardiac dysfunction in animals or patients with sepsis. To investigate this, male or female C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/peptidoglycan (PepG) co-administration or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). At 18 hours after LPS/PepG injection or 24 hours after CLP, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. The septic insult caused a significant cardiac dysfunction in both genders. However, the cardiac dysfunction was significantly less pronounced in females in comparison with males subjected to LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg) or CLP. Compared with males injected with LPS (3 mg/kg)/PepG (0.1 mg/kg), western blotting analysis of the myocardium from females injected with LPS/PepG revealed i) profound increases in phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS; ii) significant decreases in phosphorylation of IκBα, nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65, decreased expression of iNOS and decreased synthesis of TNF-α and IL-6 in the heart. However, the gender dimorphism of the cardiac dysfunction secondary to LPS/PepG was not observed when higher doses of LPS (9 mg/kg)/PepG (1 mg/kg) were used. In conclusion, the cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis was less pronounced in female than in male mice. The protection of female hearts against the dysfunction associated with sepsis is (at least in part) attributable to cardiac activation of the Akt/eNOS survival pathway, decreased activation of NF-κB, and decreased expression of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6. It should be noted that the observed gender dimorphism of the cardiac dysfunction in sepsis was not seen when a very severe stimulus (high dose of LPS/PepG co-administration) was used to cause cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2031423497,"Y-box (YB) protein-1 serves as a master regulator in gene transcription and mRNA translation. YB-1 itself is regulated at various levels, e.g. through post-translational modifications. In our previous work, we identified RANTES/CCL5 as a transcriptional target of YB-1. We previously demonstrated that YB-1 protein is transiently up-regulated during monocyte/macrophage differentiation evidenced in monocytic cells (THP-1 cells) that were differentiated using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Here we provide evidence that YB-1 phosphorylation, specifically at its serine residue 102 (Ser-102), increases early on in THP-1 cells following PMA treatment as well as in differentiated primary human monocytes. This process is mediated through the Akt signaling pathway. Ser-102-phosphorylated YB-1 displays stronger binding affinity and trans-activating capacity at the CCL5 gene promoter. Notably, Ser-102-phosphorylated YB-1 disappears at later stages of the monocyte/macrophage differentiation process. We demonstrate that serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CN) dephosphorylates YB-1 preventing it from binding to and trans-activating the CCL5 promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation assays prove a direct YB-1/CN interaction. Furthermore, analyses in kidney tissues from mice that were treated with the CN inhibitor cyclosporine A revealed an in vivo effect of CN on the YB-1 phosphorylation status. We conclude that YB-1 phosphorylation at Ser-102 is an important prerequisite for CCL5 promoter activation during macrophage differentiation.

Assembled with the β-subunit KCNE1, Kv7.1 conducts the slowly activating potassium current IKs, which is one of the major currents underlying repolarization of the cardiac action potential. A known regulator of Kv7 channels is the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).

We generated 13 charge neutralizing point mutations at the intracellular membrane border and characterized them electrophysiologically in complex with KCNE1 under the influence of diC8-PIP2. Electrophysiological analysis of corresponding long QT syndrome mutants suggested impaired PIP2 regulation as the cause for channel dysfunction. To clarify the underlying structural mechanism of PIP2 binding, molecular dynamics simulations of Kv7.1/KCNE1 complexes containing two PIP2 molecules in each subunit at specific sites were performed.

Among the ion channels regulated by PIP2 are transient receptor potential channels, (32.Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D.

Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gbetagamma.Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), and voltage-gated potassium channels such as Kv7.1. The lipid presumably exerts its effect on the latter by stabilizing the open channel conformation, thereby slowing the deactivation kinetics and shifting the activation curve to more negative potentials (34.Loussouarn G.

To date, the interaction has been localized to the C terminus of Kv7.1, in which four amino acids have been identified to interact with PIP2 (35.Thomas A.M. Harmer S.C. Khambra T. Tinker A. Characterisation of a binding site for anionic phospholipids on KCNQ1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2088-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the interaction site is confined to these amino acids. The aim of the present study, therefore, was the identification of residues within Kv7.1 responsible for the interaction with PIP2. Our experiments were based on the assumption that direct interaction is caused by electrostatic forces between negatively charged PIP2 head groups and positively charged amino acid residues. Hence, we generated neutralizing mutants of 13 positively charged amino acids. These were coexpressed with KCNE1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes to form slowly activating (IKs) channels. Effects of injected diC8-PIP2 on wild type and mutant channels was investigated by means of the two-electrode voltage-clamp. Included in the charge neutralization scan were the residues identified by Thomas et al. (35.Thomas A.M. Harmer S.C. Khambra T. Tinker A. Characterisation of a binding site for anionic phospholipids on KCNQ1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2088-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nine of the thirteen amino acids proved positive for a functional interaction with the lipid. Five of these had been identified previously as LQTS mutants. Electrophysiological analysis revealed an impaired PIP2 interaction with two of these. Two regions containing examined amino acids bound PIP2 and other lipids in lipid binding assays. To gain insight into the underlying structural mechanisms, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of Kv7.1 tetramers in complex with four KCNE1 β-subunits, both with and without PIP2 molecules. The results implied that binding of PIP2 to at least eight specific binding sites causes the stabilization of open and closed channel conformations. The molecular biological procedures were previously described (36.Seebohm G. Strutz-Seebohm N. Baltaev R. Korniychuk G. Knirsch M. Engel J. Lang F.

A mutant channel based on human Kv7.1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_000218, isoform 0; the N terminus is truncated compared with isoform 1) in which all cysteines were mutated to alanines (Kv7.1 clone without cysteines, here called Kv7.1 −cys) was described before and kindly provided by G. N. Tseng (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) (37.Xu X. Jiang M. Hsu K.-L. Zhang M. Tseng G.-N. KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in the IKs channel complex make state-dependent contacts in their extracellular domains.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The clone was subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pSGEM. Further, human Kv7.1 wild type, isoform 1 was subcloned into pXOOM. Human KCNE1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_000219) was subcloned into pSP64. The Kv7.1 mutations H126C, R181C, K183C, R190C, R192C, R195C, K196C, R249C, R259C, K354C, K358C, R360C, and K362C were introduced into the Kv7.1 −cys clone, the Kv7.1 mutations R190L, R192H, R195W, K354R, R360M, R360T, and K362R were introduced into the Kv7.1 WT clone by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmids were linearized using XbaI (Kv7.1 −cys), NheI (Kv7.1 WT), and EcoRI (KCNE1). In vitro synthesis of cRNA was performed using the T7 (Kv7.1) or SP6 (KCNE1) mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. X. laevis oocytes were harvested in accordance with German laws as previously described (36.Seebohm G. Strutz-Seebohm N. Baltaev R. Korniychuk G. Knirsch M. Engel J. Lang F. Regulation of KCNQ4 potassium channel prepulse dependence and current amplitude by SGK1 in Xenopus oocytes.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2005; 16: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ovarian lobes from tricaine-anesthetized X. laevis were digested with collagenase (Type II, Worthington, 1 mg/ml in calcium-free Barth's solution) for ∼120 min. Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with ∼20 nl of cRNA solution. Oocytes were injected with 2.5 ng of Kv7.1 WT or mutant cRNA and 2.5 ng of KCNE1 WT cRNA. The oocytes were stored for 3–4 days at ∼18 °C in Barth's solution containing 88 mmol/liter NaCl, 1.1 mmol/liter KCl, 2.4 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 0.3 mmol/liter Ca(NO3)2, 0.3 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.8 mmol/liter MgSO4, 15 mmol/liter HEPES-NaOH, 31 mg/liter penicillin-G, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 20 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate, and 80 mg/liter theophylline, pH 7.6. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed at ∼22 °C using a Turbo Tec-10CX amplifier (NPI, Tamm, Germany) equipped with a Digidata 1322A AD/DA interface and pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon Instruments Inc./Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were analyzed with Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.), Prism 4.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), and QtiPlot (Ion Vasilief, Craiova, Romania). Recording pipettes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.4–1 MΩ. Channel currents were recorded in ND96 recording solution containing 96 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 1.8 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1.0 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 5 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.6. Some oocytes were injected with 13.8 ng (−cys mutants) or 27.6 ng (LQTS mutants and comparison WT/−cys) of diC8-PIP2 (P-4508; Mobitec, Göttingen, Germany) at least 30 min prior to the recordings. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The assay was recently described in detail (31.Seebohm G. Wrobel E. Pusch M. Dicks M. Terhag J. Matschke V. Rothenberg I. Ursu O. Hertel F.

In brief, PIP Strips from Molecular Probes were used (P23750). The peptides were FITC-labeled and had the following amino acid sequences: Q1-S2/S3, (FITC)-CRSKYVGLWGRLRFARK; Q1-S4/S5, (FITC)-GTWRLLGSVVFIHRQEL; and Q1-S6, (FITC)-GSGFALKVQQKQRQKHF. PIP Strips membranes were blocked with TBS-T containing 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/liter NaCl (containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 detergent) + 3% fatty acid-free BSA and gently agitated for 1 h at room temperature protected from light. The peptides (50 μg/ml) were each solved in TBS-T + 3% fatty acid-free BSA and incubated on the membranes for 1 h at room temperature protected from light, using gentle agitation. The membranes were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBS-T + 3% fatty acid-free BSA, protected from light, and gently agitated. Peptide binding was detected by analysis of fluorescence signal. The Kv7.1/KCNE1 structural models from Kang et al. (38.Kang C. Tian C. Sönnichsen F.D. Smith J.A. Meiler J. George Jr., A.L. Vanoye C.G. Kim H.J. Sanders C.R. Structure of KCNE1 and implications for how it modulates the KCNQ1 potassium channel.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7999-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were used. Eight PIP2 molecules were introduced in proximity to the eight residue clusters identified by electrophysiology. Structures with and without PIP2 were inserted into a membrane (composition PEA/PSE/PCH = 1/1/1) and incorporated into a simulation box filled with NaCl-H2O (0.9%). All-atoms-mobile simulations were performed to reach stable conformations using YASARA Structure version 10.1 (YASARA Biosciences GmbH, Vienna, Austria) as previously described (39.Strutz-Seebohm N. Pusch M. Wolf S. Stoll R. Tapken D. Gerwert K. Attali B. Seebohm G. Structural basis of slow activation gating in the cardiac IKs channel complex.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 27: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mean current-voltage curves were analyzed using the Boltzmann equation multiplied with the driving force, considering increased current amplitudes caused by increased applied voltages, I(V)B+A−B1+eV1/2−Vτ⋅(V−Ek)(Eq. 1) where I is the current amplitude, V is the applied voltage, EK is the potassium equilibrium potential, V½ is the half-maximal activation voltage, τ is the time constant, and A and B are the maximal and minimal current amplitudes, respectively. The variation of structures during the molecular dynamics simulations is presented as the root mean square deviation, which is a measure of the deviation of the atom positions compared with the first structure, RMSD(t1,t2)=1MΣi=1Nmi⋅(ri→(t1)−(ri→(t2))2(Eq. 2) where t1 = 0, N is the number of atoms, r→i is the position of atom i at time t, mi is the atom mass, and M is the sum of the atom masses. Wild type (cysteine-free Kv7.1, −cys) or mutated Kv7.1/KCNE1 channels were expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The examined mutations are located in transmembrane segment S1 (H126C), the intracellular linker between S2 and S3 (R181C, K183C, R190C, R192C, R195C, and K196C), the intracellular linker between S4 and S5 (R249C and R259C), and the intracellular extension of helix S6 (K354C, K358C, R360C, and K362C; Fig. 1A). All channels yielded characteristic, noninactivating, slowly activating and deactivating, voltage-gated potassium currents (Fig. 1B). Current-voltage relationships (Fig. 1C) showed WT (−cys) or mutant channel activation upon depolarization to approximately −30 mV. The shapes of the curves and hence kinetic parameters appeared nearly unchanged, but some mutations led to significantly increased current amplitudes compared with WT (−cys) currents (Fig. 1, B, red curves, and D). Because oocyte batches may vary in their endogenous PIP2 levels and hence binding sites may be occupied to different extents, we included only those batches in which increased WT currents were observed after PIP2 application. In these batches, currents of the mutants were increased, decreased, or unchanged (Fig. 2A). To discover different properties upon diC8-PIP2 application, we analyzed current amplitudes. The amplitudes at 40 mV were normalized to the respective current without the PIP2 analog diC8-PIP2 of each individual batch (Fig. 2B). diC8-PIP2 significantly increased the WT (−cys) current amplitude to ∼160% on average, as well as the amplitudes of four mutants shown in gray (H126C, R195C, K196C, and K358C). Supposedly, the stimulation indicates that diC8-PIP2 was able to stabilize the open channel conformation of these mutants. Four mutants showed reduced stimulation (marked in blue; K183C, R190C, R249C, and K354C) to values between 120 and 150%. In contrast, currents of mutants shown in red (R181C, R192C, R259C, R360C, and K362C) were either not affected or even significantly decreased by up to 25% upon diC8-PIP2 injection, indicating an impaired functional interaction with PIP2. Further analysis of the diC8-PIP2 effects on mutant channel currents compared with wild type emphasized these differences (Fig. 2C). Here, current amplitudes were normalized to the WT (−cys) current with diC8-PIP2 of each individual batch. This analysis indicated no significant differences between current amplitudes of wild type and mutants shown in gray, suggesting that these residues do not play a significant role in the protein-lipid interaction. In contrast, current amplitudes of mutants depicted in blue were stimulated to a lesser extent compared with WT channels, implying an involvement in the interaction. Intriguingly, currents carried by several mutants shown in red were unchanged or reduced by diC8-PIP2 injection, suggesting an important role for these residues in PIP2 coordination. Next we analyzed current-voltage relationships of the neutralizing mutants after injection of diC8-PIP2. To examine differences in voltage dependence of activation caused by diC8-PIP2, we fit our data according to the Boltzmann equation multiplied by the driving force (representative fits in Fig. 3A). Analysis of the half-maximal activation voltage V½ showed that the values of the various mutants were distributed between −20 and 10 mV compared with −4 mV of the WT (−cys) (Fig. 3B). The voltage dependences of WT (−cys) and mutants R181C, R190C, R249C, R259C, and K358C were unchanged by diC8-PIP2. The voltage dependences of mutants R192C, K354C, and R360C were shifted by diC8-PIP2 to more negative potentials. Half-maximal activation voltages of mutants H126C, K183C, R195C, K196, and K362C were shifted to more positive potentials. However, significances could not be determined. Comparison between half-maximal activation voltage upon diC8-PIP2 injection and current-amplitude changes revealed no correlation (Fig. 3C). As a control, we compared the effect of diC8-PIP2 on Kv7.1 WT and −cys (Fig. 4A). Both current amplitudes were augmented, however, with −cys augmented to a slightly but significantly lesser extent. Notably, there are known LQTS mutants at amino acid positions 190, 192, 195, 354, 360, and 362. Because we could observe an impaired diC8-PIP2 regulation when neutralizing these residues, we hypothesized that the impaired regulation is the underlying cause for channel dysfunction. Therefore, we also investigated these mutations electrophysiologically under the influence of diC8-PIP2 (Fig. 4B). Indeed, mutations R190L, R192H, and R195W showed less increased current amplitudes. Mutations K354R and K362R showed even enhanced current amplitude increases (not significantly and significantly, respectively). Mutations R360T and R360M did not yield functional currents (data not shown). The S2-S3 linker, the S4-S5 linker, and the C-terminal part of S6, all containing the examined amino acids, were subjected to lipid binding assays (Fig. 4C). Both the S2-S3 linker and S6 were shown to bind to all phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phospho derivatives, including PIP2. Additionally, the S6 fragment was positive for phosphatidyl serine binding. The S4-S5 linker did not bind to any of the tested lipids. We based molecular dynamics simulations on Kv7.1/KCNE1 models (4:4 relation because of the ongoing discussion on stoichiometry (40.Wrobel E. Tapken D. Seebohm G. The KCNE Tango: how KCNE1 interacts with Kv7.1.Front. Pharmacol. 2012; 3: 142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) in a closed and an open conformation as described by Kang et al. (38.Kang C. Tian C. Sönnichsen F.D. Smith J.A. Meiler J. George Jr., A.L. Vanoye C.G. Kim H.J. Sanders C.R. Structure of KCNE1 and implications for how it modulates the KCNQ1 potassium channel.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7999-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and introduced eight PIP2 molecules into the models. Conventional molecular dynamics simulations on channels in a membranous environment were performed until stable structures were reached. The last nanosecond of each simulation was averaged (Fig. 5A, cyan without PIP2 and yellow with PIP2) and compared with the starting structure (Fig. 5A, green). In the open conformation, differences between the starting structure and the average without the lipid were slightly larger than the differences between the starting structure and the average with PIP2. In the closed conformation, the structural differences without PIP2 were much larger than in presence of PIP2. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis, which indicates the structural variation over time, showed that all structures were in equilibrium for at least the last nanosecond of simulation (Fig. 5B). In equilibrium, the RMSD of all simulations were ∼4 Å, except for the closed conformation with PIP2 with an RMSD of ∼3 Å, agreeing with the direct visual comparison of the structures. The RMSD values of the simulations with and without PIP2 in the open conformation (Fig. 5C, green and blue) were almost identical, whereas there was a large difference of ∼1 Å in the closed conformation (Fig. 5C, black and violet). Residue-resolved RMSD values were averaged over time and all four subunits (Fig. 5C). These values confined these results to the pore region, beginning with the S4-S5 linker, because the voltage sensor itself is much more flexible. Both regions seemed more flexible when all four subunits were averaged, although this was not the case for each individual subunit (data not shown). The results were confirmed by the averaged RMSD of the S4-S5 linker (residues 249–261) and pore helix to the upper part of helix S6 region (residues 305–343; Fig. 4D). RMSD values without PIP2 were enlarged by factors of ∼1.8 and 1.3 (linker) and 1.5 and 1.2 (S6) in the closed and open conformation, respectively. In addition, both PIP2-free structures we"

The disease is caused by an alphaherpesvirus, the Marek's disease virus (MDV), and is characterized by the rapid onset of multifocal aggressive T-cell lymphoma in the chicken host. Although several viral oncogenes have been identified, the detailed mechanisms underlying MDV-induced lymphomagenesis are still poorly understood. Many viruses modulate cell cycle progression to enhance their replication and persistence in the host cell, in the case of some oncogenic viruses ultimately leading to cellular transformation and oncogenesis. In the present study, we found that MDV, like other viruses, is able to subvert the cell cycle progression by triggering the proliferation of low proliferating chicken cells and a subsequent delay of the cell cycle progression into S-phase. We further identified the tegument protein VP22 (pUL49) as a major MDV-encoded cell cycle regulator, as its vector-driven overexpression in cells lead to a dramatic cell cycle arrest in S-phase. This striking functional feature of VP22 appears to depend on its ability to associate with histones in the nucleus. Finally, we established that VP22 expression triggers the induction of massive and severe DNA damages in cells, which might cause the observed intra S-phase arrest. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for a hitherto unknown function of the VP22 tegument protein in herpesviral reprogramming of the cell cycle of the host cell and its potential implication in the generation of DNA damages."
https://openalex.org/W2087519788,"It has been widely reported that β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synapses. Here, we show evidence that Aβ more potently blocks the potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)-spike coupling (E-S potentiation). This occurs, not by direct effect on excitatory synapses or postsynaptic neurons, but rather through an indirect mechanism: reduction of endocannabinoid-mediated peritetanic disinhibition. During high-frequency (tetanic) stimulation, somatic synaptic inhibition is suppressed by endocannabinoids. We find that Aβ prevents this endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition, thus leaving synaptic inhibition more intact during tetanic stimulation. This intact inhibition opposes the normal depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons that occurs during tetanus, thus opposing the induction of synaptic plasticity. Thus, a pathway through which Aβ can act to modulate neural activity is identified, relevant to learning and memory and how it may mediate aspects of the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s disease."

Af5517 also exhibited increased hyphal diameter and cell wall β-glucan and chitin content, with chitin most significantly increased.

Although, the trans-generational conveyance of this molecular memory has been traditionally linked to covalent modification of histone and/or DNA, recent studies suggest a role for proteins that persist or remain bound within chromatin to “bookmark” specific loci for enhanced or potentiated responses in daughter cells immediately following cell division. In this report we describe a role for p300 in enabling gene bookmarking by pre-initiation complexes (PICs) containing RNA polymerase II (pol II), Mediator and TBP. Once formed these complexes require p300 to facilitate reacquisition of protein complex assemblies, chromatin modifications and long range chromatin interactions that enable post-mitotic transmission of transcriptional memory of prior environmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2088249321,"The host defense of the model organism Drosophila is under the control of two major signaling cascades controlling transcription factors of the NF-B family, the Toll and the immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. The latter shares extensive similarities with the mammalian TNF-R pathway and was initially discovered for its role in anti-Gram-negative bacterial reactions. A previous interactome study from this laboratory reported that an unexpectedly large number of proteins are binding to the canonical components of the IMD pathway. Here, we focus on DNA methyltransferase-associated protein 1 (DMAP1), which this study identified as an interactant of Relish, a Drosophila transcription factor reminiscent of the mammalian p105 NF-B protein. We show that silencing of DMAP1 expression both in S2 cells and in flies results in a significant reduction of Escherichia coli-induced expression of antimicrobial peptides. Epistatic analysis indicates that DMAP1 acts in parallel or downstream of Relish. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that, in addition to Relish, DMAP1 also interacts with Akirin and the Brahma-associated protein 55 kDa (BAP55). Taken together, these results reveal that DMAP1 is a novel nuclear modulator of the IMD pathway, possibly acting at the level of chromatin remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W2078769764,"Imprinted small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are only found in eutherian genomes and closely related to brain functions. A complex human neurological disease, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), is primarily attributed to the deletion of imprinted snoRNAs in chromosome 15q11-q13. Here we investigated the snoRNA repertoires in the PWS locus of 12 mammalian genomes and their evolution processes. A total of 613 imprinted snoRNAs were identified in the PWS homologous loci and the gene number was highly variable across lineages, with a peak in Euarchontoglires. Lineage-specific gene gain and loss events account for most extant genes of the HBII-52 (SNORD115) and the HBII-85 (SNORD116) gene family, and remarkable high gene-birth rates were observed in the primates and the rodents. Meanwhile, rapid sequence substitution occurred only in imprinted snoRNA genes, rather than their flanking sequences or the protein-coding genes located in the same imprinted locus. Strong selective constraints on the functional elements of these imprinted snoRNAs further suggest that they are subjected to birth-and-death evolution. Our data suggest that the regulatory role of HBII-52 on 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA might originate in the Euarchontoglires through adaptive process. We propose that the rapid evolution of PWS-related imprinted snoRNAs has contributed to the neural development of Euarchontoglires."
https://openalex.org/W2084352820,"Currently very little is known about the differential expression and function of the transcription factor SOX5 during B cell maturation. We identified two new splice variants of SOX5 in human B cells, encoding the known L-SOX5B isoform and a new shorter isoform L-SOX5F. The SOX5 transcripts are highly expressed during late stages of B-cell differentiation, including atypical memory B cells, activated CD21low B cells and germinal center B cells of tonsils. In tonsillar sections SOX5 expression was predominantly polarized to centrocytes within the light zone. After in vitro stimulation, SOX5 expression was down-regulated during proliferation while high expression levels were permissible for plasmablast differentiation. Overexpression of L-SOX5F in human primary B lymphocytes resulted in reduced proliferation, less survival of CD138neg B cells, but comparable numbers of CD138+CD38hi plasmablasts compared to control cells. Thus, our findings describe for the first time a functional role of SOX5 during late B cell development reducing the proliferative capacity and thus potentially affecting the differentiation of B cells during the germinal center response."
https://openalex.org/W2028299532,"Host defense peptides play an important host-protective role by their microcidal action, immunomodulatory functions, and tissue repair activities. Proteolysis is a common strategy of pathogens used to neutralize host defense peptides. Here, we show that actin, the most abundant structural protein in eukaryotes, binds the LL-37 host defense peptide, protects it from degradation by the proteases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis, and enables its antimicrobial activity despite the presence of the proteases. Co-localization of LL-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. Competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that LL-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the His-40-Lys-50 segment of actin, located in the DNase I binding loop. The integrity of the binding site of both LL-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. Our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2056297406,"Objectives HCV co-infection is a poor prognostic factor in HIV-1-infected patients. Although the number of newly reported patients who show seroconversion is increasing, the clinical features are still unclear, especially in Asian countries. Design A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed between 2001–2012. Methods Acute hepatitis C (AHC) was diagnosed upon detection of high serum ALT (>100 IU) followed by anti-HCV seroconversion. Clinical characteristics, HIV-1-related immunological status and IL-28B genotypes (rs12979860, rs8099917) were collected. We compared these variables between patients with and without spontaneous clearance of HCV and between responders and non-responders to treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin. Results Thirty-five patients were diagnosed with AHC during the study period. The majority (96.9%) were MSM. Three were lost to follow-up. Seventy-five percent of patients with AHC (24/32) were asymptomatic and found incidentally to have high serum ALT. Compared to those who did not show spontaneous clearance, patients with spontaneous HCV viral clearance showed more symptoms and more severe abnormalities related to acute hepatitis. Spontaneous clearance was seen in 4 out of 28 patients with CC+TT genotype, but not in 6 patients with IL-28B CT+TG genotype. PEG-IFN plus ribavirin treatment was initiated in 12 out of 28 cases without spontaneous clearance. The sustained virological response rate was high (81.8%, 9/11), even in cases with CT+TG genotype infected with HCV genotype 1b (SVR 2/2). Conclusions Careful attention to AHC is needed in HIV-1-infected MSM. Early diagnosis and PEG-IFN plus ribavirin treatment should be considered for AHC cases."
https://openalex.org/W2023399502,"Most proteins found in mitochondria are translated in the cytosol and enter the organelle via the TOM complex (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane). Tom40 is the pore forming component of the complex. Although the three-dimensional structure of Tom40 has not been determined, the structure of porin, a related protein, has been shown to be a β-barrel containing 19 membrane spanning β-strands and an N-terminal α-helical region. The evolutionary relationship between the two proteins has allowed modeling of Tom40 into a similar structure by several laboratories. However, it has been suggested that the 19-strand porin structure does not represent the native form of the protein. If true, modeling of Tom40 based on the porin structure would also be invalid. We have used substituted cysteine accessibility mapping to identify several potential β-strands in the Tom40 protein in isolated mitochondria. These data, together with protease accessibility studies, support the 19 β-strand model for Tom40 with the C-terminal end of the protein localized to the intermembrane space."
https://openalex.org/W1976616566,"Context Thyroid cancer incidence has increased significantly during the past decades and is the most common type of endocrine malignancy. Many factors in thyroid cancers were studied as independent predictors of a poor prognosis. Objective The objective of the study was to evaluate survivin expression – BIRC5 and its splice variants: survivin delta Ex3 and survivin 2B in benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Design Thyroid tissues samples from a group of 50 patients consisting of: 29 patients with thyroid cancers (including medullary, papillary, follicular and undifferentiated types), as well as from 21 patients with non-cancerous thyroid tissues (including: 11 benign thyroid lesions and 10 healthy thyroid samples). Main Outcome Measures The analysis of the survivin gene expression and evaluation of the level of splice variants were performed using quantitative RT-PCR. Results A statistically significant higher level of expression of survivin gene – BIRC5 was detected in thyroid malignant nodules, when compared with benign lesions and healthy thyroid samples. Moreover, the comparison of survivin relative expression in different staged tumors (pT1, pT3, and pT4) revealed a much higher amount of BIRC5 transcripts in tumor tissues of pT3/pT4. The comparison of survivin expression between benign thyroid nodules and healthy thyroid did not reveal significant differences. Importantly, high expression rate of the survivin delta Ex3 splice variant characterized thyroid carcinomas. Conclusion The results suggest that survivin, especially survivin delta Ex3 splice variant being overexpress, is a characteristic feature of thyroid malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2093532742,"Signaling within and between animal cells is controlled by the many receptor proteins in their membrane. They variously operate as trans-membrane monomers and homo- or hetero-dimers, and may assemble with ion-channels: analyses thereof are needed in studies of receptor actions in tissue physiology and pathology. Interactions between membrane proteins are detectable when pre-labeled with fluorophores, but a much fuller analysis is achievable via advanced optical techniques on living cells. In this context, the measurement of polarization anisotropy in the emitted fluorescence has been the least exploited. Here we demonstrate its methodology and particular advantages in the study of receptor protein assembly. Through excitation in both TIRF and EPI fluorescence illumination modes we are able to quantify and suppress contributions to the signal from extraneous intra-cellular fluorescence, and we show that the loss of fluorescence-polarization measured in membrane proteins reports on receptor protein assembly in real time. Receptor monomers and homo-dimers in the cell membrane can be analyzed quantitatively and for homo-dimers only a single fluorescent marker is needed, thus suppressing ambiguities that arise in alternative assays, which require multiple label moieties and which are thus subject to stoichiometric uncertainty."

Herein, we investigated the pathogenesis of GI anthrax in animals orally infected with toxigenic non-encapsulated B. anthracis Sterne strain (pXO1+ pXO2-) spores that resulted in rapid animal death. B. anthracis Sterne induced significant breakdown of intestinal barrier function and led to gut dysbiosis, resulting in systemic dissemination of not only B. anthracis, but also of commensals. Disease progression significantly correlated with the deterioration of innate and T cell functions. Our studies provide critical immunologic and physiologic insights into the pathogenesis of GI anthrax infection, whereupon cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in immune cells may play a central role in promoting dysfunctional immune responses against this deadly pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2083816350,"The small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family and its regulatory proteins play a central role in cytokinetic actomyosin ring assembly and cytokinesis. Here we show that the fission yeast guanine nucleotide exchange factor Gef3p interacts with Rho3p at the division site. Gef3p contains a putative DH homology domain and a BAR/IMD-like domain. The protein localized to the division site late in mitosis, where it formed a ring that did not constrict with actomyosin ring (cytokinetic actomyosin ring) invagination; instead, it split into a double ring that resembled the septin ring. Gef3p co-localized with septins and Mid2p and required septins and Mid2p for its localization. Gef3p interacts physically with the GTP-bound form of Rho3p. Although Gef3p is not essential for cell separation, the simultaneous disruption of gef3(+) and Rho3p-interacting proteins, such as Sec8p, an exocyst component, Apm1p, a subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex or For3p, an actin-polymerizing protein, yielded cells with strong defects in septation and polarity respectively. Our results suggest that interactions between septins and Rho-GEFs provide a new targeting mechanism for GTPases in cytokinesis, in this case probably contributing to Rho3p function in vesicle tethering and vesicle trafficking in the later steps of cell separation."
https://openalex.org/W1984382839,"Achieving safe and readily accessible sources for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still a challenging unresolved issue. Recently, a primitive neural crest stem cell population (hOMSC) was isolated from the adult human oral mucosa and characterized in vitro and in vivo. In this study we assessed hOMSC ability to differentiate into dopamine-secreting cells with a neuronal-dopaminergic phenotype in vitro in response to dopaminergic developmental cues and tested their therapeutic potential in the hemi-Parkinsonian rat model. We found that hOMSC express constitutively a repertoire of neuronal and dopaminergic markers and pivotal transcription factors. Soluble developmental factors induced a reproducible neuronal-like morphology in the majority of hOMSC, downregulated stem cells markers, upregulated the expression of the neuronal and dopaminergic markers that resulted in dopamine release capabilities. Transplantation of these dopaminergic-induced hOMSC into the striatum of hemi-Parkinsonian rats improved their behavioral deficits as determined by amphetamine-induced rotational behavior, motor asymmetry and motor coordination tests. Human TH expressing cells and increased levels of dopamine in the transplanted hemispheres were observed 10 weeks after transplantation. These results demonstrate for the first time that soluble factors involved in the development of DA neurons, induced a DA phenotype in hOMSC in vitro that significantly improved the motor function of hemiparkinsonian rats. Based on their neural-related origin, their niche accessibility by minimal-invasive procedures and their propensity for DA differentiation, hOMSC emerge as an attractive tool for autologous cell replacement therapy in PD."
https://openalex.org/W1986394067,"Plants have two principal defense mechanisms to decrease fitness losses to herbivory: tolerance, the ability to compensate fitness after damage, and resistance, the ability to avoid damage. Variation in intensity of herbivory among populations should result in variation in plant defense levels if tolerance and resistance are associated with costs. Yet little is known about how levels of tolerance are related to resistance and attack intensity in the field, and about the costs of tolerance. In this study, we used information about tolerance and resistance against larval herbivory by the butterfly Anthocharis cardamines under controlled conditions together with information about damage in the field for a large set of populations of the perennial plant Cardamine pratensis. Plant tolerance was estimated in a common garden experiment where plants were subjected to a combination of larval herbivory and clipping. We found no evidence of that the proportion of damage that was caused by larval feeding vs. clipping influenced plant responses. Damage treatments had a negative effect on the three measured fitness components and also resulted in an earlier flowering in the year after the attack. Tolerance was related to attack intensity in the population of origin, i.e. plants from populations with higher attack intensity were more likely to flower in the year following damage. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between tolerance and resistance. These results indicate that herbivory drives the evolution for increased tolerance, and that changes in tolerance are not linked to changes in resistance. We suggest that the simultaneous study of tolerance, attack intensity in the field and resistance constitutes a powerful tool to understand how plant strategies to avoid negative effects of herbivore damage evolve."
https://openalex.org/W2065136753,"Nfatc2 and Tob1 are intrinsic negative regulators of T cell activation. Nfatc2-deficient and Tob1-deficient T cells show reduced thresholds of activation; however, whether these factors have independent or overlapping roles in negative regulation of T cell responses has not been previously examined. Here, we show that Nfatc2 knockout (KO) but not Tob1 KO mice have age-associated accumulation of persistently activated T cells in vivo and expansion of the CD44+ memory cell compartment and age-associated lymphocytic infiltrates in visceral organs, without significant changes in numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). In vitro, CD4+CD25− “conventional” T cells (Tconvs) from both KO strains showed greater proliferation than wild type (WT) Tconvs. However, while Tregs from Nfatc2 KO mice retained normal suppressive function, Tregs from Tob1 KOs had enhanced suppressive activity. Nfatc2 KO Tconvs expanded somewhat more rapidly than WT Tconvs under conditions of homeostatic proliferation, but their accelerated growth capacity was negated, at least acutely, in a lymphoreplete environment. Finally, Nfatc2 KO mice developed a previously uncharacterized increase in B-cell malignancies, which was not accelerated by the absence of Tob1. The data thus support the prevailing hypothesis that Nfatc2 and Tob1 are non-redundant regulators of lymphocyte homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1991859609,"Heart damage is widely present in patients with chronic kidney disease. Salt diet is the most important environmental factor affecting development of chronic renal failure and cardiovascular diseases. The proteins involved in chronic kidney disease -induced heart damage, especially their posttranslational modifications, remain largely unknown to date. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (chronic renal failure model) or sham operation were treated for 2 weeks with a normal-(0.4% NaCl), or high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. We employed TiO2 enrichment, iTRAQ labeling and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry strategy for phosphoproteomic profiling of left ventricular free walls in these animals. A total of 1724 unique phosphopeptides representing 2551 non-redundant phosphorylation sites corresponding to 763 phosphoproteins were identified. During normal salt feeding, 89 (54%) phosphopeptides upregulated and 76 (46%) phosphopeptides downregulated in chronic renal failure rats relative to sham rats. In chronic renal failure rats, high salt intake induced upregulation of 84 (49%) phosphopeptides and downregulation of 88 (51%) phosphopeptides. Database searches revealed that most of the identified phospholproteins were important signaling molecules such as protein kinases, receptors and phosphatases. These phospholproteins were involved in energy metabolism, cell communication, cell differentiation, cell death and other biological processes. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes analysis revealed functional links among 15 significantly regulated phosphoproteins in chronic renal failure rats compared to sham group, and 23 altered phosphoproteins induced by high salt intake. The altered phosphorylation levels of two proteins involved in heart damage, lamin A and phospholamban were validated. Expression of the downstream genes of these two proteins, desmin and SERCA2a, were also analyzed."

We recently synthesized a series of dibromophenyl enaminones and demonstrated that AK6 and E249 were equipotent to previous analogs but more efficacious in suppressing neuronal excitation. Here we examined the actions of these lead compounds on in vitro and in vivo seizure models. In vitro seizures were induced in the hippocampal slice chemically (zero Mg2+ buffer and picrotoxin) and electrically using patterned high frequency stimulation (HFS) of afferents. In vivo seizures were induced in rats using the 6 Hz and the maximal electroshock models. AK6 (10 µM) and E249 (10 µM) depressed the amplitude of population spikes recorded in area CA1 of the hippocampus by -50.5±4.3% and -40.1±3.1% respectively, with partial recovery after washout. In the zero Mg2+ model, AK6 (10 µM) depressed multiple population spiking (mPS) by -59.3±6.9% and spontaneous bursts (SBs) by -65.9±7.2% and in the picrotoxin-model by -43.3±7.2% and -50.0±8.3%, respectively. Likewise, E249 (10 µM) depressed the zero-Mg2+-induced mPS by -48.8±9.5% and SBs by -55.8±15.5%, and in the picrotoxin model by -37.1±5.5% and -56.5±11.4%, respectively. They both suppressed post-HFS induced afterdischarges and SBs. AK6 and E249 dose-dependently protected rats in maximal electroshock and 6 Hz models of in vivo seizures after 30 min pretreatment. Their level of protection in both models was similar to that obtained with phenytoin Finally, while AK6 had no effect on locomotion in rats, phenytoin significantly decreased locomotion. AK6 and E249, suppressed in vitro and in vivo seizures to a similar extent. Their in vivo activities are comparable with but not superior to phenytoin. The most efficacious, AK6 produced no locomotor suppression while phenytoin did. Thus, AK6 and E249 may be excellent candidates for further investigation as potential agents for the treatment of epilepsy syndromes with possibly less CNS side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2037440638,"Adhesion molecules play a critical role in the adhesive interactions of multiple cell types in sickle cell disease (SCD). We previously showed that anti-P-selectin aptamer efficiently inhibits cell adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs) and permits SCD mice to survive hypoxic stress. In an effort to discover new mechanisms with which to inhibit P-selectin, we examined the role of glycosylation. P-selectin is a 90 kDa protein but was found to migrate as 90 and 140 kDa bands on gel electrophoresis. When P-selectin isolated from ECs was digested with peptide N-glycosidase F, but not O-glycosidase, the 140 kDa band was lost and the 90 kDa band was enhanced. Treatment of ECs with tunicamycin, an N-glycosylation inhibitor, suppressed CD62P (P-selectin) expression on the cell surface as well as the 140 kDa form in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the 140 kDa band is N-glycosylated and glycosylation is critical for cell surface expression of P-selectin in ECs. Thrombin, which stimulates P-selectin expression on ECs, induced AKT phosphorylation, whereas tunicamycin inhibited AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that AKT signaling is involved in the tunicamycin-mediated inhibition of P-selectin expression. Importantly, the adhesion of sickle red blood cells (sRBCs) and leukocytes to ECs induced by thrombin or hypoxia was markedly inhibited by two structurally distinct glycosylation inhibitors; the levels of which were comparable to that of a P-selectin monoclonal antibody which most strongly inhibited cell adhesion in vivo. Knockdown studies of P-selectin using short-hairpin RNAs in ECs suppressed sRBC adhesion, indicating a legitimate role for P-selectin in sRBC adhesion. Together, these results demonstrate that P-selectin expression on ECs is regulated in part by glycosylation mechanisms and that glycosylation inhibitors efficiently reduce the adhesion of sRBCs and leukocytes to ECs. Glycosylation inhibitors may lead to a novel therapy which inhibits cell adhesion in SCD."

CbpM inhibits the co-chaperone and DNA binding activities of CbpA. This regulatory function of CbpM is accomplished through reversible interaction with the N-terminal J-domain of CbpA, which is essential for the interaction with DnaK. CbpM is highly specific for CbpA and does not bind DnaJ despite the high degree of structural and functional similarity between the J-domains of CbpA and DnaJ. Here we report the crystal structure of the complex of CbpM with the J-domain of CbpA. CbpM forms dimers and the J-domain of CbpA interacts with both CbpM subunits. The CbpM-binding surface of CbpA is highly overlapping with the CbpA interface for DnaK, providing a competitive model for regulation through forming mutually exclusive complexes. The structure also provides the explanation for the strict specificity of CbpM for CbpA, which we confirmed by making mutants of DnaJ that became regulated by CbpM. Interestingly, the structure of CbpM reveals a striking similarity to members of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators, suggesting an evolutionary connection between the functionally distinct bacterial co-chaperone regulator CbpM and the transcription regulator HspR."

We used predictions from available homology models and crystal structures to modulate an external access pathway for the membrane-impermeant local anesthetic derivative QX-222 into the internal vestibule of the mammalian rNaV1.4 channel. Potassium channel-based homology models predict amino acid Ile-1575 in domain IV segment 6 to be in close proximity to Lys-1237 of the domain III pore-loop selectivity filter. The mutation K1237E has been shown previously to increase the diameter of the selectivity filter.

Specifically, we examined the modulation of an external access pathway (EAP) for local anesthetic drugs to their binding site in the internal vestibule. Local anesthetic drugs containing a tertiary amino group are considered to reach this binding site either via the membrane or via the inner channel pore (9Hille B. Local anesthetics: hydrophilic and hydrophobic pathways for the drug-receptor reaction.J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Conversely, quaternary amine local anesthetics are membrane-impermeant and have to enter the channel via the inner pore (10Frazier D.T. Narahashi T. Yamada M.

The mutation K1237E has been shown to increase the diameter of the selectivity filter, perhaps by a lateral “swing out” of the IIIP (23Zarrabi T. Cervenka R. Sandtner W. Lukacs P. Koenig X. Hilber K.

The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel.Nature. 2011; 475: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Interestingly, with the K+ channel-based models, the side chains of Lys-1237 of the domain III selectivity filter (green) and of Ile-1575 of the IVS6 (yellow) are in close proximity to each other (Fig. 1, A and B). Conversely, in the NaVAb-based model, Lys-1237 and Ile-1575 are separated by a tryptophan side chain of the domain IV P-loop (homologous to Trp-1531 in rNav1.4; Fig. 1, C and D, cyan). This difference from the earlier K+ channel-based models is due to the fact that in all bacterial VGSCs crystallized so far (1Payandeh J. Scheuer T. Zheng N. Catterall W.A. The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel.Nature. 2011; 475: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 3McCusker E.C. Bagnéris C. Naylor C.E. Cole A.R. D'Avanzo N.

Hence, if the EAP is located at the region between the domain III selectivity filter and the IVS6, then the VGSC-based crystal structures predict that Trp-1531 may obstruct this access pathway. We will refer to this idea as the “Trp-lock” hypothesis. We found that predictions based on the two mentioned hypotheses are consistent with our experimental data. Furthermore, we used a homology model based upon the recently published structure of NaVRh to define the molecular localization of the experimentally explored EAP. Detailed methods for the mutagenesis have been published previously (16Sunami A. Dudley Jr., S.C. Fozzard H.A. Sodium channel selectivity filter regulates antiarrhythmic drug binding.Proc. Natl.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Mixture of plasmids coding 1.5 μg of rNaV1.4 α subunit, 0.2 μg of VGSC β1 subunit, and 0.02 μg of enhanced GFP were transiently transfected into tsA201 cells in a 35-mm dish (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16 h later, cells were dissociated from the dish surface by treatment with a 0.25% trypsin solution (Invitrogen) for ∼2 min, pelleted, resuspended in growth medium, and allowed to settle to the bottom of the recording chamber. Prior to recording, the growth medium was removed and changed to bath solution. Experiments were performed using the whole-cell patch clamp recording technique. Na+ currents were recorded using an Axopatch 700B patch clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Pipettes were formed from aluminosilicate glass (AF150-100-10, Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) with a P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and had resistances between 1.5 and 2.5 megaohms when filled with the intracellular pipette solution consisting of 105 mm CsF, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES. The pH was set to 7.3 with CsOH. For the experiments shown in Fig. 9A, Cs+ was replaced by equimolar concentrations of tetramethylammonium (TMA) or tetraethylammonium (TEA). The bath solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES. The pH was set to 7.4 with NaOH. For the experiments shown in Fig. 9B, Na+ was replaced by equimolar concentrations of K+, NH4+, and Cs+. Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were performed with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices) through a 16-bit analog-digital/digital-analog interface (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices). Data were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz (−3 db) and digitized at 100 kHz. In some experiments, QX-222 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and/or tetrodotoxin (TTX; Latoxan, Valance, France) was dissolved in the intracellular or extracellular solution. Drugs dissolved in the extracellular solution were applied via an OCTAFLOW drug application device (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY). This superfusion system permits a complete exchange of the solutions surrounding the cells under investigation within 100 ms (29Boehm S. ATP stimulates sympathetic transmitter release via presynaptic P2X purinoceptors.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 737-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recording was begun about 5 min after whole-cell access was attained to minimize time-dependent shifts in gating. Na+ currents were elicited by 20-ms pulses to −10 mV at a rate of 2 Hz from a holding potential of −120 mV if not stated otherwise. To assess recovery from intracellular QX-222 block, pipettes were filled with 500 μm QX-222 dissolved in the intracellular pipette solution. After break-in, cells were held at potential of −140 mV to keep channels in a closed state. After a minimum of 10 min of equilibration, a train of pulses (20-ms pulses to −10 mV at 10 Hz) was applied for 5 s to allow binding of QX-222 upon repetitive opening of the channels. Varying time intervals at a holding potential of −140 mV allowed for subsequent recovery of current amplitude. A final pulse to −10 mV tested for the residual current. Current-voltage relationships were determined by 20-ms voltage steps to various potentials between −80 and +50 mV from a holding potential of −140 mV. From a holding potential of −140 mV, inactivation was induced by 50-ms-long prepulses to various potentials from −140 to 0 mV. The current available after the prepulse was tested by a 20-ms test pulse to 0 mV immediately after the prepulse. Plots of current availability as a function of prepulse potential were fitted with Equation 5. Current-voltage relationships were recorded at a holding potential −140 mV. Currents were elicited by 20-ms-long voltage steps to various potentials from −80 to +50 mV. The currents were normalized to the respective maximum value. The data points were fitted with Equation 3 to calculate the respective reversal potential. The time course of Na+ current block was fitted with a single exponential function (Equation 1). y=1-A×(1-exp(-t/τ1))(Eq. 1) where y is the normalized peak inward current, τ1 is the time constant of block development, A is the fractional block amplitude, and t is the time from start of QX-222 perfusion. The time course of Na+ current unblock was fitted with Equation 2. y=(1-A)+B×(1-exp(-t/τ2))(Eq. 2) where τ2 is the unblock time constant and B is the fractional amplitude of recovery from QX-222 block with other parameters as stated above. Current-voltage relationships were fitted with a function (Equation 3), Gmax×(V-Vrev)×(1-(1/(1+exp((V-V0.5)/K))))(Eq. 3) where V is the step potential, Gmax is the maximum conductance, V0.5 is the voltage at which half-maximum activation occurred, Vrev is the reversal potential, and k is the slope factor. The time course of recovery from intracellular block was fitted with a double exponential function (Equation 4). y=-A1×(1-exp(-t/τ))-A1×(1-exp(-t/τ2))+C(Eq. 4) where y is the normalized peak inward current, t is the recovery time, τ1 and τ2 are the time constants of distinct components of recovery, A1 and A2 are the respective amplitudes, and C is the final level of recovery. Steady-state inactivation data were fitted with a Boltzmann function (Equation 5), y=1/(1+exp((V-V1/2)/k))(Eq. 5) where V is the voltage of the conditioning prepulse, V1/2 is the voltage at which half-maximum inactivation occurred, and k is the slope factor. Curve fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests or one-way unpaired analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test for comparison of more than two groups.

Zangerl E.M. Stary-Weinzinger A. Distinct interactions of Na+ and Ca2+ ions with the selectivity filter of the bacterial sodium channel NaVAb.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 430: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The simulations were performed in wild-type and mutant NaVRh channels. Mutant NaVRh channels were generated in the following manner: to mimic rNaV1.4 W1531G, the homologous residue of chain D, Trp-182, was mutated to a glycine. Furthermore, in NaVRh, the amino acid homologous to Ser-1528 in rNav1.4 is Leu-179, which might impose a stronger steric hindrance for permeation of QX-222 through the potential EAP than a serine. Therefore, in the mutant NaVRh, we also introduced the mutation L179S. The mutants were generated by PyMOL (36DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrodinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). To visualize the dimensions of the putative pathway formed by W182G/L179S mutant compared with wild-type NaVRh, we used the program HOLE (37Smart O.S. Goodfellow J.M. Wallace B.A. The pore dimensions of gramicidin A.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2455-2460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The center of mass coordinates of backbone nitrogen of Gln-175 and backbone oxygen of W182G (chain D) were selected to define the entrance of the EAP. The center of mass coordinates of four equivalent positions at the gate from four subunits (L212) were selected to determine the exit of the EAP. Then, the vector (CVECT in HOLE; Ref. 37Smart O.S.

In MD simulations of the mutant NaVRh, we observed water influx behind the selectivity filter in the region previously occupied by the tryptophan side chain. Thus, we adopted a snapshot (when this region was solvated with the maximum number of water molecules) from MD as a starting point for modeling rat NaV1.4 channel. Chains C and D were replaced with rat NaV1.4 sequences of domains III and IV. In the model, the EAP was again visualized using the program HOLE. The QX-222 three-dimensional structure was taken from the PubChem home page. Docking along the EAP in the rNaV1.4 model containing the mutation W1531G was performed with the program GOLD v5.2 (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, UK) using the GOLD scoring function as described before (38Knape K. Linder T. Wolschann P. Beyer A. Stary-Weinzinger A. In silico analysis of conformational changes induced by mutation of aromatic binding residues: consequences for drug binding in the hERG K+ channel.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e28778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In docking, we selected two arbitrary spheres (radius, 6 Å) covering the EAP as visualized by HOLE (axial length, ∼9 Å). All side chains within the spheres were treated as flexible. Within these spheres, 30 docking poses were generated. Using the Xenopus laevis expression system, replacement of Ile-1575 by alanine, cysteine, and glutamate has been shown previously to open an EAP for QX-222 (18Sunami A. Glaaser I.W. Fozzard H.A.

Furthermore, we examined the effect of engineering a positively charged histidine to this site. As shown in Fig. 2, all tested amino acid replacements at site 1575 allowed for external access of QX-222. I1575A and I1575C produced the greatest amount of fractional block, whereas introduction of charged amino acids at this site was associated with less block (Fig. 2; p < 0.05 compared with I1575A). In all constructs, block development was slow with time constants ranging from ∼12 to ∼27 s (Table 1). Thus, both charged and uncharged amino acids engineered to site 1575 open an access pathway for QX-222; however"

Anti-endothelial cells (AECA) have been described in various disorders with an associated vascular damage. Herein, we explored a novel circulating population of IgG reactive with EPC, in patients with differential risk profile for atherosclerotic vascular disease.A novel cyto-ELISA system was established where the coated cells were late outgrowth EPC. Levels of anti-EPC antibodies were determined in 100 subjects and differential risk score for atherosclerosis, as well as to circulating EPC levels and the inflammatory markers IL-6 and C-reactive protein. To study endothelial cell (EC) activating properties, sera were tested for their ability to induce VCAM-1 expression in a cell ELISA system. Detectable levels of anti-EPC antibodies, that correlated with age, Framingham risk score and CRP concentrations but did not associate with levels of LDL, HDL, hypertension or diabetes, were detected. Anti-EPC antibodies were distinct from EC binding antibodies as shown by competitive inhibition studies, and have been positively correlated with the extent of EC activation manifested by in vitro VCAM-1 expression.This is the first study showing a newly defined subgroup of self-antibodies binding EPC and associating positively with the Framingham risk score. Further studies are required to characterize and test this interesting subset of EPC binding autoantibodies and their potential significance."

The hemagglutinin envelope protein of influenza plays a critical role in viral entry and thus is an attractive target for inhibition of virus entry. The highly conserved stem loop region of hemagglutinin has been shown to undergo critically important conformational changes during the entry process and, moreover, to be a site for inhibition of virus entry by antibodies, small proteins, and small drug-like molecules. In this work we probe the structure-function properties of the H5 hemagglutinin stem loop region by site-directed mutagenesis. We find that most mutations do not disrupt expression, proteolytic processing, incorporation into virus, or receptor binding; however, many of the mutations disrupt the entry process. We further assess the effects of mutations on inhibition of entry by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (C179) and find examples of increased and decreased sensitivity to the antibody, consistent with the antibody binding site observed by x-ray crystallography. In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the mutants to MBX2329, a small molecule inhibitor of influenza entry. Interestingly, the mutants exhibit increased and decreased sensitivities to MBX2329, which gives further insight into the binding site of the compound on HA and potential mechanisms of escape. Finally, we have modeled the binding site of MBX2329 using molecular dynamics and find that the resulting structure is in good agreement with the mutagenesis results.

Together these studies underscore the importance of the stem loop region to HA function and suggest potential sites for therapeutic intervention of influenza entry. The membrane glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in influenza infection (1.Gamblin S.J. Skehel J.J. Influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase membrane glycoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Antigenic properties are used to classify HA into 17 subtypes with H1, H5, and H7 being of special concern. For example, the 1918 pandemic H1N1 influenza outbreak caused more than 50 million deaths worldwide and seasonal influenza is responsible for greater than 250,000 deaths per year worldwide (2.Johnson N.P. Mueller J. Updating the accounts: global mortality of the 1918–1920 “Spanish” influenza pandemic.Bull. Hist. Med. 2002; 76: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Ginsberg J. Mohebbi M.H. Patel R.S. Brammer L. Smolinski M.S. Brilliant L. Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data.Nature. 2009; 457: 1012-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). Moreover, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 have a >20% mortality rate and represent potential pandemic strains (4.Neumann G. Chen H. Gao G.F. Shu Y. Kawaoka Y.

Current treatments for influenza include Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir), which target NA, and Symmetrel (amantadine) and Flumadine (rimantadine), which target the M2 channel (6.Lagoja I.M. De Clercq E. Anti-influenza virus agents: synthesis and mode of action.Med. Res. Rev. 2008; 28: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, resistance is increasing in circulating influenza strains. For example, the 2008–2009 H1N1 strain of influenza exhibited ∼100% resistance against Tamiflu (7.van der Vries E. Stelma F.F. Boucher C.A. Emergence of a multidrug-resistant pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1381-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In summary, the consequences of influenza outbreaks and the observed resistance to current therapeutics strongly argue that new targets are urgently needed. HA-mediated entry, as well as that of the analogous envelope proteins from Ebola, HIV, and SARS-CoV, occurs through binding to receptor and conformational changes that result in fusion of the viral and target cell membranes (8.Skehel J.J.

HIV envelope: challenges and opportunities for the discovery of entry inhibitors.Trends Microbiol. 2011; 19: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HA are classified into 2 phylogenetic groups, based on sequence, structure, and immunogenicity, with H1 and H5 as examples of Group 1 HA and H3 and H7 as examples of Group 2 HA (11.Nobusawa E. Aoyama T. Kato H. Suzuki Y. Tateno Y. Nakajima K.

Wiley D.C. H5 avian and H9 swine influenza virus haemagglutinin structures: possible origin of influenza subtypes.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HA is synthesized as a precursor and is subsequently cleaved to form a disulfide-linked complex consisting of HA1, the receptor binding subunit, and HA2, the subunit that mediates membrane fusion (1.Gamblin S.J. Skehel J.J. Influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase membrane glycoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28403-28409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the first step of infection, HA in the neutral pH conformation binds to sialic acid receptors on the target cell surface. In the second step, the virus enters the endosome and the resulting low pH triggers a large conformational change in HA to expose a hydrophobic region, termed the fusion peptide. The newly exposed fusion peptide then inserts into the target membrane, thereby bringing the viral and target membranes in close contact to allow membrane fusion and entry of the virus into the cytoplasm (8.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). The critical role of HA in influenza entry renders it an attractive target for therapeutics designed to inhibit entry at either the binding or fusion steps (6.Lagoja I.M. De Clercq E. Anti-influenza virus agents: synthesis and mode of action.Med. Res. Rev. 2008; 28: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of fusion inhibitors have been shown to bind to the highly conserved stem loop region of HA, which is the region that undergoes a critical coil to helix transition during the entry process (8.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), and disrupts influenza entry. Examples of entry inhibitors include the monoclonal antibody C179 (14.Sakabe S.

In this work, we have further probed the importance of residues in the HA stem loop region to HA function by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, we have assessed the effects of mutation on the inhibition properties of the monoclonal antibody C179 and the small drug-like molecule MBX2329. Finally, we have modeled the interaction of MBX2329 with H5 HA by molecular dynamics simulations. Mutants were prepared from pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing H5 HA (A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1)) using the Stratagene QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit with subsequent verification by DNA sequencing. Virus-like particles were prepared by co-transfecting plasmids pH5HA (bearing wild-type or mutant HA), p-nitroanilide (bearing N1 influenza nueraminidase), and pNL4–3.Luc.R-E- using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) into HEK 293T cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin as previously described (21.Wang M. Tscherne D.M. McCullough C. Caffrey M. García-Sastre A. Rong L. Y161 is a critical residue of HA for receptor recognition.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to make the virus stock. For Western blot analyses, virions were normalized to p24 levels (22.Sen J. Yan T. Wang J. Rong L. Tao L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1: insight into the gp120-gp41 Interaction.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5057-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were lysed by adding Triton X-100 solution to a 1% final amount, and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After SDS-PAGE, transfer and blocking the membranes with 5% milk/TBST, the blots were probed with mouse anti-H5-HA1 monoclonal antibody (BEI Resources). The secondary antibody used was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Millipore Immobilon Western was used for visualization of the bands. The relative amount of HA on the Western blots was determined by a densitometric analysis as previously described (22.Sen J. Yan T. Wang J. Rong L. Tao L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1: insight into the gp120-gp41 Interaction.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5057-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, digital scans of the blots were opened in Photoshop 7.0, the image was inverted, the appropriate bands were selected with the Lasso function, and the mean intensity and area were measured with the Histogram function. Accordingly as, %HA expression=100×(IHA0×AHA0+IHA1×AHA1)/(IHA0wt×AHA0wt+IHA1wt×AHA1wt)(Eq. 1) %HA processing=100×(IHA1×AHA1)(IHA0×AHA0)+IHA1×AHA1)(Eq. 2) where I and A denote the mean intensity and band area, respectively. Based on replicate analyses, errors are estimated to be <10%. The hemagglutination assay was performed as previously described (21.Wang M. Tscherne D.M. McCullough C. Caffrey M. García-Sastre A. Rong L. Y161 is a critical residue of HA for receptor recognition.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with normalization to total HA, which was determined by the Hemagglutinin ELISA Development Kit (Immune Technology Corp.). Briefly, 60 μl of virus or control stocks, purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (22.Sen J. Yan T. Wang J. Rong L. Tao L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1: insight into the gp120-gp41 Interaction.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5057-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were mixed with at different dilutions into a 40-μl suspension of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories) in a U-bottom 96-well plate. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C the results were recorded. The viral entry assays were performed as previously described (21.Wang M. Tscherne D.M. McCullough C. Caffrey M. García-Sastre A. Rong L. Y161 is a critical residue of HA for receptor recognition.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 lung cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, were seeded to 2 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well cell culture plate in a volume of 0.5 ml. The following day, 500 μl of the virus stock was added to each of the wells of the A549 cells after removal of the medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After ∼6 h, the virions were aspirated and replaced with medium and the cells were allowed to rest for another 48 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega and a Berthold FB12 luminometer running Sirius software. In all cases, the viral entry levels fell within the linear range of detection (i.e. the values of the wild-type and mutants never exceeded 3 × 106 relative light units) (22.Sen J. Yan T. Wang J. Rong L. Tao L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1: insight into the gp120-gp41 Interaction.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5057-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Entry levels were normalized to relative p24 levels, which were determined by ELISA as previously described (22.Sen J. Yan T. Wang J. Rong L. Tao L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1: insight into the gp120-gp41 Interaction.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5057-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The inhibition of entry was performed by diluting stock solutions of C179 (1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4) or MBX2329 (20 mm in 100% DMSO) and, in the case of MBX2329, determining the IC50 from the equation: entry = entrymax/(1 + ([inhibitor]/IC50)∧ − n), where entrymax = entry in the absence of inhibitor and n = Hill coefficient. The apo crystal structure of the H5 (PDB code 2FK0) was considered for the modeling studies. The SITE-ID module of the Tripos molecular modeling package (23.Tripos International SybylX 1.3. Tripos International, St. Louis, MI2013Google Scholar) was used to identify the potential small molecule ligand binding sites in the crystal structure. The FlexiDock docking package of Tripos was used to preposition the MBX2329 ligand in the possible ligand binding sites. FlexiDock works in torsional space, keeping the bond lengths and the angles constant while allowing the amino acids interacting with the ligand to be flexible during the docking process. The energetically most favorable position and the pose of MBX2329 obtained from FlexiDock was considered for further modeling studies. The molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) 2The abbreviation used is: MDSmolecular dynamics simulations. in the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (OPLS2005) force field was used to carry out the MDS of the H5 and MBX2329 complex structures. All MDS computations were carried out in MacroModel9.8 implemented in Schrodinger software suite (24.Schrodinger LLC MacroModel version 9.8. Schrodinger LLC, New York2012Google Scholar) in one NPT ensemble (constant pressure and temperature). In the MacroModel dynamics panel, stochastic dynamics were chosen as it includes random forces that stimulate the buffering of a system by solvent molecules. To constrain the bond lengths to the original values, the “SHAKE” option was selected. The simulation of the complex was carried out at 300 K with a time step of 1.5 fs and equilibrium time of 1 ps. The MD simulation was run for 1, 5, and 10 ns recording the energies and the trajectories of the system. The plot of the potential energy versus the time at 10 ns revealed that the system had attained an equilibrium condition. molecular dynamics simulations. The stem loop is comprised of HA2 residues 40–110 (H3 numbering). In addition, we noted that residues 22–35 of HA1 and 17–25 of HA2 also make contacts in this region. Accordingly, we prepared 18 site-directed mutants at 14 different positions to probe the function of the stem loop region in H5 HA. The location and degree of conservation among diverse Groups 1 and 2 HA is shown in Fig. 1a. Positions Thr41, Gln42, Ile45, Asn53, and Leu99 of HA2 are highly conserved and designed to assay the importance of these residues to HA function. Positions Asp26, Ile28, and Met31 of HA1 and Thr49, Val52, Ser54, Ile55, Asp57, and Met102 of HA2 are less conserved and designed to assay differences between Group 1 (i.e. H1 and H5) and Group 2 (i.e. H3 and H7) HA. The location of the mutated side chains with respect to the HA structure is shown in Fig. 1b with HA1 colored blue and HA2 colored red. For clarity, only one monomer of the symmetric trimer is shown. Note that the residues range from being highly solvent exposed to being relatively buried and that the mutated residues are involved in a variety of intra and intermolecular contacts, which will be discussed below. We first assessed the mutational effects on protein expression, processing (i.e. cleavage of HA0 to HA1 and HA2), and incorporation into virions using a Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant virions. The results of this analysis is shown in Fig. 2a using a monoclonal antibody to HA1, which will detect processed HA1 and unprocessed HA0, and summarized in Table 1. In the case of the wild-type, both HA0 and HA1 are observed with the majority of the HA found in virions observed to be processed (∼85%). In the case of the mutants all mutants exhibited >50% HA processing. On the other hand, mutants HA1-D26K, HA1-M102L, HA2-V52A, and HA2-I55A exhibit significantly reduced levels of total HA (<30% of the wild-type HA levels), suggesting that they have significantly reduced the expression and/or incorporation of HA into virions. In contrast, all other mutants exhibit HA levels that are similar to the wild-type, suggesting that the mutation has not significantly affected HA expression, processing, and incorporation into virions. We next used the hemagglutination assay to assess mutational effects on the HA1 conformation and the ability to bind receptor. In this assay, virion preparations are added to red blood cells (RBC) placed at the bottom of the well and binding of virions to RBC is then visualized as the agglutination of the RBC. As shown in Fig. 2b (and summarized in Table 1) all virion preparations cause agglutination of the RBC with mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-I28V, HA1-M31A, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q42A, HA2-I45A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, HA2-S54R, HA2-I55A, HA2-I55V, HA2-D57E, HA2-L99A, and HA2-M102A exhibiting wild-type titers (agglutination observed up to ∼1:16 dilution) and HA1-D26K, HA2-T49A, and HA2-M102L exhibiting lower titers (agglutination observed up to ∼1:4 dilution). Thus, with the possible exceptions of mutants HA1-D26K, HA2-T49A, and HA2-M102L, the mutant HA are competent to bind to their receptor and have presumably not disrupted the HA1 structure.TABLE 1Summary of mutational effects to influenza H5 HAMutantaNumbering according to H3 HA.WT entryHA expressionb% HA expression with respect to the wild-type.HA processingc% Processing with respect to total HA.HemagglutinationdLargest dilution at which agglutination was observed.%WT100 ± 1100851:16HA1-D26K0.10 ± 0.0728501:4HA1-I28A4.4 ± 0.8100731:32HA1-I28V23 ± 383791:16HA1-M31A2.8 ± 1.356741:16HA1-M31L51 ± 1327961:16HA2-T41A17 ± 9150691:32HA2-Q42A14 ± 262771:8HA2-I45A7.4 ± 1.139841:32HA2-T49A19 ± 571641:4HA2-V52A51 ± 12201001:8HA2-N53A2.1 ± 1.5130751:8HA2-S54R47 ± 582791:8HA2-I55A0.7 ± 0.927561:8HA2-I55V67 ± 5120741:16HA2-D57E33 ± 7100751:32HA2-L99A5.8 ± 1.297731:16HA2-M102A11 ± 337751:4HA2-M102L22 ± 943931:8No env0.90 ± 0.30a Numbering according to H3 HA.b % HA expression with respect to the wild-type.c % Processing with respect to total HA.d Largest dilution at which agglutination was observed.

In Fig. 3 (and summarized in Table 1) we show the relative entry of virions containing wild-type or single site mutations into A549 lung cells. First note that all single-site mutations exhibit decreased entry with respect to the wild-type, even those with relatively conservative substitutions (e.g. HA2-T49A or HA2-D57E). For ease of discussion we have divided the effects into 3 classes: non-functional (<1% entry), impaired (1–25%), and intermediate (>25%). Interestingly, there are only 2 mutants that fall into the non-functional category: HA1-D26K and HA2-I55A. Presumably, the very low entry levels of these mutants is due in part to their significantly low levels of expression and/or incorporation into virions. Mutants that exhibit impaired (but measurable) entry include: HA1-I28A, HA1-I28V, HA1-M31A, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q42A, HA2-I45A, HA2-T49A, HA2-N53A, HA2-L99A, HA2-M102A, and HA2-M102L. Finally, mutants that exhibit the least effects on entry include: HA1-M31L, HA2-V52A, HA2-S54R, HA2-I55V, and HA2-D57E. Taken together, the mutational effects on entry underscores the importance of this region of the stem loop region to HA-mediated entry. Previously, the monoclonal antibody C179 has been shown to neutralize the entry of influenza virus (14.Sakabe S. Iwatsuki-Horimoto K. Horimoto T. Nidom C.A. Le Mt. Takano R. Kubota-Koketsu R. Okuno Y. Ozawa M. Kawaoka Y. A cross-reactive neutralizing monoclonal antibody protects mice from H5N1 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.Antiviral Res. 2010; 88: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by binding to the HA stem loop region and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation (15.Dreyfus C. Ekiert D.C. Wilson I.A. Structure of a classical broadly neutralizing stem antibody in complex with a pandemic H2 influenza virus hemagglutinin.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 7149-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we were interested in testing whether our stem loop region mutants would affect the binding and entry inhibition of C179. In this case we used the viral entry assay under conditions where wild-type HA is only partially inhibited (Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2). For this analysis mutants HA1-D26K and HA2-I55A were excluded due to their very low entry levels in the absence of entry inhibitor (Fig. 3 and Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4, under these conditions C179 reduced wild-type entry to 29 ± 3%.

In contrast, HA2-L99A is more sensitive to entry inhibition by C179 (>300% more sensitive, Table 2), suggesting that the mutation enhances antibody binding and/or mode of action. Interestingly, mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31A, HA1-M31L, HA2-I45A, and HA2-I55V render HA less sensitive to entry inhibition by C179 (>200% less sensitive, Table 2) suggesting that the mutation decreases antibody binding and/or mode of action.TABLE 2Summary of mutational effects to inhibition of influenza H5 HA-mediated entry by monoclonal antibody C179 and small molecule MBX2329MutantC179 InhibitionC179 PotencyaPotency is defined as WT inhibition/mutant inhibition.MBX2329 IC50MBX2329 potency%mmWT29 ± 31.04.4 ± 0.61.0HA1-D26KNDbND, not determined.NDHA1-I28A49 ± 50.60.29 ± 0.0915HA1-I28V26 ± 31.16.0 ± 1.00.7HA1-M31A66 ± 160.4NDHA1-M31L46 ± 80.60.23 ± 0.0619HA2-T41A21 ± 41.43.5 ± 0.91.3HA2-Q42A35 ± 60.84.0 ± 0.71.1HA2-I45A88 ± 150.350 ± 60.1HA2-T49A31 ± 10.95.1 ± 0.90.9HA2-V52A38 ± 30.8>50<0.1HA2-N53A37 ± 100.8>50<0.1HA2-S54R32 ± 30.9>50<0.1HA2-I55ANDNDHA2-I55V59 ± 40.56.8 ± 0.90.6HA2-D57E27 ± 31.16.0 ± 1.00.7HA2-L99A9.3 ± 1.13.1>50<0.1HA2-M102A37 ± 30.81.2 ± 0.33.7HA2-M102L37 ± 90.82.4 ± 0.31.8a Potency is defined as WT inhibition/mutant inhibition.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Recently, our groups have described the inhibitory properties of MBX2329, a small drug-like molecule, to diverse Group 1 strains of HA (20.Basu A. Antanasijevic A. Wang M.

New small molecule entry inhibitors targeting hemagglutinin-mediated influenza a virus fusion.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 1447-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on competition assays with antibody C179, MBX2329 binds to the stem loop region of HA (20.Basu A. Antanasijevic A. Wang M. Li B. Mills D.M. Ames J.A. Nash P.J. Williams J.D. Peet N.P. Moir D.T. Prichard M.N. Keith K.A. Barnard D.L. Caffrey M. Rong L. Bowlin T.L. New small molecule entry inhibitors targeting hemagglutinin-mediated influenza a virus fusion.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 1447-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and thus we were interested in testing whether our stem loop region mutations had an effect on the binding and inhibition properties of the compound. Accordingly, we determined the IC50 of wild-type and mutants for MBX2329 with the goal of gaining insight into the binding site of the compound. As shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 2, the mutants exhibit diverse effects. Mutants HA1-I28V, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q42A, HA2-T49A, HA2-I55V, HA2-D57E, and HA2-M102L have little effect on the IC50 of the compound. Interestingly, mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31L, and HA2-M102A have enhanced the inhibitory properties of MBX2329 and thus the mutations appear to improve the binding and/or mode of action of the compound. On the other hand, mutants HA2-I45A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, HA2-S54R, and HA2-L99A become insensitive to MBX2329 and thus the mutation appears to have disrupted the binding and/or mode of action of the compound. Note that this latter set of mutations may give insights into potential escape mechanisms for this compound. In a next step, we analyzed the binding pose of MBX2329 with the HA stem loop region obtained from the 10-ns MDS. Importantly, the docking followed by the MDS was performed without any input from the mutagenesis data. The MBX2329 ligand binding site is found to be in the similar location to that of the TBHQ site within the stem loop (18.Russell R.J. Kerry P.S. Stevens D.J. Steinhauer D.A. Martin S.R. Gamblin S.J. Skehel J.J. Structure of influenza hemagglutinin in complex with an inhibitor of membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17736-17741Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The binding pose of compound and its interaction with the different residues of HA stem is shown in Fig. 6. Notably, MBX2329 shows interactions with the side chains of HA1-Gln40, HA1-Thr31, HA2-Ile45, HA2-Val48, HA2-Thr49, HA2-Val52, and HA2-Asn53. In this work we generated 18 site-directed mutations to 14 conserved sites in the H5 HA stem loop region. In the case of 13 mutations, they had very little effect on HA expression, processing, incorporation into virions, and binding to receptor. On the other hand, mutants HA1-D26K, HA1-M102L, HA2-V52A, and HA2-I55A exhibited reduced HA expression and mutants HA1-D26K, HA2-T49A, and HA2-M102L somewhat reduced hemagglutination. In contrast, many of the mutations significantly impaired HA-mediated viral entry. Interestingly, several of the substitutions disrupting entry were relatively conservative in nature (e.g. HA1-I28V, HA2-T41A, HA2-T49A, HA2-N53A, and HA2-D57E, Table 1), which underscores the importance of this region to HA function and its sensitivity to structural perturbations for HA-mediated entry. In addition, we presented a molecular dynamics model of the complex between MBX2329, a promising small molecule inhibitor of Group 1 HA-mediated entry (20.Basu A. Antanasijevic A. Wang M. Li B. Mills D.M. Ames J.A. Nash P.J. Williams J.D. Peet N.P. Moir D.T. Prichard M.N. Keith K.A. Barnard D.L. Caffrey M. Rong L. Bowlin T.L. New small molecule entry inhibitors targeting hemagglutinin-mediated influenza a virus fusion.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 1447-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and H5 HA. Importantly, the model is independently validated by our mutagenesis studies. For example, mutations at residues HA2-Ile45, HA2-Val52, and HA2-Asn53 greatly reduced the potency of the compound (Fig. 5 and Table 2) in very good agreement with the molecular dynamics model shown in Fig. 6. Moreover, residues HA2-Val52 and HA2-Asn53 are not conserved between Groups 1 and 2 HA (Fig. 1), which may partially explain the selective activity of MBX2329 for Group 1 HA (20.Basu A. Antanasijevic A. Wang M. Li B. Mills D.M. Ames J.A. Nash P.J. Williams J.D. Peet N.P. Moir D.T. Prichard M.N. Keith K.A. Barnard D.L. Caffrey M. Rong L. Bowlin T.L. New small molecule entry inhibitors targeting hemagglutinin-mediated influenza a virus fusion.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 1447-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the modeled site is proximal but shifted toward the viral membrane with respect to the TBHQ site determined by x-ray crystallography (18.Russell R.J. Kerry P.S. Stevens D.J. Steinhauer D.A. Martin S.R. Gamblin S.J. Skehel J.J. Structure of influenza hemagglutinin in complex with an inhibitor of membrane fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17736-17741Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and another entry inhibitor, termed 4c, determined by molecular modeling (28.Vanderlinden E. Göktas F. Cesur Z. Froeyen M. Reed M.L. Russell C.J. Cesur N. Naesens L. Novel inhibitors of influenza virus fusion: structure-activity relationship and interaction with the viral hemagglutinin.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 4277-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and thus the MBX2329 binding pocket may represent a novel site for therapeutic intervention of influenza entry. A number of mutations have previously been characterized for HA at the identical sites. For example, Reed et al. (29.Reed M.L. Yen H.L. DuBois R.M. Bridges O.A. Salomon R. Webster R.G. Russell C.J. Amino acid residues in the fusion peptide pocket regulate the pH of activation of the H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin protein.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 3568-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have characterized the equivalent HA2-S54R mutant in H5 HA and found that the mutation significantly disrupted entry and fusion, an observation that is in agreement with the results presented in this work (cf. Table 1). On the other hand, Qiao et al. (30.Qiao H. Pelletier S.L. Hoffman L. Hacker J. Armstrong R.T. White J.M. Specific single or double proline substitutions in the “spring-loaded” coiled-coil region of the influenza hemagglutinin impair or abolish membrane fusion activity.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that HA2-V55A was competent for fusion, which is somewhat different from our result (cf. Table 1) and most probably due to subtle differences in the sequence and structure of H3, a Group 2 HA, and H5, a Group 1 HA. In another study, Casali et al. (31.Casali M. Banta S. Zambonelli C. Megeed Z. Yarmush M.L. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hinge peptide from the hemagglutinin protein: enhancement of the pH-responsive conformational change.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) characterized synthetic peptides corresponding to part of the region under study in this work and found that the HA2-E57Q substitution significantly decreased the native helical content at both neutral and acidic pH underscoring the importance of this residue to HA structure and function, an observation in agreement with the decreased entry of our HA2-D57E mutant (cf. Table 1). Finally it is next of interest to consider the mutational effects with respect to the H5 HA structure. In Fig. 7 we show space filling diagrams of the effects on entry, C179 entry inhibition and MBX2329 entry inhibition. In this representation, we have considered the outer face (i.e. solvent exposed) and inner face (i.e. contact region with other subunits) of a single HA monomer. The red, blue, and green coloring scheme corresponds to negative, minimal, and enhanced effects on HA-mediated entry, respectively. In the case of the mutational effects on virus entry, substitutions to HA2-Ile45 and HA2-Asn53 of the HA outer face and HA1-Ile28, HA1-Met31, and HA2-Leu99 of the HA inner face had the largest effects (red color, entry <10% of the wild-type). Note that during entry, the depicted inner residues are not in a region that undergoes a large conformational change (8.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar, 9.Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and thus the mutational effects most likely arise from perturbation of the beginning neutral pH structure. In contrast, the depicted outer residues are in a region that undergoes a large conformational change (8.Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Receptor binding and membrane fusion in virus entry: the influenza hemagglutinin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar, 9.Harrison S.C. Viral membrane fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and thus mutational effects could arise from perturbation of the beginning structure (i.e. the neutral pH conformation) and/or later structures (i.e. the low pH conformations). In the case of the mutational effects on entry inhibition by the monoclonal antibody C179, substitutions to HA2-Ile45 of the outer face and HA1-Met31 and HA2-Ile45 of the inner face decreased potency to ≤0.5 with respect to the wild-type (Fig. 7, red color). In contrast, substitution of HA2-Leu99 enhanced potency of the antibody to >3 with respect to the wild-type (green color). With respect to the neutral and low pH conformations of HA, C179 binds to the neutral pH conformation shown in Fig. 7 (15.Dreyfus C. Ekiert D.C. Wilson I.A. Structure of a classical broadly neutralizing stem antibody in complex with a pandemic H2 influenza virus hemagglutinin.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 7149-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mutational effects of the residues depicted on the outer face are presumably due to direct interactions with the antibody and the mutational effects of the residues depicted on the inner face are presumably indirect and propagated effects. In the case of the mutational effects on entry inhibition by the small molecule MBX2329, substitutions to HA2-Ile45, HA2-Val52, HA2-Asn53, and HA2-Ser54 of the outer face and HA2-Leu99 of the inner face had the largest effects (Fig. 7, red color, potency ≤0.1 with respect to the wild-type). Importantly, these residues are highly conserved in the Group 1 HA (e.g. H1 and H5, Fig. 1a), which is the group that MBX2329 inhibits. On the other hand, substitutions to HA1-Ile28, HA1-Met31, and HA2-Met102 of the inner face significantly enhanced entry inhibition by MBX2329 (green color, potency ≥3). With respect to the neutral and low pH conformations of HA, we suggest that the mutational effects depicted for the outer face residues directly affect the binding of MBX2329 to the neutral pH conformation, which is in agreement with the molecular dynamics model shown in Fig. 6, and the mutational effects depicted for the inner face residues to be indirectly affecting the binding of the compound to the neutral pH conformation. Nonetheless, more subtle mutational effects to the low pH conformations are possible. Finally, residues HA1-Met31, HA2-Ile45, and HA2-Leu99 exhibited large effects in all three assays, suggesting that they may represent especially sensitive regions within the HA stem loop region. Notably, HA2-Ile45 is highly conserved among all HA subtypes (Fig. 1) and is located on the outer solvent-exposed face of HA (Fig. 7). In summary, the mutations presented herein underscore the importance of the stem loop region to HA function. Importantly, many of the sensitive sites of the HA stem loop region are highly conserved and solvent exposed and, moreover, they may represent novel target sites for therapeutic intervention of influenza entry. Such sites may be of particular importance in targeting new pandemic outbreaks of influenza including those of avian H5 and H7 HA."
https://openalex.org/W2032122856,"Most of our knowledge of dominance stems from studies of deleterious mutations. From these studies we know that most deleterious mutations are recessive, and that this recessivity arises from a hyperbolic relationship between protein function (i.e., protein concentration or activity) and fitness. Here we investigate whether this knowledge can be used to make predictions about the dominance of beneficial and deleterious mutations in a single gene. We employed a model system – the bacteriophage φ6 – that allowed us to generate a collection of mutations in haploid conditions so that it was not biased toward either dominant beneficial or recessive deleterious mutations. Screening for the ability to infect a bacterial host that does not permit infection by the wildtype φ6, we generated a collection of mutations in P3, a gene involved in attachment to the host and in phage particle assembly. The resulting collection contained mutations with both deleterious and beneficial effects on fitness. The deleterious mutations in our collection had additive effects on fitness and the beneficial mutations were recessive. Neither of these observations were predicted from previous studies of dominance. This pattern is not consistent with the hyperbolic (diminishing returns) relationship between protein function and fitness that is characteristic of enzymatic genes, but could have resulted from a curve of increasing returns."

To extend the application of MRI contrast agents to plant research and to develop related techniques to study root systems, we examined the applicability of the MRI contrast agent Gd-DTPA to the imaging of rice roots. Specifically, we examined the biological effects of various concentrations of Gd-DTPA on rice growth and MRI images. Analysis of electrical conductivity and plant height demonstrated that 5 mmol Gd-DTPA had little impact on rice in the short-term. The results of signal intensity and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) analysis suggested that 5 mmol Gd-DTPA was the appropriate concentration for enhancing MRI signals. In addition, examination of the long-term effects of Gd-DTPA on plant height showed that levels of this compound up to 5 mmol had little impact on rice growth and (to some extent) increased the biomass of rice."

The COPII coat consists of an inner layer of the Sec23/24 heterodimeric complex surrounded by an outer layer of the Sec13/31 heterotetramer complex, and these components are sequentially assembled onto the ER membrane through the action of the small GTPase Sar1 (4Nakańo A.

However, it is not clear whether these COPII paralogs are functionally redundant or whether their multiplication represents an adaptation to either the increased complexity of cargo proteins or to the tissue-specific requirements.

In this study, we show that S. cerevisiae contains a novel Sec23 paralog that we designated Nel1 (non-ERES-localized Sec23 homolog 1), which appears to have a function distinct from that of Sec23. We found that purified Nel1 activates the GTPase activity of Sar1 but does not associate with any of the COPII coat components. Nel1 is predominantly localized throughout the cytosol, and the chromosomal disruption of NEL1 affects the growth phenotype of the temperature-sensitive sar1 mutant. Our findings provide a possible functional link between Sar1 and its novel GAP, Nel1. The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab The coding sequences of the NEL1 gene or the SEC23 gene, together with its upstream and downstream flanking regions, were amplified by PCR using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA and inserted into the NotI and BamHI (NEL1) or the BamHI and SalI (SEC23) sites of pRS316 (CEN, URA3), yielding pNEL1/316 and pSEC23/316, respectively. A fragment, including the TDH3 promoter and CMK1 terminator, was inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of pRS316, pYO326 (2μ, URA3), pYO324 (2μ, TRP1), and pRS314 (CEN, TRP), yielding pCKY4, pCKY5, pCKY6, and pCKY8, respectively. The coding sequences of the NEL1 and SEC23 genes were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the BglII site (located between TDH3 promoter and CMK1 terminator) of pCKY5, yielding pNEL1/CKY5 and pSEC23/CKY5, respectively. To generate plasmids for yeast two-hybrid analysis, NEL1 was cloned into the BglII sites of pGAD-C1 and pGBDU-C1 (24James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SEC24, which was digested with SmaI and XhoI, was cloned into the SmaI and SalI sites of pGAD-C1 and pGBDU-C1. SEC23, LST1, and ISS1 were cloned into the BamHI and SalI, EcoRI and BamHI, and BamHI and PstI sites, respectively, of pGAD-C1. For Nel1-MBP purification, the coding sequence of NEL1 together with a Myc tag at the N terminus and an SphI site just before the stop codon was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the BglII site of pCKY6, and a fragment encoding MBP, amplified by PCR from pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs), was inserted into the SphI site, yielding pNEL1-MBP/CKY6. For Nel1-R592A-MBP purification, the R592A mutation was introduced into pNEL1-MBP/CKY6 by primer-directed mutagenesis, yielding pNEL1-R592A-MBP/CKY6. For pulldown assay, plasmids expressing Sec24-HA, Lst1-HA, or Iss1-HA under the GAL promoter were obtained from yeast ORF collection (Open Biosystems). A fragment encoding MBP together with a Myc tag at the N terminus was amplified by PCR from pMAL-c2x and inserted into the BglII site of pCKY8, yielding pMBP/CKY8. The coding sequence of SEC23 together with a Myc tag at the N terminus and an XmaI site just before the stop codon were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the SacI and XhoI sites of pYES3/CT (Invitrogen), and a fragment encoding MBP, amplified by PCR from pMAL-c2x, was inserted into the XmaI site, yielding pSEC23-MBP/YES3. To obtain the plasmid pNEL1–13Myc/316, we first generated a yeast strain CKY4 by a PCR-based procedure using pFA6a-13Myc-TRP1 (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar), which chromosomally expresses C-terminally 13Myc-tagged Nel1. The coding sequence of the Nel1–13Myc, together with its upstream and downstream flanking regions, was amplified by PCR from the genome of the CKY4 strain and inserted into the NotI and BamHI sites of pRS316, yielding pNEL1–13Myc/316. The fragment encoding enhanced GFP was inserted into the BglII and HindIII sites of pCKY4, yielding pCKY7. The coding region of NEL1, amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA, was inserted into the BglII site of pCKY7, yielding pNEL1/CKY7. The coding sequences of the NEL1 and HTB1 genes, together with their upstream and downstream flanking regions, were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the NotI and BamHI (NEL1) and NotI and XhoI (HTB1) sites of pRS314 (CEN, TRP1), yielding pNEL1/314 and pHTB1/314, respectively. For the fluorescent protein fusions, SphI (NEL1) and BamHI (HTB1) sites were created just before the stop codon of each gene. Then, fragments encoding mCherry and AcGFP (Clontech) were inserted into the SphI (Nel1-mCherry) and BamHI (Htb1-GFP) sites, yielding pNEL1-mCherry/314 and pHTB1-GFP/314, respectively. A fragment encoding NEL1-mCherry, amplified by PCR from pNEL1-mCherry/314, was then inserted into the BglII site of pCKY4, yielding pNEL1-mCherry/CKY4. Sar1, Sec23/24, and Sec13/31 were purified as described previously (6Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R.

Schekman R. The use of liposomes to study COPII- and COPI-coated vesicle formation and membrane protein sorting.Methods. 2000; 20: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nel1-MBP and Nel1-R592A-MBP were purified from yeast YPH500 cells carrying the pNEL1-MBP/CKY6 or pNEL1-R592A-MBP/CKY6 plasmids, respectively. The cells were grown to late-log phase at 30 °C. The cells from 12 liters of cultures were washed with distilled water and then resuspended in suspension buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing a 3× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell suspension was frozen as drops by pouring it into liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were subsequently blended and thawed on ice. From the supernatant obtained from a 20-min centrifugation at 9,500 rpm with a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C, the protein extract was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 42,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in a Hitachi P45AT rotor. The supernatant was incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with wash buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and then with wash buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Nel1-MBP and Nel1-R592A-MBP were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 50 mm maltose, 10% glycerol). YPH500 cells carrying the appropriate plasmids were pregrown to mid-log phase at 30 °C in MCD medium and then transferred to MCGS medium. After a 2.5-h incubation, 20 absorbance units of cells (per sample) were harvested and resuspended in suspension buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). The cells were disrupted by vortex mixing with glass beads at 4 °C, and protein extracts were incubated with amylose resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed with the suspension buffer, and samples were eluted by elution buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm KoAc, 50 mm maltose, 10% glycerol). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements and liposome binding assays were carried out as described previously (15Antonny B. Madden D.

Dissection of COPII subunit-cargo assembly and disassembly kinetics during Sar1p-GTP hydrolysis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with synthetic major-minor mix liposomes (27Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. COPII-coated vesicle formation reconstituted with purified coat proteins and chemically defined liposomes.Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteins were grown to mid-log phase at 23 °C. Fluorescence microscopy observations were carried out using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a CSU10 spinning-disk confocal scanner (Yokogawa Electric Corp.) and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (iXon, DV897; Andor Technology). The acquired images were analyzed using Andor iQ (Andor Technology). In this setting, a 473-nm solid-state laser (J050BS; Showa Optronics) was used to excite AcGFP, enhanced GFP, and mCherry at 561 nm (Jive; Cobolt). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (28Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. In vitro reconstitution of intercompartmental protein transport to the yeast vacuole.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, CKY1 cells carrying pNEL1–13Myc/316 were grown to mid-log phase, and 500 absorbance units of cells (per sample) were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with Zymolyase. The spheroplasts were resuspended in 2× lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 400 mm sorbitol, 100 mm KoAc, 4 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm DTT) and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman JA-14 rotor. The spheroplast pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm sorbitol, 50 mm KoAc, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm DTT) and then subjected to seven strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken materials, yielding the total fractions (S3). The total fractions were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min to generate the S13 supernatants and P13 pellets. The P13 pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A search of the yeast S. cerevisiae genome revealed an uncharacterized open reading frame, YHR035W, that encodes a 630-amino acid nonessential protein with sequence similarity to members of the Sec23 family, which we designated Nel1. Alignment analysis using ClustalX revealed that Nel1 has strong similarity to Sec23, with 21% identity and 37% similarity. Nel1 contains a putative catalytic arginine residue (Arg-592) necessary for the GAP activity on Sar1 (Fig. 1) (9Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarity of Nel1 to Sec23, we first examined whether Nel1 could complement the temperature sensitivity of a sec23-1 mutant (29Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Identification of 23 complementation groups required for post-translational events in the yeast secretory pathway.Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Because sec23-1 cells already have a chromosomal copy of NEL1, endogenous expression of Nel1 is clearly not sufficient to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the sec23-1 strain. However, even high copy expression of Nel1 under the control of a strong constitutive TDH3 promoter could not suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the sec23-1 mutant (Fig. 2A). In addition, overexpression of Nel1 was not found to have obvious effects on growth of the other early sec mutants tested (sar1D32G, sar1E112K, sar1N132I, sec12-4, sec13-1, or sec16-2) (data not shown). A previous study has shown that overexpression of Sec23 leads to growth inhibition in wild-type cells, presumably by disturbing the GDP/GTP cycling of Sar1 through the excess GAP activity of Sec23 (30Kurihara T. Hamamoto S. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Yoshihisa T. Sec24p and Iss1p function interchangeably in transport vesicle formation from the endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 983-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Nel1 did not cause any apparent growth defect in wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). The combined results suggest that Nel1 activity is not functionally redundant with Sec23, thus suggesting a specialized role(s) for this protein in vivo. In S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes, Sec23 forms a stable complex with either Sec24 or its closely related homologs (9Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Nel1 could also associate with Sec24 and its yeast homologs, Lst1 or Iss1 (30Kurihara T. Hamamoto S. Gimeno R.E. Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Yoshihisa T. Sec24p and Iss1p function interchangeably in transport vesicle formation from the endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 983-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. LST1 is a SEC24 homologue used for selective export of the plasma membrane ATPase from the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Shimoni Y. Kurihara T. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Orci L. Schekman R. Lst1p and Sec24p cooperate in sorting of the plasma membrane ATPase into COPII vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As revealed by a yeast two-hybrid assay, Sec23 indeed associated with Sec24, whereas no interactions were observed between Nel1 and Sec24, Lst1, or Iss1 (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the two-hybrid results, we performed pulldown experiments in lysates prepared from yeast cells expressing both Nel1 tagged C-terminally with an MBP tag (Nel1-MBP) and HA-tagged Sec24, Lst1, or Iss1. As shown in Fig. 2D, we observed that Nel1-MBP was not able to pull down Sec24, Lst1, or Iss1, whereas Sec23-MBP formed complexes with Sec24 and its isoforms. Indeed, SDS-PAGE analysis of the affinity-purified Nel1-MBP fusion protein revealed that additional components did not copurify with Nel1-MBP (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these findings, the residues in Sec23 involved in the intersubunit interactions between Sec23 and Sec24 are poorly conserved in Nel1 (Fig. 1) (9Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, unlike Sec23, Nel1 may not associate with Sec24 and its homologs. Despite the absence of a detectable interaction with Sec24 and its homologs, Nel1 contains a region with sequence homology to the C-terminal domain of Sec23, which includes a crucial arginine residue required for Sec23 GAP activity (Fig. 1) (9Bi X. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII vesicle coat.Nature. 2002; 419: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The corresponding arginine residue is also conserved in Nel1 (Arg-592), which suggests that Nel1 may also have GAP activity toward Sar1. To examine whether Nel1 affects Sar1 GTPase activity, affinity-purified Nel1-MBP was tested for GAP activity on Sar1 by using a real time tryptophan fluorescence assay (15Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Dynamics of the COPII coat with GTP and stable analogues.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 17Sato K. Nakano A. Dissection of COPII subunit-cargo assembly and disassembly kinetics during Sar1p-GTP hydrolysis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We incubated liposomes (“major-minor mix” lipids, previously established as the optimal composition for COPII recruitment) (27Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. COPII-coated vesicle formation reconstituted with purified coat proteins and chemically defined liposomes.Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) preloaded with Sar1-GTP and monitored the decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Sar1 that accompanies the conversion of Sar1 from the GTP state to the GDP state after the addition of Nel1-MBP or control Sec23/24 (Fig. 3B). As expected, the addition of Nel1-MBP markedly accelerated the GTPase activity of Sar1. At an equal molar concentration, Nel1 was ∼5-fold (in arbitrary units) more potent than Sec23/24 at promoting GTP hydrolysis on Sar1. Replacement of the arginine 592 residue of Nel1 with alanine (Nel1-R592A-MBP) virtually abolished Nel1's GAP activity, indicating the direct involvement of this residue in catalysis. We also examined the effect of Nel1-R592A overexpression on the growth of the wild-type strain and observed no detectable alternation in growth rate (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Nel1 GAP activity is not directly involved in normal cell growth. We next determined whether the GAP activity of Nel1 could be further accelerated by Sec13/31, as has been observed with Sec23 (15Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Dynamics of the COPII coat with GTP and stable analogues.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the presence of Sec13/31 did not substantially influence the GAP activity of Nel1 (Fig. 3C). Assembly of the COPII coat proceeds in a stepwise manner by the recruitment of Sar1-GTP, which binds to the lipid surface, followed by association of Sec23/24 and Sec13/31"
https://openalex.org/W2019295084,"There is an urgent need for a rapid diagnostic system to detect the H5 subtype of the influenza A virus. We previously developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) for use in a rapid diagnostic kit. In this study, we determined the epitopes of the anti-H5 HA murine mAbs OM-b, AY-2C2, and YH-1A1. Binding assays of the mAbs to different strains of H5 HAs indicated that OM-b and AY-2C2 cross-reacted with HAs from clades 1, 2.1.3.2, 2.2, and 2.3.4, whereas YH-1A1 failed to bind to those of clades 2.1.3.2 and 2.3.4. HA chimeras revealed that the epitopes for each of the mAbs were in the HA1 region. Analysis of escape mutants revealed that OM-b and AY-2C2 mAbs interacted mainly with amino acid residues D43 and G46, and the YH-1A1 mAb interacted with G139 and K or R140 of H5 HA. Multiple alignments of H5 HA protein sequences showed that D43 and G46 were very conserved among H5N1 HAs, except those in clade 2.2.1 and clade 7 (88.7%). The epitope for YH-1A1 mAb was highly variable in the HAs of H5N1, although it was well conserved in those of H5N2-N9. The OM-b and AY-2C2 mAbs could bind to the HAs of clades 1.1 and 2.3.2.1 that are currently epidemic in Asia, and we conclude that these would be effective for the detection of H5N1 infections in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2020365024,"One distinctive feature of Purkinje cells is that they have two types of discharge: in addition to simple spikes they fire complex spikes in response to input from the climbing fibers. These complex spikes have an initial rapid burst of spikes and spikelets followed by a sustained depolarization; in some models of cerebellar function this climbing fiber input supervises learning in Purkinje cells. On the other hand, synaptic plasticity is often thought to rely on the timing of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spikes. It is suggested here that the period of depolarization following a complex spike, combined with a simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule, gives a mechanism for the climbing fiber to supervise learning in the Purkinje cell. This proposal is illustrated using a simple simulation in which it is seen that the climbing fiber succeeds in supervising the learning."
https://openalex.org/W2072875431,"Iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) researchers have shown that strong positive reputations plus an efficient reputation evaluation system encourages both sides to pursue long-term collaboration and to avoid falling into mutual defection cycles. In agent-based environments with reliable reputation rating systems, agents interested in maximizing their private interests must show concern for other agents as well as their own self-reputations--an important capability that standard IPD game agents lack. Here we present a novel learning agent model possessing self-reputation awareness. Agents in our proposed model are capable of evaluating self-behaviors based on a mix of public and private interest considerations, and of testing various solutions aimed at meeting social standards. Simulation results indicate multiple outcomes from the addition of a small percentage of self-reputation awareness agents: faster cooperation, faster movement toward stability in an agent society, a higher level of public interest in the agent society, the resolution of common conflicts between public and private interests, and a lower potential for rational individual behavior to transform into irrational group behavior."
