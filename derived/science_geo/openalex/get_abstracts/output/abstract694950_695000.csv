https://openalex.org/W4285411980,"We probed the transmission of COVID-19 by applying an airborne transmission model to five well-documented case studies—a Washington state church choir, a Korean call center, a Korean exercise class, and two different Chinese bus trips. For all events the likely index patients were pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, which is when infective patients are most likely to interact with large groups of people. Applying the model to those events yields results that suggest the following: (1) transmission was airborne; (2) superspreading events do not require an index patient with an unusually high viral load; (3) the viral loads for all of the index patients were of the same order of magnitude and consistent with experimentally measured values for patients at the onset of symptoms, even though viral loads across the population vary by a factor of &gt;10 8 . In particular we used a Wells-Riley exposure model to calculate q , the total average number of infectious quanta inhaled by a person at the event. Given the q value for each event, the simple airborne transmission model was used to determined S q , the rate at which the index patient exhaled infectious quanta and N 0 , the characteristic number of COVID-19 virions needed to induce infection. Despite the uncertainties in the values of some parameters of the superspreading events, all five events yielded ( N 0 ∼300–2,000 virions), which is similar to published values for influenza. Finally, this work describes the conditions under which similar methods can provide actionable information on the transmission of other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W4281626851,"There is a dearth of literature that provides a bibliometric analysis concerning the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in sustainable agriculture therefore this study attempts to fill this research gap and provides evidence from the studies conducted between 2000–2021 in this field of research. The study is a systematic bibliographic analysis of the 465 previous articles and reviews done between 2000–2021 in relation to the utilization of AI in sustainable methods of agriculture. The results of the study have been visualized and presented using the VOSviewer and Biblioshiny visualizer software. The results obtained post analysis indicate that, the amount of academic works published in the field of AI’s role in enabling sustainable agriculture increased significantly from 2018. Therefore, there is conclusive evidence that the growth trajectory shows a significant climb upwards. Geographically analysed, the country collaboration network highlights that most number of studies in the realm of this study originate from China, USA, India, Iran, France. The co-author network analysis results represent that there are multi-disciplinary collaborations and interactions between prominent authors from United States of America, China, United Kingdom and Germany. The final framework provided from this bibliometric study will help future researchers identify the key areas of interest in research of AI and sustainable agriculture and narrow down on the countries where prominent academic work is published to explore co-authorship opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W4285412119,"The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of collaboration-based business model innovation through an open innovation strategy among multigenerational-cohort SMEs in the context of the Thailand setting. This current research identified four key antecedents of open innovation based on resource and capability review. Open innovation is examined in two main strategies: (1) open innovation breadth and depth, and (2) open innovation cooperation. Using survey data from family-owned SMEs in Thailand, we estimate multigroup structural invariance models considering four generational cohorts by age: Generation Z, Generation Y, Generation X, and Baby Boomers. The empirical results indicated that family business owners are more likely to pay attention to innovative human capital and strategic agility among Generation Y and Baby Boomers. Meanwhile, Generation Z, Generation Y, and Baby Boomers tend to understand the importance of strategic agility before they strategize their breadth and depth of open innovation. To execute an open innovation strategy, Generation Z, Generation Y, and Generation X tend to implement a partner-search strategy and then do a cooperation plan. Our findings imply that business practitioners should understand the moderating role of generational cohorts due to their experience age. There are differences among Generation Z, Generation Y, and Generation X when participating in collaboration-based business model innovation using an open innovation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4285685099,"Introduction Few studies have described the drivers of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in India from the perspective of those involved in the design and implementation of vaccine campaigns–such as government officials and civil society stakeholders–a prerequisite to developing approaches to address this barrier to high immunization coverage and further child health improvements. Methods We conducted a qualitative study to understand government officials and civil society stakeholders’ perceptions of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India. We conducted in-depth phone interviews using a structured guide of open-ended questions with 21 participants from international and national non-governmental organizations, professional associations, and universities, and state and national government–six national-level stakeholders in New Delhi, six state-level stakeholders in Uttar Pradesh, six in Kerala, and three in Gujarat–from July 2020 to October 2020. We analyzed data through a multi-stage process following Grounded Theory. We present findings on individual-level, contextual, and vaccine/vaccination program-specific factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Results We identified multiple drivers and complex ways they influence vaccine beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors from the perspective of government officials and civil society stakeholders involved in vaccine campaigns. Important individual-level influences were low awareness of the benefits of vaccination, safety concerns, especially related to mild adverse events following immunization, and mistrust in government and health service quality. Contextual-level factors included communications, the media environment, and social media, which serves as a major conduit of misinformation and driver of hesitancy, as well as sociodemographic factors–specific drivers varied widely by income, education, urban/rural setting, and across religious and cultural groups. Among vaccine/vaccination-level issues, vaccine program design and delivery and the role of health care professionals emerged as the strongest determinants of hesitancy. Conclusions Drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India, as elsewhere, vary widely by local context; successful interventions should address individual, contextual, and vaccine-specific factors. While previous studies focused on individual-level factors, our study demonstrates the equal importance of contextual and vaccine-specific influences, especially the communication and media environment, influential leaders, sociodemographic factors, and frontline health workers."
https://openalex.org/W4281657902,"The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic left the Indian healthcare system overwhelmed. The severity of a third wave will depend on the success of the vaccination drive; however, even with a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, hesitancy can be an obstacle to achieving high levels of coverage. Our study aims to estimate the population’s acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in an Indian district. A pilot community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March-May 2021. The data was collected from eight primary health centres in Tamil Nadu. The eligible study participants were interviewed using a self-constructed questionnaire. A total of 3,130 individuals responded to the survey. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Results of our study showed that 46% percent (n = 1432) of the respondents would accept the COVID-19 vaccine if available. Acceptance for the COVID-19 vaccine was higher among males (54%), individuals aged 18-24years (62%), those with higher education (77%), having the higher income (73%), and employed (51%). Individuals with no education (OR: 2.799, 95% CI = 1.103–7.108), and low income (OR: OR: 10.299, 95% CI: 4.879–21.741), were significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy (p &lt; 0.05). Living in urban residence (OR: 0.699, 95% CI = 0.55–0.888) and age between 18 to 25 years (OR: 0.549, 95% CI = 0.309–0.977) were protective factor of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. While individuals in the age group 25-54years (OR = 1.601, 95%CI = 1.086–2.359), fewer education (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.448–9.412,), low income (OR = 2.628, 95% CI = 1.777–3.887) and unemployment (OR = 1.351, 95% CI = 1.06–1.722) had high odds of refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns and suspicions about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine (63%) was the major reasons causing hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine The public health authorities and government need to design, develop and implement targeted interventions to enhance awareness about COVID-19 vaccines, and barriers and enablers to vaccine acceptance among individuals across diverse settings. Emphasis on involving local and religious leaders, ASHA workers, community healthcare workers, Anganwadi workers, and auxiliary nurse midwives can help to overcome context-specific barriers in areas of low COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, especially in rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W4281747293,"Over the past three decades, undernutrition has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five years globally. Low birth weight has been identified as a risk factor for child morbidity and mortality, especially among children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. There is, however, a paucity of empirical literature establishing the association between low birth weight and undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the association between birth weight and nutritional status of children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.Our analyses were performed on a weighted sample of 110,497 children under five years from 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Data were obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted from 2010 to 2019. We reported the prevalence of low birth weight and nutritional status (stunting, wasting, and underweight) for all the 32 countries using percentages. We used multilevel binary logistic regression to examine the association between birth weight and nutritional status (stunting, wasting, and underweight) of the children, controlling for covariates. The results of the regression analyses were presented using adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.The prevalence of low birth weight was 5.4%, with the highest (13.1%) and lowest (0.9%) reportedin South Africa and Chad, respectively. The pooled prevalence of wasting, underweight, and stunting were 8.1%, 17.0%, and 31.3%, respectively. Niger had the highest prevalence of wasting (21.5%) and underweight (37.1%), whereas Burundi had the highest prevalence of stunting (51.7%). We found that children with low birth weight were more likely to be stunted [aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.58-1.78], underweight [aOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.70-1.94], and wasted [aOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.20-1.38] after controlling for covariates.Our study has demonstrated that low birth weight is a key determinant of undernutrition among children under five in sub-Saharan Africa. Policymakers need to give special attention to improving the nutritional status of children under-five years in sub-Saharan Africa by implementing measures aimed at enhancing the weight of children. To accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 target of ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-five by 2030, it is imperative for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to intensify interventions aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition. Specific nutrition interventions such as dietary modification counselling should prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W4281889701,"Tobacco black shank is a kind of soil-borne disease caused by the Oomycete Phytophthora parasitica. This disease is one of the most destructive diseases to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) growth worldwide. At present, various measures have been taken to control this disease, but they still have different challenges and limitations. Studies have shown that β-aminobutyric acid (BABA), a nonprotein amino acid, can enhance disease resistance in plants against different varieties of pathogens. However, it is unclear whether BABA can induce plants to resist Phytophthora parasitica infection. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effect and related mechanism of BABA against tobacco black shank. Our results showed that 5 mmol.L-1 BABA had an obvious anti-inducing effect on the pathogenic fungus and could effectively inhibit the formation of dark spots in the stems. The results also showed that a large amount of callose deposition was observed in BABA-treated tobacco. Furthermore, the application of BABA induced the accumulation of H2O2 in tobacco and effectively regulated the homeostasis of reactive oxygen in tobacco plants, reducing the toxicity of H2O2 to plants while activating the defense system. In addition, BABA spray treatment could induce an increase in the concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile) in tobacco, and the gene expression results confirmed that BABA upregulated the expression of SA-related genes (PR1, PR2 and PR5), JA-related genes (PDF1.2) and ET-related genes (EFE26 and ACC oxidase) in tobacco plants. Taken together, BABA could activate tobacco resistance to black shank disease by increasing H2O2 accumulation, callose deposition, plant hormone (SA and JA-Ile) production, and SA-, JA-, and ET- signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4281744663,"White sharks ( Carcharodon carcharias ) are the largest shark species to display regional endothermy. This capability likely facilitates exploitation of resources beyond thermal tolerance thresholds of potential sympatric competitors as well as sustained elevated swim speeds, but results in increased metabolic costs of adults, which has been documented in different studies. Little, however, is known of the metabolic requirements in free-swimming juveniles of the species, due to their large size at birth and challenges in measuring their oxygen consumption rates in captivity. We used trilateration of positional data from high resolution acoustic-telemetry to derive swim speeds from speed-over-ground calculations for eighteen free-swimming individual juvenile white sharks, and subsequently estimate associated mass-specific oxygen consumption rates as a proxy for field routine metabolic rates. Resulting estimates of mass-specific field routine metabolic rates (368 mg O 2 kg −1 h −1 ± 27 mg O 2 kg −1 h −1 [mean ± S.D.]) are markedly lower than those reported in sub-adult and adult white sharks by previous studies. We argue that median cruising speeds while aggregating at nearshore nursery habitats (0.6 m s -1 [mean ± S.E = 0.59 ± 0.001], 0.3 TL s -1 ) are likely a feature of behavioral strategies designed to optimize bioenergetic efficiency, by modulating activity rates in response to environmental temperature profiles to buffer heat loss and maintain homeostasis. Such behavioral strategies more closely resemble those exhibited in ectotherm sharks, than mature conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W4285413571,"The TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) transcription factors is one of the superfamilies of plant-specific transcription factors involved in plant growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress. However, there is no report on the research of the TCP transcription factors in soybean response to Phytophthora sojae. In this study, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to introduce the CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector into soybean cultivar ""Williams 82"" and generated targeted mutants of GmTCP19L gene, which was previously related to involve in soybean responses to P. sojae. We obtained the tcp19l mutants with 2-bp deletion at GmTCP19L coding region, and the frameshift mutations produced premature translation termination codons and truncated GmTCP19L proteins, increasing susceptibility to P. sojae in the T2-generation. These results suggest that GmTCP19L encodes a TCP transcription factor that affects plant defense in soybean. The new soybean germplasm with homozygous tcp19l mutations but the BAR and Cas9 sequences were undetectable using strip and PCR methods, respectively, suggesting directions for the breeding or genetic engineering of disease-resistant soybean plants."

https://openalex.org/W4281671360,"In the last two decades, social psychologists have identified several key spending strategies that promote happiness such as making time-saving purchases (buying time) and spending money on others (prosocial spending). Although the emotional benefits of these two spending strategies are well-documented in the current literature, it is unclear whether the effectiveness of these strategies vary depending on individual characteristics. To address this research gap, we surveyed an economically diverse sample of 15,545 Americans about their subjective well-being, spending behavior, personal values and beliefs, as well as demographics including age, gender, and income. Across demographic groups, spending money on others was robustly related to happiness. Spending money on others was also associated with greater happiness regardless of whether participants believed that they would be happier spending money on others. In contrast, the relationship between buying time and happiness was somewhat less reliable. Although gender and personal income did not moderate the relationship between buying time and happiness, the relationship was only marginally significant for men, and non-significant within each income bracket. Our results also indicated that those who valued money over time were significantly happier when they used money to buy time, whereas those who valued time over money reported similar levels of happiness whether or not they bought time. Taken together, the present research shows that the relationship between prosocial spending, buying time, and subjective well-being is largely consistent across the different demographic groups we examined."
https://openalex.org/W4281707393,"Ethiopia has been responding to the COVID-19 pandemic through a combination of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, quarantine, testing, isolation, contact tracing, and clinical management. Estimating the resources consumed for COVID-19 prevention and control could inform efficient decision-making for epidemic/pandemic-prone diseases in the future. This study aims to estimate the unit cost of COVID-19 sample collection, laboratory diagnosis, and contact tracing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Primary and secondary data were collected to estimate the costs of COVID-19 sample collection, diagnosis, and contact tracing. A healthcare system perspective was used. We used a combination of micro-costing (bottom-up) and top-down approaches to estimate resources consumed and the unit costs of the interventions. We used available cost and outcome data between May and December 2020. The costs were classified into capital and recurrent inputs to estimate unit and total costs. We identified the cost drivers of the interventions. We reported the cost for the following outcome measures: (1) cost per sample collected, (2) cost per laboratory diagnosis, (3) cost per sample collected and laboratory diagnosis, (4) cost per contact traced, and (5) cost per COVID-19 positive test identified. We conducted one-way sensitivity analysis by varying the input parameters. All costs were reported in US dollars (USD).The unit cost per sample collected was USD 1.33. The unit cost of tracing a contact of an index case was USD 0.66. The unit cost of COVID-19 diagnosis, excluding the cost for sample collection was USD 3.91. The unit cost of sample collection per COVID-19 positive individual was USD 11.63. The unit cost for COVID-19 positive test through contact tracing was USD 54.00. The unit cost COVID-19 DNA PCR diagnosis for identifying COVID-19 positive individuals, excluding the sample collection and transport cost, was USD 37.70. The cost per COVID-19 positive case identified was USD 49.33 including both sample collection and laboratory diagnosis costs. Among the cost drivers, personnel cost (salary and food cost) takes the highest share for all interventions, ranging from 51-76% of the total cost.The costs of sample collection, diagnosis, and contact tracing for COVID-19 were high given the low per capita health expenditure in Ethiopia and other low-income settings. Since the personnel cost accounts for the highest cost, decision-makers should focus on minimizing this cost when faced with pandemic-prone diseases by strengthening the health system and using digital platforms. The findings of this study can help decision-makers prioritize and allocate resources for effective public health emergency response."
https://openalex.org/W4281810487,"The efficacy of salicylic acid paste (SA) in the treatment of ulcerative bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) was assessed by combining clinical and histopathological analyses with molecular biological techniques. The latter were conducted in a blinded manner to reach maximum objectivity. Prior to treatment, M2-stage BDD lesions (n = 26, diagnosed in 21 dairy cows) exhibited ulceration, with severe perivascular, chronic, lymphoplasmacytic dermatitis and extensive keratinolysis being noted in most cases. Pretreatment biopsy samples (n = 12) followed by povidone-iodine ointment under bandage for one week before administration of SA paste were tested positive for Treponema spp. by blinded PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Subsequent treatment consisted of application of SA and bandaging at weekly intervals until lesions had completely resolved. The treatment duration ranged between 2 and 4 weeks. Complete healing was achieved in 100% of cases, with 2/21 animals requiring a second round of treatment upon disease reoccurrence. Importantly, only 3/26 biopsies taken from previously affected sites still tested positive by Treponema PCR, and in another biopsy, the outermost layers of the stratum corneum scored weakly positive by Treponema-specific FISH. None of these Treponema DNA-positive biopsies showed signs of ulceration. One case exhibited focal keratinolysis. Positive PCR or FISH in these cases may have arisen from DNA traces of dead bacteria or environmental contamination during biopsy harvesting. To our knowledge, this is the first study on blinded molecular biological monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of SA with respect to treponemal infection, and on complete BDD M2-stage remission in all animals achieved by SA treatment according to an optimized protocol. Although the etiology of BDD is considered as multifactorial, our data further support the concept that treponemes have a decisive role in BDD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4285505478,"This study examined the mediating effect of moral obligation and moderating effect of social value orientation on the relationship between empathy and fairness behavior in Chinese teachers. Seven hundred and twenty-six Chinese teachers completed self-reported questionnaires regarding empathy, moral obligation, social value orientation, and fairness behavior. The results revealed that moral obligation mediated the link between empathy and teachers' fairness behavior. Teachers' social value orientation moderated the associations between empathy and moral obligation and moral obligation and fairness behavior. The associations between empathy and moral obligation and moral obligation and fairness behavior were more robust for those with high SVO scores (i.e., prosocial). This study identified the critical factors associated with teachers' fairness behavior, supplying empirical support for existing theories and providing practical implications for interventions designed to improve Chinese teachers' classroom environment."
https://openalex.org/W4285685046,"WHO recommends vaccination against HPV for girls before sexual debut. Uganda started HPV vaccination in 2008 as pilot programs in 2 districts, followed by national roll out in 2015. Despite the availability of vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) in Uganda in the period covered by the study, there was reported low HPV vaccine uptake and completion especially of the second dose in Uganda; with little information available on timely completion of HPV vaccine and the associated factors in Uganda. This study was therefore done to determine the HPV vaccine dose 2 completion and describe the possible factors associated with timely HPV vaccine completion and non-completion among girls of age 9-14 years attending the adolescent clinic at Mulago hospital.A retrospective mixed methods study was conducted in Mulago National Referral hospital adolescent clinic. Data were mainly collected through review of charts and folders for clinic attendance by eligible girls and focus group discussions with eligible girls that completed the 2 doses of HPV vaccine on recommended/scheduled time.Out of the 201 girls studied, 87 girls (43.3%) had timely completion of the HPV vaccination. Knowledge about HPV infection and HPV vaccine benefits, positive peer influence and healthcare worker recommendation to get vaccinated at health facility level positively influenced timely completion of HPV vaccine. Among barriers to completion of HPV vaccine identified were: inadequate information about HPV infection and HPV vaccine, concerns about HPV vaccine efficacy and safety, unclear communication with adolescents/caregivers from healthcare workers and -stock out of the HPV vaccine.Timely completion of the second dose of HPV vaccine among girls attending the adolescent clinic of Mulago hospital was low (at 43.3%) but higher when compared to earlier published reports. Interventions around improved social mobilization, enhanced outreach and static vaccination approach and education of eligible girls on HPV vaccination can help increase vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4281640812,"Biological invasions are considered the second major cause of plant, amphibian, reptile, and mammal loss worldwide. Like islands, freshwater ecosystems are especially susceptible to the negative impacts of invasions. The porthole livebearer ( Poeciliopsis gracilis ), recently identified as invasive in the Mexican Central Plateau, is increasing its populations and could impact freshwater ecosystems like its cousin species the guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ). Risk-taking behaviours, such as emergence latency, are recognised as key characteristics to invasion success and Poeciliid females can establish a viable population by themselves (due to their multiple paternity broods). We investigated the emergence latency and latency to locate food in simple and complex environments of porthole livebearers, including the effect of their size and sex. For both sexes, bigger fish emerge less times and take longer to do so, but females are faster to exit the refuge than males. We found no differences in porthole livebearer’s behaviour in complex or simple habitats, and no significant differences between sex, size or treatment in the time to locate food after exiting the refuge. Our results suggest that the benefit of faster emergence from the refuge in porthole livebearers in novel environments could be higher for females. We consider that porthole livebearer females being bolder could contribute to the invasion success of the species. Our study points at females and smaller fish as being the more likely to explore novel environments, which could contribute to understanding how the invasions by the porthole livebearer are driven."
https://openalex.org/W4281684188,"Two-sided mobility platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, widely emerged in the urban mobility landscape. Distributed supply of individual drivers, matched with travellers via intermediate platform yields a new class of phenomena not present in urban mobility before. Such disruptive changes to transportation systems call for a simulation framework where researchers from various and across disciplines may introduce models aimed at representing the complex dynamics of platform-driven urban mobility. In this work, we present MaaSSim, a lightweight agent-based simulator reproducing the transport system used by two kinds of agents: (i) travellers, requesting to travel from their origin to destination at a given time, and (ii) drivers supplying their travel needs by offering them rides. An intermediate agent, the platform, matches demand with supply. Agents are individual decision-makers. Specifically, travellers may decide which mode they use or reject an incoming offer; drivers may opt-out from the system or reject incoming requests. All of the above behaviours are modelled through user-defined modules, allowing to represent agents’ taste variations (heterogeneity), their previous experiences (learning) and available information (system control). MaaSSim is a flexible open-source python library capable of realistically reproducing complex interactions between agents of a two-sided mobility platform. MaaSSim is available from a public repository, along with a set of tutorials and reproducible use-case scenarios, as demonstrated with a series of illustrative examples and a comprehensive case study."
https://openalex.org/W4281709939,"Carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture and its sequelae are among the leading causes of acute ischemic stroke. The risk of rupture and subsequent thrombosis is, among others, determined by vulnerable plaque characteristics and linked to activation of the immune system, in which neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) potentially play a role. The aim of this study was to investigate how plaque vulnerability is associated with NETs levels. We included 182 patients from the Plaque At RISK (PARISK) study in whom carotid imaging was performed to measure plaque ulceration, fibrous cap integrity, intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, calcifications and plaque volume. Principal component analysis generated a ‘vulnerability index’ comprising all plaque characteristics. Levels of the NETs marker myeloperoxidase-DNA complex were measured in patient plasma. The association between the vulnerability index and low or high NETs levels (dependent variable) was assessed by logistic regression. No significant association between the vulnerability index and NETs levels was detected in the total population (odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.90–1.83, p = 0.18). However, in the subgroup of patients naive to statins or antithrombotic medication prior to the index event, this association was statistically significant (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.04–4.17, p = 0.04). Further analyses revealed that this positive association was mainly driven by intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core and ulceration. In conclusion, plaque vulnerability is positively associated with plasma levels of NETs, but only in patients naive to statins or antithrombotic medication prior to the index event."
https://openalex.org/W4281752148,"Anatomy Nights is an international public engagement event created to bring anatomy and anatomists back to public spaces with the goal of increasing the public’s understanding of their own anatomy by comparison with non-human tissues. The event consists of a 30-minute mini-lecture on the anatomy of a specific anatomical organ followed by a dissection of animal tissues to demonstrate the same organ anatomy. Before and after the lecture and dissection, participants complete research surveys designed to assess prior knowledge and knowledge gained as a result of participation in the event, respectively. This study reports the results of Anatomy Nights brain events held at four different venues in the UK and USA in 2018 and 2019. Two general questions were asked of the data: 1) Do participant post-event test scores differ from pre-event scores; and 2) Are there differences in participant scores based on location, educational background, and career. We addressed these questions using a combination of generalized linear models (R’s glm function; R version 4.1.0 [R Core Team, 2014]) that assumed a binomial distribution and implemented a logit link function, as well as likelihood estimates to compare models. Survey data from 91 participants indicate that scores improve on post-event tests compared to pre-event tests, and these results hold irrespective of location, educational background, and career. In the pre-event tests, participants performed well on naming structures with an English name (frontal lobe and brainstem), and showed signs of improvement on other anatomical names in the post-test. Despite this improvement in knowledge, we found no evidence that participation in Anatomy Nights improved participants’ ability to apply this knowledge to neuroanatomical contexts (e.g., stroke)."

This study formulates and optimizes Eszopiclone trilaminate fast dissolving film. Methods Prepared Eszopiclone trilaminate fast dissolving film (Eszopiclone TFDF) was characterized by disintegration time, drug release, tensile strength (TS), percentage elongation (EB%), folding endurance, taste masking test, and in vitro dissolution test. The selected formulas were F2 (0.5% xanthan gum, 10% propylene glycol), F4 (3% sodium alginate, 10% propylene glycol) and F6 (1.5% pullulan, 10% propylene glycol) were subjected to in vivo study compared to conventional Lunesta® tablet. Results The results indicated that disintegration time was in the range of 940 m. Drug release was found to be in the field of 78.51%–99.99%, while TS values and EB% differed from 11.12 to 25.74 (MPa) and 25.38%–36.43%, respectively. The folding endurance went between 200 and 300 times. All formulas exhibited acceptable uniformity content, surface pH , film thickness, and a good taste feeling. Conclusion F4 had the highest C max (39.741 ± 6.785-μg/l) and lower T max (1.063 hr) among other formulas and conventional tablets. Therefore, FDFs’ technology could increase the therapeutic effect of Eszopiclone."
https://openalex.org/W4282001285,"Recently, increasing attention has been paid to team processes in peripartum care settings with the aim to improve fetomaternal outcomes. However, we have yet to understand how the perception of teamwork in peripartum care is shaped in a complex, multi-disciplinary environment.The aim of this study was to approach the question using qualitative social-scientific methodology. The theoretical foundation of the study was that obstetric teamwork is the result of a balancing act in which multiple goal conflicts are continuously negotiated and managed right at the boundary of acceptable performance in a complex adaptive system. We explored this theory by gathering lived experiences of successful management of peripartum emergencies. Based on our analysis we generated an understanding of teamwork as a phenomenon emerging from interpersonal relationships, complex relations of power, and the enactment of current quality management practices.Caregivers define teamwork through the quality of their collaboration, defined by respect and appreciation, open communication, role distribution, and shared experiences. However, teamwork also becomes the framework for negotiation of many conflicts that originated elsewhere. Power was the core theme that emerged in the analysis of our participants' narratives, which is in stark contrast to the otherwise promoted egalitarian rhetoric of team training. While our participants generally reverted to explanations based on their professional identities, traditions or cultures, interesting dynamics become visible when work is viewed through the power lens.Our study paints the convoluted picture of a work environment with all its intricacies, constraints, interpersonal relations and hierarchical struggles that are much more representative of a complex system rather than the easily tractable environment that so many stakeholders would like healthcare practitioners to believe in. The issue of power emerged as a decisive factor in the social dynamics at the workplace, revealing hidden agendas in the teamwork discourse."
https://openalex.org/W4285411648,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis many have opinionated on how it may affect society’s response to climate change. Two key questions here are how COVID-19 is expected to influence climate action by citizens and by the government. We answer these by applying topic modelling to textual responses from a survey of Spanish citizens. The identified topics tend to be more negative than positive, and more optimistic concerning future climate action by citizens. Positive views involve increasing pro-environmental behavior and are more common among younger, higher educated and male respondents as well as among those who perceive climate change as a serious threat or positively assessed COVID-19 confinement. Negative topics express concern that financial resources for climate action will be limited due to a focus on healthcare and economic recovery. In addition, they mention government mismanagement and waste due to use of protective measures like masks and gloves as impediments to effective climate action."
https://openalex.org/W4285506288,"Kimberlites are the primary source of economic grade diamonds. Their geologically rapid eruptions preferentially occur near or through thick and ancient continental lithosphere. Studies combining tomographic models with tectonic reconstructions and kimberlite emplacement ages and locations have revealed spatial correlations between large low shear velocity provinces in the lowermost mantle and reconstructed global kimberlite eruption locations over the last 320 Myr. These spatial correlations assume that the lowermost mantle structure has not changed over time, which is at odds with mantle flow models that show basal thermochemical structures to be mobile features shaped by cold sinking oceanic lithosphere. Here we investigate the match to the global kimberlite record of stationary seismically slow basal mantle structures (as imaged through tomographic modelling) and mobile hot basal structures (as predicted by reconstructions of mantle flow over the past billion years). We refer to these structures as “basal mantle structures” and consider their intersection with reconstructed thick or ancient lithosphere to represent areas with a high potential for past eruptions of kimberlites, and therefore areas of potential interest for diamond exploration. We use the distance between reconstructed kimberlite eruption locations and kimberlite potential maps as an indicator of model success, and we find that mobile lowermost mantle structures are as close to reconstructed kimberlites as stationary ones. Additionally, we find that mobile lowermost mantle structures better fit major kimberlitic events, such as the South African kimberlite bloom around 100 Ma. Mobile basal structures are therefore consistent with both solid Earth dynamics and with the kimberlite record."

As such, there is a need for low burden, and easy to engage in interventions to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for these care partners. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) aimed at improving the HRQOL of care partners. Participants are randomized either to a control group, where they wear the Fitbit® and provide daily reports of HRQOL over a six-month (180 day) period (without the personalized feedback), or the JITAI group, where they wear the Fitbit®, provide daily reports of HRQOL and receive personalized self-management pushes for 6 months. 240 participants will be enrolled (n = 120 control group; n = 120 JITAI group). Outcomes are collected at baseline, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- & 6-months, as well as 3- and 6-months post intervention. We hypothesize that the care partners who receive the intervention (JITAI group) will show improvements in caregiver strain (primary outcome) and mental health (depression and anxiety) after the 6-month (180 day) home monitoring period. Participant recruitment for this study started in November 2020. Data collection efforts should be completed by spring 2025; results are expected by winter 2025. At the conclusion of this randomized control trial, we will be able to identify care partners at greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will have demonstrated the efficacy of this JITAI intervention to improve HRQOL for these care partners.

https://openalex.org/W4285613020,"Objective There is little consistency between commercial grade footwear brands for determining shoe sizing, and no universally accepted descriptors of common types or features of footwear. The primary aim of this research was to develop a footwear taxonomy about the agreed types of footwear commonly worn by children under the age of six. Secondary aims were to gain consensus of the common footwear features, when different types of footwear would be commonly worn, common terms for key footwear parts, and how movement at some of these footwear parts should be described. Materials and methods Opinions were collected through a three-round modified Delphi international online survey from parents, health professionals, researchers, and footwear industry professionals. The first survey displayed generic pictures about different footwear types and asked participants to provide a grouping term, when the footwear would be worn (for what type of activity) and any grouping features. The second and third rounds presented consensus and gathered agreement on statements. Results There were 121 participants who provided detailed feedback to open-ended questions. The final round resulted in consensus and agreement on the names of 14 different footwear types, when they are commonly worn and their common features. Participants also reached consensus and agreement on the terms heel counter to describe the back part of footwear and fixtures as the collective term for features allowing footwear adjustability and fastening. They also agreed on terms to quantify the flexibility at footwear sole (bend or twist) or the heel counter. Conclusion This first taxonomy of children’s footwear represents consensus amongst different stakeholders and is an important step in promoting consistency within footwear research. One shoe does not fit all purposes, and the recommendations from this work help to inform the next steps towards ensuring greater transparency and commonality with footwear recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W4285613512,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the most common cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia. The SA14-14-2 JE vaccine manufactured by Chengdu Institute of Biological Products has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials and childhood routine immunization programs. However, there are few published reports describing results of surveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) when the vaccine is used in mass campaigns. We describe the results of AEFI surveillance following a 2013 vaccination campaign among almost 310,000 children aged 9 months-12 years in Battambang Province, Cambodia.Routine AEFI surveillance was strengthened by staff training and supplemented by active hospital surveillance. An AEFI was defined as any sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated (i.e., within 4 weeks) with receipt of the vaccine, irrespective of whether it was considered related to immunization. Data were collected on standardized forms and causality assessments were conducted for serious AEFI.Passive and active surveillance detected 28 AEFI for an overall incidence of 9.0 AEFI per 100,000 doses administered. The most frequent events were vasovagal episodes (n = 7, 25%) and rash (n = 6, 21%), and most other events were common childhood conditions such as fever and vomiting. Three AEFI were classified as serious, including one hypersensitivity reaction and two meningoencephalitis cases. Of these, the hypersensitivity event was the only serious AEFI classified as being consistent with a causal association to immunization.Most reported adverse events were conditions that commonly occur after other childhood vaccinations or independently of vaccination, and in the context of careful monitoring for serious AEFI only one serious event consistent with a causal association with immunization was identified. These results support the good safety profile of the SA14-14-2 JE vaccine, and provide reassuring data as the vaccine's use expands."
https://openalex.org/W4285613751,"Bacterial canker of the kiwifruit caused by the etiological agent Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae is the most severe disease in kiwifruit production. Since 2008 a hypervirulent Psa biovar 3 has spread rapidly worldwide. Different genomic and phenotypic approaches have been used to understand the origin of the dissemination and geographical evolution of populations associated with this pandemic. This study aimed to characterize the genetic and phenotypic diversity of 22 Psa isolates collected in different regions of Portugal between 2013 and 2017. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization was based on Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA), motility, IAA production, Biolog GEN III, and copper sensitivity. No polymorphisms were detected for the concatenated sequence (1950 bp) of the housekeeping genes gltA, gapA, gyrB, and rpoD. Results support the analysed Portuguese Psa isolates (2013-2017) belonging to Psa3, and MLSA indicates high genetic clonality and stability of these populations. The phenotypic analysis through Biolog revealed a heterogeneous pattern in the Psa collection and its position in the Pseudomonas complex. This heterogeneity reflects a genomic diversity that may reflect distinct adaptive trends associated with the environmental conditions and widespread. The Portuguese Psa collection showed no resistance to copper. This information is relevant to kiwi producers that predominantly use Cu-treatments to control kiwifruit bacterial canker."
https://openalex.org/W4285614094,"Introduction Using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy, previous Mendelian randomization (MR) studies found total causal effects of general obesity on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Hitherto, total and direct causal effects of general- and central obesity on PCOS have not been comprehensively analyzed. Objectives To investigate the causality of central- and general obesity on PCOS using surrogate anthropometric markers. Methods Summary GWAS data of female-only, large-sample cohorts of European ancestry were retrieved for anthropometric markers of central obesity (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) and general obesity (BMI and its constituent variables–weight and height), from the IEU Open GWAS Project. As the outcome, we acquired summary data from a large-sample GWAS (118870 samples; 642 cases and 118228 controls) within the FinnGen cohort. Total causal effects were assessed via univariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR). Genetic architectures underlying causal associations were explored. Direct causal effects were analyzed by multivariable MR modelling. Results Instrumental variables demonstrated no weak instrument bias (F &gt; 10). Four anthropometric exposures, namely, weight (2.69–77.05), BMI (OR: 2.90–4.06), WC (OR: 6.22–20.27), and HC (OR: 6.22–20.27) demonstrated total causal effects as per univariable 2SMR models. We uncovered shared and non-shared genetic architectures underlying causal associations. Direct causal effects of WC and HC on PCOS were revealed by two multivariable MR models containing exclusively the anthropometric markers of central obesity. Other multivariable MR models containing anthropometric markers of both central- and general obesity showed no direct causal effects on PCOS. Conclusions Both and general- and central obesity yield total causal effects on PCOS. Findings also indicated potential direct causal effects of normal weight-central obesity and more complex causal mechanisms when both central- and general obesity are present. Results underscore the importance of addressing both central- and general obesity for optimizing PCOS care."
https://openalex.org/W4281846511,"The quality of tuberculosis laboratory services in health facilities is a mandatory component of detecting active pulmonary TB cases and treatment follow-up. However, ensuring the quality of laboratory test results is a concern. This study aimed to assess the quality assurance practices in the tuberculosis diagnostic health facilities of Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2018 to March 2019 at nine governmental TB-culture laboratories and 34 randomly selected GeneXpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert® MTB/RIF) testing health facilities in Ethiopia. Participating health facilities were interviewed and laboratory documents and records present since 2017 were observed. Prior to the data collection, training was given to the data collectors. Descriptive statistics were used to produce results and were presented with tables and graphs.From a total of 34 Xpert® MTB/RIF testing laboratories, 50% run Internal Quality Control (IQC) for Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Microscopy and 67.6% had lot-to-lot verification of staining reagents. For the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay, a lot-to-lot verification of cartridge and method validation was performed only in 8.8%and 20.6% of Xpert® MTB/RIF testing laboratories respectively. All TB-culture laboratories included in the study ran negative control (start and end IQC) during TB-culture sample processing and performed lot-to-lot verification for Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) in 88.9% of TB-culture laboratories. External Quality Assessment (EQA) Proficiency Testing (PT) for AFB microscopy is practiced in 79.4% Xpert® MTB/RIF testing laboratories and 100.0% for the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay. TB-Culture PT participation practice among TB-culture laboratories was 88.9%. A major challenge for health facilities during PT participation was the AFB PT-sample transportation delay (40.7%) and the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay EQA-PT feedback missing (38.2%).This assessment reveals that IQC for AFB microscopy, lot-to-lot verification, method validation, and equipment calibration were not well-practiced. The majority of TB diagnostic health facility laboratories had EQA-PT participation practice, but a significant gap in PT-sample transportation and missing feedback was identified."
https://openalex.org/W4281897236,"One of the most precise methods to detect prostate cancer is by evaluation of a stained biopsy by a pathologist under a microscope. Regions of the tissue are assessed and graded according to the observed histological pattern. However, this is not only laborious, but also relies on the experience of the pathologist and tends to suffer from the lack of reproducibility of biopsy outcomes across pathologists. As a result, computational approaches are being sought and machine learning has been gaining momentum in the prediction of the Gleason grade group. To date, machine learning literature has addressed this problem by using features from magnetic resonance imaging images, whole slide images, tissue microarrays, gene expression data, and clinical features. However, there is a gap with regards to predicting the Gleason grade group using DNA sequences as the only input source to the machine learning models. In this work, using whole genome sequence data from South African prostate cancer patients, an application of machine learning and biological experiments were combined to understand the challenges that are associated with the prediction of the Gleason grade group. A series of machine learning binary classifiers (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, LR, RF) were created only relying on DNA sequences input features. All the models were not able to adequately discriminate between the DNA sequences of the studied Gleason grade groups (Gleason grade group 1 and 5). However, the models were further evaluated in the prediction of tumor DNA sequences from matched-normal DNA sequences, given DNA sequences as the only input source. In this new problem, the models performed acceptably better than before with the XGBoost model achieving the highest accuracy of 74 ± 01, F1 score of 79 ± 01, recall of 99 ± 0.0, and precision of 66 ± 0.1."
https://openalex.org/W4285611742,"The study was undertaken in Gedeo zone with the aim to identify traditional sheep breeding practices. Three potential districts (Yirgachefe, Bule and Gedeb) were purposely selected from Gedeo zone. A total of 180 smallholder sheep farmers were selected at random to complete a structured questionnaire that had been pretested. A pairwise ranking tool was used to prioritize ranked data during focus group discussion. Descriptive statistics were generated using SPSS version 26, while indices were computed for the ranked data. Mating happens because most farmers in Gedeo zone (80%) own breeding rams that are mixed and run with ewe flocks. Fifty-two percent of farmers were certain that their breeding rams mate with neighboring ewes. Nearly 70% of farmers prevented unwanted sheep breeding in their flocks by castrating or isolating undesirable rams from the ewe flock. Undesired or old breeding rams were replaced either from the same flock (58.9%) or purchased from local markets (41.1%). Breeding flock selection was common in Gedeo zone, with 97.2% of farmers selecting breeding rams and 93.3% of farmers selecting breeding ewes. Genotype (Index = 0.26) and body conformation (Index = 0.20) were the primary and secondary criteria used to select breeding ewes. Likewise, confirmation (Index = 0.25), genotype (Index = 0.24) and lamb growth rate (Index = 0.19) were the top three criteria when selecting breeding rams. Approximately three-quarters of interviewed farmers culled sheep due to poor body condition (31.8%), old age (28.6%), sickness (22.7%) and sterility (15.6%). Castration of rams was more common in Gedeb (58.3%) and Yirgachefe (55%) districts, and it was done for fattening, controlling unwanted breeding, and improving temperament. The mean selection and castration age of breeding rams were 13.18 and 30.72 months. In general, sheep breeding strategies for Gedeo zone should take into account section preferences and basic traditional sheep breeding practices."

Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for one-third of all wasted children globally, and Ethiopia is among the countries with the highest magnitude of Wasting in the region. Despite, the little decrement in the prevalence of other forms of malnutrition (stunting and underweight), the burden of wasting remains the same in the country. Gedeo zone is among those with a high prevalence of under-five wasting.To identify determinants of wasting among children aged 6-59 months in Wonago Woreda, 2018.A facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from May 11 to July 21/2018. A total of 356 (119 cases and 237 controls) mothers/caregivers of under-five children who visited the Wonago woreda public health facilities were included in the study using systematic random sampling. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and anthropometric measurement. Descriptive analysis was used to describe data. Binary logistic regression was used to identify determinants of wasting among children aged 6-59 months. Variables with p-value < 0.25 in bi-variate analysis entered to multivariate analysis. Those variables with a p-value less than 0.05 during the multivariate regression were considered significant.Determinants which found to have an association with wasting in this study were; maternal illiteracy [AOR = 2.48, 95% CI (1.11, 5.53)] family size <3 [AOR = 0.16, 95% CI (0.05, 0.50)] wealth index [AOR = 2.41, 95% CI (1.07, 5.46)] exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.15, 6.40)] dietary diversity [AOR = 5.52, 95% CI (2.06, 14.76)] and children been sick in the last 2 weeks [AOR = 4.36, 95% CI (2.21, 8.61)].Determinants identified were maternal education, family size, wealth index, and exclusive breastfeeding, dietary diversity, and morbidity history of a child in the last 2 weeks. To reduce childhood wasting, due emphasis should be given to empowering women and improving the knowledge and practice of parents on appropriate infant and young child-caring practices."

We investigated fecal microbiota in CLD and CLD-associated IBD. We also tested whether microbiota is modulated by supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Subjects and methods We recruited 30 patients with CLD for an observational 3-week follow-up study. Thereafter, 16 consented to oral butyrate substitution for a 3-week observational period. Fecal samples, collected once a week, were assayed for calprotectin and potential markers of inflammation, and studied by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing and compared to that of 19 healthy controls and 43 controls with Crohn’s disease. Data on intestinal symptoms, diet and quality of life were collected. Results Patients with CLD had increased abundances of Proteobacteria, Veillonella , and Prevotella , and lower abundances of normally dominant taxa Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae when compared with healthy controls and Crohn´s disease. No major differences in fecal microbiota were found between CLD and CLD-associated IBD (including two with yet untreated IBD). Butyrate was poorly tolerated and showed no major effects on fecal microbiota or biomarkers in CLD. Conclusions Fecal microbiota in CLD is different from that of healthy subjects or Crohn´s disease. Unexpectedly, no changes in the microbiota or fecal markers characterized CLD-associated IBD, an entity with high frequency among patients with CLD."
https://openalex.org/W4281610473,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) exist in at least two distinct states in mammals: naïve pluripotency that represents several molecular characteristics in pre-implantation epiblast and primed pluripotency that corresponds to cells poised for differentiation in post-implantation epiblast. To identify and characterize the surface molecules that are necessary for the maintenance of naïve hPSCs, we generated a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to the naïve state of hPSCs. Flow cytometry showed that N1-A4, one of the MAbs, bound to naïve hPSCs but not to primed hPSCs. Cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation analysis identified that N1-A4 recognized heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) expressed on the surface of naïve hPSCs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that HSP60 expression was rapidly downregulated during the embryoid body (EB) differentiation of primed hPSCs. HSP60 knockdown led to a decrease in the expression of pluripotency genes in primed hPSCs. HSP60 depletion also led to a decrease in the expression of pluripotency genes and representative naïve-state-specific genes in naïve hPSCs. Taken together, the results suggest that HSP60 is downregulated during differentiation of hPSCs and is required for the maintenance of pluripotency genes in both primed and naïve hPSCs, suggesting that HSP60 is a regulator of hPSC pluripotency and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W4281642094,"Background Child and family social workers in the UK work closely with other agencies including schools and the police, and typically they are based in local authority offices. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of placing social workers in schools (SWIS) on the need for social care interventions. SWIS was piloted in three local authorities in 2018–2020, and findings from a feasibility study of the pilots suggests SWIS may operate through three key pathways: (1) by enhancing schools’ response to safeguarding issues, (2) through increased collaboration between social workers, school staff, and parents, and (3) by improving relationships between social workers and young people. Methods The study is a two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial building on three feasibility studies which found SWIS to be promising. Social workers will work within secondary schools across local authorities in England. 280 mainstream secondary schools will be randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio to SWIS or a comparison arm, which will be schools that continue as normal, without a social worker. The primary outcome will be the rate of Child Protection (Section 47) enquiries. Secondary outcomes will comprise rate of referrals to children’s social care, rate of Child in Need (Section 17) assessments, days spent in care, and educational attendance and attainment. The study also includes an economic evaluation, and an implementation and process evaluation. Social care outcomes will be measured in July 2022, and educational outcomes will be measured in July 2023. Days in care will be measured at both time points. Discussion Findings will explore the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SWIS on the need for social care interventions. A final report will be published in January 2024.

https://openalex.org/W4281658962,"The ability to track teammates and opponents is an essential quality to achieve a high level of performance in soccer. The visual tracking ability is usually assessed in the laboratory with non-sport specific scenarios, leading in two major concerns. First, the methods used probably only partially reflects the actual ability to track players on the field. Second, it is unclear whether the situational features manipulated to stimulate visual tracking ability match those that make it difficult to track real players. In this study, participants had to track multiple players on a virtual soccer field. The virtual players moved according to either real or pseudo-random trajectories. The experiment was conducted online using a web application. Regarding the first concern, the visual tracking performance of players in soccer, other team sports, and non-team sports was compared to see if differences between groups varied with the use of soccer-specific or pseudo-random movements. Contrary to our assumption, the ANOVA did not reveal a greater tracking performance difference between soccer players and the two other groups when facing stimuli featuring movements from actual soccer games compared to stimuli featuring pseudo-random ones. Directing virtual players with real-world trajectories did not appear to be sufficient to allow soccer players to use soccer-specific knowledge in their visual tracking activity. Regarding the second concern, an original exploratory analysis based on Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components was conducted to compare the situational features associated with hard-to-track virtual players in soccer-specific or pseudo-random movements. It revealed differences in the situational feature sets associated with hard-to-track players based on movement type. Essentially with soccer-specific movements, how the virtual players were distributed in space appeared to have a significant influence on visual tracking performance. These results highlight the need to consider real-world scenarios to understand what makes tracking multiple players difficult."

Through an age-and gender-matched case-control study, 577 people with insomnia (cases) and 577 people without insomnia (controls) were tested for anti- T . gondii IgG and IgM antibodies using commercially available enzyme-immunoassays. Anti- T . gondii IgG antibodies were found in 71 (12.3%) of 577 individuals with insomnia and in 46 (8.0%) of 577 controls (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09–2.39; P = 0.01). Men with insomnia had a higher (16/73: 21.9%) seroprevalence of T . gondii infection than men without insomnia (5/73: 6.8%) (OR: 3.81; 95% CI: 1.31–11.06; P = 0.009).

Further research to confirm the association between seropositivity and serointensity to T . gondii and insomnia is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4281683121,"Gene activity is controlled by multiple molecular mechanisms, for instance through transcription factors or by microRNAs (miRNAs), among others. Established bioinformatics tools for the prediction of miRNA target genes face the challenge of ensuring accuracy, due to high false positive rates. Further, these tools present poor overlap. However, we demonstrated that it is possible to filter good predictions of miRNA targets from the bulk of all predictions by using information from the gene regulatory network. Here, we take advantage of this strategy that selects a large subset of predicted microRNA binding sites as more likely to possess less false-positives because of their over-representation in RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST)-regulated genes from the background of TargetScanHuman 7.2 predictions to identify useful features for the prediction of microRNA targets. These enriched miRNA families would have silencing activity for neural transcripts overlapping the repressive activity on neural genes of REST. We analyze properties of associated microRNA binding sites and contrast the outcome to the background. We found that the selected subset presents significant differences respect to the background: (i) lower GC-content in the vicinity of the predicted miRNA binding site, (ii) more target genes with multiple identical microRNA binding sites and (iii) a higher density of predicted microRNA binding sites close to the 3' terminal end of the 3'-UTR. These results suggest that network selection of miRNA-mRNA pairs could provide useful features to improve microRNA target prediction."

There is a gap in research regarding the attitudes and practices of doctors towards discussing patient occupation and return to work. The aim of this work was to explore the attitudes of ophthalmology doctors towards work as a clinical outcome and assess the need for occupational health training among participants (doctors).A cross-sectional survey among doctors working in ophthalmology in two London teaching hospitals. The survey focused on the attitudes of doctors towards 'work' as a clinical outcome, their practices of asking patients about occupation, their perceived level of competency in this area of clinical practice and the level of training doctors had received in this field. Descriptive data analysis was undertaken and results presented as frequencies and proportions.The response rate was 30/72 (42%). Approximately a quarter (8/30;27%) of doctors 'always' discussed return to work during care planning whilst the majority (25/30;87%) of doctors agreed or strongly agreed that this should always be the case. Over half of the doctors had received no formal OH training on how to discuss or assess the impact of health on work and only 17/30 (57%) considered themselves competent in discussing these work outcomes with patients. Over half agreed that additional training would be useful, with the majority believing that it would be most useful at all stages of medical training.We found the majority of ophthalmology doctors regard 'return to work' as an important clinical outcome yet most do not routinely discuss work outcomes with patients to inform care planning. Majority of doctors lack training in how to discuss issues relating to work and would benefit from additional OH training."

Outcomes of the SF-36 were evaluated, exploring the relationship between physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, alcohol/tobacco use, age, BMI) and clinical data (AIDS progression, treatment duration, CD4+ cell count and viral load, years since HIV diagnosis) with HRQoL using regression analysis. Statistical significance was set with a two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05. Results We enrolled 427 women (175 HIV-infected) with mean age of 54±8 years. From the SF-36 individual domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional health, and emotional wellbeing were significantly lower for HIV-infected women. Summary component scores were lower for the HIV-subset for both physical (45.8 vs 47.3) and mental (45.1 vs 45.8) components, although they did not achieve statistical significance. Regression analysis of the HIV-infected women revealed that the physical component score was significantly associated with physical activity, ethnicity, and chronic comorbidities while the mental component was significantly associated with physical activity, employment, and CD4+ cell count. Conclusion In our study, HIV-infected women scored lower in both physical and mental component scores. Important determinants for each component included CD4+ cell count as an assessment of HIV severity for the mental component, and ethnicity, reflecting socio-cultural factors, for the physical component. These results reveal the importance of a holistic approach to addressing HRQoL in this population. Better understanding of these factors will help shape future policies and interventions to improve HRQoL of women aging with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W4281783964,"Social power undermines focus on others and increases reliance on stereotype-consistent information. Thus, power may enhance focus on stereotypical cues to deception, thereby decreasing lie detection accuracy. In three studies, we tested whether having power affects lie detection accuracy. Participants (overall N = 502) were asked to identify truthful and lying candidates (N = 12) during mock job interviews. Study 1 was a field experiment involving employees who held managerial and non-managerial positions (N = 88). In the following laboratory experiments, we manipulated power and asked participants to imagine themselves as managers (Study 2, N = 214) or provided them with control over resources and the ability to reward others (Study 3, N = 200). In Studies 2 and 3, we additionally manipulated the method of lie detection (direct vs. indirect). In contrast to the original hypotheses, we found that power led to increased veracity assessment accuracy. Having power over others enhances the accuracy of one's veracity assessment, although this increase is small and limited to lie detection (Study 1) or direct judgments (Studies 2 & 3). Together, power affects the processing of social information and what aspects of this information are taken into account."

The main component is Mallotus repandus (Willd.) Müll. Arg.; however, Anamirta cocculus (L.) Wight &amp; Arn and Croton caudatus Gleiseler share the same common name: “Kho-Khlan”. Confused usage of A . cocculus or C . caudatus can have effects via toxicity or unsuccessful treatment. This study aimed to combine a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique and DNA barcoding coupled with high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) to differentiate M . repandus from the other two species. The M . repandus extract exhibited a distinct HPTLC profile that could be used to differentiate it from the others. DNA barcodes of the rbc L, mat K, ITS and psb A- trn H intergenic spacer regions of all the plants were established to assist HPTLC analysis. The rbc L region was selected for Bar-HRM analysis. PCR amplification was performed to obtain 102 bp amplicons encompassing nine polymorphic nucleotides. The amplicons were subjected to HRM analysis to obtain melting curve profiles. The melting temperatures (T m ) of authentic A . cocculus (A), C . caudatus (C) and M . repandus (M) were separated at 82.03±0.09°C, 80.93±0.04°C and 80.05±0.07°C, respectively. The protocol was applied to test crude drugs (CD1-6). The HPTLC profiles of CD2-6 showed distinct bands of M . repandus , while CD1 showed unclear band results. The Bar-HRM method was applied to assist the HPTLC and indicated that CD1 was C . caudatus . While ambiguous melting curves from the laboratory-made formulae were obtained, HPTLC analysis helped reveal distinct patterns for the identification of the plant species. The combination of HPTLC and Bar-HRM analysis could be a tool for confirming the identities of plant species sharing the same name, especially for those whose sources are multiple and difficult to identify by either chemical or DNA techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4281867364,"The fast development of technologies in today’s world is accompanied by the mushrooming of digital platforms constituting the core of the ecosystem of sharing economy. This multifaceted phenomenon and its ever-increasing presence have become a subject of public interest and debate, as well as encouraging research and scientific discourse. The article presents the results of the first study of Poles’ participation in sharing economy derived from a questionnaire survey of a representative sample (n = 1000). The purpose of the study was to characterise Poles participating in the digital economy and to determine how they differ in the use of sharing platforms depending on their age group and generation. The analysis has shown that the rates of Poles participating in the digital economy are the smaller, the older the age group, and that a rising number of the users of digital economy solutions translates into greater acceptance of sharing platforms. Among the oldest Poles, 70% do not participate in the digital economy and as much as 80% in the sharing economy. The numbers sharply contrast with generations Z and Y that participate in the sharing economy almost without exception. The most popular of sharing services turned out to be accommodation reservation indicated by every third respondent."

While initial reporting focused mainly on lung involvement, the ongoing pandemic showed that multiple organs can be involved, and prognosis is largely influenced by multi-organ involvement. Our aim was to obtain nationwide retrospective population-based data on hospitalizations with COVID-19 and AKI in Germany.We performed a query of G-DRG data for the year 2020 via the Institute for the hospital remuneration system (Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus GmbH, InEK) data portal and therefore included hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of RT-PCR proven COVID-19 infection, aged over 15 years. We included hospitalizations with acute kidney injury (AKI) stages 1 to 3. Age-specific and age-standardized hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates (ASR) per 100.000 person years were calculated, with the German population of 2011 as the standard.In 2020, there were 16.776.845 hospitalizations in German hospitals. We detected 154.170 hospitalizations with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 diagnosis. The age-standardized hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in Germany was 232,8 per 100.000 person years (95% CI 231,6-233,9). The highest proportion of hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 were in the age group over 80 years. AKI was diagnosed in 16.773 (10.9%) of the hospitalizations with COVID-19. The relative risk of AKI for males was 1,49 (95%CI 1,44-1,53) compared to females. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was performed in 3.443 hospitalizations, 20.5% of the hospitalizations with AKI. For all hospitalizations with COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality amounted to 19.7% (n = 30.300). The relative risk for in-hospital mortality was 3,87 (95%CI 3,80-3,94) when AKI occurred. The age-standardized hospitalization rates for COVID-19 took a bimodal course during the observation period. The first peak occurred in April (ASR 23,95 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 23,58-24,33)), hospitalizations peaked again in November 2020 (72,82 per 100.000 person years (95%CI 72,17-73,48)). The standardized rate ratios (SRR) for AKI and AKI-related mortality with the overall ASR for COVID-19 hospitalizations in the denominator, decreased throughout the observation period and remained lower in autumn than they were in spring. In contrast to all COVID-19 hospitalizations, the SRR for overall mortality in COVID-19 hospitalizations diverged from hospitalizations with AKI in autumn 2020.Our study for the first time provides nationwide data on COVID-19 related hospitalizations and acute kidney injury in Germany in 2020. AKI was a relevant complication and associated with high mortality. We observed a less pronounced increase in the ASR for AKI-related mortality during autumn 2020. The proportion of AKI-related mortality in comparison to the overall mortality decreased throughout the course of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4285414431,"The association between COVID-19 symptoms and antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 is poorly characterized. We analyzed antibody levels in individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify potential antibody-symptom associations. Convalescent plasma from 216 SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ individuals with symptomatology information were tested for the presence of IgG to the spike S1 subunit (Euroimmun ELISA), IgG to receptor binding domain (RBD, CoronaCHEK rapid test), and for IgG, IgA, and IgM to nucleocapsid (N, Bio-Rad ELISA). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of having a COVID-19 symptom from the antibody response, adjusting for sex and age. Cough strongly associated with antibodies against S1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.33; 95% CI from 1.51 to 18.86) and RBD (aOR = 4.36; CI 1.49, 12.78). In contrast, sore throat significantly associated with the absence of antibodies to S1 and N (aOR = 0.25; CI 0.08, 0.80 and aOR = 0.31; 0.11, 0.91). Similarly, lack of symptoms associated with the absence of antibodies to N and RBD (aOR = 0.16; CI 0.03, 0.97 and aOR = 0.16; CI 0.03, 1.01). Cough appeared to be correlated with a seropositive result, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibiting lower respiratory symptoms generate a robust antibody response. Conversely, those without symptoms or limited to a sore throat while infected with SARS-CoV-2 were likely to lack a detectable antibody response. These findings strongly support the notion that severity of infection correlates with robust antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W4285504912,"Hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1) is expressed throughout the nervous system and is critical for regulating neuronal excitability, with mutations being associated with multiple forms of epilepsy. Adaptive modulation of HCN1 has been observed, as has pathogenic dysregulation. While the mechanisms underlying this modulation remain incompletely understood, regulation of HCN1 has been shown to include phosphorylation. A candidate phosphorylation-dependent regulator of HCN1 channels is 14-3-3. We used bioinformatics to identify three potential 14-3-3 binding sites in HCN1. We confirmed that 14-3-3 could pull down HCN1 from multiple tissue sources and used HEK293 cells to detail the interaction. Two sites in the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of HCN1 were necessary and sufficient for a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3. The same region of HCN1 containing the 14-3-3 binding peptides is required for phosphorylation-independent protein degradation. We propose a model in which phosphorylation of mouse S810 and S867 (human S789 and S846) recruits 14-3-3 to inhibit a yet unidentified factor signaling for protein degradation, thus increasing the half-life of HCN1."
https://openalex.org/W4285505053,"Background Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne parasitic diseases of public health importance that is prevalent in the West Bank but not in the Gaza Strip. The disease caused by parasitic protozoans from the genus Leishmania and it is transmitted by infected phlebotomine sand flies. The aim of our study is to investigate the eco-epidemiological parameters and spatiotemporal projections of CL in Palestine over a 30-years period from 1990 through 2020 and to explore future projections until 2060. Methodology/Principal findings This long-term descriptive epidemiological study includes investigation of demographic characteristics of reported patients by the Palestinian Ministry of Health (PMoH). Moreover, we explored spatiotemporal distribution of CL including future projection based on climate change scenarios. The number of CL patients reported during this period was 5855 cases, and the average annual incidence rate (AAIR) was 18.5 cases/10 5 population. The male to female ratio was 1.25:1. Patients-age ranged from 2 months to 89 years (mean = 22.5, std 18.67, and the median was 18 years). More than 65% of the cases came from three governates in the West Bank; Jenin 29% (1617 cases), Jericho 25% (1403), and Tubas 12% (658) with no cases reported in the Gaza Strip. Seasonal occurrence of CL starts to increase in December and peaked during March and April of the following year. Current distribution of CL indicate that Jericho, Tubas, Jenin and Nablus have the most suitable climatic settings for the sandfly vectors. Future projections until 2060 suggest an increasing incidence from northwest of Jenin down to the southwest of Ramallah, disappearance of the foci in Jericho and Tubas throughout the Jordan Vally, and possible emergence of new foci in Gaza Strip. Conclusions/Significance The future projection of CL in Palestine until 2060 show a tendency of increasing incidence in the north western parts of the West Bank, disappearance from Jericho and Tubas throughout the Jordan Vally, and emergence of new CL endemic foci in the Gaza Strip. These results should be considered to implement effective control and surveillance systems to counteract spatial expansion of CL vectors."
https://openalex.org/W4285612055,"Occupational stress is a psychosocial risk in the workplace. Working conditions in industrial settings may lead to occupational stress. In Benin, however, there is little epidemiological data on occupational stress in industrial settings. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with occupational stress in industrial settings in Benin in 2019.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted from January 31 to April 11, 2019, among 15 cotton ginning plants. Sampling was exhaustive for permanent workers and stratified in clusters by shift for occasional cotton gin workers. Data were collected through Karasek and Siegrist questionnaires. Data analysis was performed using R software. Binary multivariable logistic regression was performed. The significance level was p < 0.05.Of 1883 workers included, 90.8% were male. The median age was 38 years (IQR: 28 years to 49 years). The prevalence of occupational stress was 77.7% (95% CI: 75.8-79.6). Psychological demand was high in 93.0% of workers and 83.9% had low decision latitude. Among the workers, 16.3% had low social support and 89.9% had a low recognition score at work. Factors associated with occupational stress were: being an occasional vs. permanent worker (aOR 6.43, 95% CI 4.18 to 9.88); age less than 38 years (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76); high intensity physical activity at work (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.73); working in production vs. administration (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.45); spending fewer than 4 years at the current work location (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.44); and scoring low for recognition at work (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.23). Noise exposure and being a shift worker were significant in univariable analysis, but not multivariable analysis.Occupational stress is very common among workers in industrial settings. The implementation and evaluation of preventive measures against these risk factors is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4285744342,"Introduction Effective communication in specialist consultations is difficult for some patients. These patients could benefit from support from a coach who accompanies them to and during medical specialist consultations to improve communication in the consultation room. This study aims to investigate patients’ perspective on interest in support from a patient coach, what kind of support they would like to receive and what characterizes an ideal patient coach. Methods We applied a mixed method design to obtain a realistic understanding of patients’ perspectives on a patient coach. Patients in the waiting rooms of outpatient clinics were asked to fill out a short questionnaire which included questions about demographic characteristics, perceived efficacy in patient-provider interaction and patients’ interest in support from a patient coach. Subsequently, patients interested in a patient coach were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview. The quantitative data were examined using univariate analysis and the qualitative interview data were analysed using content analysis. Results The survey was completed by 154 patients and eight of them were interviewed. Perceived efficacy in patient-physician interactions was the only variable that showed a significant difference between patients with and without an interest in support from a patient coach. The interviews revealed that a bad communication experience was the main reason for having an interest in support from a patient coach. Before the consultation, a patient coach should take the time to get to know the patient, build trust, and help the patient create an agenda, so take the patient seriously and recognize the patient as a whole person. During the consultation, a patient coach should support the patient by intervening and mediating when necessary to elicit the patient’s agenda. After the consultation, a patient coach should be able to explain and discuss medical information and treatment consequences. An ideal patient coach should have medical knowledge, a strong personality and good communication skills. Conclusion Especially patients who had a bad communication experience in a specialist consultation would like support from a patient coach. The kind of support they valued most was intervening and mediating during the consultation. To build the necessary trust, patient coaches should take time to get to know the patient and take the patient seriously. Medical knowledge, good communication skills and a strong personality were considered prerequisites for patient coaches to be capable to intervene in specialist consultations."
