https://openalex.org/W2050252451,"The obesity epidemic shows no signs of abating. There is an urgent need to push back against the environmental forces that are producing gradual weight gain in the population. Using data from national surveys, we estimate that affecting energy balance by 100 kilocalories per day (by a combination of reductions in energy intake and increases in physical activity) could prevent weight gain in most of the population. This can be achieved by small changes in behavior, such as 15 minutes per day of walking or eating a few less bites at each meal. Having a specific behavioral target for the prevention of weight gain may be key to arresting the obesity epidemic."

This effect of nitric oxide was dependent on guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and was mediated by the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the mitochondrial biogenesis induced by exposure to cold was markedly reduced in brown adipose tissue of endothelial nitric oxide synthase null-mutant (eNOS-/-) mice, which had a reduced metabolic rate and accelerated weight gain as compared to wild-type mice. Thus, a nitric oxide-cGMP-dependent pathway controls mitochondrial biogenesis and body energy balance."

This observation suggests that the Au 20 cluster should be highly stable and chemically inert. Using relativistic density functional calculations, we found that Au 20 possesses a tetrahedral structure, which is a fragment of the face-centered cubic lattice of bulk gold with a small structural relaxation. Au 20 is thus a unique molecule with atomic packing similar to that of bulk gold but with very different properties."

The yield gains are much higher than what has been reported for other countries where genetically modified crops were used mostly to replace and enhance chemical pest control. In many developing countries, small-scale farmers especially suffer big pest-related yield losses because of technical and economic constraints. Pest-resistant genetically modified crops can contribute to increased yields and agricultural growth in those situations, as the case of Bt cotton in India demonstrates."
https://openalex.org/W1987306181,"The vascular endothelium was once thought to function primarily in nutrient and oxygen delivery, but recent evidence suggests that it may play a broader role in tissue homeostasis. To explore the role of sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in the adult liver, we studied the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor activation on mouse hepatocyte growth. Delivery of VEGF-A increased liver mass in mice but did not stimulate growth of hepatocytes in vitro, unless LSECs were also present in the culture. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was identified as one of the LSEC-derived paracrine mediators promoting hepatocyte growth. Selective activation of VEGF receptor–1 (VEGFR-1) stimulated hepatocyte but not endothelial proliferation in vivo and reduced liver damage in mice exposed to a hepatotoxin. Thus, VEGFR-1 agonists may have therapeutic potential for preservation of organ function in certain liver disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1979135961,"The cell wall envelope of Gram-positive pathogens functions as a scaffold for the attachment of virulence factors and as a sieve that prevents diffusion of molecules. Here the isd genes (iron-regulated surface determinant) of Staphylococcus aureus were found to encode factors responsible for hemoglobin binding and passage of heme-iron to the cytoplasm, where it acts as an essential nutrient. Heme-iron passage required two sortases that tether Isd proteins to unique locations within the cell wall. Thus, Isd appears to act as an import apparatus that uses cell wall-anchored proteins to relay heme-iron across the bacterial envelope."

In particular, we were able to view the oxygen atoms which, due to their low scattering power, were not previously accessible, and this allowed us to detect local nonstoichiometries or the degree of oxygen-vacancy ordering. This technique offers interesting opportunities for research into oxides, minerals, and ceramics. In particular, this holds for the huge group of perovskite-derived electroceramic materials in which the local oxygen content sensitively controls the electronic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2121676856,"The zebrafish is an attractive model organism for studying cancer development because of its genetic accessibility. Here we describe the induction of clonally derived T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in transgenic zebrafish expressing mouse c-myc under control of the zebrafish Rag2 promoter. Visualization of leukemic cells expressing a chimeric transgene encoding Myc fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that leukemias arose in the thymus, spread locally into gill arches and retro-orbital soft tissue, and then disseminated into skeletal muscle and abdominal organs. Leukemic cells homed back to the thymus in irradiated fish transplanted with GFP-labeled leukemic lymphoblasts. This transgenic model provides a platform for drug screens and for genetic screens aimed at identifying mutations that suppress or enhance c-myc- induced carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2146835460,"We investigated the forces that connect the genetic program of development to morphogenesis in Drosophila. We focused on dorsal closure, a powerful model system for development and wound healing. We found that the bulk of progress toward closure is driven by contractility in supracellular ""purse strings"" and in the amnioserosa, whereas adhesion-mediated zipping coordinates the forces produced by the purse strings and is essential only for the end stages. We applied quantitative modeling to show that these forces, generated in distinct cells, are coordinated in space and synchronized in time. Modeling of wild-type and mutant phenotypes is predictive; although closure in myospheroid mutants ultimately fails when the cell sheets rip themselves apart, our analysis indicates that beta(PS) integrin has an earlier, important role in zipping."
https://openalex.org/W1991587102,"The Fragile X mental retardation-1 (Fmr1) gene encodes a multifunctional protein, FMRP, with intrinsic RNA binding activity. We have developed an approach, antibody-positioned RNA amplification (APRA), to identify the RNA cargoes associated with the in vivo configured FMRP messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Using APRA as a primary screen, putative FMRP RNA cargoes were assayed for their ability to bind directly to FMRP using traditional methods of assessing RNA-protein interactions, including UV-crosslinking and filter binding assays. Approximately 60% of the APRA-defined mRNAs directly associate with FMRP. By examining a subset of these mRNAs and their encoded proteins in brain tissue from Fmr1 knockout mice, we have observed that some of these cargoes as well as the proteins they encode show discrete changes in abundance and/or differential subcellular distribution. These data are consistent with spatially selective regulation of multiple biological pathways by FMRP."
https://openalex.org/W2029081524,"Nuclear genes control plastid differentiation in response to developmental signals, environmental signals, and retrograde signals from plastids themselves. In return, plastids emit signals that are essential for proper expression of many nuclear photosynthetic genes. Accumulation of magnesium-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-Proto), an intermediate in chlorophyll biosynthesis, is a plastid signal that represses nuclear transcription through a signaling pathway that, in Arabidopsis, requires the GUN4 gene. GUN4 binds the product and substrate of Mg- chelatase, an enzyme that produces Mg-Proto, and activates Mg-chelatase. Thus, GUN4 participates in plastid-to-nucleus signaling by regulating Mg-Proto synthesis or trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2136744556,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver disease. Only interferon-α and the nucleosidic inhibitors of the viral polymerase, 3TC and adefovir, are approved for therapy. However, these therapies are limited by the side effects of interferon and the substantial resistance of the virus to nucleosidic inhibitors. Potent new antiviral compounds suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy are highly desired. We describe non-nucleosidic inhibitors of HBV nucleocapsid maturation that possess in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity. These inhibitors have potential for future therapeutic regimens to combat chronic HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2158551180,"Selenoprotein P (Se-P) contains most of the selenium in plasma. Its function is not known. Mice with the Se-P gene deleted (Sepp−/−) were generated. Two phenotypes were observed: 1) Sepp−/−mice lost weight and developed poor motor coordination when fed diets with selenium below 0.1 mg/kg, and 2) maleSepp−/− mice had sharply reduced fertility. Weanling male Sepp+/+,Sepp+/−, and Sepp−/−mice were fed diets for 8 weeks containing <0.02–2 mg selenium/kg.Sepp+/+ and Sepp+/−mice had similar selenium concentrations in all tissues except plasma where a gene-dose effect on Se-P was observed. Liver selenium was unaffected by Se-P deletion except that it increased when dietary selenium was below 0.1 mg/kg. Selenium in other tissues exhibited a continuum of responses to Se-P deletion. Testis selenium was depressed to 19% in mice fed an 0.1 mg selenium/kg diet and did not rise toSepp+/+ levels even with a dietary selenium of 2 mg/kg. Brain selenium was depressed to 43%, but feeding 2 mg selenium/kg diet raised it to Sepp+/+ levels. Kidney was depressed to 76% and reachedSepp+/+ levels on an 0.25 mg selenium/kg diet. Heart selenium was not affected. These results suggest that theSepp−/− phenotypes were caused by low selenium in testis and brain. They strongly suggest that Se-P from liver provides selenium to several tissues, especially testis and brain. Further, they indicate that transport forms of selenium other than Se-P exist because selenium levels of all tissues except testis responded to increases of dietary selenium inSepp−/− mice.

Se-P 1The abbreviations used are: Se-Pselenoprotein PSeppgene encoding selenoprotein PGSHPxglutathione peroxidaseESembryonic stem is the most extreme example of the interesting protein class known as selenoproteins. Selenoproteins contain selenocysteine in their primary structures (1Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Insertion of this 21st amino acid involves an expansion of the genetic code by redefinition of specific internal UGA stop codons (2Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In the majority of selenoproteins there is a single selenocysteine that is at the active site of an enzyme, and it plays a pivotal role in a redox reaction. By contrast, Se-P has many selenocysteines, ranging from 10 in mice and humans to 17 in zebrafish (3Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Steinert P. Bächner D. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The function of Se-P is not known, and there is no direct evidence that its selenocysteine residues play a chemically active role. selenoprotein P gene encoding selenoprotein P glutathione peroxidase embryonic stem Se-P is an extracellular glycoprotein that contains most of the selenium in plasma (5Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17899-17905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its abundance is such that Se-P in rat plasma accounts for 8% of the selenium in the animal. The liver is the primary source of plasma Se-P (6Kato T. Read R. Rozga J. Burk R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G854-G858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although virtually all tissues express it. Substantial amounts of Se-P are synthesized, because the plasma half-life of its selenium is only 3–4 h (7Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Read R. Bellew T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E26-E30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that selenium cycles through plasma Se-P at a high rate. Because of its plasma location, Se-P has been postulated to be a selenium transport protein (8Motsenbocker M.A. Tappel A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The selenium in Se-P is present in its primary structure as selenocysteine residues, and so delivery of its selenium to a cell would require degradation of the Se-P and catabolism of its selenocysteine. That would make a selenium transport role for the protein costly to the animal. Nevertheless, evidence suggesting a transport function has been presented (7Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Read R. Bellew T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E26-E30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that Se-P is a preferred source of selenium for Jurkat cells (9Saito Y. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and embryonic neurons (10Yan J. Barrett J.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8682-8691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another hypothesis of Se-P function is that it protects against oxidative injury (11Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Kato T. Cockell K.A. Lyons P.R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). Its presence has been correlated with protection against hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cell injury by diquat in the rat (12Atkinson J.B. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, it binds to endothelial cells throughout the animal, presumably through its heparin binding properties (13Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Boeglin M.E. Ebner F.F. Chittum H.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Hondal R.J. Ma S. Caprioli R.M. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

To facilitate studies on Se-P function we have produced mice that lack Se-P using homologous recombination. We report some of the characteristics of these animals here, along with results that support a selenium transport or distribution function for Se-P. Restriction enzymes and ligases were obtained fromPromega (Madison, WI), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and MBI Fermentas (Amherst, NY). Cloning vectors, pBluescript and pBC, were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The loxP-flanked Neo® gene, pKT1LoxA, (15Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Neuron. 2002; 33: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and the TK2 gene (16Deng C. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2134-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Kirk R. Thomas, University of Utah. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by core laboratory facilities at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Utah. [32P]dATP and [32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [75Se]Selenite (specific activity, 800 mCi/mg selenium) was obtained from the University of Missouri Research Reactor Facility, Columbia, MO. NADPH was purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Glutathione reductase was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. A P1 plasmid-containing mouse genomic DNA for Sepp was purchased from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). PCR primers MG5 (5′-GATTTGTGCAAACATGGAGAAATC-3′) and MG7 (5′-GAATGTAAGAGTAGGAAGACAAAG-3′) were supplied to Genome Systems and used to screen their murine 129/Sv P1 library. One clone, MG6138, was shown to contain Sepp by Southern analysis. P1-DNA, prepared using a procedure from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA), was digested withEcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI. Southern analysis of the digested MG6138 DNA, using [32P]dCTP-labeled 16C1 cDNA (17Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed twoHindIII fragments (approximate sizes, 6 and 2 kb), a single EcoRI fragment (10 kb), and a singleBamHI fragment (10 kb). The MG6138-HindIII digest was subcloned into pBluescript II KS. Subclones were selected by screening with [32P]dCTP-labeled 16C1 cDNA. Double-stranded DNA prepared from these clones was sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy termination method. Intron-exon boundaries were identified by a comparison of genomic DNA sequences with the sequence of a mouse selenoprotein P cDNA (MB23A). MB23A was obtained by screening a mouse brain cDNA library with the HindIII fragment of MG6138. The cDNA library was a gift from Dr. Thomas Quertermous, Vanderbilt University. MG6138P1 DNA was prepared and digested with BamHI. The fragments from the digest were ligated into pBluescript II and transformed into Escherichia coli. Bacterial colonies were screened by PCR using primers SeP4342 (5′-CGCAGAACGCACAAAGAATGTAGATGGC-3′) and SePBsuR (5′-GTACCCTTAGGCCAGAAGAGGGCACTGGG-3′). One clone (P1#10) selected was determined to contain a 12-kb fragment of genomic DNA suitable for construction of a Sepp knockout vector (SePCKNT). The SePCKNT vector was constructed using the following steps (Fig. 1). 1) The Neo® cassette, KT1LoxA, was passed through E. coliDM1 strain to demethylate the XbaI site and then was digested with XbaI. KT1LoxA was then inserted at theAvrII site in P1#10, producing Sep#10Neo®. 2) SePCKN-1 was prepared by ligation of a SalI/KpnI 7.1-kb fragment of SeP#10Neo®, a KpnI/NotI 6.3-kb fragment of P1#10, and a SalI/NotI 3.4-kb fragment of pBC. 3) SePCKNT was prepared by ligation of aBamHI/NotI 2.9-kb fragment of pBluescript, aSalI/BamHI 13.4-kb fragment of SePCKN-1, and aNotI/XhoI 2.3-kb fragment of TK-2. SePCKNT had a size of 18.6 kb. The total homology with Sepp genomic DNA was 12 kb. The loxP sites within the Neo® cassette gave translational stops in all three reading frames. ES cell transformation with SePCKNT and blastocyst injection were carried out in the Mouse Core Facility at the University of Utah using published procedures (18Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar, 19Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). PCR assays were used to determine the genotype of ES cells and adult mice. DNA was extracted from ES cells and from tail biopsies using established procedures. DNA was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Approximately 1 μg of DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of PCR lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8), 0.01% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20), denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and quick-chilled on ice. Two μl of the denatured DNA solution was amplified for 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 60 s) in a 10-μl reaction mixture. The primers used to screen for ES-positive cells were MoSePS6 (5′-GAAGACTGTAATCGCTATAACCACTGTCCAG-3′) and ACNeoS2 (5′-GGTGTTGGGTCGTTTGTTCGGATCG-3′). The primers used to screen tissue DNA were MoSePS14 (5′-GCCATCAGGGCTCAGTGCAG-3′), MoSePA16 (5′-GTTCAAAGCCCAGGAATGCCACAG-3′), and ACNeoS2. PCR product sizes are: wild type (Sepp+/+), 900 bp from MoSePS14 and MoSePA16; homozygote (Sepp−/−), 500 bp from MoSePS14 and ACNeoS2; heterozygote (Sepp+/−), 900 and 500 bp. An additional PCR product of 2.1 kb is predicted for the primers MoSePS14 and MoSePA16 in Sepp+/− andSepp−/− mice. PCR conditions were not optimized for production of this product. Adult Sepp+/− andSepp−/− mice were transferred to the animal facility at Vanderbilt University. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal protocols for studies at Vanderbilt, and the corresponding University of Utah committee approved the protocols used to generate the knockout mouse. The mice were housed in plastic cages with aspen shavings as bedding material. The light/dark cycle was 12 h:12 h. Mice received pelleted rodent chow (selenium content, 0.29 ± 0.01 mg/kg) and water ad libitum except when fed diets containing specific amounts of selenium. Matings were set up betweenSepp−/− males andSepp−/− females, betweenSepp−/− males andSepp+/− females, between Sepp+/− males andSepp−/− females, and betweenSepp+/− males andSepp+/− females. Pups were weaned 21 days after birth and separated by sex. For experiments in which different amounts of selenium were fed, aTorula yeast-based diet was used (20Burk R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The basal form of this experimental diet contained <0.02 mg of selenium/kg. Sodium selenate was added to this diet during mixing to give final added selenium concentrations that ranged from 0.05 to 2 mg/kg. Male weanling mice were fed basal or selenium-supplemented diet for 8 weeks. They were weighed weekly, and mice that had lost 20% of their highest body weight were euthanized. At 8 weeks the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was removed from the inferior vena cava. The blood was treated with Na2EDTA (1 mg/ml) to prevent coagulation, and plasma was separated by centrifugation. Liver, kidney, heart, testis, and brain were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Plasma and tissues were stored at −80 °C. Tissue homogenates (10%) were prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Supernatants from centrifugation of the tissue homogenates at 13,000 ×g for 30 min were used for measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity. The coupled method was used with 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide as substrate (21Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). Plasma Se-P was measured with a radioimmunoassay (22Hill K.E. Xia Y. Åkesson B. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that utilized the polyclonal antibody preparation 695. Selenium was measured using a modification of the fluorometric assay of Koh and Benson (23Koh T.S. Benson T.H. J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 1983; 66: 918-926PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sheehan T.M.T. Gao M. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 2124-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The limit of detection of this assay is 1 ng of selenium. Adult mice of all genotypes that were fed the chow diet were each injected intraperitoneally with 15 μCi of [75Se]selenite (in 0.15 m NaCl). Blood was obtained from the mice 24 h after 75Se administration. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After being stained with Coomassie Blue, the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film. In a separate experiment, some of the 75Se-labeled plasma was subjected to immunoprecipitation by polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against rat selenoprotein P (25Hill K.E. Chittum H.S. Lyons P.R. Boeglin M.E. Burk R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and by polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against human GSHPx-3 (pAb 3495, a generous gift of K. R. Maddipati, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and75Se-labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography. Male mice of all three genotypes were fed the experimental diet supplemented with 0.1 mg of selenium/kg for 6–8 weeks from the time of weaning. Then each was administered 15 μCi of [75Se]selenite (in 0.15 m NaCl) by gavage. They were housed individually for 24 h and were then anesthetized and exsanguinated by collection of blood from the inferior vena cava. Liver, kidney, testis, and brain were harvested and weighed. The 75Se content of plasma and tissues was determined in a Commugamma 1282 (Amersham Biosciences). Results were analyzed using Student'st test or by analysis of variance with post hocanalysis for statistical differences using the Scheffe test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Calculations were done on a Macintosh G4 using Statview, version 5.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Se-P knockout mice were produced by homologous recombination using genomic DNA cloned from an Sv-129 P1 library that had been mutated using the strategy shown in Fig. 1. C57Bl/6 blastocysts were injected with ES cells heterozygous for the Sepp mutation and then implanted into pseudopregnant females. A male chimera was identified among the offspring. This male was mated with two C57Bl/6j female mice, and the heterozygote progeny (Sepp+/−) from these matings were used to establish the Se-P knockout mouse colony. Twenty-four hours after75Se had been injected into animals of each genotype, plasma was obtained and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig.2A shows the autoradiograph of the resulting gel. Both theSepp+/+ and Sepp+/−plasma samples yielded bands characteristic for Se-P and GSHPx-3.Sepp−/− plasma exhibited only the band of75Se radioactivity corresponding to glutathione peroxidase. The Se-P band was not present in the Sepp−/−lane. The identity of each of the radioactive proteins was verified by precipitation using specific antibody preparations (Fig.2B). Northern analysis of liver RNA was carried out and showed a gene-dose effect with no signal evident in theSepp−/− lane (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows the results of measuring Se-P by competitive radioimmunoassay of plasma samples from the three genotypes. A gene-dose effect is evident that mirrors the liver mRNA results (Fig. 2C). Thus, Se-P has been eliminated from the plasma of the knockout mice, and its concentration is half that of the wild types in the plasma of the heterozygotes. Offspring ofSepp+/− and Sepp−/−animals fed rodent chow were characterized. The ratio of male to female progeny was ∼50/50 regardless of the genotype of the parents (data not shown). Mating of Sepp+/− males andSepp+/− females resulted in viable pups with the predicted genotype distribution (TableI, top). Those pups survived to weaning (Table 1, bottom). Mating of Sepp+/−males and Sepp−/− females produced fewerSepp−/− pups than predicted, and 31% of these homozygous pups died before weaning. WhenSepp−/− males were mated withSepp+/− and Sepp−/−females over a period of 6 months, only one litter was born from 18 mating pairs (Table II). In contrast,Sepp+/− males produced many pregnancies withSepp+/− and Sepp−/−females. These results indicate that female homozygotes have difficulties producing and raising homozygote pups and that male homozygotes have sharply reduced fertility.Table IGenotype distribution and viability of pups produced by Sepp+/− siresPup genotypeDam genotypeSepp+/−Sepp−/−Number of pups% of totalNumber of pups% of totalGenotype distribution of pups Sepp−/−88275142 Sepp+/−160497058 Sepp+/+81240Number of pups% SurvivingNumber of pups% SurvivingPup survival to weaning Sepp−/−881003569 Sepp+/−1599970100 Sepp+/+80990 Open table in a new tab Table IIFertility of Sepp−/− and Sepp+/− miceMouse genotypeSire:Sepp+/−Sepp−/−Dam:Sepp+/−Sepp−/−Sepp+/−Sepp−/−Breeding pairs2-aBreeding pairs were fed the chow diet and housed together for up to 6 months.4620108Litters742910Average pups/litter8772-a Breeding pairs were fed the chow diet and housed together for up to 6 months. Open table in a new tab In the initial experiments with our genetically altered mice (Tables I and II), we fed mouse chow containing 0.29 mg of selenium/kg. TheSepp−/− mice grew as well as theSepp+/+ mice (Fig.3A) and appeared healthy. However, when we began feeding a selenium-deficient diet containing <0.02 mg of selenium/kg, the Sepp−/− mice did not survive for more than a few weeks, whereasSepp+/− and Sepp+/+ mice survived. To investigate this sensitivity ofSepp−/− mice to selenium deficiency, selenium and glutathione peroxidase were measured in tissues from male mice of all three genotypes that for 8 weeks had been fed diets containing amounts of selenium ranging from deficient to 20 times the dietary requirement. These mice were obtained by matingSepp+/− males withSepp+/− females. Sepp−/− mice fed the selenium-deficient diet (no selenium supplementation) gained weight for about a week and then began to suffer from loss of motor coordination and weight (Fig.3B). When mice had lost 20% of their highest recorded body weight, they were euthanized. Their average survival time from weaning was 15 days. Sepp−/− mice fed the diet with 0.05 mg of selenium added/kg also had decreased survival times; 2 of 4 mice were sacrificed because of 20% weight loss, one at 3 weeks and the other at 6.5 weeks (Fig. 3C). Thus only 2Sepp−/− mice fed this diet remained alive at the 8-week time point. Animals fed an 0.1 mg of selenium or more/kg diet all survived to 8 weeks without loss of coordination, and weights were similar for all genotypes (Fig. 3D). Two selenoproteins contribute to plasma selenium: extracellular glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-3) and Se-P. Fig.4A shows the selenium content and glutathione peroxidase activity of plasma at different levels of dietary selenium supplementation. The absence of Se-P from the plasma of Sepp−/− mice is reflected in the very low plasma selenium concentrations measured at all levels of selenium supplementation (Fig. 4A, left panel). Selenium concentrations in Sepp+/− mouse plasma were intermediate between the homozygote and wild type concentrations at each supplementation level. This finding is consistent with the gene-dose effect indicated in Fig. 2D by the Se-P concentrations in plasma. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity increased as the dietary selenium supplement was increased from 0 to 0.1 mg/kg in wild type (Sepp+/+) mice and maintained that level as dietary selenium was increased further (Fig. 4A, right panel). This result is consistent with the established dietary requirement of 0.1 mg of selenium/kg in mice (26Prohaska J.R. Sunde R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 105: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Weiss S.L. Evenson J.K. Thompson K.M. Sunde R.A. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2260-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Sepp+/− plasma glutathione peroxidase activities were not significantly different from activities in theSepp+/+ mice. Sepp−/−mice had lower plasma glutathione peroxidase activities thanSepp+/+ mice at levels of selenium supplementation below 1.0 mg/kg. These results indicate that Se-P is needed to achieve normal plasma activity of GSHPx-3 at dietary selenium concentrations up to 5 times the requirement but not when the dietary selenium concentration is 10 times the required concentration. Liver selenium levels were not affected by deletion of Se-P, except when dietary selenium was below the selenium requirement (Fig.4B, left panel). The twoSepp−/− animals in the 0.05 mg selenium/kg diet group that survived for 8 weeks had levels that were greater than the averages of the other groups. The liver selenium levels of the twoSepp−/− animals that did not survive 8 weeks were also greater than the 8-week averages of the other animals (see legend for Fig. 4). Liver glutathione peroxidase activities had the same pattern (Fig. 4B, right panel) as liver selenium concentrations. These results indicate that theSepp−/− liver retains more selenium than theSepp+/+ liver during selenium deficiency and that deletion of Se-P does not cause a decrease in liver selenium content at any dietary selenium level. They also demonstrate that deletion of Se-P does not impair regulation of selenium concentration in liver when higher levels of selenium are fed. Fig. 5 shows the selenium content of testis, brain, kidney, and heart. Glutathione peroxidase activity was also determined in these tissues, and its pattern (not shown) was similar to that of the selenium concentrations. In each of these tissues the values for Sepp+/+ andSepp+/− mice were similar. The selenium difference between the Sepp+/+ orSepp+/− mice, on the one hand, and theSepp−/− mice, on the other hand, varied by tissue. It was greatest in testis, with selenium concentration being 19% of Sepp+/+ when selenium was fed at the dietary requirement. Moreover, increasing dietary selenium 20-fold did not raise the level of testis selenium into theSepp+/+ range. The brain was also severely affected with its selenium concentration being 43% of control at the dietary requirement. However, brain selenium was raised into theSepp+/+ range by increasing dietary selenium 20-fold. Kidney selenium was less affected, being 76% ofSepp+/+ when the dietary selenium requirement was fed. Moreover, increasing dietary selenium to just 2.5-fold the requirement raised the selenium content ofSepp−/− kidney to the same level found inSepp+/+ kidney. Heart selenium concentration was not significantly affected by genotype. These results indicate that Se-P facilitates selenium accumulation in testis, brain, and kidney. Heart selenium content does not appear to depend on Se-P. Thus, the tissues studied vary in their dependence on Se-P to maintain their selenium concentrations. To determine the effect of Se-P deletion on the disposition of a single dose of selenium, a tracer dose of 75Se as sodium selenite was administered by gavage to mice being fed the diet supplemented with 0.1 mg of selenium/kg. Tissues were harvested 24 h after administration, and their 75Se content was determined; Fig.6 shows the results. Liver showed a trend of containing more of the 75Se administered inSepp−/− mice than it did inSepp+/− or Sepp+/+ mice. Brain and testis contained less 75Se inSepp−/− mice than in the other two genotypes. These results show that absorbed selenium is readily taken up by the liver in Sepp−/− mice but is less well taken up and/or retained by the brain and testis. These results are consistent with the tissue selenium levels shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Mice with Se-P deleted have been produced by homologous recombination. These mice are viable but exhibit a profound alteration in selenium metabolism, which renders them intolerant of low dietary selenium intake. When intake is low they develop impaired movement and coordination and do not maintain their weight. In addition, males have sharply reduced fertility, even when fed enough selenium to prevent the movement abnormality and weight loss. These two phenotypes correlate with the effect of Se-P deletion on the selenium content of the brain and testis (Fig. 5, Band A, respectively). Low selenium in the brain correlates with the apparent neurological impairment, and low selenium in testis appears to underlie the impaired male fertility. Selenium is essential for spermatogenesis (28Behne D. Weiler H. Kyriakopoulos A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 106: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 29Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohé L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Brain and testis have been identified as tissues that retain selenium well under conditions of extreme selenium deficiency (30Burk R.F. Brown D.G. Seely R.J. Scaief III, C.C. J. Nutr. 1972; 102: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Behne D. Hilmert H. Scheid S. Gessner H. Elger W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Therefore, a decade ago we compared the ability of these two tissues to take up selenium administered in the form of75Se-labeled Se-P (7Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Read R. Bellew T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E26-E30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both tissues took up the75Se avidly. The brain was able to increase its uptake more than 4-fold when selenium deficiency was imposed. In contrast, testis uptake, although brisk, was unaffected by selenium deficiency. These results and the present ones suggest that the brain and testis remove Se-P from plasma to acquire its selenium. Moreover, the brain would appear to be able to up-regulate this uptake mechanism in selenium deficiency. In addition, the neurological phenotype could be prevented by feeding selenium to Sepp−/− mice at the level of dietary requirement or higher. This suggests that the brain can take up other plasma forms of selenium than Se-P and therefore utilizes two or more mechanisms to obtain the selenium it needs. No evidence was found that the testis is able to utilize a form of selenium other than Se-P. The severity of the effect of Se-P deletion on selenium concentration forms a continuum in the tissues we examined. Although there were severe effects on the testis and brain, the kidney was only moderately affected and the heart was not significantly affected. This indicates that other transport forms of selenium than Se-P exist and that each tissue may have preferred forms of plasma selenium from which it obtains the element. In the mice studied here, plasma selenium was present as Se-P, GSHPx-3, and small molecule forms. The origin of plasma Se-P is mostly liver (6Kato T. Read R. Rozga J. Burk R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G854-G858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that of GSHPx-3 is kidney (32Avissar N. Ornt D.B. Yagil Y. Horowitz S. Watkins R.H. Kerl E.A. Takahashi K. Palmer I.S. Cohen H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C367-C375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intestine is known to release a small molecule form of selenium that is taken up by the liver (6Kato T. Read R. Rozga J. Burk R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G854-G858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but additional small molecule forms of selenium, other than excretory metabolites, have not been detected. It can be inferred that the kidney can also take up a small molecule form of selenium, because kidney is the source of plasma GSHPx-3 and the selenium concentration of kidney responds to dietary selenium in animals lacking Se-P (Fig.5C). There is no direct evidence that GSHPx-3 serves to supply tissues with selenium. However, one finding in this study is consistent with such a function. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity did not rise to its control level until 10 times the dietary requirement of selenium was fed (Fig. 4A), whereas kidney selenium level rose to control at only 2.5 times the requirement (Fig. 5C). If it is assumed that synthesis and secretion of GSHPx-3 was normalized when kidney selenium was at control levels, then increased removal of GSHPx-3 from plasma must be invoked to explain the low glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma at that point. Mice with deletion of GSHPx-3 will facilitate study of its putative transport role. The liver has a central role in selenium metabolism. It receives small molecule selenium directly from the intestine and is the major organ for removal of selenium from the dietary form, selenomethionine, via the trans-sulfuration pathway (33Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Suzuki T. Morino Y. Soda K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4492-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The liver also is the principal organ producing excretory metabolites of selenium to prevent the accumulation of toxic levels of the element. Thus, the liver is the portal through which selenium enters the body and the organ that maintains its homeostasis through excretion of the element. Secretion of Se-P into the plasma is another important function of the liver. The increase of liver selenium concentration in selenium-deficient mice with deletion of Se-P is therefore not surprising (Fig. 4B). Selenium entering the liver inSepp−/− mice is presumably diverted from export as Se-P to hepatic selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase. Se-P deletion did not interfere with the regulation of liver selenium content when levels above the dietary requirement for selenium were fed. Whether the liver selenium concentration was maintained by release of selenium in a form that could be taken up by other tissues or by production of excretory metabolites was not addressed in these experiments. Determination of this will be important in the elucidation of selenium homeostasis. The studies reported here address the selenium transport function of Se-P. They indicate that the testis and brain have mechanisms for acquiring selenium from plasma Se-P. The characterization of those mechanisms will require additional research, as will assessment of the putative oxidant defense role of Se-P. We are grateful to Dr. Kirk R. Thomas for help in generating the mutant mice as well as for very helpful discussions and to Dr. Marla J. Berry for suggesting the collaboration that led to this study."

These cues include soluble inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as stationary adhesion molecules. Both types of signals initiate immune system responses from resting leukocytes and provide directional information for appropriate migration. The process of cell migration can be described as the result of coordination between membrane protrusive activity at a leading edge, movement of the cell body, and retraction of the rear of the cell (5Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar,6Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). New membrane extensions at the leading edge are stabilized by adhesive interactions between integrins and stationary adhesion molecules located on another cell or deposited as an extracellular matrix. Conversely, the retraction of membrane at the rear of the cell requires the disruption of the adhesive interaction either by disengagement between the ligand and receptor or dissociation of the links between the integrin and the internal cytoskeleton (7Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in regulating both cell shape and adhesive properties. Actin polymerization at the leading edge can physically drive membrane protrusion (8Borisy G.G. Svitkina T.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and integrins regulate integrin activity (9Sastry S.K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The links between the actin cytoskeleton and integrins can either promote or restrain integrin adhesiveness depending on the cell type and environmental context. Early investigations of integrin-actin linkages in stationary fibroblasts demonstrated that actomyosin-dependent integrin clustering was required for strong integrin adhesions (11Burridge K., M. Chzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). More recently, a study of highly motile leukocytes and lymphocytes have revealed that when these cells are circulating, interactions between integrins and cortical actin can restrain integrin activity until the appropriate signals are received (12Zhou X.

These signaling proteins act as molecular switches that are responsive to a range of extracellular signals that influence cell migration including those transduced by tyrosine kinase receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin adhesion molecule receptors (25Van Aelst L.

In fibroblasts, we have shown that down-regulation of RhoA by p190RhoGAP is necessary for cell spreading and directed migration into a wound (32Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In leukocytes, we have shown that RhoA signaling to a serine/threonine kinase, ROCK,1 regulates the retraction of the tail of migrating monocytes and negatively influences integrin adhesion at the cell rear (33Alblas J. Ulfman L. Hordijk P. Koenderman L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 34Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This role for RhoA and ROCK in negative regulation of integrin adhesion was initially unexpected based on previous findings that RhoA promotes the formation of large integrin-based focal adhesions in fibroblasts. However, these large focal adhesions are a characteristic of stationary cells and are absent from leukocytes. Instead, leukocytes form small focal complexes of tethering and signaling molecules surrounding ligand-engaged integrins. These focal complexes coordinate integrin signaling during migration and are present both in leukocytes and the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. In both cases, membrane protrusions and their accompanying focal complexes have been shown to be dependent on Rac or Cdc42 and negatively regulated by RhoA and ROCK activity (33Alblas J. Ulfman L.

In our current study, we have further investigated the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in regulating integrin activity. We find that ROCK negatively regulates two integrin-mediated functions: phosphytyrosine signaling and membrane protrusion. We present evidence suggesting that ROCK regulates integrin adhesion and membrane activity by suppressing cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, we show that a biological consequence of RhoA/ROCK signaling is to promote migration by limiting membrane protrusions to the leading edge.

Cofilin antibody was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc., and the phosphospecific cofilin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Jim Bamburg. Adhesion to 10 μg/ml ICAM-1 or VCAM was performed as described previously (34Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Cell morphology was assessed by F-actin staining with Alexa 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) or by phase-contrast microscopy using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with either a ×100 or ×63 objective. Images were obtained with a cooled CCD camera and processed in Metamorph Imaging software (Universal Imaging) and Adobe PhotoShop. Scion Image software (NIH) was used to quantitate cell area. For cells plated on fibronectin, ICAM+VCAM or poly-l-lysine, a minimum of 10 cells from three separate experiments was analyzed. Cells transfected with Myc-S3A cofilin were detected by immunostaining, and those determined to be expressing low levels of S3A cofilin were selected for the measurement of cell area. Data were collected from three separate transfection experiments. Time-lapse videos were recorded with Scion Image software. Images were taken every 20 s for 15 min to record cell behavior at a magnification of ×40. Still images were further processed in Adobe PhotoShop. Transwell assays were performed by coating the 8.0-μm pore membrane with a solution of 10 μg/ml ICAM-1 and 3 μg/ml VCAM (using concentrations previously shown to promote monocyte migration) (39Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), placing 105monocytes in the upper chamber and 10 ng/ml MCP-1 in the lower chamber to induce migration. Primary monocytes were allowed to migrate 1 h, whereas THP-1 cell migration was assessed after 3 h. Cells adherent to the top of the Transwell filter were removed with a cotton swab, and the number of cells attached to the underside of the filter was counted by microscopy. Previous work has shown that ROCK negatively influences integrin-mediated adhesion in primary monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils (33Alblas J. Ulfman L. Hordijk P. Koenderman L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 34Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 38Liu L. Schwartz B.R. Lin N. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2330-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying this observation, we used the THP-1 monocytic cell line to study the function of ROCK on integrin adhesion, membrane activity, and leukocyte migration. THP-1 cells grow in suspension, but placing them in wells coated with the integrin substrates, ICAM-1 or VCAM, induces adhesion that is up-regulated >2-fold in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Fig.1). This indicates that integrin adhesion of the THP-1 cell line is regulated in the same manner as primary cells. Because Y-27632-induced adhesion was correlated with a dramatic increase in cell spreading in primary monocytes, we examined the morphology of THP-1 cells treated with Y-27632. For these experiments, we used F-actin staining to observe the shape of THP-1 cells adherent to different integrin substrates. Fibronectin represents an extracellular matrix material present in wounds that engages several β1 integrins, whereas ICAM-1 and VCAM are cell adhesion molecules expressed by activated endothelial cells to recruit leukocytes through αL/Mβ2 and α4β1, respectively. THP-1 cells adherent to fibronectin or ICAM + VCAM displayed a rounded appearance, although the cells plated on ICAM + VCAM had more fine filopodial extensions and more distinct punctate structures characteristic of podosomes (Fig.2A). To investigate the role of ROCK on monocyte morphology, we allowed the cells to engage the substrates in the presence of Y-27632. The area occupied by THP-1 cells plated under various conditions was measured, and the average results are depicted graphically in Fig. 2B. The inhibition of ROCK augmented cell spreading in response to integrin engagement, particularly when plated on fibronectin. In addition to a simple increase in cell spreading, the F-actin staining in Fig. 2Ashows that inhibition of ROCK promoted excessive membrane activity as indicated by F-actin content and numerous lamellipodia around the perimeter of the cell. The up-regulated protrusions were dependent on the integrin substrates, because cells adherent to a nonspecific charged surface (poly-l-lysine) were round and flat with no active lamellipodia or membrane ruffling as indicated by the smooth appearance and reduced levels of F-actin content. These findings prompted us to determine whether integrin signaling was similarly misregulated by the inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632. Because tyrosine kinases are potent mediators of integrin signaling, we examined the pattern of tyrosine kinase signaling in THP-1 cells adherent to integrin substrates. Fig.3A shows localization of phosphotyrosine in punctate structures concentrated toward the leading edge of cells bound to fibronectin or ICAM + VCAM. THP-1 cells adherent to integrin substrates in the presence of Y-27632 displayed multiple membrane extensions on the cell, each with a concentration of phosphotryosine signal. The phosphotyrosine content of cells bound to poly-l-lysine was significantly reduced, indicating that the integrin substrates initiated the phosphotyrosine signaling. Thus, the increased membrane protrusions were accompanied by phosphotyrosine signaling triggered by integrin substrates. To further explore the effect of inhibiting ROCK on tyrosine phosphorylation signaling, we analyzed cell lysates for the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot. Fig. 3B shows that when THP-1 cells adhere to fibronectin, there is an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the region of ∼100 and ∼64–70 kDa. This adhesion-induced phosphotyrosine signaling is further enhanced when the cells are allowed to adhere in the presence of Y-2732. We next sought to determine the identity of specific proteins that may display increased tyrosine phosphorylation when ROCK is inhibited with Y-27632. Based on the molecular mass of the observed increase in phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of the tyrosine kinase Pyk-2 (CADTK, Cakβ, and RAFT-TK) and paxillin, which have molecular masses of 110 and 68 kDa, respectively. Again, THP-1 cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin for 20 min followed by immunoprecipitation of Pyk-2 or paxillin and subjected to analysis of phosphotyrosine content by Western blot. In suspension, Y-27632 decreased Pyk-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that integrin-independent signaling to Pyk-2 requires ROCK signaling. We found that the highest level of tyrosine phosphorylation for both Pyk-2 and paxillin occurred in cells adherent to fibronectin in the presence of Y-27632 (Fig. 3C). Having found that inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632 promoted increased integrin adhesion that is accompanied by increases in membrane protrusions and phosphotyrosine signaling, we then investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for increased integrin adhesion. Regulation of integrin avidity is an important mechanism controlling of integrin adhesion in leukocytes (40van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is thought that the round circulating cells maintain integrins inactive by tethering them to the band of cortical actin until appropriate signals are received. Upon activation, integrins are freed from their cytoskeletal constraints and allowed to cluster, forming qualitatively different connections with the actin cytoskeleton for signaling and migration. Evidence both for and against the model of cytoskeletal constraint has been reported, so we performed experiments to test this model with our cell system using two different drugs that destabilize the cytoskeleton, cytochalasin D, and latrunculin A. Fig.4A shows dose-dependent adhesion of THP-1 cells to either ICAM-1- or VCAM-coated surfaces when the cells are plated in the presence of cytochalasin D or latrunculin A. Our results support the cytoskeletal constraint model because both drugs stimulate adhesion to integrin substrates at low doses. Thus, limited cytoskeletal destabilization promotes adhesion, whereas completely abolishing F-actin does not allow the formation of the subsequent cytoskeletal linkages thought to be required for productive integrin clustering and signaling. This is further supported by the observation that cells plated in the presence of 0.1 μm cytochalasin D displayed a well spread morphology, whereas those plated in 1 μm cytochalasin D were very small and rounded (Fig. 4B). We then asked whether the role of Y-27632 in promoting integrin functions could be attributed to a destabilization of the cortical actin network. To address this question, we utilized another pharmacological reagent, jasplakinolide, which stabilizes F-actin structures, thereby preventing actin remodeling. Fig. 4Cshows that jasplakinolide counteracts the effects of Y-27632 on THP-1 cell morphology as the cells treated with both jasplakinolide and Y-27632 are more rounded than those treated with only Y-27632. In addition, jasplakinolide and Y-27632 have opposite and ameliorating effects on THP-1 cells adhesion. Jasplakinolide abolishes adhesion, Y-27632 promotes adhesion, and cells plated in the presence of both drugs show an intermediate level of adhesion (data not shown). These results are consistent with a model in which ROCK negatively regulates integrin function by maintaining the cortical actin structure that constrains integrins. Our next objective was to determine signaling pathways downstream from ROCK that influenced integrin function in a manner dependent upon cytoskeletal remodeling. The small GTPase RAP1 plays an important role in up-regulating integrin adhesion, especially in leukocytes (41Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 42Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 43Caron E. Self A.J. Hall A. Curr.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10453-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between members of the small GTPase superfamily is a common regulatory mechanism, so we asked whether ROCK might exert its effect through RAP1 by examining the effect of RAP1 mutants on THP-1 cell membrane protrusions. If Y-27632 is activating RAP-1 to stimulate integrin function, transfection with constitutively active RAP1 should mimic the Y-27632 phenotype, whereas a dominant negative RAP1 should block the Y-27632 effect on morphology. Fig.5 shows that these RAP1 mutants have little effect on the cell morphology with or without Y-27632. In addition, we found that Y-27632 did not increase the levels of GTP-RAP1 when cells were plated on fibronectin (data not shown). These results indicate that RAP1 is not a component of ROCK signaling that modulates integrin function. Another potentially interesting candidate downstream from ROCK is the LIM kinase to cofilin signaling pathway. ROCK phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin. Cofilin both depolymerizes and severs F-actin filaments, thereby facilitating actin remodeling (45Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In this model, ROCK activity would lead to phosphorylated inactive cofilin that would tend to stabilize the existing F-actin networks, whereas Y-27632 would lead to de-phosphorylated active cofilin that would promote actin remodeling. However, LIM kinase and cofilin are regulated by additional pathways besides ROCK. To determine the contribution of ROCK signaling in cofilin regulation in our cell system, we first examined the effect of Y-27632 on cofilin phosphorylation status. We used an antibody that specifically recognizes cofilin that is phosphorylated on serine 3 to show that in THP-1 cells plated on fibronectin, there is a significant level of phosphorylated inactive cofilin. When cells are allowed to adhere to fibronectin in the presence of Y-27632, the levels of cofilin phosphorylation are nearly abolished. This indicates that ROCK plays an important role in regulating the phosphorylation and thus activation, the status of cofilin in response to THP-1 cell adhesion. We next used an S3A mutant of cofilin that cannot be phosphorylated and inactivated to examine the importance of cofilin activity in cell shape and membrane protrusions. In THP-1 cells transfected with S3A cofilin, we found that low level expression of activated cofilin led to a ∼40% increase in cell spreading (Fig.6B). In cells expressing high levels of activated cofilin, F-actin structures are completely abolished, leading to cells with a small rounded morphology (data not shown). This finding is consistent with our previous data using cytochalasin D and latrunculin A that showed strong dose-dependent differences on integrin function. We also examined the effect of activated cofilin on the morphology of primary monocytes. In these experiments, cells were loaded with either wild type or S3A cofilin proteins by electroporation as described previously (34Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated that inhibiting ROCK in primary monocytes increased membrane protrusive activity, and because the cells are highly migratory, ROCK inhibition results in cells with unretracted tails (34Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Fig. 6C shows that overexpression of wild type cofilin leads to a small increase in the percentage of cells with unretracted tails (22% in controls, 34% with wild type cofilin), whereas loading the cells with active cofilin results in a greater percentage of cells with unretracted tails (65%). The effect of loading primary monocytes with active cofilin is very similar to the phenotype observed with Y-27632 treatment (80% unretracted tails), albeit less potent. Together, these results indicate that cofilin is inactivated downstream from ROCK, which contributes to the promotion of membrane protrusions and inhibition of tail retraction. This study has examined the molecular mechanisms underlying of membrane protrusions induced by inhibition of ROCK. Our next goal was to determine the biological consequence of RhoA/ROCK-regulated membrane protrusions. To study monocyte migration, we used our primary monocyte system in which cells were loaded with C3 protein, a potent inhibitor of RhoA, and subsequently ROCK activity. The loaded monocytes were plated onto coverslips and their migration was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy. Control cells loaded with GST displayed a typical migration pattern in which the membrane at the leading edge protrudes, the cell body moves forward, and the rear of the cell retracts. This results in a cell with a relatively round morphology, reflecting the balance between protrusions at the front of the cells and retraction of membrane at the rear of the cell. To change direction, the monocyte sends out a lamellipodial extension in an alternate direction and the former leading edge stops protruding and retracts (Fig. 7A). In contrast, monocytes loaded with C3 display competing membrane lamellae, pulling the cell in different directions at the same time (Fig.7B). Membrane activity is not limited to a single leading edge, resulting in an elongated cell with unregulated protrusions along the length of the cell. Thus, RhoA activity is required to suppress membrane protrusions at the rear of a migrating monocyte. Monocytes in which RhoA or ROCK is inhibited have robust lamellipodial protrusions, a behavior typically thought to promote migration. Yet over time, the C3-loaded monocytes do not appear to be able to migrate any significant distance, despite vigorous short term movements. To directly test whether monocytes require ROCK signaling to undergo productive migration, we used a Transwell migration assay. Primary monocytes (Fig. 8) or THP-1 cells (data not shown) were placed in the upper chamber of a Transwell and allowed to migrate toward the chemokine MCP-1 in the lower chamber. The dividing membrane was coated with the ICAM + VCAM combination to simulate integrin substrates normally used by monocytes for migration. The number of cells that migrated to the lower chamber was counted by microscopy, and the results are presented in Fig. 8. As expected, MCP-1 induced >10-fold induction of monocyte migration for control cells. When the migration assay was performed in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, migration was reduced to ∼3-fold. Together, these results demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK signaling is required to suppress protrusions at the rear of migrating monocytes to allow productive migration. In this study, we have extended results from previous work examining the function of RhoA and ROCK signaling in leukocyte migration. We report that RhoA and ROCK signaling are required to limit membrane protrusions to a single leading edge. When ROCK signaling was inhibited with Y-27632, we found increased integrin adhesion accompanied by increased membrane activity and up-regulated phosphotyrosine signaling. We described an important role for cytoskeletal remodeling in regulating integrin adhesion in experiments utilizing either actin depolymerizing or stabilizing agents. An investigation into the signaling pathways that influence cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate integrin activity revealed that both ROCK and cofilin contribute to regulating membrane protrusions. Finally, we showed that in the absence of RhoA/ROCK signaling, monocytes send out competing lamellipodia that interfere with productive migration. We observed a strong correlation among increased integrin adhesion, increased integrin-dependent phosphotyrosine signaling, and inappropriate lamellipodial protrusions. We propose that the misregulated integrin engagement initiates phosphotyrosine signaling, which promotes membrane protrusion. Evidence for a direct link between integrin signaling and lamellipodia formation comes from our identification of Pyk-2 and paxillin as two proteins whose adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation levels are influenced by ROCK activity. Both Pyk-2 and paxillin have been implicated in promoting protrusive activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts (46Duong L.T. Rodan G.A. Cell Motil.

This is further supported by studies from the Cabanas laboratory showing that increased Pyk-2 signaling in neutrophils treated with C3 was downstream from integrin clustering (51Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Sanchez-Martin L. Rey M. Vicente- Manzanares M. Narumiya S. Teixido J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40518-40527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our data highlight a previously unappreciated role for ROCK signaling in suppressing integrin adhesion, signaling, and membrane protrusions away from the leading edge. Circulating leukocytes must maintain tight regulation over the state of integrin adhesiveness. Leukocytes inhibit integrin function in the resting state to prevent unwarranted inflammatory responses but quickly activate integrin adhesion in response to infection or injury. A rigid band of cortical actin maintains the round shape of circulating leukocytes, and it has been proposed that this cortical actin constrains integrin mobility, rendering them unable to cluster with other integrins (14Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 40van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our data support the model for cytoskeletal remodeling as a molecular mechanism that regulates integrin adhesion in leukocytes. We found that low doses of two actin destabilizing agents, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, promote integrin adhesion, whereas the jasplakinolide, a F-actin stabilizing agent, prevents adhesion. Despite the pharmacological evidence for the role of actin remodeling in integrin activation, the in vivo signaling pathways that would regulate actin dynamics have not been well characterized. Here, we implicate ROCK in governing actin remodeling, because inhibition of ROCK has the same effect as low doses of actin destabilizing agents on integrin adhesion. In addition, the combination of the ROCK inhibitor with an actin stabilizer had counteracting effects on adhesion and membrane protrusion. Further investigation of signaling pathways downstream from ROCK showed that the actin remodeling protein, cofilin, is involved in regulating membrane protrusions in THP-1 cells and tail retraction in primary monocytes. Cofilin is known to promote actin remodeling by virtue of its actin severing and depolymerizing activity (45Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cofilin activity has been implicated in promoting lamellipodial protrusions in response to growth factors (52Zebda N. Bernard O. Bailly M. Welti S. Lawrence D.S. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 53Chan A.Y. Bailly M. Zebda N. Segall J.E. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The effects of expressing non-phosphorylatable, activated cofilin were not as striking as those observed with inhibition of ROCK, which indicates a role for additional signaling molecules. These results indicate that regulation of integrin function by actin remodeling was regulated by ROCK signaling through a pathway involving inactivation of cofilin. To evaluate the biological consequence of RhoA and ROCK regulation of integrin functions, we analyzed the behavior of primary monocytes in addition to THP-1 cells. Using time-lapse video microscopy, we observed that inhibition of RhoA signaling leads to the formation of multiple competing lamellae. These monocytes appear to be unable to choose a leading edge and do not appear to migrate any appreciable distance, despite robust membrane protrusive activity. We measured the capability of the monocytes to migrate in a Transwell assay, which demonstrated the ROCK dependence of MCP-1-induced migration. This finding is consistent with results reported by Ashida et al. (54Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that show that Y-27632 inhibits migration of THP-1 cells. Our results confirm those findings and build upon them by implicating two integrin-dependent functions, phosphotyrosine signaling and membrane protrusions, as molecular mechanisms underlying the block in directed migration. Combining data from the present studies with that from many different investigators and systems, we propose a model in which spatial regulation of RhoA activity is required for productive migration. In this model, RhoA must be actively inhibited at the leading edge to allow lamellipodial protrusions. This is supported by other studies in fibroblasts that show that the inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling with C3, Y-27632, or overexpression of p190RhoGAP promotes cell spreading, protrusion, and polarity (32Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 36Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p190RhoGAP is localized to sites of membrane protrusions and ruffling (55Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 56Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Silver J. Bronson R.T. Settleman J. Development. 2000; 127: 4891-4903PubMed Google Scholar). Although RhoA must be inhibited at the leading edge, our model also proposes that RhoA must be activated at the rear of the cell to promote migration. Myosin-based contractility has previously been implicated in the tail retraction of migrating neutrophils (57Eddy R.J. Pierini L.M. Matsumura F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is known to regulate myosin phosphorylation. However, our previous studies in migrating monocytes did not reveal a major role for myosin contractility in RhoA-dependent tail retraction. Our current data suggest an additional mechanism that RhoA and ROCK are required to suppress lamellipodia formation away from the leading edge and that failure to limit membrane activity inhibits productive migration.

https://openalex.org/W2001051671,"Agonist-dependent internalization of G protein-coupled receptors via clathrin-coated pits is dependent on the adaptor protein β-arrestin, which interacts with elements of the endocytic machinery such as AP2 and clathrin. For the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) this requires ubiquitination of β-arrestin by E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Based on trafficking patterns and affinity of β-arrestin, G protein-coupled receptors are categorized into two classes. For class A receptors (e.g. β2AR), which recycle rapidly, β-arrestin directs the receptors to clathrin-coated pits but does not internalize with them. For class B receptors (e.g. V2 vasopressin receptors), which recycle slowly, β-arrestin internalizes with the receptor into endosomes. In COS-7 and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, stimulation of the β2AR or V2 vasopressin receptor leads, respectively, to transient or stable β-arrestin ubiquitination. The time course of ubiquitination and deubiquitination of β-arrestin correlates with its association with and dissociation from each type of receptor. Chimeric receptors, constructed by switching the cytoplasmic tails of the two classes of receptors (β2AR and V2 vasopressin receptors), demonstrate reversal of the patterns of both β-arrestin trafficking and β-arrestin ubiquitination. To explore the functional consequences of β-arrestin ubiquitination we constructed a yellow fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin2-ubiquitin chimera that cannot be deubiquitinated by cellular deubiquitinases. This “permanently ubiquitinated” β-arrestin did not dissociate from the β2AR but rather internalized with it into endosomes, thus transforming this class A receptor into a class B receptor with respect to its trafficking pattern. Overexpression of this β-arrestin ubiquitin chimera in HEK-293 cells also results in enhancement of β2AR internalization and degradation. In the presence ofN-ethylmaleimide (an inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes), coimmunoprecipitation of the receptor and β-arrestin was increased dramatically, suggesting that deubiquitination of β-arrestin triggers its dissociation from the receptor. Thus the ubiquitination status of β-arrestin determines the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex as well as the trafficking pattern of β-arrestin.

Upon agonist stimulation GPCRs initiate second messenger signaling cascades through activated G protein subunits. Agonist stimulation also leads to rapid receptor phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases known as G protein-coupled receptor kinases. The receptor, thus phosphorylated, has increased affinity for cytosolic proteins called β-arrestins. β-Arrestin binding leads to the uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G proteins, causing dampening or desensitization of GPCR signaling via the downstream second messenger molecules (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Recently, novel adaptor and scaffold functions of β-arrestins have been discovered. Thus, while terminating G protein signals, β-arrestin binding can initiate new signal waves from GPCRs (2Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For example, β-arrestins serve as adaptors that bring nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src to form signaling complexes with the internalizing receptor (3Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y.

In addition, β-arrestins interact with proteins of the endocytic machinery such as clathrin, β-adaptin subunit 2 of the AP2 complex, and Arf-6 and thus promote internalization of receptors via clathrin-coated vesicles (6Krupnick J.G.

Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The prototypic mammalian GPCR, β2AR is ubiquitinated in an agonist- and β-arrestin-dependent manner (15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Interestingly, receptor ubiquitination is not crucial for its internalization but is essential for proper trafficking to lysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, β2AR internalization requires the agonist-promoted ubiquitin modification of the adaptor protein β-arrestin2 catalyzed by a RING domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 (15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It is now evident that G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin binding promote internalization of numerous GPCRs. Furthermore, recently developed fluorescent-tagged β-arrestins have aided in visualizing the translocation of cytosolic β-arrestins to activated receptors at the cell surface using confocal microscopy (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). By employing such methods, two distinct patterns of β-arrestin trafficking within the cell have been delineated resulting in the classification of GPCRs as follows: class A (e.g. β2AR, α1b-adrenergic receptor, μ opioid receptor, endothelin 1A, and dopamine D1A receptors), where β-arrestin interacts with the receptor at the cell surface but does not endocytose into vesicles, thus showing a transient interaction with the receptor; and class B (e.g. vasopressin receptor V2, angiotensin AT1a, neurotensin 1, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and neurokinin NK-1 receptors), in which β-arrestins and receptor traffic together from the cell membrane to endocytic vesicles (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These two classes of receptor also differ with regard to their affinity for different β-arrestin isoforms. Class A receptors preferentially bind β-arrestin2, whereas class B receptors bind to β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 with equal affinity. We now report that the distinct intracellular trafficking patterns of β-arrestin with the two classes of receptors are a function of the differing pattern of β-arrestin ubiquitination and deubiquitination, which they induce. The pattern of β-arrestin ubiquitination is transient with β2AR (class A) and is sustained with V2R (class B), which parallels the intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin2 with respect to these two receptors. Moreover a β-arrestin-ubiquitin fusion protein changes the trafficking pattern such that a transient β-arrestin binder such as β2AR now shows stable β-arrestin interaction because β-arrestin-Ub and β2AR traffic together into cells and colocalize in endocytic vesicles. Our data strongly suggest that β-arrestin ubiquitination stabilizes the receptor-β-arrestin complex and that the intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin is determined by its ubiquitination status.

The plasmids pcDNA3-β-arrestin2-Ub and pEYFPC1-β-arrestin2-Ub were constructed as follows. A 1250-bp DNA fragment encoding β-arrestin2 was amplified to contain 5′-KpnI-HindIII and 3′-SalI ends; a 240-bp DNA fragment encoding ubiquitin was amplified to contain 5′-SalI and 3′-XbaI ends. The two fragments were ligated together with pcDNA3 with HindIII andXbaI ends to obtain β-arrestin2-Ub expression plasmid. A 1500-bp DNA fragment encoding β-arrestin2-Ub was subcloned into theKpnI and ApaI sites of pEYFPC1 vector to obtain the expression plasmid for YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin streptomycin and transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent. HEK cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent. To detect ubiquitinated β-arrestin2, β-arrestin2 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells or HEK-293 cells. Cells were serum starved for at least 2 h and then stimulated or not for the stipulated times with the appropriate agonists. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μm benzaminidine, and 10 mm NEM. Soluble extracts were mixed with FLAG M2 affinity beads and rotated at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding was eliminated by repeated washes with lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with sample buffer containing SDS. The proteins were separated on a gradient gel (4–20%, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using SuperSignal® West Pico reagent (Pierce). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with YFP-β-arrestin2 or YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub. Prior to labeling with isotope, the cells were washed twice with methionine/cysteine-free medium and incubated in this medium for 10 min. Cells were incubated with radiolabel solution (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 300 μCi/ml 35S) for 20 min at 37 °C, after which the cells were washed three times with regular medium and incubated in medium for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h at 37 °C. At the end of incubation at each time point, the cells were lysed in glycerol lysis buffer (above), and immunoprecipitations of both constructs were done with either GFP beads (n = 2) or using A1CT antibody (n = 1). FLAG or HA epitope-tagged receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells in 12-well dishes were treated with or without agonist for 30 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Cell surface receptors were labeled with M1 FLAG or 12CA5 monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG as secondary antibody. Receptor internalization was quantified as loss of cell surface receptors as measured by flow cytometry (flow cytometry facility, Duke University). Degradation assays were done with [125I](−)iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) radioligand binding as reported before (15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) on whole cells gently resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Binding was performed in triplicate with 400 pm [125I]CYP in the presence or absence of the hydrophobic antagonist propranolol (10 μm, to define nonspecific binding). Binding was terminated by rapid dilution and filtration on Whatman GFC glass fiber filters. For degradation assays incubation was at 30 °C for 30 min, and the receptor number (total specific [125I]CYP binding sites) was determined after 24 h of isoproterenol treatment and expressed as percent of receptor number assessed in nonstimulated cells. HEK-293 cells have a favorable morphology for examining sections of cytoplasm and nucleus simultaneously and hence were used in these experiments. HEK-293 cells on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with HA-β2AR, HA-V2R, HA-β2ARV2CT, or HA-V2Rβ2CT, along with β-arrestin2-GFP, YFP-β-arrestin2, or YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub. 24 h post-transfection cells were plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom plates. Cells were starved for at least 2 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For visualizing HA-tagged receptors, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton® X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min and incubated at room temperature with 12CA5 antibody at 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Texas Red, followed this. Antibody incubations were done for 1 h followed by repeated washes using phosphate-buffered saline. Cells expressing low and equivalent levels of the fluorescent proteins were selected carefully to examine YFP-β-arrestins. Confocal images were obtained on Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using dual excitation (488, 568 nm) and emission (515–540 nm GFP, YFP; 590–610 nm, Texas Red) filter sets. Live images were acquired using a heated (37 °C) microscope stage and collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm). Stimulation of β2AR in COS-7 cells with the agonist isoproterenol can lead to robust ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 at about 1 min after agonist treatment (Fig, 1A, left panel, and Ref. 15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). However, this ubiquitination signal diminishes within 15 min. In contrast, stimulation of either V2 vasopressin receptors or angiotensin AT1a receptor leads to a stable ubiquitination pattern (Fig. 1B, left panel, and data not shown). With these receptors β-arrestin2 is ubiquitinated robustly within 1 min, but the signal does not diminish at 15 min. Interestingly β-arrestin2 is mostly polyubiquitinated (attachment of the first ubiquitin to the substrate lysine followed by formation of a polyubiquitin chain on the first ubiquitin) or possibly multiubiquitinated (ubiquitination of substrate at several lysines). Similar agonist-stimulated ubiquitination patterns were also observed for the β-arrestin1 isoform with the aforementioned receptors (not shown). Identical ubiquitination time courses for β-arrestin with the above receptors were seen in yet another cell system, namely, HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1,A and B, right panels). In addition, we found a higher level of basal ubiquitination in some experiments when the receptors were overexpressed. A striking correlation can be drawn between ubiquitination and intracellular trafficking patterns of β-arrestins with β2AR and V2R. As shown in Fig. 1, C andD, GFP-β-arrestin2 (green, top row) is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells. The receptors (red, middle row) are seen at the plasma membrane. Within 1 min of respective stimuli, β-arrestin2 translocates to the plasma membrane in both cases. However, at 15 min after stimulation, in the case of β2AR, the receptor alone is seen in the endocytic vesicles, with the β-arrestin still at the plasma membrane, whereas in the case of V2R both β-arrestin and receptor are seen colocalized in endocytic vesicles (yellow,bottom row). Thus, the ubiquitination and deubiquitination time course of β-arrestin parallel its association with and dissociation from the two types of receptor. The differing affinity of a class Aversus a class B GPCR for β-arrestin has been attributed to the phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases of specific serine clusters in the tail region of the GPCR (18Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Moreover, the exchange of the cytoplasmic tail residues between the two receptor classes leads to reversal of the patterns of β-arrestin affinity for the receptors as well as intracellular trafficking (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a chimeric β2ARV2CT with the first 341 amino acids of the β2AR (Met1–Cys341) fused to the last 29 amino acids of the V2R (Ala343–Ser371) interacts with β-arrestin more stably, and hence after 15 min of isoproterenol stimulation, both the receptor and β-arrestin are colocalized in endosomes. On the other hand the chimera V2Rβ2CT, which contains the first 342 amino acids of the V2R (Met1–Cys342) fused to the last 72 amino acids of the β2AR (Leu342–Leu413) shows the transient β-arrestin binding pattern of the β2AR, and hence β-arrestin remains at the plasma membrane, and receptor alone traffics to endosomes (Fig. 2B). If the ability of β-arrestin to remain ubiquitinated is dependent on its interaction with the GPCR, one might expect that the receptor cytoplasmic tail residues would govern the pattern of ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, we determined the agonist-promoted ubiquitination patterns of β-arrestin for the 2 chimeric receptors. As shown in Fig. 2C, a 1-min isoproterenol stimulation of COS-7 cells (left) or HEK-293 cells (right) expressing β2ARV2CT leads to a marked increase in β-arrestin ubiquitination which does not decrease at 15 min. In marked contrast, the stimulation of the chimera V2Rβ2CT leads to a very robust increase in ubiquitination at 1 min of AVP treatment, but the signal returns to almost basal levels at 15 min (Fig. 2D). These results, together with the data shown in Fig. 1, strongly suggest that the ubiquitinated form of β-arrestin corresponds to the receptor-bound β-arrestin complex. Our data suggest that β-arrestin2 translocates to the plasma membrane and becomes ubiquitinated within 1 min of GPCR stimulation but is deubiquitinated with differing kinetics depending upon the receptor. However, it is unknown whether deubiquitination is a cause or consequence of β-arrestin dissociation from the receptor. We theorized that fusion of a ubiquitin moiety to the β-arrestin protein would provide a persistently ubiquitinated form of β-arrestin. If β-arrestin2 deubiquitination was the trigger for dissociation from the class A receptor, then we would expect that the chimeric protein would not dissociate from the receptor and would show tighter binding to the class A receptor than wild type β-arrestin because it cannot be efficiently deubiquitinated. On the other hand, if deubiquitination of β-arrestin occurs after its dissociation from the receptor then there should be no alterations in β-arrestin-Ub binding or in its dissociation kinetics. Because ubiquitinated proteins are substrates for proteasomal degradation (19Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar), we tested the stability of a β-arrestin-Ub chimeric protein. A comparison of the half-lives of YFP-β-arrestin2 and YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub is shown in Fig.3A. Wild type β-arrestin2 has a half-life of about 10–12 h in COS-7 cells as determined by35S metabolic labeling. Not surprisingly, fusion of ubiquitin in frame to β-arrestin decreased its half-life to about 2 h (Fig. 3A). Nonetheless the chimeric protein could be over-expressed in sufficient amounts to be detected by antibody to both β-arrestin (not shown) and YFP (Fig. 3, B andC). Several research groups including ours have demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation (in the presence or absence of chemical cross-linking reagents) of β-arrestin2 with β2AR. However, under such experimental conditions only a modest increase of the protein interaction is observed upon agonist treatment. In contrast, as assessed by confocal microscopy with YFP- or GFP-tagged β-arrestin, within a few seconds of isoproterenol treatment, one can observe a major portion of the cytosolic β-arrestin move to the plasma membrane and colocalize with the receptor. If β-arrestin ubiquitination contributes to the stability of the GPCR-β-arrestin interaction, then coimmunoprecipitation done under conditions that preserve the ubiquitination of β-arrestin, such as treatment with NEM (which inactivates deubiquitinating enzymes; see Ref. 20Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) should result in a considerable increase in the amount of β-arrestin that coprecipitates with the receptor. This indeed is the case as shown in Fig. 3B, which compares the amount of β-arrestin that is coimmunoprecipitated with β2AR in the presence and absence of NEM. The laddering of bands as detected by the antibody to YFP-β-arrestin represents the multimerized as well as ubiquitinated forms of the β-arrestin protein. NEM treatment produced identical receptor-β-arrestin complexes in coimmunoprecipitations done in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3C). Note that these bands are not detectable at 15 min of agonist treatment with the wild type YFP-β-arrestin2 but are detectable with the chimeric protein, YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub. This is probably because the chimeric protein is not efficiently deubiquitinated as is the wild type and hence is detectable as the receptor-bound form of β-arrestin2. The 90 kDa band that corresponds to monoubiquitinated YFP-β-arrestin2 is indicated in Fig. 3B. To determine whether β-arrestin-Ub chimeric protein influences its trafficking we utilized confocal microscopy to examine the fluorescent proteins in live cells. Fig. 4Aillustrates the trafficking of wild type YFP-β-arrestin2 in HEK-293 cells transiently overexpressing β2AR. In unstimulated cells, YFP-β-arrestin2 is distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm. Within 2 min of isoproterenol treatment, β-arrestin is seen to concentrate at the plasma membrane. The distribution of YFP-β-arrestin is unaltered at 30 min of isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 4A, upper panels). The punctate fluorescence of YFP-β-arrestin2 at the membrane is probably because of its localization in clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. A cytosolic distribution of YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub in unstimulated and plasma membrane localization in 2-min stimulated cells are shown in Fig. 4A, lower panels. However, at 15 min, YFP-β-arrestin-Ub is seen to redistribute from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles. Longer agonist treatment results in a further increase in number as well as size of YFP-β-arrestin-Ub-containing endocytic vesicles. V2Rβ2CT is a chimeric receptor in which the class B pattern of trafficking and ubiquitination is converted to that of a class A receptor (Fig. 2, B and D). Stimulation of V2Rβ2CT with AVP leads to the redistribution of YFP-β-arrestin2 to the plasma membrane in a punctate pattern like the β2AR (Fig. 4B, upper panels) at 2 min. The YFP-β-arrestin2 remains at the plasma membrane at longer time points. On the other hand, YFP-β-arrestin-Ub, which translocates to the plasma membrane within 2 min of agonist, moves into endocytic vesicles as early as 15 min of AVP treatment (Fig. 4B,lower panels). The addition of tail residues of β2AR (class A) to V2R (class B) confers class A trafficking pattern to the V2Rβ2CT chimeric receptor. As a further step, overexpression of YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub reverts the trafficking pattern back to that of class B. Thus a “double reversal” of β-arrestin trafficking pattern is seen with respect to V2Rβ2CT. To determine whether the YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub in endocytic vesicles colocalizes with the GPCR, we examined the distribution of both β2AR and β-arrestin after 15 min of isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 5). In unstimulated cells receptor is seen at the plasma membrane, and either YFP-β-arrestin or YFP-β-arrestin-Ub is seen uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Stimulation of cells with isoproterenol for 15 min resulted in the redistribution of β2AR (red) and YFP-β-arrestin2 (green) into small puncta at the plasma membrane, which likely represent colocalization of β2AR and YFP-β-arrestin in clathrin-coated pits at the membrane (Fig. 5A). Internalized receptors, seen asred vesicles in the cytoplasm, do not, however, contain any YFP-β-arrestin2, suggesting that β-arrestin2 dissociates from the receptor during or shortly after vesicle formation. Fig. 5Bshows the distribution of β2AR and YFP-β-arrestin2-Ub after 15 min of isoproterenol treatment. In contrast to what was seen with wild type YFP-β-arrestin2, the YFP-β-arrestin-Ub chimera is seen to colocalize with the internalized β2AR. Further, very little staining of either protein is seen at the plasma membrane. Thus, a ubiquitinated form of β-arrestin2 can transform a class A receptor such as the β2AR into a class B receptor with respect to its pattern of internalization. Because β-arrestin2-Ub can form stable complexes with β2AR, we tested whether this interaction had any effect on agonist-stimulated receptor internalization. As shown Fig. 6A, β2AR internalization, as measured in HEK-293 cells after a 30-min isoproterenol treatment, was 25 ± 1.8%. Upon overexpression of β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin2-Ub the internalization increased to 33 ± 1.6% and 44 ± 3.5%, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with 200 μm monodansylcadaverine, a known inhibitor of receptor movement to clathrin-coated pits (21Phonphok Y. Rosenthal K.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), reduced this internalization by 58% (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the β-arrestin-Ub promoted internalization proceeds via clathrin-coated vesicles. Overexpression of β-arrestin-Ub did not, however, result in a similar enhancement of internalization of V2R over wild type β-arrestin as measured after 30 min of AVP stimulation (Fig. 6B). This result is expected because the ubiquitination of β-arrestin is stable with this receptor. A short term isoproterenol treatment of cells expressing β2AR results in a decrease in the number of cell surface receptors without changing total cellular receptor levels. However, prolonged exposure to isoproterenol, for hours or days, results in a decline in the total receptor number, measurable by radioligand binding. In HEK-293 cells, after 24 h of isoproterenol treatment, overexpressed β2AR levels decrease by about 25% (Fig.7A). The amount of degradation increased with β-arrestin overexpression by about 6–7%. On the other hand, the amount of receptor degradation was doubled when β-arrestin2-Ub was coexpressed with the receptor. For comparison, we measured the degradation of the β2ARV2CT chimera, which essentially mimics the properties of V2R with respect to endocytosis. However, no change in the degradation of β2ARV2CT was observed with β-arrestin2-Ub overexpression (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that the ubiquitination status of β-arrestin influences both the rate at which a given receptor is sequestered from the plasma membrane as well as the likelihood that it will be sorted to lysosomes. Binding of β-arrestins to activated receptors leads to homologous receptor desensitization as well as to the recruitment of specialized endocytic machinery to internalize receptors. Recently, we have shown that both β-arrestin and the β2AR undergo agonist-dependent ubiquitination (15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast α-factor receptor, ubiquitination appears to serve as an internalization signal (9Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, β2AR ubiquitination, which requires β-arrestin as an adaptor to recruit ubiquitination enzymes, is necessary for targeting of the receptors to lysosomes for degradation rather than for their internalization. Interestingly, β-arrestin ubiquitination catalyzed by Mdm2, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for β2AR internalization. The β2AR and the V2R are seven-membrane-spanning receptors, which typify two very different patterns of receptor trafficking and β-arrestin interaction. Importantly, β2AR stimulation leads to a transient pattern of β-arrestin ubiquitination, whereas V2R stimulation leads to stable β-arrestin ubiquitination, which parallels the intracellular trafficking interaction of β-arrestin with these two receptors. Exchanging the C-terminal domains of these two receptors reverses the ubiquitination patterns of β-arrestin. Agonist stimulation of the β2AR leads to the recruitment of β-arrestin to the cell membrane within a few seconds, where it gets ubiquitinated. β2ARs then move to clathrin-coated pits and are internalized into vesicles within 15 min. This event is accompanied by the dissociation of β-arrestin from the receptor after its deubiquitination. This order of events is supported by the experiments done with a chimeric β-arrestin with ubiquitin fused to its C terminus. Stimulation of the β2AR with isoproterenol leads to the redistribution of this chimera to the plasma membrane where it colocalizes with the receptor. However, unlike its wild type counterpart, the ubiquitin chimera does not dissociate from the receptor but is seen to colocalize with the receptor in endocytic vesicles. If deubiquitination occurred after β-arrestin dissociation, the ubiquitin chimera would have nevertheless dissociated from the receptor. Thus, stable ubiquitination forces β-arrestin to move into endocytic vesicles with the receptor. However, this movement could also be the result of its tighter association with the receptor as seen in the coimmunoprecipitation experiments done in the presence of inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes. Thus, our data indicate that when β-arrestin interacts with a class A receptor it is prone to deubiquitination by an unknown mechanism, and this causes it to dissociate from the receptor at the plasma membrane. The reason for sustained ubiquitination with a class B receptor is not known. Previously, we found that inhibiting β-arrestin ubiquitination either by use of a dominant negative form of its E3 ligase Mdm2 or by using Mdm2-null cell lines did not inhibit degradation of the β2AR. However, in the present work, a persistently ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 is observed to be associated with not only more robust β2AR sequestration but also increased receptor degradation. How can these two sets of observations be reconciled? Previous findings suggest that very slow rates of β2AR sequestration can support robust receptor degradation, especially as monitored at late time points such as 24 h of agonist exposure (15Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It appears that even the small amount of receptor sequestration remaining when we inhibit β-arrestin ubiquitination is likely sufficient to support receptor degradation. On the other hand, in the presence of the β-arrestin-Ub chimera the β2ARs sequester more robustly and do not recycle readily. As noted above, this is now typical of a class B receptor rather than the normal class A receptor behavior of the β2AR. Our data suggest that such non- or slowly recycling β2ARs may be more subject to entry into degradative pathways and hence show increased down-regulation. In other words, the persistently ubiquitinated β-arrestin likely fundamentally alters the relationship between the rate of receptor sequestration and the ultimate down-regulation of the receptor. Presumably, the presence of ubiquitinated β-arrestin in complex with internalized receptors somehow leads to more efficient sorting of these internalized receptors to lysosomes. Whether this is the result of inhibition of receptor dephosphorylating enzymes, blocking the interaction of recycling proteins such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) (22Cong M.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or some other mechanism remains to be determined. Our data thus reveal an interesting and previously unappreciated connection between the ubiquitin modification of β-arrestin2 and its trafficking pattern with distinct types of receptors. Recently, ubiquitination of adaptor proteins has been implicated as a trigger for downstream signaling pathways (25Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). It was shown that stimulation of interleukin-1 receptors leads to recruitment, dimerization, and auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6 at the membrane, which in turn triggers the kinase TAK1, which can phosphorylate Iκβ kinase and MKK6 leading to the activation of nuclear factor-κB and JNK-p38 kinase pathways (25Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). We have observed that agonist stimulation of receptors such as angiotensin AT1a and vasopressin V2 lead to sustained ubiquitination of β-arrestins. These receptors, when activated, are also known to engage pools of β-arrestin and active ERK complexes in the cytoplasm (26Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Whether β-arrestin ubiquitination forms a foundation for scaffolding of these signaling complexes on endosomes is another tantalizing question for future research.

https://openalex.org/W2034131948,"We targeted 266 CAG repeats (a number that causes infantile-onset disease) into the mouse Sca7 locus to generate an authentic model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). These mice reproduced features of infantile SCA7 (ataxia, visual impairments, and premature death) and showed impaired short-term synaptic potentiation; downregulation of photoreceptor-specific genes, despite apparently normal CRX activity, led to shortening of photoreceptor outer segments. Wild-type ataxin-7 was barely detectable, as was mutant ataxin-7 in young animals; with increasing age, however, ataxin-7 staining became more pronounced. Neurons that appeared most vulnerable had relatively high levels of mutant ataxin-7; it is interesting, however, that marked dysfunction occurred in these neurons weeks prior to the appearance of nuclear inclusions. These data demonstrate that glutamine expansion stabilizes mutant ataxin-7, provide an explanation for selective neuronal vulnerability, and show that mutant ataxin-7 impairs posttetanic potentiation (PTP)."

Thus, down-regulation of ErbB2 signaling has emerged as a new anti-cancer strategy.

The CHIP U-box mutant H260Q reduced 17-AAG-induced ErbB2 ubiquitinylation. Wild type ErbB2 and a mutant incapable of association with Cbl (ErbB2 Y1112F) were equally sensitive to CHIP and 17-AAG, implying that Cbl does not play a major role in geldanamycin-induced ErbB2 down-regulation. Both endogenous and ectopically expressed CHIP and ErbB2 coimmunoprecipitated with each other, and this association was enhanced by 17-AAG.

ErbB2 is a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, which also includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFRepidermal growth factor (EGF) receptorCHIPcarboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting proteinGAgeldanamycin17-AAG17-allylamino-geldanamycinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHRPhorseradish peroxidaseIPimmunoprecipitateAbantibodyE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2 or Ubcubiquitin-conjugating enzymeRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay buffer/ErbB1), ErbB3, and ErbB4. The members of this receptor tyrosine kinase family play key roles in normal cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration and have emerged as important contributing factors in tumorigenesis (1Klapper L.N.

ErbB2 overexpression, found in nearly a third of breast cancer patients as well as in other cancers, is associated with poor responsiveness to conventional therapy and shorter relapse-free survival, validating ErbB2 as a molecular target for therapy through attenuation of ErbB2 signaling (2Hynes N.E.

Recent studies have focused on the role of ErbB receptor ubiquitinylation, mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Cbl, as a crucial mechanism to control ErbB receptor sorting to the lysosome. Upon EGF stimulation, EGFR associates with Cbl and undergoes ubiquitinylation, which facilitates its lysosomal sorting and eventual degradation (3Waterman H. Yarden Y.

In contrast, ErbB2 activated by heregulin (through heterodimer formation with ErbB3/4) fails to interact with Cbl and is inefficiently ubiquitinylated (9Lenferink A.E.

Furthermore, ErbB2 heterodimerized with other ErbB family members also avoids the lysosomal fate and is preferentially recycled, accounting for its enhanced signaling potency (9Lenferink A.E.

Importantly, the therapeutic anti-ErbB2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin™) induces an ErbB2-Cbl interaction, which results in ErbB2 ubiquitinylation and degradation (14Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M.

These findings highlight the potential use of ubiquitin ligase-mediated ErbB2 down-regulation as a therapeutic strategy in ErbB2-overexpressing cancers. It has been demonstrated that treatment of breast and other cancer cell lines with ansamycin antibiotics such as geldanamycin (GA) depletes the cell surface ErbB2 via ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation (16Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar,17Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol.

The effect of GA on ErbB2 is apparently not mediated by Cbl, since EGFR, a Cbl target, is GA-resistant. Furthermore, ErbB2 kinase activity is dispensable for GA action, whereas the kinase activity is required for Cbl-mediated EGFR or ErbB2 ubiquitinylation (16Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These findings point to the existence of a novel ubiquitin ligase machinery that could be recruited to attenuate ErbB2 signaling. To date, however, the identity of such an ubiquitin ligase remains unknown. Previous studies reveal that GA is a specific inhibitor of the molecular chaperone Hsp90, suggesting that Hsp90 is required for mature ErbB2 stability (21Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Indeed, mature ErbB2 is associated with Hsp90, and GA treatment leads to the disassociation of Hsp90 from ErbB2, with concomitant recruitment of Hsp70 (21Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that GA treatment leads to remodeling of the ErbB2-associated chaperone complex, resulting in the recruitment of a ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitinylation of ErbB2. Recent studies identify a co-chaperone protein, CHIP (carboxyl terminusHsc70-interacting protein) (Fig.2A), whose three tetratricopeptide repeats bind to Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90, whereas its carboxyl-terminal U-box domain associates with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc), thus satisfying the requirements of a chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase (22Ballinger C.A.

Importantly, CHIP has been demonstrated to negatively regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90 function and convert Hsp90 complexes from a chaperone function to one that promotes the ubiquitinylation and degradation of client proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (23Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here we investigated if CHIP serves as an ErbB2-directed ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that CHIP associates with ErbB2in vivo and that wild type CHIP, but not its U-box mutant, induces ErbB2 ubiquitinylation and down-regulation. CHIP also enhances the effects of GA treatment, and the U-box mutant of CHIP inhibits GA-induced ErbB2 ubiquitinylation. Together with results published by Neckers and co-workers while this paper was under review (27Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One-mg aliquots of cell lysate proteins were incubated with 50 μg of GST or GST-Cbl-N fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed 5 times with cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting. CHIP- or vector-transfected SKBR-3 cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and then incubated in the same buffer with 400 μg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) for 40 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in pre-warmed medium with 100 nm 17-AAG or Me2SO control for the indicated times before lysis. Anti-ErbB2 immunoprecipitates (IPs) of the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Densitometry of ErbB2 bands was carried out using the Scion Images for WindowsTM software (Version beta3b, Frederick, MD), and the data were expressed as a percentage of the signals obtained with untreated cells. The GST-CHIP and GST-Cbl fusion proteins were affinity-purified from Escherichia colilysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads, eluted with reduced glutathione, and stored at −80 °C. 5-μg aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized fusion protein were incubated with purified E1 (20 nm) (Calbiochem), E2 (200 nm) (UbcH5a; Calbiochem), biotin-labeled ubiquitin (2 μg/ml) (AFFINITI Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, UK), 5 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm magnesium chloride in a 50-μl reaction for 90 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium chloride and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium chloride, and 2 mm ATP to remove any bacterial heat shock proteins and associated proteins (26Demand J.

The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and the ubiquitinylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with streptavidin-HRP. For in vitro ErbB2 ubiquitinylation, anti-ErbB2 IPs from 500-μg aliquots of SKBR-3 cell lysate were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated with 5 μg of the indicated soluble GST fusion proteins, 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 μg/ml biotin-labeled ubiquitin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP in a 50-μl reaction for 90 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed and processed for detection of ubiquitinylated proteins as above. Ansamycin antibiotics, such as GA, specifically bind to Hsp90 and inhibit its ATPase activity (18Neckers L.

Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevented 17-AAG-induced loss of ErbB2 (Fig. 1, middle and bottom panels). Furthermore, 17-AAG treatment induced the ubiquitinylation of ErbB2, as revealed by anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting of ErbB2 IPs, and MG-132 treatment markedly enhanced the ubiquitinylation signal (Fig. 1, top left panels, compare lane 1 with lane 2 andlane 3 with lane 4; top right panel, compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 3with lane 4).

Purified CHIP could readily auto-ubiquitinylate itself in vitro in the presence of purified E1, E2, ubiquitin, and ATP, whereas a CHIP mutant lacking the U-box domain was completely inactive (Fig.2B), and the point mutation of an invariant histidine in the U-box domain, corresponding to a conserved RING finger domain histidine residue crucial for E2 binding, greatly reduced the auto-ubiquitinylation activity (32Hatakeyama S.

Biol. 2000; 10: 132-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To assess if recombinant CHIP could function as a ubiquitin ligase toward ErbB2, ErbB2 immunopurified from SKBR-3 cells was incubated with purified CHIP fusion proteins, ubiquitin, and ATP in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Relatively little in vitro ErbB2 ubiquitinylation was observed in the absence of CHIP or ErbB2 (Fig.2C). Inclusion of recombinant wild type CHIP in the reaction resulted in a marked increase in the level of ubiquitinylated ErbB2 (Fig. 2C, lane 5). In contrast, little or no increase in ErbB2 ubiquitinylation was observed with the CHIP U-box domain mutants ΔU-box or H260Q (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). The relative specificity of CHIP-induced ErbB2 ubiquitinylation was shown by the relatively modest ubiquitinylation of ErbB2 by GST-Cbl (Fig. 2D), whereas GST-Cbl efficiently induced the ubiquitinylation of EGFR (data not shown). These in vitro studies showed that CHIP could function as a ubiquitin ligase toward ErbB2, suggesting the possibility that CHIP may regulate ErbB2 turnover in vivo. To assess the effect of CHIP on ErbB2 turnover in vivo, we cotransfected ErbB2 and Myc-tagged CHIP into 293T cells and examined the overall levels of ErbB2 with or without 17-AAG treatment. Coexpression of CHIP led to a slight reduction in the level of ErbB2 in the absence of 17-AAG treatment (Fig.3A, lane 3). Furthermore, CHIP overexpression modestly augmented the reduction in ErbB2 protein levels induced by 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Previous analyses have identified the role of Cbl, a RING finger domain ubiquitin ligase, in ErbB2 down-regulation induced by anti-ErbB2 antibodies or by EGF-induced heterodimerization with EGFR; the phosphorylated Tyr-1112 in ErbB2 serves as the Cbl-binding site in the context of antibody-mediated ErbB2 down-regulation (14Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3384-3388PubMed Google Scholar,15Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Harari D. Lavi S. Sela M. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

Notably, the ability of 17-AAG and/or CHIP to induce the loss of ErbB2 protein was unaltered by the Y1112F mutation (Fig. 3A,lanes 7 and 8). That the Y1112F mutation indeed abrogated the ability of ErbB2 to interact with Cbl was demonstrated by a pull-down assay using lysates of ErbB2-transfected 293T cells stimulated with the humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody HerceptinTM and the GST-Cbl-N fusion protein, which incorporates the tyrosine kinase binding domain of Cbl (29Lupher M.L.

The measured rate constants were 4.0 x 10(-6) per second in nitrogen and 4 x 10(-5) per second in argon. Calculations indicated that at this temperature the reaction proceeds from a single quantum state of the reactant so that the computed rate constant has achieved a temperature-independent limit. According to calculations, the tunneling contribution to the rate is 152 orders of magnitude greater than the contribution from passage over the barrier. We discuss environmental effects of the solid-state inert-gas matrix on the reaction rate."
https://openalex.org/W2023140943,"The exocyst (Sec6/8) complex is necessary for secretion in yeast and has been postulated to establish polarity by directing vesicle fusion to specific sites along the plasma membrane. The complex may also function in the nervous system, but its precise role is unknown. We have investigated exocyst function in Drosophila with mutations in one member of the complex, sec5. Null alleles die as growth-arrested larvae, whose neuromuscular junctions fail to expand. In culture, neurite outgrowth fails in sec5 mutants once maternal Sec5 is exhausted. Using a trafficking assay, we found impairments in the membrane addition of newly synthesized proteins. In contrast, synaptic vesicle fusion was not impaired. Thus, Sec5 differentiates between two forms of vesicle trafficking: trafficking for cell growth and membrane protein insertion depend on sec5, whereas transmitter secretion does not. In this regard, sec5 differs from the homologs of other yeast exocytosis genes that are required for both neuronal trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2034517872,"After a period of deflation during the 1991-1993 flank eruption, Mount Etna underwent a rapid inflation. Seismicity and ground deformation show that since 1994, a huge volume of magma intruded beneath the volcano, producing from 1998 onward a series of eruptions at the summit and on the flank of the volcano. The last of these, started on 27 October 2002, is still in progress and can be considered one of the most explosive eruptions of the volcano in recent times. Here we show how geodetic data and seismic deformation, between 1994 and 2001, indicate a radial compression around an axial intrusion, consistent with a repressurization of Mount Etna's plumbing system at a depth of 6 to 15 kilometers, which triggered most of the seismicity and provoked the dilatation of the volcano and the recent explosive eruptive activity."

To further analyze such effects, we have here employed lipid-mediated delivery of recombinant TrxR1 preparations into human A549 cells, thereby bypassing selenoprotein translation to facilitate assessment of the protein-related effects on cell viability. We found that selenium-deficient TrxR1, having a two-amino acid-truncated C-terminal -Gly-Cys-COOH motif, rapidly induced cell death (38 ± 29% apoptotic cells after 4 h;p < 0.005 compared with controls). Cell death induction was also promoted by selenium-compromised TrxR1 derivatized with either cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) or dinitrophenyl moieties but not by the structurally related non-selenoprotein glutathione reductase.

All of these enzymes are selenoproteins and carry a selenocysteine (Sec) residue in a C-terminal redox active motif having the amino acid sequence -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH.

These diverse functions mainly derive from cellular actions by its main substrate, thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), which has a remarkable range of cellular activities (11Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J.

A main function of TrxR1 is hence to reduce Trx1, and many of the intracellular functions held by reduced Trx1 are known to promote cell viability.

The potential importance of TrxR1 as a clinical drug target was recently reviewed (23Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In light of such studies as those referred to above, that all in essence identify the selenium-dependent TrxR1 and the thioredoxin system as important for normal cell function and viability, it is most interesting that TrxR1 has also been shown to function as a cell death-promoting factor. GRIM-12 (gene associated withretinoid interferon-inducedmortality), subsequently shown to be TrxR1, was reported to mediate the cell death effects seen in tumor cell lines treated with a combination of interferon-β and all-trans-retinoic acid (24Hofman E.R.

The identification of GRIM-12 was elegantly made by use of an antisense cDNA library expressed under control of an interferon-induced promoter in HeLa cells, screened for induced resistance to retinoid- and interferon-induced cell death, cloned inEscherichia coli and subsequently ascertained for protective effects when transfected into MCF-7 cells (24Hofman E.R.

Thus, antisense TrxR1 cDNA expression protected MCF-7 cells from cell death induced by the retinoid-interferon combination, suggesting that TrxR1 activity was a prerequisite for the cell death effect. Subsequent studies clearly indicated that the cell death was apoptotic, dependent upon wild type Trx1 and involved both caspase-8 and p53 (25Lindner D.J. Hofmann E.R. Karra S. Kalvakolanu D.V.

This reflects a need for a functional thioredoxin system in the induction of apoptosis through p53 upon treatment of cells specifically with the retinoid/interferon combination (24Hofman E.R.

We were, however, intrigued by the fact that transient transfection with TrxR1 constructs was shown to directly induce cell death in MCF-7 cells, with 25% cell death 72 h post-transfection compared with 8% in vector controls (27Hu J. Ma X. Lindner D.J. Karra S. Hofmann E.R. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4235-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or, in a subsequent study, up to 40% cell death 40 h post-transfection with similar results in T47D, COS-7, and HeLa cells (29Ma X. Karra S. Guo W. Lindner D.J. Hu J. Angell J.E. Hofmann E.R. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24843-24854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). How could this selenoprotein, hitherto considered essential for cell viability, display such potent cell death-promoting effects? Considering the well known inefficiency in the mammalian selenoprotein translation machinery, which also has been demonstrated using transfection constructs for TrxR1 (30Gasdaska J.R. Harney J.W. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25379-25385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these cell death-promoting effects of TrxR1 might have been due to the formation of truncated selenium-deficient protein species. This assumption was corroborated by the fact that the selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the 3′-untranslated region, necessary for TrxR1 selenoprotein production (2Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J.

Furthermore, selenocysteine in TrxR1 is as in all selenoproteins co-translationally inserted at a UGA codon, which normally confers termination of translation (1Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 2Zhong L. Arnér E.S.J. Ljung J. Åslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

In case of GRIM-12, this UGA codon was initially interpreted as a termination codon and replaced with a nucleotide sequence encoding a c-myc tag (24Hofman E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). That construct has, nonetheless, subsequently been utilized for transfection studies with results interpreted to show that “wild type” thioredoxin reductase may induce cell death (27Hu J. Ma X.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3210-3218PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to scrutinize whether the direct deleterious effects by TrxR1 on cell viability could specifically be attributed to selenium-compromised forms of TrxR1, we have here made use of a recently developed methodology for lipid-mediated delivery of intact proteins into mammalian cells (33Zelphati O. Wang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Felgner P.L. Corbeil J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35103-35110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This approach was chosen to avoid any production of a mixture of full-length and truncated TrxR1 that may result from inefficient selenoprotein synthesis using transfection experiments, even using constructs including the selenocysteine-encoding UGA codon and a correct mammalian selenocysteine insertion sequence element. As reported herein, we found that selenium-compromised TrxR1, either a selenium-deficient truncated form or an enzyme derivatized at the selenocysteine residue, indeed rapidly induced cell death, whereas such direct effect on viability could not be seen using the full-length selenocysteine-containing enzymatically active form of the enzyme. BioPORTER protein delivery reagent was obtained from Gene therapy systems, fetal calf serum came from Biotech Line AS, whereas Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, l-glutamine, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Invitrogen, and antibiotics came from BIO-Whittaker Belgium. GR (purified from yeast), GSSG, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), CDDP, 2′-[4-ethoxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl-1piperazinyl]-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole (Hoechst 33342), 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF), and propidium iodide came from Sigma. Recombinant selenocysteine containing TrxR1 (rTrxR1) was purified from an overproducing E. coli system as described previously (34Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and full-length TrxR1 was prepared from rTrxR1 using a recently developed technique based upon selective binding to phenyl arsine oxide-Sepharose. 2O. Rengby, L. Johansson, L. A. Carlson, E. Serini, P. Kårsnäs, and E. S. J. Arnér, manuscript in preparation. For fluorescence labeling, Alexa (Molecular Probes) or 5-IAF was conjugated to TrxR1 by prior reduction of rTrxR1 (1 μg/μl) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA with the addition of 11 μl of 40 mm dithiothreitol in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 1 μl of 80 mm 5-IAF and incubation for an additional 2 h at 20 °C. This reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 100 mm GSH. For DNCB derivatization (35Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), rTrxR (100 μg ≈ 1.8 nmol subunit) was preincubated with NADPH (250 nmol) 30 min at 20 °C in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, whereupon 0.5 μl of 340 mmDNCB in ethanol was added, and derivatization was allowed for 20 min at 20 °C, hence producing dnp-TrxR1. Preparation of a DNCB control followed the same procedure as the preparation of dnp-TrxR1, except for excluding rTrxR from the reaction. CDDP-TrxR1 was prepared by incubating 20 μm rTrxR1 with 100 μm CDDP in Me2SO in the presence of 1 mm NADPH in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, for 20 min at 20 °C. The CDDP control was prepared by the same procedure without the addition of enzyme. To separate CDDP-TrxR1, fluorescent TrxR1, or dnp-TrxR1 from reductants, co-factor, and unbound electrophilic reactant, the derivatized enzyme samples were run on Fast desalting PC 3.2/10 columns equilibrated with 50 mmTris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, using the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method according to protocol from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as standard. The DNCB and CDDP controls were subjected to the same desalting procedures, with the fractions corresponding to the enzyme fractions used for the control cell experiments using equivalent volumes. To confirm labeling of TrxR1 with 5-IAF, it was also analyzed on a Tris-Cl SDS-PAGE gradient 8–16% gel, and fluorescent protein was detected by exposure of the gel to UV light. The TrxR1 activities of different preparations were determined using the standard DTNB assay (36Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activity was determined as described previously (35Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) by following A 340 in a reaction mixture with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 200 μm NADPH using 2.55 μm enzyme. The activity of GR was determined following the initial linear decrease ofA 340 in a 500-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADPH, and 2 mm GSSG. The NADPH oxidase activity of GR was determined according to the same protocol as for TrxR1. A549 (human lung carcinoma) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The cells were seeded in LabTec II chamber slides (0.7 cm2/well) (Nunc, Denmark) 24 h before incubation with BioPORTER, which was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol, briefly described as follows. Chloroform (250 μl) was used to dissolve the driedBioPORTER reagent present in one tube as delivered (catalog number BP502401; Gene Therapy Systems), which was vortexed 20 s and added in aliquots (2.5 μl) to the bottom of Eppendorf tubes, whereupon the tubes were left open in a hood to evaporate the chloroform. For our initial experiments, different quantities of each TrxR1 preparation (0.1–100 ng) were diluted in PBS to a final volume of 15 μl and were used to hydrate the aliquots with dryBioPORTER reagent by incubation for 5 min at 20 °C. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4, only 100 ng of the TrxR1 preparations and 350 ng of GR were used in each assay. Each tube was then briefly vortexed before the addition of serum free cell medium to a final volume of 250 μl. This medium preparation withBioPORTER/TrxR1 was added to the cells grown in chamber slides (10,000 cells/well), which had first been washed once with serum-free medium. The cells were subsequently incubated for 4 h at 37 °C before microscopy assessment. The cells were washed three times with PBS prior to microscopy with a power Leica DMRB microscope equipped with Fluotar PL 10X and Fluotar PL 20× objectives with filters for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), rhodamine, and fluorescein isothiocyanate. A Hamamatsu digital camera 4742-95 was used to obtain the microscopic images. Cells treated with 5-IAF-TrxR1 or Alexa-labeled TrxR were subjected to bright field and fluorescein isothiocyanate-filtered images, whereas assessment of viability was performed with bright field, DAPI (for Hoechst staining), and rhodamine (for propidium iodide staining) filters. For staining, the cells washed in PBS were first incubated for 15 min 20 °C with Hoechst 33342 dye (5 μg/ml in PBS), whereupon propidium iodide was added (50 μg/ml from 5 mg/ml stock in PBS), and then the cells were incubated for an additional period of 5 min. Cell morphology was assessed as follows. Viable cells were considered to have Hoechst-stained normal-sized smooth nuclei without red propidium iodide staining, whereas cells having red-stained nuclei with either multiple bright specks of fragmented chromatin or one or more spheres of condensed chromatin with more compact nuclei than normal were judged to be apoptotic, and necrotic cells had red-stained smooth nuclei of roughly the same size as viable cells. The aim of this study was to introduce different forms of TrxR1 into mammalian cells and study effects on cell viability. As mentioned in the Introduction, use of a novel lipid-mediated delivery system (33Zelphati O. Wang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Felgner P.L. Corbeil J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35103-35110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), commercially available under the brand name BioPORTER, would bypass inefficiencies in selenoprotein translation and thereby open the possibility to study isolated effects of the selenium-containing compared with selenium-compromised forms of TrxR1. We wished to introduce into cells (a) fully active selenocysteine-containing TrxR1, (b) truncated selenocysteine-deficient TrxR1, and (c) TrxR1 derivatized with DNCB. The latter yields an enzyme devoid of the Trx1 reducing capacity but with an increased NADPH oxidase activity, producing superoxide (35Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also utilized TrxR1 derivatized with the clinically used antitumor agent cisplatin, which inhibits TrxR1 activity but does not induce its inherent NADPH oxidase activity (20Arnér E.S.J. Nakamura H. Sasada T. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To have well defined preparations of TrxR1, we made use of purified recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli either using a system tailored for heterologous production of the full-length selenoprotein or a construct without a selenocysteine insertion sequence element, thereby producing the two-amino acid truncated selenium-deficient form of the enzyme (34Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, the system for production of recombinant selenoprotein results in a mixture of truncated and full-length enzyme (34Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore we have further isolated the full-length recombinant TrxR1 from the purified preparation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We also used the original preparation of rTrxR1 containing a mixture of full-length and truncated enzyme species. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of GR, which is a non-selenoprotein enzyme closely related to mammalian TrxR1 in both structure (8Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G.

https://openalex.org/W2124018615,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a key component of photosynthesis, the process of converting sunlight into the chemical energy of life. In plant cells, it forms a unique oligomeric macrostructure in membranes of the chloroplasts. Several light-harvesting antenna complexes are organized precisely in the PSII macrostructure-the major trimeric complexes (LHCII) that bind 70% of PSII chlorophyll and three minor monomeric complexes-which together form PSII supercomplexes. The antenna complexes are essential for collecting sunlight and regulating photosynthesis, but the relationship between these functions and their molecular architecture is unresolved. Here we report that antisense Arabidopsis plants lacking the proteins that form LHCII trimers have PSII supercomplexes with almost identical abundance and structure to those found in wild-type plants. The place of LHCII is taken by a normally minor and monomeric complex, CP26, which is synthesized in large amounts and organized into trimers. Trimerization is clearly not a specific attribute of LHCII. Our results highlight the importance of the PSII macrostructure: in the absence of one of its main components, another protein is recruited to allow it to assemble and function."
https://openalex.org/W2047434938,"Much uncertainty surrounds the interactions between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and long-term global change. Past periods of extreme global warmth, exemplified by the Eocene (55 to 35 million years ago), provide a good testing ground for theories for this interaction. Here, we compare Eocene coupled climate model simulations with annually resolved variability records preserved in lake sediments. The simulations show Pacific deep-ocean and high-latitude surface warming of approximately 10 degrees C but little change in the tropical thermocline structure, atmosphere-ocean dynamics, and ENSO, in agreement with proxies. This result contrasts with theories linking past and future ""hothouse"" climates with a shift toward a permanent El Niño-like state."
https://openalex.org/W1983996634,"Spinal motor neurons must extend their axons into the periphery through motor exit points (MEPs), but their cell bodies remain within spinal motor columns. It is not known how this partitioning is established in development. We show here that motor neuron somata are confined to the CNS by interactions with a neural crest subpopulation, boundary cap (BC) cells that prefigure the sites of spinal MEPs. Elimination of BC cells by surgical or targeted genetic ablation does not perturb motor axon outgrowth but results in motor neuron somata migrating out of the spinal cord by translocating along their axons. Heterologous neural crest grafts in crest-ablated embryos stop motor neuron emigration. Thus, before the formation of a mature transitional zone at the MEP, BC cells maintain a cell-tight boundary that allows motor axons to cross but blocks neuron migration."

It links the AMP moiety of ATP with the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, or its deamidated form NaMN) to form the dinucleotide product NAD (or deamido-NAD, NaAD). A practical aspect of human PNAT function is that it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the metabolic conversion of the anticancer agent tiazofurin to its active form TAD (tiazofurin adenine dinucleotide, an NAD analog) (11Cooney D.A. Jayaram H.N. Glazer R.I. Kelley J.A. Marquez V.E. Gebeyehu G. Van Cott A.C. Zwelling L.A. Johns D.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1983; 21: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The development of tiazofurin resistance has been shown to relate mainly to a decrease in PNAT activity (12Jayaram H.N. Pillwein K. Lui M.S. Faderan M.A. Weber G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been found that human nuclear PNAT (hsPNAT-1, or NMNAT-1 as in Raffaelliet al. (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L.

These structures revealed a hexameric organization of the protein and provided a structural basis for its dual specificity in recognizing both NMN and NaMN substrates (19Zhou T. Kurnasov O.

Another isoform of human PNAT, hsPNAT-2 (or NMNAT-2 as in Raffaelli et al. (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) is distinct from the nuclear PNAT-1 (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It contains 307 residues (versus279 in hsPNAT-1) and shares 34% sequence identity with the nuclear enzyme. Its tissue expression level is generally low, and it is thought to be primarily expressed in the nervous systems (25Raffaelli N. Sorci L. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Mazzola F. Magni G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of hsPNAT-2 activity is much lower compared with the nuclear form. Both human PNAT isoforms recognize NMN and NaMN substrates equally well; therefore, they are capable of participating in thede novo and salvage/recycling routes of NAD biosynthesis via either NMN or NaMN intermediates. Historically, PNAT activity has been detected in various animal tissues, including mammary gland, testis, liver, placenta, kidney, thymus, erythrocyte, lymphocyte, and retina (28Balducci E.

Quagliariello E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel human PNAT, named hsPNAT-3, which is located in the cytosol and mitochondria. Structural analysis of hsPNAT-3 and its complexes with substrates and products provided critical insight in the catalytic mechanism of the adenylyltransfer reaction, which are likely to be shared among all PNATs and some other (T/H)IGH motif-containing adenylyltransferases. The poly(A)+-RNA filters of 10 human tissues and 10 human cancer cell lines, hybridization buffer, and washing buffer were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). ThePfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Rediprime II DNA labeling kit was from Amersham Biosciences (UK). The pPROEX-1a prokaryotic expression vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The pEGFP-N1 mammalian expression vector was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The MitoTraker® Red mitochondria-specific fluorescent dye was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The TEV protease used to remove the His tag of the expressed recombinant proteins was purified in our laboratory from an expression vector kindly provided by Dr. Dave Waugh (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). The Wizard I and II crystallization screening kits were from Emerald Biostructures (Bainbridge Island, WA). The hsPNAT-3 cDNA was amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and inserted into the pPROEX prokaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). The resultant pPROEX-hsPNAT3 vector was then transformed into Escherichia coli DH10β-competent cells (Invitrogen) for protein expression. The cells were induced by adding 0.8 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when grown to A600 = 0.5–0.6 and harvested after shaking at 20 °C overnight. The clarified cell lysate was mixed with the proper amount of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound protein was eluted with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. After the elution, the protein was treated with TEV protease at 4 °C overnight to cleave the His6 tag. As the final purification step, the tag-removed protein was passed through a Mono S ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The hsPNAT-3 activity with both substrates NMN and NaMN was analyzed using a continuous assay coupling NAD formation to alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion of NAD to NADH as previously described (39Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Amici A. Magni G. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Natalini P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Kurnasov O.V.

Briefly, the assay was performed in UV-transparent plastic cuvettes in the six-cuvette autosampler of a DU-640 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) at 37 °C. The 500-μl reaction contained 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 115 mm ethanol, 40 mm semicarbazide, 2 mm ATP, 3 units of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma), and ∼0.01 μg of hsPNAT-3. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 20 mm NMN and monitored at 340 nm over a 20-min period. The NADH extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1 was used for rate calculations. One unit of enzyme was defined as capable of producing 1 μmol of NADH per minute. To measure NaMNAT activity, the procedure was modified by introducing an additional enzymatic step: conversion of NaAD to NAD by NAD synthetase (NADS, EC 6.3.5.1) (40Kurnasov O.V. Polanuyer B.M. Ananta S. Sloutsky R. Tam A. Gerdes S.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6906-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 0.3 unit of NAD synthetase from Corynebacterium glutamicum (gift from Dr. K. Shatalin, Integrated Genomics Inc.) and 10 mmNH4Cl were added to the same reaction mixture, and the reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 20 mm NaMN. The DNA template of hsPNAT-3 used for synthesizing a hybridization probe was amplified by PCR from the pPROEX-hsPNAT3 plasmid. About 25 ng of DNA was used for probe synthesis in the presence of [32P]CTP using the Rediprime II system (Amersham Biosciences). The synthesized probe was purified with a Micro Bio-spin 30 column (Bio-Rad) to remove the non-incorporated nucleotides. The two poly(A)+-RNA filters (the normal cell multiple tissue blot and multiple cancer cell line blot from Ambion) were prehybridized at 42 °C for 30 min before being hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the filters were washed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The autoradiography was set at −70 °C for 7 days. The blots were subsequently washed and rehybridized with radiolabeled β-actin probe to normalize for mRNA loading levels. HEK293 (human kidney epithelial) and HeLa cells (kind gift from Dr. Helen Yin, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX) were cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Harlan Bioproducts for Science). The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To make the C-terminal GFP fusion mammalian expression constructs for hsPNAT-1, hsPNAT-2, and hsPNAT-3, the cDNA of each of the three genes was amplified by PCR from their respective prokaryotic expression plasmids and inserted into the pEGFP-N1 mammalian expression vector (Clontech). The resultant vectors pEGFP-hsPNAT1, pEGFP-hsPNAT2, and pEGFP-hsPNAT3 were transfected into cells using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) when the cell density reached about 70% confluence. The localization of the expressed GFP fusion proteins was examined after 2-day transfection with a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope. The co-localization of hsPNAT-3 and mitochondria-specific dye was observed under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal fluorescence microscope. The hsPNAT-3 crystals were obtained using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method. 1.5 μl of hsPNAT-3 (20 mg/ml) was mixed with 1.5 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0–7.0, 200 mm Li2SO4, and 20–25% polyethylene glycol 400, and equilibrated against the reservoir. The crystals of the complexes of hsPNAT-3 with various substrates and products, including NMN, AMP-CPP, NAD, NaAD, and a ternary complex with both NMN and AMP-CPP, were obtained by co-crystallization. All crystals were directly frozen in liquid propane, and the diffraction data were collected on a RAXIS-IV image plate detector equipped with a Rigaku-H3R x-ray generator and Osmic mirrors at a temperature of 100 K. The data were processed with the HKL2000 package (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar), and the space group was later determined to be P43212 with cell dimensions a = b = 79.36 Å, and c = 146.2 Å.

Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins may also encode for PNAT (see Supplemental Material). In particular, a 252-amino acid human protein sequence (gi 14029540), termed here hsPNAT-3, shares 50% identity with hsPNAT-1 and 82% identity with a mouse protein (gi 13543122) that presumably is the mouse ortholog of hsPNAT-3. We have cloned and overexpressed hsPNAT-3 and experimentally confirmed that indeed it has the predicted adenylyltransferase activity. Like the two other isoforms, hsPNAT-3 has comparable activity with both physiological substrates (5.6 units/mg for NaMN and 4.7 units/mg for NMN at saturating concentration of either substrate). Both activities of hsPNAT-3 are lower compared with hsPNAT-1 (38 and 30 units/mg, respectively), but being ∼10-fold higher compared with hsPNAT-2. Together with the previously reported hsPNAT-1 and hsPNAT-2, three human PNAT isoenzymes are now identified. To understand the cellular and physiological roles of these different human PNATs, we studied the tissue distributions and subcellular localization of the three different hsPNATs by Northern hybridization and expression of GFP fusion proteins in cultured kidney epithelial HEK293 and HeLa cells. The overall mRNA levels of hsPNAT-3 in normal tissues and cancer cell lines were low compared with hsPNAT-1 (23Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J.

Clear hybridization bands of a 1.1-kb transcript were detected in mRNA blots of human lung and spleen, and weaker reaction bands were detected in placenta and kidney. There was almost no hybridization signal detected in all the cancer cell lines tested (data not shown). This tissue distribution pattern is different from both human PNAT-1 and PNAT-2 (23Emanuelli M.

There appears to be no overlapping in tissue distributions between the three hsPNAT isoforms, suggesting that expression of these isoenzymes are differentially controlled at transcription level and each may have a distinct cellular and physiological role. We monitored subcellular localization of the three human PNAT isoenzymes tagged with GFP and overexpressed in HEK293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). We found that GFP-hsPNAT1 is located exclusively in the nuclei (data not shown), consistent with the results from earlier immunofluorescent studies (24Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M.

Further examination of the co-localization of GFP-hsPNAT3 with the red mitochondria-specific dye showed that hsPNAT-3 is also present in mitochondria (Fig. 2A). GFP-hsPNAT2, on the other hand, is found to have a very specific localization outside nucleus that does not overlap with the mitochondria-specific dye (Fig.2B). Its exact location in the cell remains to be determined. The results obtained here demonstrate for the first time that two human PNAT isoenzymes are expressed outside cell"
https://openalex.org/W2038757363,The increased rate of obesity in the past decade is caused by a larger rate of energy input than energy expenditure. But this simple explanation belies the complexity of the possible solutions: Education about obesity needs to improve for both the medical community and the public. Successful treatment will require reforms of medical practice as well as more research to facilitate the development of new drugs.

To investigate mechanisms of cryptdin-4 (Crp4) peptide interactions with membrane bilayers and to determine whether MMP-7-mediated proteolysis activates the membrane disruptive activity of Crp4, associations of Crp4 and melittin with biomimetic lipid/polydiacetylene chromatic vesicles were characterized. The peptides differ in their sensitivity to vesicle lipid composition and their depth of bilayer penetration. Crp4 undergoes strong interfacial binding onto lipid bilayers with disruption of the bilayer head group region, unlike melittin, which inserts more deeply into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Colorimetric and tryptophan fluorescence studies showed that Crp4 insertion is favored by negatively charged phospholipids and that zwitterionic and Escherichia coliphospholipids promote stronger interfacial binding; melittin-membrane interactions were independent of either variable. In contrast to the membrane disruptive activity of Crp4, pro-Crp4 did not perturb vesicular membranes, consistent with the lack of bactericidal activity of the precursor, and incubation of Crp4 with prosegment in trans blocked Crp4 and G1W-Crp4 membrane interactions at concentrations that inhibit Crp4 bactericidal activity. CD measurements showed that Crp4 has an expected β-sheet structure that is not evident in the pro-Crp4 CD trace or when Crp4 is incubated with prosegment, indicating that the β-sheet signal is attenuated by proregion interactions or possibly disrupted by the prosegment. Collectively, the results suggest that the prosegment inhibits Crp4 bactericidal activity by blocking peptide-mediated perturbation of target cell membranes, a constraint that is relieved when MMP-7 cleaves the prosegment.

Antimicrobial peptides have been identified as components of innate immunity in every living organism investigated (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6798) Google Scholar), and the mammalian α-defensins were among the first antimicrobial peptide families to be recognized and characterized (2Lehrer R.I.

In contrast to α-defensins in cells of myeloid origin, which provide a nonoxidative means for killing microorganisms after phagocytosis (6Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), Paneth cell α-defensins are secreted to function in the extracellular compartment (7Ouellette A.J. Bevins C.L. Inflamm.

These cationic peptides with molecular masses of 3–4 kDa contain six cysteine residues that form a distinctive tridisulfide array to produce an amphipathic peptide, a feature that is essential for its microbicidal activity (6Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In mouse Paneth cells, the production of mature bactericidal α-defensins requires proteolytic activation by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (9Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T.

Human α-defensin HNP-2 is a noncovalent dimer, but rabbit NP-1 is monomeric (11Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D.

White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and a pore model in which six HNP-2 dimers intercalate in the bilayer to form the 20 Å pore annulus has been proposed based on fluorescence leakage studies with large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) (14White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In contrast, NP-1 does not induce stable multimeric pores, but evidence shows that this peptide permeabilizes LUV by creating large, short-lived defects in the model membrane (15Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, myeloid α-defensins from human and rabbit neutrophils achieve bacterial cell killing by highly distinctive membrane disruptive mechanisms. Preliminary findings show that Crp4 induces graded leakage of fluorophores from LUV, but the mechanisms by which individual Paneth cell α-defensins achieve microbial cell killing are unexplored. As HNP and NP comparisons reveal, the means by which Paneth cell α-defensins exert bactericidal effects cannot be extrapolated from existing literature or from a single model peptide. In this work, the newly developed lipid/polydiacetylene (PDA) colorimetric vesicle assay combined with fluorescence and CD spectroscopies have been applied to characterizing Crp4 interaction and permeation of membranes. The lipid/PDA system consists of mixed vesicles composed of PDA interspersed with natural lipids, and the vesicles undergo blue-red transitions when induced by a variety of biological molecules that interact with the vesicular lipid components. The polymeric PDA matrix, which forms the scaffold of the mixed vesicles, accommodates the incorporation of varied lipid components while maintaining an overall sensitivity to membrane properties and processes. Analyses of PDA-based mixed vesicles have proven useful in studies of varied membrane-related processes, including peptide-membrane interactions (16Kolusheva S. Shahal T. Jelinek R.

In particular, this colorimetric assay has provided insights into mechanisms of membrane permeation, including the degree of interfacial disruption by peptides, the depth of peptide penetration into the lipid bilayer, and changes in membrane fluidity in response to peptide exposure (16Kolusheva S.

Chem. 278, 7910–7919.Furthermore, Crp4 has a unique structure among the known α-defensins in that its polypeptide backbone contains a three-residue deletion in the loop formed by the Cys3–Cys5 disulfide bond (4Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N.

In the studies reported here, interactions between model membranes and mouse Crp4 and its precursor have been analyzed spectroscopically and by colorimetric measurements on lipid/PDA mixed vesicles, and those interactions were correlated with the bactericidal activity of the peptide. The mechanisms of Crp4 membrane binding and permeation and the sensitivity of that binding to the composition of the lipid bilayer were evaluated in relation to melittin, a classic amphipathic α-helical peptide (23Smith R. Separovic F. Milne T.J. Whittaker A. Bennett F.M. Cornell B.A. Makriannis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Also, the lack of pro-Crp4 microbicidal activity and the inhibitory action of the precursor proregion on Crp4 bactericidal activity are consistent with the inability of pro-Crp4 and proregion-Crp4 mixtures to interact with these model membranes. Phospholipids, including dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), and lipopolysacharides (LPS from Escherichia coli055:B5) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). LPS was dialyzed sequentially against 1 mm EDTA for 24 h and against distilled water to remove excess divalent cations, which can cause lipid/PDA vesicles to precipitate. The diacetylenic monomer, 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid, was purchased from GFS Chemicals (Powell, OH), washed in chloroform, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter prior to use. For commercially obtained peptides, melittin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the Crp1 proregion consisting of the following primary structure: DPIQNTDEET KTEEQPGEDD QAVSVSFGDP EGTSLQEES was synthesized by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). The properties of the synthetic prosegment have been reported previously (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). E. coli strain B/r H-266 was grown at 37 °C for 24 h in LB medium. The lipids were extracted from E. coli by resuspending deposited bacterial cells in 4 m NaCl and an equal volume of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol. After the mixture was shaken gently for 1 h and refrigerated overnight, the chloroform and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 5000 × gfor 15 min, and the aqueous methanol solution was re-extracted with chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts were concentrated by solvent evaporation, and the residual lipid-containing fraction was lyophilized. The lipids were stored at −20 °C. Recombinant Crp4, the G1W-Crp4 variant, and procryptdin-4 (pro-Crp4) were expressed in E. coli as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. DNA coding for the Crp4 peptide, corresponding to nucleotides 182–274 of mouse Crp4 cDNA (27Ladokhin S., M.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1762-1766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), was amplified and cloned in-frame with the N-terminal His6 in theEcoRI/SalI sites of pET-28a (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The Crp4 coding cDNA sequences were amplified using forward primer (ER1-Met-C4-F), 5′-GCGCG AATTC ATCGA GGGAA GGATG GGT TTGTT ATGCT ATTGT, paired with reverse primer (pMALCrp4-R), 5′-ATATA TGTCG ACTCA GCGAC AGCAG AGCGT GTACA ATAAA TG (18Evrard D. Touitou E. Kolusheva S. Fishov Y. Jelinek R. Pharm. Res. 2001; 18: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A Trp for Gly substitution was made at Crp4 N terminus by pairing the common reverse primer (pMALCrp4-R) with forward primer (ER1-Met-G1W-F) 5′-ATATG AATTC ATGTGGTTGTTATGCTAT to prepare G1W-Crp4. To prepare recombinant pro-Crp4, a Met-coding trideoxynucleotide was incorporated 5′ of codon 20 in the Crp4 precursor cDNA and cloned in pET-28a as above. For cloning pro-Crp4, forward primer pETPCr4-F (5′-GCGCG AATTCATGGA TCCTA TCCAA AACAC A) was paired with reverse primer SLpMALCrp4R (5′-ATATA TGTCG ACTGT TCAGC GGCGG GGGCA GCAGT ACAA). The reactions were performed by incubating the reaction mixtures at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by successive cycles at 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The underlined codon in each forward primer denotes a Met codon to incorporate a CNBr cleavage site immediately upstream of the designed peptide N terminus. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc., La Jolla, CA) transformed with appropriate cDNA constructs. The cells were grown at 37 °C to A620 = 0.9 in Terrific Broth medium consisting of 12 g of Bacto Tryptone (Becton Dickenson Microbiological Systems, Inc., Sparks, MD), 24 g of Bacto Yeast Extract (Becton Dickenson), 4 ml of glycerol, 900 ml of H2O, 100 ml of sterile phosphate buffer consisting of 0.17m KH2PO4, 0.72 mK2HPO4, and 70 μg/ml kanamycin (28Hristova K. Dempsey C.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Expression of fusion proteins was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C after growth at 37 °C for 6 h. The cells were lysed by resuspending bacterial cell pellets in 6 m guanidine HCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, followed by sonication at 70% power, 50% duty cycle for 2 min using a Branson Sonifier 450. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a Sorvall SA-600 rotor at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C prior to protein purification. His-tagged Crp4 fusion proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin affinity chromatography by incubating cell lysates with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (v/v) in 6 mguanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) for 4 h at 4 °C. Fusion proteins were eluted with 2 column volumes of 6m guanidine HCl, 1 m imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.4) dialyzed against 5% acetic acid (HOAc) in SpectraPor 3 dialysis membranes (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) and lyophilized. The Met residue introduced at the Crp4, G1W-Crp4, and pro-Crp4 N termini was subjected to CNBr cleavage by dissolving lyophilized His6 fusion proteins in 50% formic acid, addition of solid CNBr to 10 mg/ml final concentration, and incubation of the mixtures for 8 h in darkness at 25 °C. The cleavage reactions were terminated by addition of 10 vol of H2O, followed by freezing and lyophilization of the peptide mixture. The cleaved fusion peptide mixtures were dissolved in 5% acetic acid and stored at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). After CNBr cleavage, Crp4, G1W-Crp4, and pro-Crp4 peptides were separated from CNBr fragments of the 36-amino acid His6 tag fusion partner by C-4 RP-HPLC on a Vydac 214TP1010 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). For Crp4, the samples were applied to C-4 columns in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were resolved with a 0–35% acetonitrile gradient developed over 55 min. All other peptides were purified to homogeneity by analytical C-18 RP-HPLC on a Vydac 218TP54 column. Using the same mobile phase, recombinant proteins were resolved with elution times ranging from 21 to 24 min using a 10–45% acetonitrile gradient over 55 min. Protein fractions containing Crp4 were identified by acid-urea PAGE as described (14White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) to confirm co-migration with natural Crp4 and pro-Crp4 and to evaluate the homogeneity of the preparation. Peptide concentrations were quantified by amino acid analysis (Waters Alliance, Bedford, MA) or UV absorption at 280 nm based on the extinction coefficients of the individual proteins. Molecular masses of purified peptides were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mode mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE MALDI-TOF; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Recombinant peptides were tested for microbicidal activity against E. coli ML35 and the PhoP− mutant of Salmonella typhimurium. Bacteria growing exponentially at 37 °C in trypticase soy broth were deposited by centrifugation at 1700 × g for 10 min, washed in 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) that was supplemented with 0.01 vol of prepared trypticase soy broth. The peptide samples were lyophilized and dissolved in 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) at 1 mg/ml. The microorganisms were incubated at 37 °C with peptides in a total volume of 50 μl at a concentration of ∼1 × 106/ml for 1 h in a shaking incubator. Following microbial exposure to peptides, 20-μl samples of peptide-exposed bacteria were diluted 1:200 with 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), and 50 μl of the diluted samples were plated on trypticase soy agar plates using an Autoplate 4000 (Spiral Biotech Inc., Bethesda, MD). The surviving microorganisms were counted as colony-forming units/ml after incubation at 37 °C for 12–18 h. Vesicles containing lipid components and PDA (DMPG/DMPC/PDA, 1:1:3 ratio; LPS/DMPC/PDA, 0.2:2:3 ratio) were prepared as follows. All of the lipid constituents were dissolved in chloroform/ethanol (1:1), dried together in vacuo to constant weight, and suspended in deionized water by probe sonication at 70 °C for 2–3 min. The vesicle suspension was cooled to room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and polymerized by irradiation at 254 nm for 10–20 s, resulting in solutions having an intense blue appearance. An ultracentrifugation binding assay was carried out for evaluation of peptide affinities, or partition coefficients, to the vesicles. First, a calibration graph that correlated peptide concentration with the absorbance at 220 nm was prepared and used to determine the concentration of soluble, unbound peptide. Varying quantities of peptides were added to aqueous lipid/PDA vesicle solutions containing 0.5 mm total lipid in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and the solutions were incubated briefly at ambient temperature to allow equilibration of bound and unbound peptide species, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 40 min in a SW-55 rotor to deposit vesicle-peptide aggregates. The concentration of soluble, i.e. unbound, peptide in the supernatant was determined by extrapolation from the calibration curve, and the quantity of bound peptide was calculated as the difference from the initial peptide concentration. The binding data results were confirmed using the Lowry method for determination of soluble peptide concentration (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral UV-visible measurements were carried out to analyze and quantify the colorimetric transitions undergone by the blue lipid/PDA vesicles. Peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20 μm were added to 60-μl vesicle solutions consisting of 0.5 mm total lipid in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). Following addition of the peptides, the solutions were diluted to 1 ml, and spectra were acquired at 28 °C between 400 and 700 nm on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp., Tokyo), using a 1-cm optical path cell. The extent of blue-to-red color transitions within the vesicle solutions, the colorimetric response (%CR), was defined and calculated as follows (19Kolusheva S. Kafri R. Katz M. Jelinek R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).%CR=[(PB0−PB1)/PB0]×100(Eq. 1) where PB =Ablue/(Ablue +Ared), and A is the absorbance at 640 nm, the “blue” component of the spectrum, or at 500 nm, the “red” component. Note that blue and red refer to the visual appearance of the material, not actual absorbances.PB0 is the blue/red ratio of the control sample before induction of a color change, and PBI is the value obtained for the vesicle solution after the colorimetric transition occurred. Changes in tryptophan intrinsic emission were measured for 10 μm peptide solutions titrated with vesicles. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired at 28 °C on an FL920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Co., Edinburgh, UK), using excitation at 280 nm and emission at 345 nm. Excitation and emission slits were both 8 nm. Total sample volumes were 1 ml, and the solutions were placed in a quartz cell having a 0.5-cm optical path length. Light scattering from the vesicles was confirmed to account for less than 5% of the emission intensity. CD spectra were acquired on an Aviv 62A-DS Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Aviv Inc., Lakewood, NJ). Four scans were recorded between 190 and 250 nm with 1-nm acquisition steps. A 0.2-mm optical path length was used. All of the vesicle solutions had a total lipid concentration of 1 mm in 50 mmTris-HCl at pH 8. The peptide concentrations were 0.1 mm. Consistent and efficient recombinant expression of Crp4, G1W-Crp4, and pro-Crp4 (Fig.1A) was obtained using the pET-28 vector system. Recombinant His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography from the bacterial cell lysates (“Experimental Procedures”). After chemical cleavage with CNBr, Crp4, G1W-Crp4, and pro-Crp4 were purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC (“Experimental Procedures”). Peptide homogeneity was evaluated using analytical RP-HPLC (not shown) and acid-urea PAGE (Fig.1B). All of the purified peptides were homogeneous by these criteria, migrated as expected relative to native Crp4 and pro-Crp4 molecules (Fig. 1B),3 and the molecular masses of individual recombinant peptides determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry matched the respective theoretical values exactly. Thus, the purified recombinant peptides were homogeneous and biochemically equivalent to the natural molecules. The in vitro microbicidal activities of Crp4, G1W-Crp4, and pro-Crp4 were evaluated against the defensin-sensitivePhoP− mutant of S. typhimurium and the DH5α strain of E. coli. As expected, Crp4 and G1W-Crp4 showed extensive bactericidal activity in the low micromolar range, equal to 5–10 μg/ml of peptide (Fig. 1C). The bactericidal activities of both peptides were the same against S. typhimurium PhoP− (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Against E. coli, the G1W-Crp4 variant was slightly less active, requiring 3–5-fold greater peptide concentrations to achieve killing equivalent to that of Crp4 (Fig.1C, lower panel). In contrast to the bactericidal activities of these mature Crp4 peptides (5Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Cano-Gauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E.

Because pro-Crp4 lacks bacterial cell killing activity, it provided a useful reagent for testing whether interactions with model membranes correlate with bactericidal activity. The bactericidal activity of G1W-Crp4 similarly validates the use of this peptide as a biologically relevant fluorescent probe (see below). Melittin was selected as a model peptide for comparisons of bactericidal activity and membrane interactions with Crp4. The folded conformations of Crp4 and melittin differ. Crp4 is a typical α-defensin consisting of three β-strands and no α-helical content. In contrast, melittin, is a potently bactericidal, membrane disruptive peptide that assumes an amphipathic α-helical structure in hydrophobic environments (23Smith R. Separovic F. Milne T.J.

Despite the high potential as a pharmacologic agent for both infectious diseases and cancer, a variety of shortcomings have limited the widespread use of IFN, including the inability to obtain clinically relevant concentrations in vivo, the short half-life of IFN in circulation, limited access of exogenous IFN to the site of infection, and the evolution of viruses that can antagonize enzymes involved in the antiviral response. Novel strategies for activation of IFN biological responses by targeting transcriptional regulators to specific cells might circumvent these problems and ultimately prove to be an effective therapeutic option. Most of the immediate actions of IFN can be attributed to the activity of an IFN-inducible transcriptional regulator, the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), and its IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) targets. As a trimeric complex, the ISGF3 transcription factor is mechanistically unique compared with other STAT-dependent transcription pathways. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase-based signaling events leading to STAT protein activation and STAT1:STAT2 dimerization are dissociable from the nuclear transcription functions of ISGF3 that require obligatory interactions between STATs and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). IRF9 is essential as the DNA binding component of ISGF3 that binds to consensus IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and provides specific protein interaction sites for the IFN-activated STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (9Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R.I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 10Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the modular STAT2 C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) provides the essential signals for the induction of target gene transcription (12Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that IRF9 functions as an adaptor molecule for tethering a STAT1:STAT2 dimer to the ISRE DNA element, an emerging body of evidence suggests non-ISGF3 roles for IRF9 in the regulation of gene expression. For instance, the human IP-10 gene requires an IRF9·STAT1 complex for its activation by IFNγ (13Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4736-4744PubMed Google Scholar). IRF9 is efficiently targeted to the nucleus via an intrinsic bipartite localization signal that functions in the absence of IFN signaling (14Lau J.F. Parisien J.-P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of IRF9 confers resistance to anti-microtubule agents in breast cancer cell lines independent of IFN signals (15Luker K.E. Pica C.M. Schreiber R.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6540-6547PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRF9 mRNA levels are increased in half of the breast and uterine cancer samples tested (15Luker K.E. Pica C.M. Schreiber R.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6540-6547PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for this factor in cancer biology. Therefore, the potential of IRF9 to act as a direct transcriptional regulator independent of its role as the ISGF3 DNA binding adaptor was examined. Results demonstrate that whereas IRF9 lacks intrinsic transcriptional capacity, IRF9-TAD fusion proteins effectively mimic the activity of the trimeric ISGF3 complex. The IRF9 hybrids function in the absence of endogenous IFN signaling and provide a novel strategy for enhancing endogenous antiviral responses. Human fibrosarcoma 2fTGH, 2fTGH-derived cell lines U3A (STAT1-deficient) and U6A (STAT2-deficient), 293T, CV-1, Vero, and the 293 Tet-On (purchased from Clontech) were adapted to and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Cosmic calf serum (Hyclone). Transfection of cells with cDNAs was carried out by standard CaPO4 procedures (16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). GAL4-IRF9 and GAL4-S1C were constructed by insertion of PCR-amplified ORF into the GAL4-DBD plasmid pSG424 (17Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Inserts for the IRF9-S1C, IRF9-S2C, and IRF9-VP16 hybrid cDNAs were created by standard four-primer PCR technique (18Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first step involves generation of two PCR fragments encompassing full-length IRF9 and the STAT2 104 C-terminal amino acids, the 38 C-terminal amino acids of STAT1, or the 80 C-terminal amino acids of the VP16 TAD (17Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These products are then combined for use as templates for a second PCR reaction, with external 5′ and 3′ primers to create IRF9-S1C, IRF9-S2C, or IRF9-VP16 hybrid inserts with BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Primers used were as follows: T IRF9, 5′-CCCGGATCCCCGCCATGGCATCAGGCAGGGCACGC-3′; S2 REV 3′, 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCCTAGAAGTCAGAAGGCATC-3′; IRF9-S2C T, 5′-GCCATTCTGTCCCTGGTGGGGCCAGAGCTAGAGTCT-3′; IRF9-S2C B, 5′-AGACTCTAGCTCTGGCCCCACCAGGGACAGAATGGC-3′; IRF9-VP16 T, 5′-GCCATTCTGTCCCTGGTGTCGACGGCCCCCCCCA-3′; IRF9-VP16 B, 5′-TGGGGGGGGCCGTCGACACCAGGGACAGAATGGC-3′; IRF9-S1C T, 5′-GCCATTCTGTCCCTGGTGGAAGTTCACCCTTCTAGA-3′; IRF9-S1C B, 5′-TCTAGAAGGGTGAACTTCCACCAGGGACAGAATGGC-3′; S1C-REV, 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCTATACTGTGTTCATCATACT-3′. The IRF9-TAD hybrid insert was subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Inserts for IRF9 and IRF9-STAT TADs were also subcloned into the tetracycline-regulated plasmid pBI (Clontech). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For detection of GAL4 constructs in a reporter gene assay, 293T, U3A, and U6A cells were transiently transfected with either vector alone or GAL4-IRF9 fusion constructs, along with a reporter gene containing five GAL4 upstream activation sequence elements fused to the luciferase gene (17Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). For detection of IRF9-STAT hybrid protein activity, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding hybrid proteins and a reporter gene plasmid containing five copies of the ISG54 ISRE element upstream of a TATA box and firefly luciferase ORF. Luciferase assays were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity derived from 1 μg of co-transfected CMV-lacZ. Unless otherwise noted, all graphs represent average values for a triplicate experiment ± S.D. Antibodies against IRF9 (C-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total protein extracts were prepared in whole cell extract buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotted by standard procedures, and prepared for chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was prepared by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), digested with DNase I, and subjected to reverse transcriptase with SuperScript II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and PCR analysis as described elsewhere (10Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A mock reaction was carried out with no reverse transcriptase added (−RT). One-tenth of the resulting cDNA product was used as template for 25 cycles of PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using specific primers for ISG15, ISG54, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. As a control for genomic DNA contamination, PCR was carried out with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers using the mock (−RT) reaction products as templates. Following gel electrophoresis, products were detected by autoradiography. For RT-PCR analysis of ISGs induced by IRF9-VP16, RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as above, but PCR was performed using a 32-cycle reaction, and the product was run on an agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. Primer sequences were as follows: ISG54A, 5′-AATGCCATTTCACCTGGAACTTG-3′; ISG54B, 5′-GTGATAGTAGACCCAGGCATAGT-3′; ISG15A, 5′-CAACGAATTCCAAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3′; ISG15B, 5′-CCCTTGTTATTCCTCACC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A, 5′-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase B, 5′-TGGAATTTGCCATGGGTG-3′. Antiviral responses measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay were conducted as reported previously (19Friedman R.M. Interferons: A Primer. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar, 20Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 647-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. First, to create stably transfected cell lines, 293 Tet-On cells (Clontech) were transfected with tetracycline-regulated pBI plasmids (Clontech) encoding the IRF9, IRF9-S1C, or IRF9-S2C ORFs. Individual clones were then selected and then probed by anti-IRF9 immunoblotting analyses for regulated expression. To determine the extent of protection from viral-induced CPE, cells were first treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 24 h, challenged with virus infection for 18 h, and then photographed. Antiviral assays comparing the biologic activity of IRF9-S2C and IFN with simian virus 5 (SV5; W3A strain), type II human parainfluenza virus (HPIV2; Greer strain), and VSV infection were performed as follows: 293T cells carrying the Tet-induced IRF9-S2C transgene were treated with Dox or IFN for 24 h. Cells were then washed with serum-free medium, infected with virus at a multiplicity of 1.0 and/or 0.1 pfu/cell for 2 h, washed with serum-free medium, and cultured for an additional 48 h (18 h for VSV) in the presence or absence of Dox or IFN in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% serum. For SV5 antiviral assays performed in the presence of IFN neutralizing antibodies, cells were pre-treated with Dox in the presence or absence of 400 neutralizing units of anti-IFNα and anti-IFNβ antibodies (PBL Biomedical Laboratories), a concentration sufficient to prevent the antiviral activity of exogenous IFN (data not shown). Cells were infected as above and then cultured for 48 h in the continued presence of either Dox or IFN and the anti-IFN antibodies as indicated. Supernatants were then titered in plaque assays using simian CV-1 cells with an overlay containing 0.5% agar with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The monolayer was fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) dissolved in 20% EtOH. Anti-viral assay using herpes simplex virus (HSV-1; gift from John Blaho) was performed similarly, except cells were infected at a multiplicity of 5 pfu/cell. Supernatants were harvested from infected Dox-inducible IRF9-S2C cell lines 24 h after infection and titered on Vero cells. No antiviral effects or virus replication inhibition were observed in Dox-treated control cells or IRF9 cells. A heterologous DNA binding domain fusion system was used to test the intrinsic transcriptional capacity of IRF9. Hybrid cDNAs were constructed that fuse the yeast GAL4-DBD to IRF9, and the resulting fusion proteins were assayed for the ability to activate transcription of a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter gene (17Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). No reporter gene activity was observed when the GAL4- DBD alone was expressed, but fusion of the full-length IRF9 to GAL4 resulted in a fusion protein that was capable of stimulating transcription 5–10-fold greater than the GAL4-DBD alone (Fig. 1A). As a positive control, the activity of GAL4-S1C, a fusion with the well characterized 38-amino acid TAD of STAT1 (21Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M. Aaronson S.A. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GAL4-S1C activated transcription over 100-fold in this system, indicating that the intrinsic activity of IRF9 was relatively weak (Fig.1A). To determine the specific IRF9 amino acids responsible for this modest transcriptional activity, smaller GAL4-IRF9 fusions were engineered and expressed (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal portion that encompasses the DNA binding and nuclear localization domain of IRF9 (amino acids 1–200) was transcriptionally inactive as a GAL4 fusion, and the central region of the molecule (amino acids 100–300) produced only a minor stimulation of the reporter gene above basal levels. The C-terminal IRF9 domain (amino acids 200–393) was the only region to exhibit significant transcriptional activity, giving rise to reporter gene activity that was even greater than the full-length IRF9 fusion (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the IRF9 transcriptional activity localizes to its C-terminal half, previously determined to be the STAT1 and STAT2 binding region (10Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A current model of ISGF3 signaling assumes that IRF9 is a STAT and DNA binding adaptor protein linking transcriptional activation to ISRE DNA elements, but this hypothesis has not been tested rigorously. Because the transcriptional activity of IRF9 localized to the STAT protein interaction region, the role of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins in activation by GAL4-IRF9 was tested in sister cell lines deficient in one of the IFN-activated STATs and thereby unresponsive to IFN (24Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 25Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of STAT1 (U3A cells), GAL4-IRF9 has a low constitutive level of transcriptional activity, as observed in the STAT-intact cells, that does not change upon IFNγ stimulation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, in the absence of STAT2 (U6A cells), no basal activity was observed, but IFNγ stimulation activated the reporter gene (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that endogenous STAT2 may be responsible for the basal activity of GAL4-IRF9, even in the absence of STAT1, and that a STAT2·GAL4-IRF9 complex can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The action of IFNγ on IRF9-dependent transcription is not the result of direct stimulatory effects, as no additional IFNγ induction was observed in the absence of STAT1 (U3A cells). As STAT1 dimers form in response to IFNγ in STAT2-deficient cells, this result suggests that STAT1 is responsible for the activity of GAL4-IRF9 in the IFNγ-treated cells. To test this hypothesis, the reporter gene assay was carried out in the absence of the both STAT1 and STAT2 by using STAT2-deficient cells (U6A) and dominant negative STAT1 mutants to block the activity of the remaining endogenous STAT1 (Fig.1D). Expression in STAT2-deficient U6A cells of dominant negative forms of STAT1 that either fail to activate and dimerize (STAT1 Y701F) or lack transcriptional activity (STAT1β) results in a situation where neither STAT1 nor STAT2 is functional. GAL4-IRF9 failed to activate the reporter gene in this virtual null cellular environment, in support of the conclusion that association of GAL4-IRF9 with endogenous STAT2 is required for basal transcription, but association with STAT1 is responsible for the observed IFNγ-inducible transcription. Together, the results with the GAL4-IRF9 system indicate that IRF9 lacks intrinsic transcriptional activity, providing experimental evidence that supports a model where IRF9 functions to integrate STAT1 or STAT2 transcriptional activation signals to the ISRE element on target promoters. The primary transcription activation function of ISGF3 has been attributed to contributions from the STATs, especially the STAT2 C terminus. Deletions from this region of STAT2 abrogate the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 (26Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and fusion of the STAT2 C terminus to STAT1 or GAL4-DBD is sufficient to generate fusion proteins that activate transcription (23Shen Y. Darnell J.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Park C. Lecomte M.J. Schindler C.

The constitutive nuclear import of IRF9, coupled with its lack of transcriptional activity in the absence of STATs, suggests that one role of IRF9 might be to target STAT activation domains to the IFN-responsive promoter, ensuring rapid and specific activation. To test this concept, the ability of IRF9 to target STAT transcriptional activation domains to ISGF3-responsive promoters was examined. A hybrid cDNA expression vector was created that expressed IRF9 fused to the ISGF3 transcriptional activation domain that resides in the STAT2 C terminus. The C-terminal 104 amino acids of STAT2 were fused to the IRF9 ORF to create IRF9-S2C (Fig.2A). The hybrid protein was expressed in 293T cells and subjected to ISRE-dependent luciferase assays. Expression of IRF9 protein alone resulted in weak reporter gene activity, consistent with the results observed in the GAL4-IRF9 system (Fig. 1). The IRF9-S2C fusion, however, was found to strongly activate ISRE-dependent reporter gene transcription in the absence of IFN stimulation, resulting in ∼50-fold stimulation of reporter gene activity (Fig. 2A,right panel). The high level of activity of IRF9-S2C was not altered by stimulation with IFNα, but a small increase was observed following IFNγ stimulation, consistent with contributions by endogenous IFNγ-activated STAT1 dimers interacting with IRF9 to heighten transcriptional responses (29Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlieststra R.J. Made A.C.J.V. d. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results indicate that recruitment of the STAT2 TAD to the ISRE DNA element is sufficient for transcriptional activity. To determine whether the activity of the IRF9-S2C chimeric activator requires endogenous STAT1 or STAT2, similar ISRE-dependent luciferase reporter gene assays were performed in STAT1-deficient U3A cells, STAT2-deficient U6A cells, or parental 2fTGH cells (Fig.2B). As a control, a second hybrid protein fusing the IRF9 ORF to the STAT1α C-terminal 38 amino acids was also constructed (to create IRF9-S1C) and included in these assays. Although the cell-specific transfection efficiency and protein accumulation levels varied between the tested cell lines, resulting in distinct absolute activation values, all of the IRF9 expression vectors behaved similarly, regardless of endogenous STAT1 or STAT2 deficiency; IRF9 and the IRF9-S1C TAD fusion protein only weakly stimulated reporter gene activity, but the IRF9-S2C TAD fusion was highly active in all cell lines (Fig. 2B). To determine the activity of IRF9-S2C at endogenous target loci, the ability of the IRF9-S2C hybrid to regulate the expression of endogenous ISGs was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Cells were treated with IFNα or IFNγ for 6 h or transfected with IRF9 or IRF9-S2C expression vectors. RNA was prepared and processed for RT-PCR assays to examine the accumulation of ISG15 and ISG54, two genes known to be regulated transcriptionally by ISGF3. For both ISGs, treatment with IFNα, but not IFNγ, resulted in a strong mRNA induction (Fig.2C). In the absence of IFN stimulation, transfection of the IRF9-S2C fusion protein resulted in a similar increase in mRNA abundance for these two ISGs. A small stimulation of the ISGs was observed for expression of IRF9 that is consistent with earlier conclusions regarding the transcriptional activity of IRF9 and may represent contributions from endogenous STAT proteins. These data indicate that the IRF9-STAT fusion is active on chromatinized endogenous loci that are normally targets of ISGF3. Based on these and previous studies (26Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Park C. Lecomte M.J. Schindler C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we conclude that a primary and essential TAD for ISGF3 resides within the C-terminal 104 amino acids of STAT2. Furthermore, targeting this minimal STAT2 domain to endogenous promoters is sufficient to mediate ISG transcription. The finding that IRF9-S2C exhibited intrinsic ISGF3-like transcriptional activity but IRF9-S1C did not (Fig. 2B) was unexpected in view of the established role for the STAT1 C terminus in IFNγ-dependent transcription (reviewed in Ref. 12Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To determine whether the STAT2 TAD is unique in its ability to activate IRF9, a distinct heterologous TAD was tested in this system. The well characterized acidic activation domain of herpesvirus VP16 protein was fused to IRF9 to create IRF9-VP16. Expression of this construct in 293T cells resulted in strong ISRE-directed reporter gene activity (Fig.2D), ∼3-fold higher than observed with IRF9-S2C, in agreement with results published for a similar comparison using a GAL4 system (23Shen Y. Darnell J.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Kirchoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The activity of IRF9-VP16 was also tested for ability to induce endogenous ISG transcription. Consistent with the reporter gene assays, expression of IRF9-VP16 was able to induce transcription of both ISG15 and ISG54 (Fig. 2D). By the tested criteria, IRF9-TAD fusion proteins duplicate molecular aspects of ISGF3 function. To test the biological activity of this hybrid factor in IFN response assays, vectors for inducible expression of the IRF9 fusions were constructed. Tetracycline-regulated vectors with IRF9 and IRF9-S2C open reading frames were used to create mammalian cell lines that inducibly express the transgene following stimulation with the tetracycline analog, Dox. Several independent clones were isolated in 293 Tet-On cells that demonstrated similar levels of Dox-induced transgene expression (Fig. 3A,right panel). The inducible cell lines were tested for resistance to virus-induced cytopathic effects and the ability to suppress virus replication. Cells were assayed for resistance to VSV by standard methodology (19Friedman R.M. Interferons: A Primer. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar, 20Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 647-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines were susceptible to VSV-induced CPE, causing death of infected cell monolayers, and no nonspecific antiviral effects were observed in Dox-treated control cells or IRF9 cells (Fig. 3A, left panels). Induction of transgene expression with Dox did not alter the susceptibility of the cells to VSV-induced CPE when IRF9 was the transgene, but cells expressing IRF9-S2C were greatly protected from viral CPE (Fig. 3A). As VSV is well known to be susceptible to the IFN-induced antiviral state, the ability of the IRF9-S2C transgene to block the replication of an IFN-resistant virus was also tested. SV5, a member of theRubulavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae, evades the IFN signaling response by targeting STAT1 for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (32Parisien J.P. Lau J.F.

We have investigated the role of the C-terminal hexapeptide of SifA as a potential site for membrane anchoring.

Intravacuolar bacterial replication initiates 3–5 h after infection and correlates with the formation in epithelial cells of unusual tubular membranous structures termed Sifs (forSalmonella-induced filaments) (13Garcia-del Portillo F.

Sifs extend from and connect SCVs and are characterized by a high enrichment in Lgps. The formation of Sifs requires a functional type III secretion system (TTSS) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) (8Beuzon C.R. Méresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S.

Several Gram-negative pathogens use TTSS to inject proteins, termed bacterial effectors, into the host cell, were they subvert specific host functions. SifA is a SPI-2 TTSS effector (14Brumell J.H.

It is not known whether the absence of Sifs and vacuolar membrane result from the same loss of function. Other SPI-2 TTSS-translocated proteins, SseF, SseG and SpiC, have also been found to be necessary for the formation of Sifs (17Guy R.L. Gonias L.A. Stein M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1417-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SpiC was originally described as an inhibitor of interactions between SCV and late endocytic compartments (18Uchiya K.

Furthermore, expression of a GFP·SifA fusion protein in non-infected cells induces the vacuolation of Lamp1-positive compartments and the appearance of tubular structures that resemble Sifs (16Brumell J.H.

To gain some insight in the molecular mechanisms of action of SifA, we analyzed the role of a C-terminal, cysteine-rich, hexapeptide in the subcellular localization and biological function of this virulence factor. In the present paper, we show that this domain is necessary for systemic virulence in mice, intracellular replication, and reorganization of the host endocytic compartment. Collectively, our results indicate that SifA requires its C-terminal hexapeptide to achieve its function. The rabbit antiserum against the Rab7 GTPase has been described previously (23Méresse S.

Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) as appropriate. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 105 colony-forming unit per mouse, as described previously (27Beuzon C.R. Holden D.W. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The spleens were aseptically removed 48 h after inoculation, and bacteria recovered and enumerated after plating a dilution series onto LB agar and LB agar with the appropriate antibiotics. Each competitive index (CI) value is the mean of three independent mice infections and is defined as the ratio between the mutant and wild-type strains within the output (bacteria recovered from the mouse after infection) divided by their ratios within the input (initial inoculum) (28Taylor R.K.

Bacteria were incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking, diluted 1:33 in fresh LB broth and incubated in the same conditions for 3.5 h. The cultures were diluted in Earle's buffered salt solution, pH 7.4 and added to the HeLa cells at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100:1. The infection was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C in 7% CO2. Cells were washed three times with DMEM containing fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg·ml−1 gentamicin and incubated in this medium for 1 h, after which the gentamicin con centration was decreased to 10 μg·ml−1. Macrophages were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates 24 h before use. Bacteria were cultured overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The cultures were opsonized in DMEM containing FCS and 10% normal mouse serum for 20 min. Bacteria were added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100:1 and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 7% CO2. Macrophages were washed three times with DMEM containing FCS and 100 μg·ml−1 gentamicin and incubated in this medium for 1 h. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing FCS and 10 μg·ml−1 gentamicin for the remainder of the experiment. For enumeration of intracellular bacteria, macrophages were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and a dilution series was plated onto LB agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were counted. Each time point was performed in triplicate, and each individual experiment was performed three times or more. The fullsifA ORF was amplified from S. typhimuriumgenomic DNA by PCR using the primer 1 (5′-AAA AAA GAA TTC CAC CAC CAT GCC GAT TAC TAT AGG GAA TGG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-AAA AAA CCC GGG TTA TAA AAA ACA ACA TAA ACA-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into the unique EcoR1 and XmaI sites of pEGF-C1 vector (Clontech) into the same reading frame as EGFP, generating pgfp::sifA. The C-terminal deletion or substitution mutants were generated using the primer 1 and second primers designed so that they correspond to the different C-terminal sequences. For fusing the 11 C-terminal residues of SifA to GFP, the following primers (5′-AATTCTGAACAACAAAGCGGCTGTTT ATGTTGTTTTTTATAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTATAAAAAACAACATAAACAGC CGCTTTGTTGTTCAG-3′) were annealed and cloned into the EcoR1 and BamH1 sites of pEGFP-C1 generating GFP·SifA-(326–336). HeLa cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were further incubated for 24 h. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Fixed cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized by incubating in PBS containing 0.1% saponin. Saponin 0.1% was included in all subsequent incubation steps. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 5% normal horse serum. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS containing 0.1% saponin, and then incubated with appropriate Alexa goat secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol (Aldrich). Cells were observed with a Leica epifluorescence microscope or a confocal laser-scanning microscope LSM510 Zeiss. For each chimeric GFP a 10-cm dish of transfected HeLa cells was chilled on ice and washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Scraped cells were pelleted for 5 min at 100 × g in a clinical centrifuge, overlaid with 3 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mmimidazole, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1800 ×g. Cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized by three passages through a 22-gauge needle. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1800 × g, the post-nuclear supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The soluble fraction was saved, and the pellet was resuspended in a volume of homogenization buffer. For high pH extraction, the pellet was resuspended in a volume of 100 mm NaOH, pH 11, 50 mm NaCl, incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Fractions were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred on Immobilon-P for Western blotting. The C-terminal hexapeptide of SifA (CLCCFL) contains three cysteine residues that may serve as recognition sites for lipidations. These post-translational modifications are important for membrane attachment and the biological functions of many proteins. To investigate the role of the C-terminal hexapeptide in the function of SifA, a mutant strain (HH215) was constructed carrying a deletion of sifA(sifAΔ6) in the chromosome. The truncated gene lacks the sequence encoding the C-terminal last six amino acids of SifA. The virulence of this strain was tested by comparing it with the wild-type strain in mixed infections of mice. Bacteria from infected spleen were recovered 48 h after intra-peritoneal inoculation, and the competitive index was determined as described previously (30Beuzon C.R. Unsworth K.E. Holden D.W. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7254-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CI is a sensitive measure of the relative degree of virulence attenuation of a given mutant (27Beuzon C.R. Holden D.W. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The CI of the sifAΔ6 mutantversus the wild-type strains was significantly lower than 1.0 (CI = 0.226 ± 0.08) showing that, in the mouse, the net growth of the sifAΔ6 mutant strain was considerably less than that of the wild-type strain. This result indicates that the C-terminal hexapeptide motif of SifA is required for full virulence in mice and, therefore, SifA function. Because the sifAΔ6 mutant strain is attenuated in the systemic phase of the infection, and S. typhimurium systemic virulence is correlated with its ability to replicate inside host macrophages, this mutant strain was tested for replication over 16 h in the macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line. As a control we used an ssaV− mutant strain that is completely defective for SPI-2-mediated secretion and, thus, defective for intracellular replication (31Beuzon C.R. Banks G. Deiwick J. Hensel M. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Hensel M. Shea J.E. Waterman S.R. Mundy R. Nikolaus T. Banks G. Vazquez-Torres A. Gleeson C. Fang F.C. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We observed that thesifAΔ6 mutant has a replication defect similar to that ofsifA− and ssaV− mutant strains (Fig. 1A). This indicates that SifA-mediated proliferation in macrophages requires its C-terminal hexapeptide. SifA is essential to maintain the integrity of the vacuolar membrane, as sifA−mutant bacteria are gradually released into the host cell cytosol (8Beuzon C.R. Méresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The cytosol of macrophages does not support S. typhimuriumreplication (9Beuzon C.R. Salcedo S.P. Holden D.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2705-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that the failure of thesifAΔ6 mutant strain to replicate inside these cells is due to a failure to maintain the vacuolar membrane. To address this question, we compared the level of association with an SCV membrane marker, Lamp2, of sifAΔ6 mutant bacteria to that of the wild-type and sifA− strain by immunofluorescence analysis. In macrophages, 95% of wild-type and 47% of sifA− bacteria were decorated by the anti-Lamp2 antibody 10 h after bacterial uptake. ThesifAΔ6 mutant displayed an intermediate phenotype with 70% of the bacteria found in association with the membrane marker (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in bone marrow-derived macrophages (data not shown). A drastic reorganization of Lgps to the vicinity of vacuoles occurs in epithelial cells infected by S. typhimurium. This process is dependent on the function of SifA (15Stein M.A. Leung K.Y. Zwick M. Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Ruiz-Albert J. Yu X.J. Beuzon C.R. Blakey A.N. Galyov E.E. Holden D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In Raw 264.7 macrophages, a similar SifA-dependent phenomenon was observed. Alteration of the distribution of Lamp2 was detected in 65 ± 6 or 5.5 ± 0.7% of macrophages infected with wild-type orsifA− mutant bacteria, respectively (Fig.1C). 27 ± 3% of macrophages infected with thesifAΔ6 mutant strain exhibited modified Lamp2 distribution (Fig. 1C). We concluded that the maintenance of bacteria inside a vacuolar membrane and the recruitment of Lgp-containing compartments require a full-length SifA. The presence of Sifs is the hallmark of S. typhimurium infection of epithelial cells (13Garcia-del Portillo F. Zwick M.B. Leung K.Y. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10544-10548Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and thesifA gene is essential for their formation (15Stein M.A. Leung K.Y. Zwick M. Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). At 10 h after bacterial entry, Sifs were detected in more than 65% of epithelial cells infected with the wild-type strain, whereas thesifA− mutant strain was unable to induce the formation of such structures (Fig.2A). The sifAΔ6mutant strain exhibited an intermediate phenotype, as Sifs were found in ∼30% of infected cells (Fig. 2A). Where Sifs were observed their morphology was altered, appearing shorter and thinner (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminal hexapeptide motif of SifA contributes to the function of this SPI-2 effector in remodeling intracellular compartments. Ectopic expression of SifA in epithelial cells complements the failure of asifA− mutant strain to induce Sif formation (8Beuzon C.R. Méresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and results, in non-infected cells, in the reorganization of late endocytic compartments (16Brumell J.H. Rosenberger C.M. Gotto G.T. Marcus S.L. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To investigate the specific contribution of each of the six C-terminal residues to SifA function, we generated a series of sifA alleles carrying deletions or substitutions in the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of the protein and ligated them into a vector for transfection from which GFP-tagged versions of each proteins were expressed (Fig.3A). Transfection of epithelial cells with a vector encoding GFP·SifA induces the formation of large Lgp-enriched vesicles and filamentous structures resembling Sifs (16Brumell J.H. Rosenberger C.M. Gotto G.T. Marcus S.L. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Compared with non-transfected cells (star symbol in Fig.4A), we observed similar large Lamp1-positive vesicles and tubules in cells expressing GFP·SifA (Fig. 4A). Tubules were more numerous but thinner than Sifs in infected cells (compare inset in Fig. 4A with Fig. 2B) and will thereafter be referred to as Sif-like tubules. Large Lgp-enriched vesicles and Sif-like tubules were observed in 65 ± 13% and 15 ± 5%, respectively, of GFP·SifA transfected cells. GFP·SifA co-localized with Lamp1 on vesicles and tubules (Fig. 4A), and appeared essentially membrane bound. To investigate the composition of the SifA-induced structures in more detail, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of these chimeras on the distribution of several other markers of the endocytic pathway. EEA1, a marker for early endosomes, was unaffected by the cellular expression of SifA (data not shown). We also analyzed the effects on the distribution of late endosomal (Rab7 and the cation-independent mannose 6-phophate receptor) and lysosomal (lysobisphosphatidic acid, Lamp2, CD63, vATPase and cathepsin D) markers. In non-transfected cells these two groups of markers were distributed to distinct compartments, and no co-localization of late endosomal and lysosomal markers could be detected by confocal microscopy (data not shown). In contrast, cells expressing GFP·SifA were characterized by the presence of both Rab7 and cathepsin D in the large vesicular compartments in which they co-localized with the over-expressed protein (Fig. 4B). This was also the case for other late endosomal and lysosomal protein and lipid markers (data not shown). Therefore, ectopic expression of SifA induces a profound reorganization of late endocytic structures and results in the formation of an unusual vesicular and tubular compartment. We next examined the intracellular localization and the consequences of the expression of GFP·SifAΔ6 in transfected cells. Compared with cells expressing the full-length version of SifA, a drastic reduction in the frequency of redistribution of Lamp1-containing structures was observed, and Sif-like tubules were very rarely seen (Fig. 3,B and C). Confocal imaging revealed that the GFP·SifAΔ6 fusion protein was localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 5), contrasting with the membrane distribution of GFP·SifA (Fig. 4). Therefore, we conclude that both membrane association and SifA activity in transfected cells are dependent on its C-terminal hexapeptide motif. To gain insight in the function of the C-terminal motif, the distribution of wild-type and mutant versions of the GFP-tagged version of SifA between soluble and membrane fractions of transfected cells was analyzed (Fig. 6). GFP·SifA was found to associate with the membrane fraction, whereas the majority of GFP·SifAΔ6 was found in the cytosol (Fig.6A), consistent with fluorescence microscopic observations (Fig. 5). Removal of the last or the last two amino acid residues did not result in a significant change in the distribution of the protein. By contrast, the deletion of the fi"

https://openalex.org/W2077032767,"The rapid migration of intestinal epithelial cells is important to the healing of mucosal ulcers and wounds. This cell migration requires the presence of polyamines and the activation of RhoA. RhoA activity, however, is not sufficient for migration because polyamine depletion inhibited the migration of IEC-6 cells expressing constitutively active RhoA. The current study examines the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in cell migration and whether their activities are polyamine-dependent. Polyamine depletion with α-difluoromethylornithine inhibited the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. This inhibition was prevented by supplying exogenous putrescine in the presence of α-difluoromethylornithine. IEC-6 cells transfected with constitutively active Rac1 and Cdc42 migrated more rapidly than vector-transfected cells, whereas cells expressing dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 migrated more slowly. Polyamine depletion had no effect on the migration of cells expressing Rac1 and only partially inhibited the migration of those expressing Cdc42. Although polyamine depletion caused the disappearance of actin stress fibers in cells transfected with empty vector, it had no effect on cells expressing Rac1. Constitutively active Rac1 increased RhoA and Cdc42 activity in both normal and polyamine-depleted cells. These results demonstrate that Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 are required for optimal epithelial cell migration and that Rac1 activity is sufficient for cell migration in the absence of polyamines due to its ability to activate RhoA and Cdc42 as well as its own effects on the process of cell migration. These data imply that the involvement of polyamines in cell migration occurs either at Rac1 itself or upstream from Rac1.

Dev. Dyn. 1992; 192: 2-10Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). New cells migrate from the crypts of the small intestine onto the villi and differentiate as they move toward the tips. Mature cells are sloughed into the lumen and replaced from below. The damaged mucosa rapidly repairs itself through two basic processes (2Siley W. Ito S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 217-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early phase consists of the loss of damaged cells and the migration of remaining viable cells over the denuded lamina propria. This process of early mucosal restitution rapidly seals the wound and re-establishes the barrier to luminal contents (3Moore R. Carlson S. Madara J.L. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 227-284Google Scholar). The later phase of mucosal repair is the replacement of lost cells by mitosis and does not take effect until 24 h or so after injury. We have examined the early phase and the process of cell migration using IEC-6 cells, a non-transformed, putative crypt cell line derived from adult rat intestine and originally described by Quaroni et al. (4Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This model resembles the early phase of mucosal healing in the gastrointestinal tract in that cell migration is independent from DNA synthesis, has a complete dependence on actin polymerization (5McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1992; 263: 426-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and depends on polyamines (6McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1993; 264: 367-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell migration requires an intact and functioning cytoskeleton, which for the most part consists of filamentous or F-actin, tubulin, and intermediate fibers. F-actin is formed by the polymerization of 420-kDa monomers termed G-actin. These filaments of actin with their associated binding proteins make up the actin cortex, a dense network just inside the inner surface of the plasma membrane (7Abraham V.C. Krishnamurthi V. Taylor D.L. Lanni F. Biophys. J. 1991; 77: 1721-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Long filaments of actin traverse the cell as stress fibers, and short filaments extend into the lamellipodia that are prominent during migration (8Pantoloni D. Le Clainche C. Carlier M.F. Science. 2001; 292: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions provide the necessary attachments to the substrate and via the stress fibers allow the cytoskeleton to exert force on the extracellular matrix (9Beningo K.A. Dembo M. Kaverina I. Small J.V. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 881-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells initiate migration in response to receptor signaling via integrins and the extracellular matrix (10Göke M. Zuk A. Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1996; 271: 729-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in response to soluble factors (11Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Soluble factor and integrin signaling is relayed to the cytoskeleton by signal transduction pathways involving a subgroup of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 8: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). The Rho (forRas homology) GTPases consist of three major types of small (21 kDa) proteins that bind and hydrolyze GTP. Their intrinsic GTPase activity is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins, known as GAPs. Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor is an inhibitory guanine nucleotide exchange factor that prevents the dissociation of guanosine diphosphate from Rho as well as from Rac and Cdc42, the two other members of this family (13Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mizuro T. Kaibuchi T. Yamamoto M. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Soc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rho and Rac regulate the polymerization of actin to produce stress fibers and lamellipodia, respectively (15Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 16Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been shown to be responsible for the formation of filopodia (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 8: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the Rho GTPases can be activated sequentially in that activation of Cdc42 activates Rac, which in turn activates Rho (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 8: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be a mechanism for the coordinated regulation of the cytoskeleton through activation of the Rho GTPases. Our laboratory has been interested in the cellular actions of polyamines, which are involved in many aspects of membrane function including stability, Ca2+ homeostasis, and ion transport (17Schuber F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Polyamines are also involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell migration. Polyamine-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells lack actin filaments and microtubules unless polyamines are supplied exogenously (18Pohjanpelto P. Virtanen I. Holtta E. Nature. 1981; 293: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of polyamine synthesis prevent concanavalin A-induced expression of α-tubulin and β-actin mRNAs in mouse splenocytes (19Kaminska B. Kazmareck L. Grzelakowska B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro, polyamines stimulate the rapid polymerization of G-actin and formation of bundles from F-actin, indicating a possible direct effect of polyamines on cytoskeletal organization (20Grant N.J. Orial-Audit C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 30: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the early phase of mucosal healing, which is due to cell migration, requires polyamines (21Wang J.-Y. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1990; 259: 584-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang J.-Y. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and that polyamine depletion inhibits migration in the IEC-6 cell model and leads to numerous alterations in the cytoskeleton. When cells were depleted of polyamines with α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO),1 which inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, the first rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, there was a significant decrease in actin stress fibers and a corresponding increase in the density of the actin cortex (23McCormack S.A. Wang J.-Y. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1994; 267: C715-C722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was also a redistribution of tropomyosin from stress fibers to the actin cortex. Additional changes in response to polyamine depletion included a marked reduction in the formation of lamellipodia and a dissociation of actin from nonmuscle myosin II (24Wang J.-Y. McCormack S.A. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1996; 270: G355-G362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although no changes occurred in the absolute amounts of G- and F-actin, the association of actin with the sequestering protein thymosin β4 was inhibited (25McCormack S.A. Ray R.M. Blanner P.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C459-C468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the alterations in the cytoskeleton as well as the inhibition of migration caused by DFMO were prevented if exogenous polyamines were supplied in the presence of DFMO. Santos et al. (26Santos M.F. McCormack S.A. Guo Z. Okolicany J. Zheng Y. Johnson L.R. Tigyi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Rho was required for the actual migration of IEC-6 cells after wounding or in response to growth factor stimulation. Migration was inhibited after microinjection of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin or Rho T19N, a dominant negative form of RhoA. Inactivation of Rho by these means not only inhibited migration but also altered the cytoskeleton in ways that were identical to those produced by polyamine depletion. With this in mind we recently examined the effects of polyamine depletion on RhoA (27Ray R.M. Patel A. Viar M.J. McCormack S.A. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that DFMO caused a significant decrease in RhoA levels in the cytoplasm and membranes of IEC-6 cells. This decrease was due to an approximate 50% inhibition in RhoA synthesis. Neither the half-life of RhoA nor the level of RhoA mRNA was affected. Constitutively active HA-V14 RhoA cells migrated much more rapidly than vector-transfected cells, and dominant negative HA-N19-RhoA cells exhibited almost no motility. Surprisingly, the depletion of polyamines almost totally inhibited the migration of the cells expressing constitutively active Rho. Polyamine depletion did not affect the activity of RhoA in the HA-V14-RhoA cells but inhibited it dramatically in the vector-transfected cells (27Ray R.M. Patel A. Viar M.J. McCormack S.A. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After the loss of polyamines, constitutively active HA-V14-RhoA cells had fewer stress fibers and took on the appearance of the HA-N19-RhoA cells and the polyamine-depleted wild type cells. Thus, although RhoA activity is essential for the migration of intestinal epithelial cells, it is not sufficient. And although polyamines are necessary for RhoA synthesis and activity, they are also required for an additional step either upstream or downstream from RhoA that results in cell migration (27Ray R.M. Patel A. Viar M.J. McCormack S.A. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both Rac1 and Cdc42 are excellent candidates for additional steps in the process of cell motility to be regulated by polyamines. There is considerable signaling cross-talk between Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, and each of these molecules regulates some aspect of cytoskeletal transformation (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 8: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 16Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). In fact Rac1 has also been shown to be involved in stress fiber formation (16Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). In the current paper, we show that the activities of Rac and Cdc42, like that of RhoA, are polyamine-dependent. We demonstrate that the rates of migration of IEC-6 cells transfected with constitutively active Rac or Cdc42 are significantly more rapid than those of the corresponding wild type cells or those transfected with empty vectors. We also demonstrate that Rac1 activation leads to RhoA and Cdc42 activation independent of polyamines, which explains the restoration of the cytoskeleton and migration rate in constitutively active Rac1 cells depleted of polyamines.

The IEC-6 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection at passage 13. IEC-6 cells originated from intestinal crypt cells as judged by morphological and immunological criteria. They are nontumorigenic and retain the undifferentiated character of epithelial stem cells. Stock cell cultures were maintained in T-150 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS, 10 μg insulin, and 0.05 mg of gentamicin sulfate/ml. The flasks were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2. Stock cells were passaged once a week at 1:20; medium was changed 3 times weekly. The cells were restarted from original frozen stock every seven passages. Tests for mycoplasma were routinely negative. The general protocol for the experiments and the methods used were similar to those described previously (27Ray R.M. Patel A. Viar M.J. McCormack S.A. Zheng Y. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, IEC-6 cells were plated at 6.25 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS, 10 μg of insulin, and 50 μg of gentamicin sulfate/ml (DMEM/dialyzed FBS, control) or in DMEM/dialyzed FBS containing 5 mm DFMO or DFMO plus 10 μm putrescine. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2. They were fed every other day and serum-starved during the 24 h before harvesting or cell migration assay. Previously we have shown that maximal depletion of polyamines occurs after 4 day of DFMO treatment (6McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1993; 264: 367-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pfeffer L.M. Yang C.H. Murti A. McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. J. Biol.

Wang J.-Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C590-C598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In IEC-6 cells putrescine was completely absent after 6 h of exposure to DFMO and after 24 h to spermidine, and 40% of the spermine remained after 4 days. DFMO inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, preventing the synthesis of putrescine; therefore, exogenous addition of putrescine along with DFMO restores endogenous spermidine and spermine. Thus, cells grown in DFMO plus putrescine are an important control showing that effects are due to the depletion of polyamines and not to pharmacological effects of DFMO. Cells were grown in control medium for 4 days or in medium to which DFMO was added at the time of plating for 4 days or on days 1, 2, and 3 during feeding for 3-, 2-, and 1-day treatments, respectively. Another group of cells was grown in DFMO plus putrescine for 4 days. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before the experiment (during day 4). For the cell migration assay, plates containing a confluent monolayer of cells were marked in the center by drawing a line along the diameter of the plate with a black marker. Wounding of the monolayer was carried out perpendicular to the marked line using a gel-loading micro-tip. Plates were washed, and the area of migration was photographed with a video camera system using NIH Image software (Version 1.58*) at the intersection of the marked line and wound edge at 0 h (WW0) and at desired time intervals (WWT). Cell migration was calculated as wound width covered at time t (WW0 − WWT) and expressed as % control. Each experiment was carried out three times in duplicate, and each plate was wounded twice. Therefore, n was considered to be 6 even though results are the means of 12 observations. Biological activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins were assayed by pull-down assays following the method of Kranenburg et al. (30Kranenburg O. Poland M. vanHorck F.P.G. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). GST-Rho-kinase, GST-mDia, GST-PKN, and GST-PAK fusion proteins were prepared by lysing the bacteria (Escherichia coliBL21-DE-3pLysE strain transformed with GST fusion protein construct) in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysates were then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 15 min. The fusion proteins were recovered by the addition of glutathione beads to the supernatants. The beads were washed three times in cell lysis buffer and resuspended before the addition of the cell lysates (200 μg of protein for RhoA and Cdc42 and 100 μg of protein for Rac1). After 1 h of tumbling at 4 °C, beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the amounts of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using RhoA-, Rac1-, and Cdc42-specific antibodies. Protein (20 μg) from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE to determine the levels of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins. Protein was separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting. The membranes were then probed with an antibody directed against one of the proteins (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, or actin). Immunocomplexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system and quantitated by densitometric scanning. IEC-6 cells were transfected with constitutively active and dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 as well as vector. DNA was prepared by using a Qiagen (endotoxin-free) plasmid preparation kit. Cells were grown as mentioned earlier to 70–80% confluence in 60-mm culture dishes. FuGENE 6 reagent was mixed with constitutively active (pMX-IRES-GFP-V12-Rac1), dominant negative (pMX-IRES-GFP-N17-Rac1), constitutively active (pMX-IRES-GFP-F28L-Cdc42), dominant negative (pMX-IRES-GFP-N17-Cdc42), or vector (pMX-IRES-GFP) DNA (3 μl: 2 μg) in serum-free medium to a total volume of 100 μl and incubated 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was added dropwise onto monolayers of cells containing 4.0 ml of serum-free medium and further incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Cells were fed after 12 h with fresh medium. The limiting dilution technique was used to select stable clones. Selected clones were grown to confluence, and the characterization of clones was carried out by measuring cell migration and the direct visualization of green fluorescence protein (GFP). Transfected cells were grown for 4 days, trypsinized, replated in 35-mm dishes (each containing a matrigel-coated glass coverslip), and allowed to attach and spread. Cells were fixed with 4.0% formaldehyde, washed with DPBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 3% BSA for 20 min. Cell monolayers were stained with Rac1 antibody for 1 h followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red (Chemicon Intl., Temecula, CA) at a 1:60 dilution for 1 h. Images were captured by digital confocal microscopy and processed with NIH image. Control, DFMO, and DFMO plus putrescine-treated (4 day) V12- Rac1, F28L-Cdc42, and vector-transfected cells were plated in 35-mm dishes (each containing a matrigel-coated glass coverslip) and allowed to attach and spread for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4.0% formaldehyde, washed with DPBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 3% BSA for 20 min. Cell monolayers were stained with Texas-red conjugated phalloidin for 1 h. Images were captured by digital confocal microscopy and processed with NIH image. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. from six dishes. Autoradiographic results were repeated three times. Densitometry of Western blots was done by NIH image analysis. The significance of the differences was determined using Dunnett's multiple-range test (R), and values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. To study the effect of polyamine depletion on activities of Rho family GTPases, it is important to determine the relative amounts of activated RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in normal IEC-6 cells. Whole cell extracts equivalent to 25–200 μg of protein were subjected to pull-down assay using either GST-PKN and GST-mDia (for RhoA) or GST-PAK (for Rac1 and Cdc42) protein. Pull-down samples along with 25 μg of whole cell extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Confluent IEC-6 cells grown in control medium showed high levels of active Rac1 protein in as low as 25 μg of total protein (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a significant amount of active RhoA protein was detected only in 200 μg of total protein (Fig. 1B). Although active Cdc42 protein was evident in as low as 50 μg of total protein, the total amount of activated Cdc42 was lower than amounts of active Rac1 and RhoA (Fig.1C). Total protein levels of RhoA and Rac1 were comparable and significantly higher than that of Cdc42. Thus, in subsequent experiments we used 100 μg of total protein for Rac1 and 200 μg of total protein for the determination of RhoA and Cdc42 activity. Polyamine depletion by treatment of cells with DFMO for 4 days significantly decreased the activities of all three Rho GTPases (Fig.2). Active RhoA decreased to 35 or 20% of control levels depending on whether binding to mDia or to PKN was used in the pull-down assay, respectively. There was also a 40% decrease in the level of RhoA protein when cells were grown for 4 days in the presence of DFMO. PAK1 was used to pull down both active Rac1 and active Cdc42. Rac1 activity was reduced to 40% and Cdc42 activity was reduced to 23% that of control levels. There was no change in the level of Rac1 protein, but Cdc42 levels decreased to 45% of normal. In each case supplying putrescine along with DFMO during growth prevented the decrease (Fig. 2).Figure 2Polyamine depletion inhibits activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in IEC-6 cells. Cells were grown in the presence of 5 mm DFMO or DFMO plus 10 μmputrescine for 4 days. Equal amounts of protein (200 μg for RhoA and Cdc42 and 100 μg for Rac1) were used for the pull-down assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 25 μg of protein was used to determine the levels of total RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 proteins.

There were dramatic decreases in the activities of all 3 to below 50% that of control on the 4th day of DFMO treatment. The levels of RhoA and Cdc42 proteins followed a similar pattern, and there was no significant decrease in Rac1 protein (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B illustrates the means of the quantified data of the activities of all three Rho GTPases. As in the studies depicted in Fig. 2, the addition of putrescine to the incubation medium containing DFMO prevented all of the effects of ornithine decarboxylase inhibition. Clones of IEC-6 cells transfected with vector and with dominant negative and constitutively active genes of Rac1 and Cdc42 were characterized by the direct visualization of green fluorescent protein and by determining rates of cell migration. Digital confocal micrographs of one clone of each of the five types are shown in Fig.4. In each case, all cells expressed GFP, indicating successful transfection and clonal selection. Transfection with dominant negative constructs of both Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibited cell migration compared with vector-transfected cells, whereas transfection with constitutively active constructs significantly increased the rates of migration (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, by 8 h vector-transfected cells had migrated to cover ∼40% of the original wound. This number was reduced to 25% in cells carrying dominant negative Rac1 and to 10% in cells with dominant negative Cdc42. On the other hand, cells transfected with constitutively active Rac1 covered more than 85% of the wound width and those with constitutively active Cdc42 had migrated over 60% of the original wound.Figure 5Rac1 and Cdc42 protein expression influences IEC-6 cell migration. A, cells transfected with vector (pMX-IRES-GFP), constitutively active (CA) Rac1 and Cdc42, and dominant negative (DN) Rac1 and Cdc42 were grown in DMEM, 5% FBS for 4 days. Confluent monolayers were wounded with a gel-loading tip in the center of plates marked to localize the wound site. Plates were photographed immediately to record the wound width (0 h), washed, and incubated with fresh serum free medium. Plates were photographed at the marked wound location after 10 h of incubation. A plate containing vector cells at 0 and 10 h is shown as a representative control.

Melanoma cells have been shown previously to bind distinct triple-helical regions within basement membrane (type IV) collagen. Additionally, tumor cell binding sites within type IV collagen contain glycosylated hydroxylysine residues. In the present study, we have utilized triple-helical models of the type IV collagen α1(IV)1263–1277 sequence to (a) determine the melanoma cell receptor for this ligand and (b) analyze the results of single-site glycosylation on melanoma cell recognition. Receptor identification was achieved by a combination of methods, including (a) cell adhesion and spreading assays using triple-helical α1(IV)1263–1277 and an Asp1266Abu variant, (b) inhibition of cell adhesion and spreading assays, and (c) triple-helical α1(IV)1263–1277 affinity chromatography with whole cell lysates and glycosaminoglycans. Triple-helical α1(IV)1263–1277 was bound by melanoma cell CD44/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan receptors and not by the collagen-binding integrins or melanoma-associated proteoglycan. Melanoma cell adhesion to and spreading on the triple-helical α1(IV)1263–1277 sequence was then compared for glycosylated (replacement of Lys1265 with Hyl(O-β-d-galactopyranosyl))versus non-glycosylated ligand. Glycosylation was found to strongly modulate both activities, as adhesion and spreading were dramatically decreased due to the presence of galactose. CD44/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan did not bind to glycosylated α1(IV)1263–1277. Overall, this study (a) is the first demonstration of the prophylactic effects of glycosylation on tumor cell interaction with the basement membrane, (b) provides a rare example of an apparent unfavorable interaction between carbohydrates, and (c) suggests that sugars may mask “cryptic sites” accessible to tumor cells with cell surface or secreted glycosidase activities.

Tumor cell invasion, a key step in the metastatic process, involves a complex series of correlated macromolecular interactions. These include interaction with, and movement through, collagen, most often type I and/or basement membrane (type IV) collagen. In general, invasion of the basement membrane is believed to be a critical step in the metastatic process.

Glycosylation is believed to have three important biological roles (34Bertozzi C.R. Kiessling L.L. Science. 2001; 291: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 35Helenius A. Aebi M.

First, glycosylation can serve as a recognition marker for a cell, both in the context of cell-cell and cell-extracellular-matrix interactions. A second role concerns the alteration glycosylation has on the physical properties of the protein. Frequently, glycosylation will render a protein resistant to hydrolysis, significantly increase solubility of a protein, or even drastically affect the overall folding and/or physical bulk of a protein. In the case of collagen-like triple helices, the addition of β-d-galactose to Thr in the Yyy position of either (Gly-Pro-Yyy)10 or (Gly-Hyp-Yyy)10 greatly enhances triple-helical stability compared with Thr alone (39Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Bann J.G. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24466-24469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A third role for glycosylation is in signal transduction and may be analogous to or compete with protein phosphorylation (37Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). For example, addition of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine to insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 apparently decreases phosphorylation and affects insulin-mediated homeostatsis. Prior studies have focused on the carbohydrate structures expressed on the tumor cell surface (34Bertozzi C.R. Kiessling L.L.

The effects of glycosylated triple-helical structure on cellular systems have not been addressed. In the present study, we sought to (a) determine the melanoma cell receptor for triple-helical IV-H1 and (b) analyze the results of IV-H1 single-site glycosylation on triple-helical stability and melanoma cell recognition of this ligand. We have used collagen-model triple-helical peptides of the general sequence (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)m (wheren = 4 or 6 and m = 4 or 0) for both goals. Affinity chromatography and melanoma cell adhesion/inhibition assays were utilized to determine the cellular receptor for triple-helical IV-H1. To evaluate the effects of glycosylation, the desired peptides and peptide-amphiphiles were assembled, and biophysical comparisons were first performed using CD spectroscopy to determine the conformational effects of single site glycosylation. Melanoma cell adhesion and spreading on the respective peptide-amphiphile ligands were then quantitated to evalulate the biological consequences of glycosylation. All standard peptide synthesis chemicals were peptide synthesis grade or better and purchased from FisherBiotech. HOAt and HATU were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Fmoc-4-((2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl)aminomethyl)phenoxy resin (substitution level = 0.55 mmol/g), and Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were purchased from Novabiochem/Calbiochem. Amino acids are of thel-configuration (except for Gly). Palmitic acid (CH3-(CH2)14-CO2H, designated C16) was purchased from Fisher. Hyl was isolated from porcine gelatin by hydrolysis followed by multiple passages over an ion-exchange column (46Hamilton P.B. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 213: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous Hyl solution was acidified with HCl and evaporated to obtain crystals of Hyl. The Hyl was recrystallized when necessary. Analysis was performed using a Crownpak CR+ column (150 × 4 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 0 °C at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The mobile phase was 0.13 m aqueous perchloric acid. Detection was at λ = 200 nm. Fmoc-Hyl(ε-Boc,O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)), branched α1(IV)1263–1277 THP, and branched Hyl(Gal)1265-α1(IV)1263–1277 THP were prepared as described previously (47Fields C.G.

Peptide-resin assembly was performed by Fmoc solid-phase methodology on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/ABD 433A peptide synthesizer by methods described previously in our laboratory (18Yu Y.-C.

Fmoc-Hyl(ε-Boc,O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)) was coupled manually in an orbital shaker using 3-fold molar excesses of Fmocamino acid and HOAt, a 2.7-fold molar excess of HATU, and a 6-fold molar excess of N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine in 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide for 18 h. Subsequent amino acids were coupled on the instrument. Peptide-resins were characterized by Edman degradation sequence analysis as described previously for “embedded” (non-covalent) sequencing (51Fields C.G. VanDrisse V.L. Fields G.B. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer/120A analyzer. Peptide-resins were then either (a) cleaved or (b) acylated with the C16 alkyl tail (19Yu Y.-C. Tirrell M. Fields G.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9979-9987Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and then cleaved. Cleavage and side-chain deprotection of the peptide-resin proceeded for 2 h using ethanedithiol/thioanisole/phenol/water/trifluoroacetic acid (2.5:5:5:5:82.5) as described (52Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 6661-6664Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cleavage solution was extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether prior to purification. The glycosylated peptide was deacetylated with methanolic sodium methoxide (2 m) for 1 h at 20 °C (53Paulsen H. Schultz M. Klamann J.D. Waller B. Pall M. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985; : 2028-2048Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RP-HPLC purification was performed on a Rainin AutoPrep system. Peptides were purified with a Vydac 218TP152022 C18column (15–20-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 250 × 25 mm) at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. The elution gradient was 0–85% B in 85 min where A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Detection was at λ = 229 nm. Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with an ODS Hypersil C18 RP column (5-μm particle size, 120-Å pore size, 100 × 2.1 mm). Eluants were the same as for peptide purification. The elution gradient was 0–100% B in 30 min with a flow of 0.3 ml/min. Diode array detection was at λ = 220, 254, and 280 nm. MALDI-MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A LD-TOF mass spectrometer using either a sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-benzoic acid (9:1, v/v) matrix (54Henkel W.

Peptide mass values were as follows: (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2, [M+H]+ 3573.3 Da (theoretical 3574.9 Da); Hyl(Gal)1265-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2, [M+H]+ 3752.4 Da (theoretical 3751.1 Da); C16-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2, [M+H]+ 3811.5 Da (theoretical 3813.3 Da); C16-Hyl(Gal)1265-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2, [M+H]+ 3992.0 Da (theoretical 3989.1 Da); and C16-Abu1267-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-IV-H1-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2, [M+H]+ 3781.9 Da (theoretical 3783.4 Da). A sample of peptide was dissolved in 85% H2SO4 and heated at 80 °C for 35 min. After cooling, carbazole (1 mg/ml in ethanol) was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The presence of carbohydrate was monitored by an increase in absorbance at λ = 490 nm (55Chrums S.C. CRC Handbook of Chromatography. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1982: 190Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190–250 nm on a JASCO J-600 using a 10-mm path length quartz cell. The peptide concentration (14 μm in water) was kept constant for all the experiments. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm, whereas the temperature was continuously increased in the range of 5–80 °C at a rate of 12 °C/h. Temperature was controlled using a JASCO PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the reflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm). Alternatively,Tm was evaluated from the midpoint of the transition. SK-Mel2, M14P, M14#5, and M14#11 human melanoma cells were propagated as described previously (2Miles A.J. Skubitz A.P.N.

Briefly, melanoma cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged eight times and then replaced from frozen stocks of early passage cells to minimize phenotypic drift. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. All media reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific. The cell surface CD44 or β1 integrin subunit concentration was evaluated for M14P, M14#5, and M14#11 human melanoma cells by ELISA. Briefly, cells were diluted in PBS and plated at various concentrations on a 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and the PBS was removed. The cells were fixed with methanol, and the plate was blocked with BSA at 4 °C. Anti-CD44 mAb, anti β1-integrin subunit mAb, or an equivalent concentration of IgG was diluted in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2 mg/ml BSA and incubated at 4 °C. The plate was washed with PBST and subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBST and 2 mg/ml BSA. The plate was washed and horseradish peroxidase detected using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Pierce). Melanoma cell adhesion to substrate-coated Pro-BindTM 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) was performed as described previously (4Lauer J.L. Gendron C.M. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Peptide-amphiphiles dissolved in PBS were diluted in 70% ethanol and added to the 96-well plate and allowed to adsorb overnight at room temperature with mixing. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were released with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed 2× with adhesion medium (20 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml albumin in Eagle's minimum essential medium or RPMI 1640), and labeled with 5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Unincorporated fluorophore was removed by repeated washings with adhesion medium. Cells were then resuspended in adhesion medium and added to the plate. The plate was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing three times with adhesion medium. Adherent cells were lysed with 0.2% SDS and quantitated with a SpectraMAX Gemini, 96-well plate spectraflurometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were labeled with 5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, and Pro-BindTM 96-well plates were coated with peptides or proteins as in the adhesion assay. The cells were preincubated with various concentrations of mAbs (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), GAGs, or chondroitinase ACII in the presence of 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride for 60 min at 37 °C after they had been harvested. The cells were added to the wells to evaluate the adhesion to coated peptides or proteins in the continued presence of mAbs or GAGs. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37"
https://openalex.org/W2059247797,"PNUTS, Phosphatase 1NUclear Targeting Subunit, is a recently described protein that targets protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the nucleus. In the present study, we characterized the biochemical properties of PNUTS. A variety of truncation and site-directed mutants of PNUTS was prepared and expressed either as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli or as FLAG-tagged proteins in 293T cells. A 50-amino acid domain in the center of PNUTS mediated both high affinity PP1 binding and inhibition of PP1 activity. The PP1-binding domain is related to a motif found in several other PP1-binding proteins but is distinct in that Trp replaces Phe. Mutation of the Trp residue essentially abolished the ability of PNUTS to bind to and inhibit PP1. The central PP1-binding domain of PNUTS was an effective substrate for protein kinase A in vitro, and phosphorylation substantially reduced the ability of PNUTS to bind to PP1 in vitro and following stimulation of protein kinase A in intact cells. In vitro RNA binding experiments showed that a C-terminal region including several RGG motifs and a novel repeat domain rich in His and Gly interacted with mRNA and single-stranded DNA. PNUTS exhibited selective binding for poly(A) and poly(G) compared with poly(U) or poly(C) ribonucleotide homopolymers, with specificity being mediated by distinct regions within the domain rich in His and Gly and the domain containing the RGG motifs. Finally, a PNUTS-PP1 complex was isolated from mammalian cell lysates using RNA-conjugated beads. Together, these studies support a role for PNUTS in protein kinase A-regulated targeting of PP1 to specific RNA-associated complexes in the nucleus.

During the cell cycle, biochemical and genetic studies have shown that PP1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation (19Kwon Y.G. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We and others have reported recently (30Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol.

PNUTS exhibits a discrete nuclear compartmentalization and is found in a stable complex with PP1 in mammalian cell lysates. Recombinant PNUTS potently inhibits the catalytic activity of PP1 toward exogenous substrate in vitro. Primary sequence analysis indicates that the C terminus of PNUTS contains several closely spaced RGG sequences, motifs that are often found in RNA-binding proteins (32Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). PNUTS also contains a novel region of repetitive amino acid sequence that is rich in His and Gly, and a putative Zn2+ finger domain with the signature CX8CX5CX3H. In the present study, we have characterized further the biochemical properties of PNUTS. PNUTS contains a short ∼50-amino acid central region that contains closely associated PP1-binding domains and inhibitory domains. Moreover, the interaction of PNUTS with PP1 is regulated by phosphorylation within the binding domain. We have also found that PNUTS binds to homopolymeric RNA with high selectivity for poly(A) and poly(G) via the RGG motifs and the novel region rich in His and Gly. These studies support the conclusion that PNUTS may mediate the reversible association of PP1 with specific RNAs in the nucleus of mammalian cells. Ribonucleotide homopolymer-agarose beads were obtained from Sigma. An in vitro transcription and translation kit was purchased from Promega. [35S]Methionine, ssDNA-agarose (1–3 mg of denatured calf thymus DNA/ml gel), secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Synthetic peptides (DARPP-32-(1–39) (with a Cys residue included at the C terminus), PNUTS-(392–408), PNUTS-(392–415), PNUTS-(392–408;W401A), and PNUTS-(392–415;W401Y)) were prepared by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center, Yale University. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) was purified from bovine heart as described (33Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F.

Choi and M.-Y. Choi, respectively. Full-length DARPP-32 was expressed in bacteria, purified, and phosphorylated at Thr34 with PKA and ATPγS essentially as described (36Desdouits F. Cheetham J.J. Huang H.-B. Kwon Y.-G. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Denefle P. Ehrlich M.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.-A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA fragments of PNUTS were amplified byPfu polymerase; PCR products were digested bySalI/NotI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pcDNA1Neo (Invitrogen) (encoding a FLAG epitope with a 5′SalI site in-frame with the FLAG sequence). Internal deletion mutants were prepared from the ligation of two individual PCR fragments. HEK293T cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium (10% fetal bovine serum) were transiently transfected with different plasmids (10 μg) using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were washed with fresh medium 5 h after transfection and were cultured for 16 h. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A and chymostatin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were briefly sonicated and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration of supernatants was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates (1 mg) were incubated with anti-FLAG affinity beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer and eluted from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) by electroblotting (200 mA, overnight). Blots were incubated with either an anti-FLAG antibody or an anti-PP1α antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized using ECL. The cDNAs encoding various deletion mutants of PNUTS were amplified by PCR with primers containing 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI restriction sites. PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into the pGEX-5x-1 expression vector. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli(BL21 DE3), and bacteria were cultured in LB media in the presence of 50 mg/ml ampicillin to an A600 value of 0.6–0.8 at 37 °C. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), and lysed by sonication on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were loaded onto a column containing glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed extensively with PBS. Fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. Point mutations were produced by Quick Change Mutation Kit using the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The W401A, V399A, K397A, and R396A mutant cDNAs were prepared byPfu-mediated PCR using pGEX-5x-1 vectors containing wild-type PNUTS-(382–433) and PNUTS-(382–450). The primers used are as follow: W401A, 5′-GAAAAACTGTGACGGCGCCTGAGGAGGGC-3′; V399A, 5′-GAAAGAGAAAAACTGCGACGTGGCCTGAGG-3′; K397A, 5′-GGGCAGAAAGAGAGCAACTGTGACGTGGCC-3′; and R396A, 5′-CGAAAGGGCAGAAAGGCAAAAACTGTGACGTGG-3′. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purified rabbit muscle PP1 was kindly provided by Dr. Hsien-bin Huang. PP1 was assayed using [32P]phosphorylase a as substrate essentially as described (34Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays (final volume 30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mm EGTA, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/w) Brij 35, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm caffeine, 10 μm[32P]phosphorylase a, various concentrations of GST fusion proteins, and <0.1 unit/ml of PP1α (∼50 pm). All components except [32P]phosphorylasea were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min. Assays were initiated by addition [32P]phosphorylase a; incubations were performed at 30 °C for 10 min and then terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged for 3 min, and 32P in the supernatant was measured by Cerenkov counting. Various GST-PNUTS mutants (7 μg) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and then mixed with PC12 cell lysates (1 mg of protein with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and chymostatin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 2 h. After centrifugation, beads were washed with lysis buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). PP1 was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-PP1α antibody. PP1 overlay assays were carried out essentially as described (37Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% (w/v) dried milk, and 0.1% Tween 20. Filters were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated with PBS/Nonidet P-40 containing 0.1 μg/ml recombinant PP1 and 100 nmmicrocystin (to inhibit potential dephosphorylation of PNUTS) for 2 h at 4 °C. Filters were washed with PBS/Nonidet P-40, and bound PP1 was detected by immunoblotting using PP1α antibody. PC12 cells were incubated in 200 μCi/ml of [32P]inorganic phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and phosphate-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. After metabolic labeling, cells were washed three times with PBS, harvested by lysis in an immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF), and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Unlabeled HEK293 cells, incubated in the absence or presence of 8-Br-cAMP, were lysed in the same way. Lysates were incubated with control IgG or anti-PNUTS antibody in the absence or presence of antigen peptide, followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-agarose with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). Gels were dried, and proteins were visualized by either autoradiography (32P-labeled samples) or by immunoblotting with PNUTS or PP1α antibodies. Phosphorylation reactions were performed using the protein of interest and the catalytic subunit of PKA (40 μg/ml) in an incubation mixture using 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (50 μm) in the absence or presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated at various time points by dilution of the reaction mixture into SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was assessed after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. After autoradiography, gel pieces containing 32P-labeled GST-PNUTS-(382–433), GST-PNUTS-(382–486), or PNUTS were re-swollen in destain (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid in water), washed twice with 50% methanol, and dried. Gel pieces were then incubated withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (50 μg/ml, Worthington) in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0 (1 ml), for 18 h at 37 °C. The supernatants containing the soluble phosphopeptides were recovered after centrifugation. The extraction efficiency (∼85%) was quantified by Cerenkov counting of the gel pieces and supernatants before and after digestion. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (38Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping, electrophoretic separation was at pH 3.5 for 90 min at 400 V, and ascending chromatography was in pyridine/n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12). The pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was detected by autoradiography. For phosphoamino acid analysis, ∼10% of the digested sample was hydrolyzed in HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Lysates were lyophilized and resolved in pH 1.9 buffer containing standard phosphoamino acids (o-phospho-dl-serine,o-phospho-dl-threonine, ando-phospho-dl-tyrosine from Sigma). Phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis. Standard amino acids were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and autoradiography was used to detect phosphorylated amino acids. GST fusion proteins (10–40 ng) were incubated with ∼5 ng of 32P-radiolabeled β-globin mRNA in binding buffer (total volume 40 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 40 ng of RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. After addition of 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue, reaction mixtures were separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel for 2–3 h at 20 mA (about 6 V/cm) at room temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm MP. cDNA encoding full-length PNUTS was subcloned into the pGEM T vector (Promega); the plasmid was linearized by digestion with ScaI and used as a template for RNA synthesis with T7 polymerase. The resulting RNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions (Amersham Biosciences). Translated protein was analyzed SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and autoradiography. Assays were initiated by addition of 25 μl of ribonucleotide homopolymer-agarose or ssDNA-agarose into binding buffer with various GST fusion proteins (total volume of 125 μl of 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, or other salt at the indicated concentrations, 1 mm PMSF) at 4 °C. After 30 min of incubation, beads were centrifuged and washed 6 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and immunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody. Binding of in vitro translated protein to ribonucleotide homopolymer-agarose was performed essentially as described (39Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). An equivalent of 105 cpm of 35S-labeled in vitro translation product and 25 μl of homopolymer RNA beads were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 0.25 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, at the salt concentrations indicated). The beads were pelleted by a brief centrifugation and washed 5 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer, and protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and autoradiography. HEK293T cells were lysed by brief sonication in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A and chymostatin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (400 μl, 500 μg of protein) was mixed with 50 μl of homopolymer RNA beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were centrifuged and washed 5 times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl, and proteins were eluted in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using antibodies against PNUTS, PP1α, and hnRNP C, and detection was by the ECL method. For poly(G) column chromatography, 2 ml of the supernatants (2 mg of protein) were mixed with 200 μl of poly(G) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed once with 1 ml of lysis buffer and loaded onto a column, which was then washed extensively with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0.1–2.0 mNaCl gradient in lysis buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against PNUTS, PP1α, PP1γ, and hnRNP C. Previous studies (30Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown that full-length PNUTS and PNUTS-(309–872) (the protein product of clone 14 originally isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen) were able to interact with PP1α. To characterize further the interaction of PP1 and PNUTS protein, various FLAG-tagged PNUTS fragments were expressed in HEK293T cells, proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and PP1α was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.1). All the PNUTS fragments were expressed at equivalent levels (data not shown). PP1 was bound to fragments containing residues 309–872, 309–589, 309–433, 357–537, 357–486, 357–433, 143–433, and a fragment between residues 143 and 872 with an internal deletion of residues 434–589. A low level of PP1 was found to bind to PNUTS-(309–401), but no binding was detected for PNUTS-(404–537), PNUTS-(590–872), and PNUTS-(724–872) or for two fragments with an internal deletion of residues 254–589. Together, these results indicate that PP1 binds to PNUTS between residues 357 and 433, with the C-terminal boundary of the binding site close to residue 401. The viability of the 293T cells was significantly affected by transfection with many of the PNUTS plasmids. Notably, all of the PNUTS fragments that bound strongly to PP1 caused cell death (Fig. 1). Neither a nuclear localization signal (a KKKRK motif at residues 157–161) nor the C-terminal region (residues 590–872) was required for cell toxicity. Expression of PNUTS-(357–486) caused cell toxicity more effectively than PNUTS-(357–433) or PNUTS-(309–433), suggesting that residues 434–486 contributed to regulation of cell viability but were not required for PP1 binding. Our previous studies showed that a GST fusion protein containing residues 309–872 potently inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 in vitro (30Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1 and other preliminary studies indicated that both PP1 binding and inhibition appeared to be contained within residues 382–537 of PNUTS. Various GST fusion proteins containing residues 382–537 of PNUTS were expressed in bacteria, purified, and incubated with a 293T cell extract. PP1 co-precipitated with GST-PNUTS fusion proteins containing residues 382–486, 382–450, 382–444, 382–438, 382–433, and 382–417 (Fig. 2).

Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The receptor for CGRP, the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) requires interaction with the accessory protein, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP 1), to form a functional CGRP receptor. RAMP 1 belongs to a three-member family of integral membrane proteins that share ∼30% sequence homology. The RAMPs are 150–177 amino acids in size with a cleavable signal peptide, relatively large N-terminal extracellular domain, one transmembrane-spanning domain, and a nine-amino acid intracellular C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1). CRLR associated with RAMP 1 has high affinity for CGRP, whereas association with RAMP 2 and RAMP 3 results in higher affinity for adrenomedullin (2McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The association of CRLR and RAMP 1 occurs early after translation. The first report of the discovery of the RAMPs (2McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) and subsequent studies show that RAMP 1 influences the glycosylation and trafficking of CRLR to the cell surface (3Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of RAMP 2 and 3 is required for their cell surface expression in the absence of CRLR (4Flahaut M. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14731-14737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RAMP 1, unlike RAMP 2 and 3, is not glycosylated and therefore requires association with CRLR for cell surface expression. This functional interaction continues at the cell surface where RAMP 1 enables CGRP binding and signaling, and the heterodimer can be cross-linked and immunoprecipitated with CGRP (5Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain (ECD) of RAMP is largely responsible for determining CRLR ligand specificity for either CGRP or adrenomedullin although domain swapping between the ECD and TM/tail of RAMPs 1 and 2 suggests that the TM and/or tail may play a minor role (6Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Similar to the RAMPs, the extracellular N terminus of several members of the B class of receptors also plays an important role in receptor-ligand association as demonstrated by cross-linking (7Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), chimera (8Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis studies (9Carter P.H. Shimizu M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31955-31960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, the exogenously expressed N-terminal domain of the PTH receptor is able to associate with PTH (10Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M. Reusch D. Esswein A. Schafer W. Rucknagel K.P. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8878-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another accessory protein known to assist a GPCR in its function is LRP6. LRP6 is also a single transmembrane-spanning protein that associates with the GPCR, frizzled, and promotes its activity. The ECD of LRP6 can associate with frizzled, and an LRP6 mutant lacking its cytosolic tail is a dominant negative for frizzled function (11Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). To determine the function of each of the three domains (ECD, TM, and tail) of human RAMP 1, we made the following three mutants: the ECD and TM of RAMP 1 without the tail, a chimera of the ECD of RAMP 1 with the TM and tail from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and the ECD of RAMP 1 alone. These RAMP 1 mutants were examined for their ability to functionally couple with CRLR to effect CGRP-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation, CGRP binding, CRLR trafficking, and cell surface expression. All RAMP 1 mutants were able to associate with CRLR with full efficacy for CGRP-stimulated cAMP accumulation. However, the RAMP 1-ECD/PDGFR TM/tail mutant demonstrated a moderate decrease in potency for CGRP signaling and binding, whereas the RAMP-ECD mutant was more severely affected. CRLR cell surface expression was retained with all RAMP 1 mutants, although the RAMP 1 mutant consisting of the ECD alone functioned less efficiently and was secreted into the medium. The ECD of RAMP 1 was also shown to interact specifically with the N terminus of CRLR. The full-length human RAMP 1 was PCR-amplified from human brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). An oligonucleotide primer encoding a 5′ HindIII restriction site, followed by theHaemophilus influenza hemagglutinin cleavable signal peptide sequence (MKTILALSTYIFCLVFA) (12Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the c-myc antigen epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL) was used to replace the native signal peptide in-frame with the remaining RAMP 1 sequence using PCR. The RAMP 1 C-terminal tail truncation was made by PCR amplification of wild type RAMP 1 cDNA using an antisense primer that inserted a stop codon after Trp-139, the last predicted amino acid of the transmembrane domain (see Fig. 1). The RAMP 1 chimera consisting of the RAMP 1-ECD and the PDGF receptor TM and tail domains was constructed by PCR amplification of wild type RAMP 1 cDNA using a long antisense primer coding for the TM and first nine amino acids of the C-terminal tail of the human PDGFR (see Fig. 1). The RAMP 1-ECD was made by PCR amplification of wild type RAMP 1 cDNA using an antisense primer that replaced the codon for the first amino acid in the transmembrane domain with a stop codon (see Fig. 1). The full-length human CRLR was PCR-amplified from human brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). An oligonucleotide primer encoding a 5′ HindIII restriction site, followed by the H. influenza hemagglutinin cleavable signal peptide sequence (MKTILALSTYIFCLVFA) (12Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the influenza virus hemagglutinin antigen epitope (HA1) sequence (YPYDVPVYA), was used to replace the native signal peptide in-frame with the remaining CRLR sequence using PCR. This construct of CRLR and a similar construct containing an enhanced GFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) C-terminal fusion (CRLR-GFP) were cloned into PEAK 12 vector (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) at the HindIII and NotI restriction sites. All studies were performed using human embryonic kidney 293 tsA 201 cells (tsA 201) (a kind gift from Ronald Li, Institute of Molecular Cardiobiology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). tsA 201 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioFluids Inc., Rockville, MD) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated in humidified air supplemented with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections of tsA 201 cells were performed in either six-well culture plates (5 × 105 cells per well) or 10-cm round culture plates (5 × 106 cells) using Polyfect (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the cAMP and binding studies, cells were split 8 h after transfection and cultured in the above medium until assayed at 24 h post-transfection. Eight h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well. The cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C, 50 pm [125I]CGRP (human 8–37) (2200 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min with and without increasing concentrations of unlabelled human CGRP. The cells were washed one time with PBS containing 1% BSA and were collected with 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH added to each well. Radioactivity was detected in a γ-counter (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). Nonspecific binding (determined in the presence of 1 μm CGRP) was always less than 10% of total binding. Binding assays were performed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. IC50 values were determined using a nonlinear regression curve-fitting computer program within PRISM, version 2.0 (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Intracellular cAMP levels were assayed using a modification of the procedure described by Salomon et al.(13Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 h after transfection, tsA 201 cells were trypsinized and reseeded in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and [3H]adenine (2 mCi/ml). The cells were washed with DMEM alone for 10 min and incubated in DMEM with or without the indicated concentrations of human CGRP, BSA (1%), and isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min. Following the aspiration of the incubation medium, 100 μl of 5% SDS/1 mm cAMP solution was used to lyse the cells. Intracellular [3H]cAMP released into the lysate was measured by successive column chromatography using a Dowex AG-50W-X4 resin (Bio-Rad) followed by aluminum oxide (Sigma). Eluates were collected in scintillation vials, and radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). cAMP assays were performed in triplicate in at least six separate experiments. Each assay included an experimental positive control group of cells expressing native human HA-CRLR-GFP and native RAMP 1. Positive control cells stimulated 20-fold over basal, whereas mock (vector alone) and untransfected cells were unresponsive to CGRP. Results were expressed as a percent of the maximal response observed for the positive control group of cells, and EC50 values were determined using a nonlinear regression curve-fitting computer program within PRISM, version 2.0 (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). tsA 201 cells were grown in six-well culture plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and processed 24 h post-transfection. The cells were solubilized after washing away the growth medium and incubating with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min), a fraction of the supernatant was mixed with sample buffer (final concentration: 1% SDS, 4 m urea, and 50 mmdithiothreitol), separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) run in MOPS buffer, and elector-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibody, either monoclonal HA.11 (anti-HA ascites; 1:3000) or 9E10 (anti-c-myc; 1:3000) (BabCo, Berkeley, CA), in PBST/1% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed in three changes of PBST for 15 min, incubated with secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), in PBST/1% milk for 1 h at room temperature, and washed in three changes of PBST for 15 min at room temperature. Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus kit; Amersham Biosciences). tsA 201 cells were grown in six-well culture plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and processed 24 h post-transfection. The cells were solubilized after washing away the growth medium and incubating with 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min), the supernatant was mixed on a rocker with either HA.11 (1:200) or 9E10 (1:200) antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) after rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted with sample buffer (final concentration: 1% SDS, 4 m urea, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. tsA 201 cells, grown in six-well culture plates (5 × 105 cells), were incubated 24 h post-transfection by washing three times with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS/0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h on ice (4Flahaut M. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14731-14737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HA.11 anti-HA antibody was added (1:200) for 2 h on ice. The cells were washed once with 4 °C blocking buffer and twice with 4 °C PBS and then lysed, centrifuged, bound to protein G beads, and Western blotted as described above. tsA 201 cells transiently expressing either wild type or one of the mutant RAMP 1 constructs and N-terminal HA epitope-tagged human CRLR-GFP (HA-CRLR-GFP) were harvested 24 h post-transfection using Versene (Invitrogen). The cells were washed with DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in the same medium containing a 1:100 dilution of anti-HA antibody (HA.11) (BabCo, Berkeley, CA) for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were subsequently washed twice with DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in the same medium containing a 1:100 dilution of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum and resuspended in the same media at 1 × 106 cells/ml at 4 °C. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on 1 × 104 cells using an EPICS ELITE ESP flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Argon laser excitation and either a 525 or 575 nm bandpass filtering was used to detect GFP or phycoerythrin. Cells that fluoresced at least two standard deviations above the mean autofluorescence of unmanipulated tsA 201 cells were defined as positive. Differences between mean values were analyzed by Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant for p values <0.05. EC50 and IC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), were determined using a nonlinear regression curve-fitting computer program within PRISM, version 2.0 (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). To determine the role of the ECD, TM, and tail domains of human RAMP 1, three mutants were constructed. The role of the cytoplasmic tail was evaluated using a mutant consisting of the ECD and TM (ECD/TM). The importance of the specific sequence of the TM and tail was determined using a chimera composed of the ECD of RAMP 1 and the TM and tail of the PDGF receptor (R1-ECD/PDGF-TM/tail). A mutant consisting of the ECD alone (ECD) was used to further evaluate the role of the TM domain, as well as the role of the ECD (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). tsA 201 cells were transiently transfected with human HA-CRLR-GFP and either wild type human RAMP 1 or one of the RAMP 1 mutants. Twenty-four h post-transfection, dose response assays for CGRP stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation were performed. CGRP stimulated cAMP accumulation with an EC50 of 36 pm (95% CI, 24–55 pm) (see Fig. 2and Table I). Truncation of the nine-amino acid intracellular C-tail of RAMP 1 to form the ECD/TM mutant resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in EC50(EC50 = 125 pm, 95% CI, 52–299 pm) that was not significantly different from wild type RAMP 1 (Table I). Maximal stimulation (efficacy) was unaffected by the tail truncation, and therefore the ECD/TM mutant was statistically indistinguishable from wild type RAMP 1 in its biological function as measured by cAMP stimulation.Table IEC50 and IC50 values for CGRP-stimulated increases in intracellular cAMP accumulation and [125I]CGRP binding for wild type RAMP 1 and each of the RAMP 1 mutants derived from Figs. 2and 6, respectivelyHEK 293 tsA 201 cell transfection, HA-CRLR-GFPcAMP accumulation EC50 (95% CI)[125I]CGRP Binding IC50 (95% CI)nm+ RAMP 1 WT0.036 (0.024–0.055)2.8 (2.1–3.7)+ RAMP 1-ECD/TM0.125 (0.052–0.299)4.5 (3.5–5.9)+ RAMP 1-ECD/PDGFR-TM/tail0.470 (0.201–1.099)23 (7.3–74)+ RAMP 1-ECD145 (78–272)ND Open table in a new tab The importance of the TM domain of RAMP 1 was examined by replacing the TM and tail with the TM and first nine amino acids of the C-terminal tail of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 1). This chimera allows the exploration of the contribution of the specific sequence of the RAMP 1 TM domainversus a nonspecific membrane-tethering role it may serve for the ECD. The EC50 for the CGRP dose response curve for cAMP stimulation in cells expressing the RAMP 1-ECD/PDGFR-TM/tail chimera and HA-CRLR-GFP was increased ∼12-fold compared with wild type RAMP 1 (470 pm, 95% CI, 201–1099 pm) (see Fig. 2 and Table I), and the maximal response (efficacy) was unaffected. These data indicate that the specific sequence of the TM of RAMP 1 contributes to CGRP sensitivity, although the remote possibility that the PDGFR tail interferes with HA-CRLR-GFP action cannot be ruled out. This RAMP 1/PDGFR chimera shows that although the TM domain is important for CGRP sensitivity, it is still unclear whether the TM domain is necessary for full efficacy or whether the ECD of RAMP 1 alone is sufficient for full biologic function. Therefore, the ECD mutant of RAMP 1 was transiently expressed with HA-CRLR-GFP in tsA 201 cells, and the cAMP response to increasing doses of CGRP was determined. Although the EC50 for the ECD of RAMP 1 was increased ∼4000-fold (145 nm, 95% CI, 78–272 nm) compared with wild type RAMP 1, surprisingly, the maximal response was increased nearly 2-fold. CGRP stimulation of HA-CRLR-GFP expressed alone was the same as non-transfected tsA 201 cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the ECD alone is sufficient for association with HA-CRLR-GFP and full biological efficacy as determined by the cAMP response to CGRP and that the specific amino acid sequence and tethering function of the TM domain are required for full receptor sensitivity to CGRP. Previous studies have shown that RAMP 1 associates early with CRLR to form a heterodimer and functions to promote their trafficking through the Golgi to the cell surface. As a result of passing through the Golgi, CRLR increases in size as it becomes terminally glycosylated. This increase in the size of CRLR can be used to assess the functional association and trafficking of CRLR and RAMP 1. To determine whether the decrease in CGRP potency for stimulation of cAMP observed for the various mutants of RAMP 1 was because of impaired association and trafficking with CRLR, we examined the effect of each mutant of RAMP 1 on HA-CRLR-GFP glycosylation. Total lysates of tsA 201 cells expressing HA-CRLR-GFP alone or with RAMP 1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) and immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody. In the absence of RAMP 1, HA-CRLR-GFP runs as two bands of ∼70 and 82 kDa (Fig.3A) that have been shown previously to represent intracellular core-glycosylated and cell surface terminally glycosylated forms, respectively (4Flahaut M. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14731-14737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HA-CRLR-GFP co-expressed with wild type RAMP 1 ran at an intermediate size of 75 kDa. Similar to the wild type RAMP 1, all three RAMP 1 mutants, the ECD/TM mutant lacking the nine-amino acid intracellular tail and the RAMP 1-ECD/PDGFR-TM/tail chimera (Fig. 3A), as well as the RAMP 1-ECD alone (Fig. 3B), were able to completely convert the 70- and 82-kDa bands to the 75-kDa form of HA-CRLR-GFP. The significance of the differences in the intensity of the bands of HA-CRLR-GFP co-expressed with the various mutants is difficult to interpret because of the variability in transfection efficiency and mutant expression. Nonetheless, this size shift functional assay demonstrates that only the ECD of RAMP 1 is necessary for the early association and trafficking with HA-CRLR-GFP. Therefore the decreased potency for CGRP stimulation of cAMP observed for the RAMP 1 mutants is not because of impaired early association and trafficking with HA-CRLR-GFP. Several expression studies in a variety of heterologous cells have shown that RAMP 1 association with CRLR is necessary for full expression of CRLR at the cell surface (2McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Although one study has questioned this requirement for RAMP 1, the data still suggest that RAMP 1 is important for surface expression of the functional CRLR/RAMP 1 heterodimer (5Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the absence or mutation of one domain within RAMP 1 that resulted in the decreased potency for cAMP production reported above could be because of impaired surface expression of CRLR, each of the RAMP 1 mutants was compared with wild type RAMP 1 for its ability to promote HA-CRLR-GFP cell surface expression. Cell surface expression of HA-CRLR-GFP was detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and phycoerythrin-labeled, goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. The GFP fused to the C terminus of CRLR-GFP was used to measure the level of whole cell expression of HA-CRLR-GFP. Fluorescent flow cytometric analysis was applied for the simultaneous measurement of both the phycoerythrin and whole cell GFP (HA-CRLR-GFP) fluorescent signals. Fluorescent measurements for 10,000 cells are depicted on scatter plots (Fig.4A). HA-CRLR-GFP surface expression could be then be normalized for the level of total cell receptor expression of GFP and expressed as a ratio that could be meaningfully compared among cells co-expressing wild typeversus mutant or absent domains of RAMP 1 (Fig.4B). Among all the mutant RAMPs, both the RAMP 1-ECD/PDGFR-TM-tail chimera and the RAMP 1-ECD mutant lacking the TM and tail domains were impaired with statistical significance (70.3 ± 11.2%) and (56 ± 1.5%, respectively) compared with wild type RAMP 1 in their ability to promote HA-CRLR-GFP surface expression. Although the impaired function of the mutant that resulted in a 50% reduction in HA-CRLR-GFP surface expression may contribute to the observed 4000-fold decrease in CGRP potency for cAMP stimulation, it cannot account for all of the reduction. We demonstrated that the ECD of RAMP 1 could associate and traffic with HA-CRLR-GFP similar to wild type RAMP 1 using an N-linked glycosylation maturation assay (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 3B). To determine whether the heterodimer consisting of the ECD of RAMP 1 and HA-CRLR-GFP was unstable, perhaps because of the absence of the TM and tail of RAMP 1, the media of cells either expressing myc-ECD of RAMP 1 alone or co-expressed with HA-CRLR-GFP was examined for the presence of the ECD of RAMP 1. Myc-ECD of RAMP 1 was immunoprecipitated from the medium using mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody and analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotting with the same anti-myc antibody. The presence of RAMP 1-myc-ECD in the media of cells expressing RAMP 1-Myc-ECD alone was nearly undetectable (Fig5, lane 1) whereas there was a dramatic increase of the 11-kDa RAMP 1-Myc-ECD in the media of cells co-expressing HA-CRLR-GFP (Fig. 5, lane 2). These data confirm that the ECD of RAMP 1 alone is capable of associating with HA-CRLR-GFP and trafficking through the Golgi to the cell surface as shown above. In addition, the presence of the ECD of RAMP 1 in the media indicates that the ECD has dissociated from HA-CRLR-GFP presumably as a result of a decrease in the stability of its interaction with HA-CRLR-GFP at the surface. Although it is difficult to quantitate the degree of instability between the ECD and HA-CRLR-GFP, because there are so many unknown variables, the interaction is stable enough to allow full efficacy of CGRP stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation. RAMP 1 association with CRLR at the cell surface is necessary for CGRP high affinity binding and activation of signal transduction. Having demonstrated that the RAMP 1-ECD is sufficient for association, trafficking, and cell surface expression of HA-CRLR-GFP, the effect of the mutations of each of the RAMP 1 domains on CGRP affinity was examined as a possible basis for the observed decrease in potency for stimulating cAMP accumulation. Radioligand binding dose inhibition studies were performed in tsA 201 cells co-expressing HA-CRLR-GFP and each of the RAMP 1 mutants using 50 pm [125I]CGRP and inc"

https://openalex.org/W2064116925,"The germ cell-deficient (gcd) mutation is a recessive transgenic insertional mutation leading to a deficiency of primordial germ cells (PGCs). We have recently shown that the gene underlying this mutation is Pog, which is necessary for normal proliferation of PGCs. Here we show thatPog is also involved in spermatogenesis in that meiosis is impaired in Pog-deficient mice. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that POG interacted with GGN1 and GGN3, two proteins formed by alternate splicing of the same gene, gametogenetin (Ggn).Ggn had more than 10 different splice variants giving rise to three proteins, GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3. The three proteins had different subcellular localizations, with GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3 localized along the nuclear membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus/nucleoli respectively. The expression of Ggn was confined to late pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, a time window concomitant with the occurrence of meiosis. MouseGgn and Pog were both expressed in primary spermatocytes. Co-expression of POG with GGN1 or GGN3 in HeLa cells changed the localization of POG to the perinuclear localization or the nucleoli, respectively. Our data showed that in addition to functioning in proliferation of primordial germ cells, POG also functioned in spermatogenesis. Two spatial and temporal regulated proteins, GGN1 and GGN3, interacted with POG, regulated the localization of POG, and played a role in spermatogenesis. The germ cell-deficient (gcd) mutation is a recessive transgenic insertional mutation leading to a deficiency of primordial germ cells (PGCs). We have recently shown that the gene underlying this mutation is Pog, which is necessary for normal proliferation of PGCs. Here we show thatPog is also involved in spermatogenesis in that meiosis is impaired in Pog-deficient mice. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that POG interacted with GGN1 and GGN3, two proteins formed by alternate splicing of the same gene, gametogenetin (Ggn).Ggn had more than 10 different splice variants giving rise to three proteins, GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3. The three proteins had different subcellular localizations, with GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3 localized along the nuclear membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus/nucleoli respectively. The expression of Ggn was confined to late pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, a time window concomitant with the occurrence of meiosis. MouseGgn and Pog were both expressed in primary spermatocytes. Co-expression of POG with GGN1 or GGN3 in HeLa cells changed the localization of POG to the perinuclear localization or the nucleoli, respectively. Our data showed that in addition to functioning in proliferation of primordial germ cells, POG also functioned in spermatogenesis. Two spatial and temporal regulated proteins, GGN1 and GGN3, interacted with POG, regulated the localization of POG, and played a role in spermatogenesis. primordial germ cell days postcoitum plant homeodomain reverse transcription phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP nucleolar targeting signal Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs)1 are generated ∼6 days after fertilization by the epiblast cells along the border of the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm (1Lawson K.A. Hage W.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 182: 68-84PubMed Google Scholar). Bmp4 andBmp8 secreted by the neighboring extraembryonic ectoderm cells are two important signals for this induction (2Lawson K.A.

Zhao G.Q. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the PGCs move out of the epiblast, and at 7.5–8 days postcoitum (dpc) they are at the base of the allantois as a pool of about 100 tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase-positive cells (4Ginsburg M. Snow M.H. McLaren A. Development. 1990; 110: 521-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A process of proliferation and migration of the PGCs is followed until, at 13.5 dpc, they number about 20,000 in each gonad (5Tam P.P. Snow M.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 64: 133-147PubMed Google Scholar). Several genes are known to function in this process. Mutations in Kit and its ligand Kitl affect the proliferation and migration of PGCs (6Chabot B.

Heasman J. Wylie C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After 13.5 dpc, germ cells in the male and female take different developmental pathways (12Byskov A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 71-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the male, PGCs are arrested in mitosis at 13.5 dpc. They resume mitosis after birth, the prospermatogonia, establish a stem cell pool, and start spermatogenesis (13Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. 1st Ed. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar). In the female, the germ cells enter meiosis and are arrested at the diplotene stage of meiosis I, 5 days after birth. Following a growth period, the oocytes resume meiosis at puberty and arrest again at metaphase II. Only after fertilization do the oocytes complete the meiosis. Unlike in the male line, female germ cells do not form a self-renewing stem cell population. They exist as a finite population, the number of which is fixed at birth. The prophase of meiosis I in both sexes is notably long, which includes stages of leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene (13Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. 1st Ed. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar). In the prophase, a series of meiosis-unique events take place. For example, chromosomal axes begin to condense in leptonema, chromosome pairing and synapsis initiate in zygonema, synapsis completion and genetic recombination occur in patchnema, and desynapse happens in diplonema (14Cobb J. Handel M.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A number of meiosis-specific proteins are known to express during this period, these including the synaptonemal complex proteins (SYCP1 to -3) (15Heyting C. Dettmers R.J. Dietrich A.J. Redeker E.J. Vink A.C. Chromosoma. 1988; 96: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), germ cell-specific transcription factor SPRM1, and germ cell-specific histone protein H1t (H1Ft) (16Andersen B. Pearse 2nd, R.V. Schlegel P.N. Cichon Z. Schonemann M.D. Bardin C.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Kremer E.J. Kistler W.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Identifying all of the players in the process is necessary for the better understanding of meiosis. The germ cell-deficient (gcd) mutant is a transgenic insertional mutation showing a reduced number of PGCs in genital ridges of homozygotes from 9.5 dpc (18Duncan M.K. Lieman J. Chada K.K. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 697-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Agoulnik A.I. Lu B. Zhu Q. Truong C. Ty M.T. Arango N. Chada K.K. Bishop C.E. Hum. Mol.

A. 1991; 88: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the gene responsible for this phenotype is Pog(proliferation of germ cells), which encodes a novel protein containing a plant homeodomain (PHD) motif at its C terminus (19Agoulnik A.I. Lu B. Zhu Q. Truong C. Ty M.T. Arango N. Chada K.K. Bishop C.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During the embryonic stage,Pog is involved in proliferation but not migration of PGCs. It is also involved in other aspects of the embryonic development, since in certain genetic backgrounds deletion of Pog leads to lower embryonic viability. Further investigation of the gametogenesis of Pog-deficient mice revealed thatPog-deficient females were sterile throughout their lives, whereas Pog-deficient males eventually became fertile at the age of 3–4 months due to the population of the tubules with spermatogonial stem cells and the resumption of the spermatogenesis (21Lu B. Bishop C.E. Biol. Reprod. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we show that in Pog −/− males, although spermatogenesis is qualitatively normal after age 9–12 weeks, it is abnormal quantitatively. Pog −/− testes have a lower percentage of primary spermatocytes and round spermatids than normal controls, although they have the same percentage of proliferating spermatogonia. The impaired transition from the primary spermatocytes to spermatids in Pog −/− testis indicates that Pog is also involved spermatogenesis in adult testis. In an attempt to identify interacting protein partners of POG in the testis, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening using an adult testis cDNA library. A novel germ cell-specific gene, gametogenetin (Ggn), was found to encode proteins interacting with POG. Consistent with the functioning of Pog in spermatogenesis,Ggn was highly expressed in the adult gonad, specifically in germ cells from the late pachytene spermatocyte to the round spermatid stage. Single spermatocyte RT-PCR showed that Ggn andPog were both expressed in the primary spermatocytes. Multiple splicing of Ggn pre-mRNA gave rise to at least three different proteins, GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3, showing a perinuclear, cytoplasmic, and nucleolar localization, respectively. When POG was co-expressed with GGN3 in HeLa cells, the localization of POG switched from a ubiquitous intracellular localization to an essential nucleolar specific localization, whereas when POG was co-expressed with GGN1, it changed to a perinuclear localization. Our data suggested thatPog also functioned in spermatogenesis. GGN1 and GGN3, two proteins produced from Ggn by alternative splicing, interacted with POG and regulated its subcellular localization. Generation of Pog-deficient mice has been previously described (19Agoulnik A.I. Lu B. Zhu Q. Truong C. Ty M.T. Arango N. Chada K.K. Bishop C.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed overnight at 4 °C in either 4% paraformaldehyde or Bouin's solution and were dehydrated, embedded in Paraplast X-tra (Fisher). 8-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin or periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Russell's system was adopted for staging of the seminiferous tubules (13Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. 1st Ed. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar). A monocellular suspension of testicular cells was prepared as described (22Krishnamurthy H. Weinbauer G.F. Aslam H. Yeung C.H. Nieschlag E. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 710-717PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tunica albuginea was removed, and the seminiferous tubules were minced in PBS (calcium- and magnesium-free) to release the testicular cells. The minced tissue was gently aspirated for 2 min, and the cells were washed in PBS and spun down at 800 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in PBS, filtered through 80-μm nylon mesh, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and kept at 4 °C until further analysis. For propidium iodide staining, 2 × 106cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 300 μl of 0.5% pepsin in 0.9% saline, pH 2.0, at 37 °C for 10 min. After spinning down, the cells were incubated with propidium iodide staining solution (25 μg/ml propidium iodide, 40 μg/ml RNase, 0.3% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed with a Coulter EPICS cytometer (Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). 20,000 cells were counted for each sample. Full-length PogcDNA was cloned in the EcoRI site of pGBKT7 (Clontech) to make a fusion protein between the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain and POG. The primers for amplifying full-length Pog cDNA were PogF1 (5′-acgtgaattcatggacgaagcagaagcaag-3′) and PogR1 (5′-ggttgaattcaaggttttctcccagaca-3′). To delete the C-terminal PHD domain from the fusion protein, pGBKT7/Pog was cut withBamHI, and the large fragment was religated with T4 DNA ligase to obtain plasmid pGBKT7/PogΔ. pGBKT7/PogΔ was transformed into reporter yeast strain AH109 and mated with a pretransformed mouse testis cDNA library cloned in pACT2 and carried in yeast strain Y87. The diploid colonies were plated on SD-Leu-Trp-Lys agar plates to screen for interacting partners according to the manufacturer's instructions. For testing protein interactions in yeast, the cDNAs coding for the two test proteins were cloned into pGBKT7 and pACT2. The two plasmids were then co-transformed into yeast strain AH109, and the growth and color were tested on SD-Leu-Trp-Lys-Ade/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) agar plates. The 3′ 300 bp of the Ggn1cDNA coding region was amplified and cloned into theEcoRI site of pBluescript KS(II). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were prepared using a digoxigenin RNA-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 18 h. After stringent washing, bound probe was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and BM purple (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Serial sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff and staged using Russell's system to define the stage and cell type that expressGgn1. Testicular germ cells were dissociated as described above. Single primary spermatocytes were picked under a Leica microscope by virtue of their large cell size. Single cell RT-PCR was performed as described (23Brady G. Iscove N.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, each cell was lysed in 8 μl of first strand cDNA synthesis buffer, which was made by mixing 96 μl of cDNA/lysis buffer (1× alternate first strand buffer from the Ambion Retroscript kit, with 0.52% Nonidet P-40), 2 μl of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), 1.33 μl of 2.5 mm dNTPs, and 0.67 μl of 50 μm random decamers (Ambion, Austin, TX). The lysate was incubated at 65 °C for 3 min and cooled at room temperature for 3 min. 4 μl of lysate from each cell was incubated with 0.5 μl of reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for 30 min, and the other 4 μl of lysate from the same cell was similarly treated without reverse transcriptase to serve as a control. 1.5 μl of the RT product (with or without reverse transcriptase) was used as the template for both Ggn and Pog PCR. Primers for PogPCR were GCD2F (5′-TCCAACAGAGAATGAAGCACTC-3′) and SplicingR (5′-CAGATTCCACAGTCCATGCT-3′). Primers for Ggn PCR were 215F (5′-GGCAGTGATCTGATCTTTGGTCG-3′) and 481R (5′-AGTTGATGGTGCTGGCGGTAG-3′). PCR was performed using the following cycle profile: one cycle of 94 °C for 4 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. For Ggn, the first round PCR product was used for electrophoresis. ForPog, a second round of PCR (30 cycles) was performed using the product of the first PCR as the template. Full-length Pog cDNA was cloned in the EcoRI site of pM (Clontech, CA) and pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen, CA), to express the GAL4 DNA binding domain-tagged POG and Xpress-tagged POG in mammalian cells. Ggn1 cDNA was cloned in the EcoRI site of pcDNAmyc/HisA to express Myc-tagged GGN1. 8 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into 70% confluent COS-1 or HeLa cells (grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes) using Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 60 h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.8 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mmol/liter sodium chloride, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 8.0) including a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used in the precipitation. 300 μl of each clear lysate was incubated with the suitable antibody and 50 μl protein A/G beads in a volume of 600 μl at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were spun down at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of SDS loading buffer and used for Western blotting analysis. pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-N2 vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used to make green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins with the target proteins. In some cases both C-terminal and N-terminal fusion constructs were made to ensure the GFP did not interfere with the subcellular localization. The constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, COS-1 cells, or GC-1 cells (grown on glass cover slides). 36 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% phosphonoformic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), and localization of the GFP signal was checked by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). For checking the nucleolar localization, the same field was examined under UV for the GFP signal and under bright field for the nucleolus. To check the co-localization of POG and GGN3, pEGFP-C2/Pogand pCMV-HA/Ggn3 were co-transfected into HeLa cells at a ratio of 1:1. For the co-localization of POG and GGN1, pEGFP-N2/Ggn1 and pcDNA3.1HisC/Pog were similarly cotransfected. HA-GGN3 was stained with goat anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Xpress-POG was stained with anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody. Co-transfected HeLa cells were fixed with 4% phosphonoformic acid in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min, permeabilized at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min, and blocked at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times for 5 min each in PBS, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and checked under a fluorescent microscope. Pictures of the same field were taken using different filters to obtain the EGFP and rhodamine signals, respectively. Merging of the EGFP and rhodamine views was done with standard image manipulation software (Adobe Photoshop). Pog-deficient males eventually become fertile at 3–4 months of age due to the population of the tubules with spermatogonial stem cells and the resumption of spermatogenesis (21Lu B. Bishop C.E. Biol. Reprod. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Since Pogis highly expressed in the testis, we were interested in determining whether the spermatogenesis in Pog-deficient males was affected. A careful examination of periodic acid-Schiff's stained testis sections revealed that although spermatogenesis appeared qualitatively normal in Pog −/− mice, in that four waves of spermatogenesis could be seen in all populated tubules, it was quantitatively abnormal. InPog −/− testis, there were consistently fewer round spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium than stage-matched tubules from normal littermates (Fig.1, A and B). Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively examine the germ cell populations in normal and Pog-deficient mice. Five populations could be distinguished according to the amount of propidium iodide the cells bound. They were elongating and elongated spermatid (HC, H indicating hypostainability of compacted DNA during spermiogenesis), round spermatid (1C), spermatogonia and somatic cells (2C), spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes synthesizing DNA (S), and primary spermatocyte (4C). Since in thePog-deficient mouse, the lumens of the seminiferous tubules were not completely normal, possibly affecting spermiation, the elongating and elongated spermatids were not included in the comparison. The data clearly showed that Pog-deficient mice had a lower percentage of 1C (round spermatids) and 4C (majority primary spermatocytes) cells (Fig. 1 C), whereas they had the same percentage of testicular cells in S phase and a higher percentage of 2C cells. The higher percentage of 2C cells inPog-deficient mice could be the result of hyperproliferation of somatic cells in the testis. Since in the adult testis, germ cells are the only cell type to synthesize DNA, the 4C/S and 1C/S ratios were used to compare the spermatogenesis of Pog-deficient and normal mice. Both ratios were significantly lower inPog-deficient mice (Fig. 1 D), indicating that some primary spermatocytes are lost and that the transition from primary spermatocytes to round spermatids (meiosis) is impaired. These data indicate that Pog is involved in spermatogenesis in addition to its function in proliferation of primordial germ cells. Since POG is a novel protein, little is known about its function in the cell. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for proteins interacting with POG in the adult testis in order to shed some light on its potential role. Since the presence of the POG C-terminal PHD domain in the bait caused autoactivation of the reporter gene upon transformation into AH109, the PHD domain-coding region was deleted from the bait construct and used to screen a pretransformed mouse adult testis cDNA library (Clontech). Four million clones were screened using SD-Trp-Leu-His selection, and six independent clones were identified and sequenced. Three matched the cDNA sequence of mouse RanbpM (24Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the other three matched the mouse Unigene Mm.63529. Further testing the interaction by co-transformation of the bait and pray plasmid into yeast AH109 revealed that interaction with RanbpM plasmids was nonspecific, whereas activation of the reporter gene by the other three plasmids was specific and dependent on the presence of POG. Since no homologous full-length cDNA sequences were found in the public data base, we used the primer extension strategy to get the complete coding region of the cDNA based on the genomic DNA sequence and the expressed sequence tag records in the data base. We named this gene gametogenetin (Ggn) because of its germ cell-specific expression and its involvement in gametogenesis (see below). In RT-PCR experiments using several primer sets aligned to the 5′- and 3′-end of the mouse Ggn cDNA, we consistently obtained more than 10 DNA bands of different sizes from the testis and the ovary. Six major bands were sliced out of the gel and sequenced directly or after subcloning. Eight sequences were obtained (three sequences were from the smallest band after subcloning), showing all to be specific products of variant splicing of the Ggnpre-mRNA (Fig. 2 A). Three related proteins could be deduced from the cDNAs sequenced and were named GGN1, GGN2, and GGN3. GGN1 has two potential trans-membrane domains in the N terminus (amino acids 45–64) and the middle of the protein (amino acids 268–287) and two arginine/lysine-rich domains at the C terminus (Fig. 2 B). GGN3 has the C-terminal 137 amino acids of GGN1 together with the two arginine/lysine-rich domains. The Ensemble mouse genome assembly indicated that mouse Ggn is located on Chr 7 and is relatively small, spanning about 5 kb in the mouse genome. The three clones obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening all contained the cDNA coding the C-terminal part of GGN1, with the shortest coding the C-terminal 122 amino acids. Thus, both GGN1 and GGN3 contained the sequences mediating the interaction with POG in yeast. To further confirm the interaction between POG and GGN3 in yeast, the Pog cDNA and cDNA coding for GGN3 were switched between the DNA binding domain vector pGBKT7 and the activation domain vector pACT2. The resulting two constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109, and the interaction was tested again. Only cells transformed with both pGBKT7/Ggn3 and pACT2/Pog survived the selection, whereas cells transformed with pGBKT7 and pACT2/Pog did not (Fig.3 A). These data indicate that the interaction between the POG and GGN3 proteins is specific in yeast. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to further confirm the interaction in mammalian cells. In one direction, C-terminal Myc-tagged GGN1 co-immunoprecipitated with GAL-4-tagged POG when the two proteins were co-expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 3 B). In the other direction, Xpress-tagged POG co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged GGN1 when they were co-expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 C). These experiments provide further evidence that the two proteins interact specifically in mammalian cells. To determine which part of POG mediated the interaction with GGN3, cDNA coding for amino acids 182–274 of POG was tested in the yeast two-hybrid system and was found to be sufficient to mediate the interaction (Fig. 3 A). Using a similar strategy, it could be shown that the C-terminal 65 amino acids of GGN3 was not able to mediate the interaction. Sequences further N-terminal to this region were therefore needed for GGN3 to interact with POG. In addition to binding to POG, GGN3 was able to form a homodimer with itself and a heterodimer with GGN1 in yeast two-hybrid experiments (Fig. 3 D). The region mediating the homodimerization was mapped to the C-terminal 65 amino acids of GGN3, a region that could not mediate the interaction with POG. When pACT2/Ggn3 was co-transformed into AH109 cells with either pGBKT7/Ggn1 or pGBKT7/Ggn3, the transformed clones could grow on selection medium. In the case of pACT2/GgnC-65, only when it was co-transformed with pGBKT7/Ggn3 but not pGBKT7/Ggn1 could the cells survive the selection. It appears that although the C-terminal 65 amino acids of GGN3 are enough to mediate the interaction, the presence of the N-terminal sequences added further strength to the interaction. With the construct pGBKT7/Ggn1, the larger protein size and the potential trans-membrane domain of GGN1 might limit the amount of protein getting into the nucleus; thus, a stronger protein-protein interaction was needed to activate the reporter gene. The expression of Ggn in the adult tissues was first analyzed by RT-PCR. A specific product could only be amplified from testis and ovary RNA but not from adult liver, kidney, lung, heart, spleen, or brain (data not shown). In situ hybridization was used to check the cell type and stage that expressed Ggn in the adult testis using a probe containing 300 bp of the 3′ coding region, present in all splice variants. Ggn was expressed only in the germ cells and not in the somatic, Sertoli, or Leydig cells (Fig.4 A). In the germ cells,Ggn expression is tightly related to the developmental stage. The expression started in stage VIII pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. 4, B and C), increased in stage IX and X pachytene spermatocytes, and culminated in stage XI diplotene spermatocytes and the meiotic cells in stage XII (Fig. 4, Dand E). Expression decreased slightly in step 1–3 spermatids, further decreased in step 4–11 spermatids, and was no longer detectable in step 12 spermatids and beyond (Fig.4 E). The expression of Ggn in the testis is summarized in Fig. 4 G. Consistent with the expression pattern in the adult testis, the expression of Ggn in the developing postnatal gonad is also developmentally regulated. It is not expressed in 6-day-old testes in which the germ cells are almost exclusively spermatogonia or 14-day testis in which the most advanced germ cells are early pachytene spermatocytes. However, it is expressed in 21-day testis tubules containing late pachytene spermatocytes or spermatids (Fig.4 F). Thus, in the postnatal male testis, Ggnexpression is strictly confined to late pachytene spermatocytes through spermatids, a time during which meiosis takes place. Pog has been shown to expressed in the adult testis and the ovary (19Agoulnik A.I. Lu B. Zhu Q. Truong C. Ty M.T. Arango N. Chada K.K. Bishop C.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), although it is not known which individual cell types express Pog. For unknown reasons, we have been unable to obtain a POG antibody suitable for immunohistochemistry; nor have we been able to obtain clear in situ hybridization data using several different Pog probes and multiple different techniques. Thus, to test whether Pog was also expressed in the same cell type that expressed Ggn, we picked single primary spermatocytes by virtue of their morphology (large cell size) and performed single cell RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 H, three cells (cell numbers 2, 3, and 5) were positive for both Ggnand Pog, which indicated that Ggn andPog are expressed in primary spermatocytes. From the sequenced splicing variations shown in Fig. 2, three DNA products of 922, 600, and 452 bp would be expected from the testis cDNA using primer pair 215F and 481R for P"

In other eukaryotes, theDictyostelium domain shows greatest homology to the 73-kDa subunit of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. The Dictyostelium PdeE gene is expressed at its highest levels during aggregation, and its disruption causes the loss of a cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity. The pdeE null mutants show a normal cAMP-induced cGMP response and a 1.5-fold increase of cAMP-induced cAMP relay. Overexpression of a PdeE-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion construct causes inhibition of aggregation and loss of the cAMP relay response, but the cells can aggregate in synergy with wild-type cells. The PdeE-YFP fusion protein was partially purified by immunoprecipitation and biochemically characterized. PdeE and its Dictyostelium ortholog, PdeD, are both maximally active at pH 7.0. Both enzymes require bivalent cations for activity. The common cofactors Zn2+ and Mg2+ activated PdeE and PdeD maximally at 10 mm, whereas Mn2+activated the enzymes to 4-fold higher levels, with half-maximal activation between 10 and 100 μm. PdeE is an allosteric enzyme, which is ∼4-fold activated by cAMP, with half-maximal activation occurring at about 10 μm and an apparentKm of ∼1 mm. cGMP is degraded at a 6-fold lower rate than cAMP. Neither cGMP nor 8-Br-cAMP are efficient activators of PdeE activity. A cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, PdeE, that harbors two cyclic nucleotide binding motifs and a binuclear Zn2+-binding domain was characterized inDictyostelium. In other eukaryotes, theDictyostelium domain shows greatest homology to the 73-kDa subunit of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. The Dictyostelium PdeE gene is expressed at its highest levels during aggregation, and its disruption causes the loss of a cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity. The pdeE null mutants show a normal cAMP-induced cGMP response and a 1.5-fold increase of cAMP-induced cAMP relay.

Neither cGMP nor 8-Br-cAMP are efficient activators of PdeE activity. In mammalian cells the inactivation of the ubiquitous second messengers cAMP and cGMP is achieved by no less than 11 different families of the class I phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 1The abbreviations used are: PDEcyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterasecNMPcyclic nucleotide monophosphateYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKGcGMP dependent protein kinasecARcAMP receptorACAadenylyl cyclase A8-Br-cAMP8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate8-Br-cGMP8-bromoguanosine 3′:5′-monophosphateDTTdithiothreitolIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineORFopen reading framePFAMprotein family database of alignments and hidden Markov modelsSMARTsimple modular architecture research toolKOknockoutRIrandom integrant1The abbreviations used are: PDEcyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterasecNMPcyclic nucleotide monophosphateYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePKGcGMP dependent protein kinasecARcAMP receptorACAadenylyl cyclase A8-Br-cAMP8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate8-Br-cGMP8-bromoguanosine 3′:5′-monophosphateDTTdithiothreitolIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineORFopen reading framePFAMprotein family database of alignments and hidden Markov modelsSMARTsimple modular architecture research toolKOknockoutRIrandom integrant These families differ in substrate specificities, endogenous and exogenous regulators, and targeting to different subcellular compartments.

J. 2001; 353: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lower eukaryotes additionally use class II PDEs, which have an entirely different catalytic center. These enzymes are exemplified by PDE1 from yeast (8Nikawa J. Sass P. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and PdsA from Dictyostelium (9Lacombe M.-L. Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16811-16817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent screens of Dictyostelium genomic and cDNA data banks for proteins with cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP) binding motifs identified two proteins that each contained two cNMP binding motifs and the binuclear Zn2+-binding domain that forms the catalytic center of metallo-β-lactamases (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andGbpA and GbpB by others (11Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gene disruption and overexpression studies of PdeD/GbpA showed that the gene encodes the cGMP-stimulated cGMP phosphodiesterase, which is lacking in the chemotactic stmF mutants (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Van Haastert P.J.M.

Analysis of truncated PdeD constructs revealed that the catalytic activity was provided by the metallo-β-lactamase domain (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report gene ablation, overexpression, and biochemical characterization of the other gene, PdeE/GbpB. This gene encodes a cAMP-stimulated cAMP-PDE that is highly active during the aggregation stage of development. A bioinformatics approach showed that a subregion of the metallo-β-lactamase domain of PdeE and PdeD shares additional homology with a 73-kDa factor that is part of the complex for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (15Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1996; 274: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the endonuclease (phosphodiesterase) activity of this complex is still unknown (16Wahle E. Ruegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that it is provided by the highly conserved metallo-β-lactamase domain of the 73-kDa factor. D.discoideum strain NC4 was grown in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on SM agar plates, and all other strains were grown in HL5 medium, which was supplemented with 200 μg/ml uracil for the ura− strain DH1 (17Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 200 μg/ml G418 for the AX2 cells transformed with YFP or PdeE-YFP constructs. For developmental time courses, cells were harvested from bacterial plates or growth medium, washed with 10 mm PB buffer (NaH2PO4 and K2HPO4, pH 6.5), plated at variable cell densities on PB agar (1.5% agar in PB buffer), and incubated at 22 °C. The Dictyostelium genome and cDNA databases were screened with consensus sequences for cyclic nucleotide binding motifs. Two candidate genes, PdeD (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PdeE, were identified. PdeE was assembled after several cycles of data base screening, yielding the complete coding sequence and 5′-untranslated region with at least 5-fold coverage. The gene is part of the recently published sequence of chromosome II (18Glockner G. Eichinger L. Szafranski K. Pachebat J.A. Bankier A.T. Dear P.H. Lehmann R. Baumgart C. Parra G. Abril J.F. Guigo R.

Dingermann T. Gerisch G. Philippsen P. Schleicher M. Schuster S.C. Winckler T. Nature. 2002; 418: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and was also identified by other workers (11Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar to PdeD, PdeE showed an ORF with two PFAM cNMP binding motifs (19Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) when analyzed with SMART (20Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2969) Google Scholar), and the sequence upstream of the ORF was interrupted by two short AT-rich regions. To determine whether these regions were introns, oligonucleotides were designed that flanked the two regions (5′-ATGAATTCTAAATATGGGGATAACATTATAG-3′ and 5′-CCAATTCTTGCTGAAATCACTGC-3′ for the 5′-intron and 5′-TGCAGATCATGATAGTGGTATCCTTC-3′ and 5′-GATGGTAACTCCAAAAGGTTTGCC-3′ for the 3′-intron) to perform reverse transcription PCR of the mRNA of 10-h starved NC4 cells. Bands of 192 and 410 bp, respectively, were obtained and sequenced, showing the presence of a 202 and a 80 bp intron. The 3288-kb ORF of PdeE could then be established, and its sequence has been in GenBankTM under accession numberAY047364 since July 19, 2001. The PdeE gene was inactivated in aura− cell line by homologous recombination (21De Lozanne A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a linear construct that contains ∼1 kb each of the 5′- and 3′-regions of the PdeE gene flanking the PJB1 vector, which contains the URA+ selection cassette (22Kalpaxis D. Werner H. Marcotte E.B. Jacquet M. Dingermann T. Dev. Gen. 1990; 11: 396-402Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two PdeEfragments comprising nucleotides 2961–4427 and 1689–2835 were amplified with oligonucleotides that yielded a 5′-PstI and 3′-BamHI on the first fragment and a 5′-BamHI and 3′-XbaI site on the second fragment. The fragments were cloned in tandem in the PstI-BamHI- andXbaI-BamHI-digested URA vector PJB1 (gift of Peter N. Devreotes). The two constructs were linearized withBamHI, which yielded the PJB1 plasmid flanked by ∼1 kb of 5′- and 3′-DNA of the PdeE gene. Homologous recombination with this construct causes insertion of the entire plasmid at position 2835 of PdeE and the deletion of about 100 nucleotides. The knockout construct was introduced into the ura−strain DH1, and transformed cells were selected by growth in FM medium (23Franke J. Kessin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2157-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in the absence of uracil. Selected clones were screened for homologous recombination by two separate PCR reactions and analysis of Southern blots of genomic digests (Fig. 2A). 11 of 90 clones derived from two transformations carried a gene disruption (pdeE). Three knockout (KO) and three random integrant (RI) clones were used for further analysis. The complete PdeE ORF was amplified by PCR using the AdvantageTM genomic PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and the oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGGATCCAATTCTAAATATGGGGATAACATTATAGATTTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGTTAAACCTTCAATTGGATAAACTTTTCTTGG-3′, which generate 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI sites, respectively. The BamHI/XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI-digested vector pB17SYFP, which is a derivative of pDXA-HC (24Manstein D.J. Schuster H.-P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene. 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that contains the coding sequence for the enhanced YFP (25Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar) downstream of the constitutive actin15 promoter. The construct yields a 1335-amino acid fusion protein with YFP (239 amino acids) at the carboxyl terminus of PdeE (1096 amino acids) in which the carboxyl terminal Ser and Ile of PdeE are replaced by Thr and Arg and fused to Asp and the start Met of YFP. The integrity of the PdeE sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Two errors were detected, i.e. a neutral AAT to AAC transition in Asn540 and an ATT to GTT transition, which transforms Ile1036 into Val1036. The Ile1036is not conserved, and there is often a Val at this position in homologous proteins; thus, protein function is unlikely to be affected. The actin15PdeE-YFP vector and pB17SYFP were transformed into parent strain AX2. Cells were selected in HL5 medium with 200 μg/ml G418. Total RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 cells, size fractionated on 1.5% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde (26Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Sivertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Spudich J.A. Methods in Cell Biology. 28. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 67-100Google Scholar), and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized to [32P]dATP-labeled DNA probes according to standard procedures. 3 μl of 0.28–6.6-kb RNA markers (Promega) were run on the same gel and stained with ethidium bromide to estimate the size of the PdeE mRNA. To measure cAMP or cGMP hydrolysis, cells were resuspended in 250 mmsucrose in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0 and lysed through Nuclepore filters (pore size 3.0 μm). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 40,000 × g. Cleared cell lysates or a suspension of matrix linked to αGFP immunoprecipitate were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with 10 nm or 10 μm [3H]cGMP or [3H]cAMP, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm IBMX, and 1 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0 and assayed for 5′-[3H]AMP or 5′-[3H] GMP levels as described previously (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All PDE assays in this work were performed in the presence of DTT and IBMX, which inhibit otherDictyostelium PDEs such as PdsA, RegA, and PDE3, but not PdeD or PdeE. Cells were starved for 8 h, resuspended in PB buffer to 108cells/ml, and stimulated with 0.1 μm cAMP for the cGMP response and 5 μm 2′-deoxy-cAMP in the presence of 5 mm DTT for cAMP-induced cAMP production (cAMP relay). Aliquots of cell suspension were rapidly mixed with an equal volume of 3.5% perchloric acid (v/v) at various intervals after stimulation. After neutralization of the lysates with KHCO3, cGMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and cAMP levels were measured by competition with [3H]cAMP for binding to the bovine PKA regulatory subunit (27Gilman A.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1972; 2: 9-24PubMed Google Scholar). 25 μg of mouse monoclonal GFP antibody (αGFP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a mixture of 250 μl each of slurries of protein G linked to Sepharose 4B (Sigma) and protein A linked to Affiprep (Bio-Rad). The αGFP antibody also cross-reacts with and immunoprecipitates YFP. The αGFP-linked matrix was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (0.7% NaCl in PB buffer) and resuspended to the original concentration. 1 ml of cleared lysate, prepared in phosphate-buffered saline at 2 × 108 cells/ml, was incubated for 4 h with 100 μl of αGFP matrix suspension. The matrix was washed thoroughly with 0.2 m NaCl in PB buffer and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. Screening ofDictyostelium cDNA and genome databases with consensus sequences for cyclic nucleotide binding motifs yielded two novel genes of similar structure, PdeD (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PdeE, which were also identified by others as gbpA and gbpB(11Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PdeE is transcribed into a 3.4 kb mRNA and shows low expression during growth and a very pronounced peak at 8–10 h of starvation, when cells are aggregating (Fig.1A). This peak was not found for gbpB expression in earlier work (11Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which may be due to the fact that the 4-h interval used by these workers between successive points in the developmental time course was too large. The 1096-amino acid PdeE protein can be subdivided into an amino terminal region with no homology to known proteins, a middle region, containing the metallo-β-lactamase domain that is common to a number of hydrolases (28Melino S. Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal region that contains two cyclic nucleotide binding cNMP motifs (19Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) (site A and site B in Fig. 1B). PdeD has a similar domain architecture and encodes a cGMP-stimulated cGMP phosphodiesterase (10Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). cAMP and cGMP-binding domains are highly homologous and share a similar structure that was first determined for the regulatory subunit of bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA RI) (29Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The major determinant for nucleotide specificity is Ala210(Fig. 1C, site A, yellow) and Ala334 (site B,yellow) in PKA RI (30Shabb J.B. Buzzeo B.D. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24320-24326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equivalent positions in human cGMP-dependent protein kinase (huPKG2) are Thr243 and Ser367 (in blue), which allow hydrogen bond formation with the C2-NH2group of the guanine base. Both sites A and B in PdeE harbor a serine (Ser890 and Ser1030) at the positions equivalent to Ala210 or Ala334, suggesting that PdeE binds cGMP (Fig. 1C). The putative PdeE cGMP-binding domains deviate rather strongly from the consensus motif. In site A, an Ala889 replaces the essential Arg209 (inred) of PKA RI that forms an ion pair with the equatorial phosphate oxygen of cNMP (29Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition, insertions of two and seven amino acids precede this key residue in sites A and B, respectively. Additional residues at this position are absent in all characterized cNMP-binding proteins. The PFAM metallo-β-lactamase domain contains the HXHXD sequence, two more conserved His residues, and one Asp/Cys residue (19Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). These residues can bind one or two Zn2+ ions that are essential for catalysis (12Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 31Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The metallo-β-lactamase domain is also present in the well characterized enzyme glyoxalase II (32Cameron A.D. Ridderstrom M. Olin B. Mannervik B. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in a variety of other proteins that usually function as hydrolases (33Daiyasu H. Osaka K. Ishino Y. Toh H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Class II cAMP-PDEs, such as Dictyostelium PdsA, also contain the HXHXD sequence but do not otherwise conform to the PFAM metallo-β-lactamase domain (19Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). PdeE and PdeD do conform but have little else in common with any enzymes of known substrate specificity that carry this domain or with the class II PDEs. The closest homolog of PdeE outside Dictyostelium is aBacillus halodurans protein (BH3002) of unknown function (34Takami H. Nakasone K. Takaki Y. Maeno G. Sasaki R. Masui N. Fuji F. Hirama C. Nakamura Y. Ogasawara N. Kuhara S. Horikoshi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4317-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The homology between PdeE, PdeD, and BH3002 was greatest in a region preceding the conserved Asp669 in PdeE (Fig. 1,magenta) and showed the motif FXFFXT/SXHXXPXXXXXXEXXGXXXXYS/TXD (Fig. 1D). When GenBankTM was searched with this motif, a class of highly homologous proteins was detected. These proteins also carried the HXHXD motif of the metallo-β-lactamase domain upstream of the search motif and were either 73-kDa subunits of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) (15Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1996; 274: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or uncharacterized bacterial proteins (Fig. 1D). CPSF73 is one of a complex of factors that binds to the RNA sequence AAUAAA and causes 3′-endonucleolytic cleavage and the addition of the poly(A) tail a few bases downstream from this sequence. Another factor in the complex, CPSF100 (35Jenny A. Hauri H.P. Keller W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8183-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), harbors a degenerate metallo-β-lactamase motif, which does not display the region of homology to PdeD and PdeE. CPSF100 also lacks an essential residue for binding to Zn(I). Despite the fact that all components of the polyadenylation complex have been cloned, the 3′-endonuclease has not yet been identified (16Wahle E. Ruegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Because 3′-endonucleases cleave 3′-nucleotide phosphodiester bonds, as is the case for PdeD and PdeE, we consider it likely that CPSF73 provides the 3′-endonuclease activity. The bacterial homologs may likewise be 3′-nucleotidases. The PdeE gene was inactivated by homologous recombination in the ura− strain DH1 to generate cell line pdeE. Construct integration was verified by two separate PCR reactions and Southern analysis of genomic digests (Fig. 2A). Three randomly selected KO and RI clones were compared in an analysis of phenotypes. Growth and developmental morphology on bacterial plates of the KO and RI clones were identical (Fig. 2B). We also could not distinguish differences in growth rate in axenic cultures or in the morphology and rate of development of cells plated on PB agar at cell densities of 104, 105, and 106cells/cm2 (data not shown). Similar to its homolog PdeD, PdeE is likely to encode a cytosolic cyclic nucleotide hydrolyzing activity. We therefore tested whether such an activity might be lacking in the KO cell lines during the course of their development. Assays were performed in cleared lysates in the presence of DTT and IBMX to inhibit the PDE activities of PdsA, RegA, and PDE3 (5Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R.

Fig.3A shows that, in the control cell line RI1, cytosolic [3H]cAMP-hydrolyzing activity increased strongly to reach a peak at 8 h of starvation. The activity persisted at low levels during the slug stage of development and was completely absent in the pdeE null mutant KO2. There was no significant difference in [3H]cGMP hydrolysis between the KO and RI cell lines (Fig. 3B), which suggests that PdeE encodes a cAMP phosphodiesterase. We next analyzed the dose dependence of the cAMP-PDE activity that was detected att = 8 h in the control RI cells. Fig.3C shows that [3H]cAMP hydrolysis in the control cells is stimulated by micromolar concentrations of cAMP, whereas competition only occurs at millimolar concentrations. This does not resemble the dose-dependence of the known cAMP-PDEs, PdsA and RegA in Dictyostelium, which have a Km of 10 μm and 5 μm, respectively (5Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W.-T.

The developmental regulation of putative PdeE activity agrees well with the appearance of PdeE transcripts, with maximum levels at the aggregation stage (Fig. 1A). At this stage, both cAMP and cGMP are transiently synthesized in response to stimulation with cAMP receptor ligands. To test whether PdeE is involved in regulating cAMP-induced cAMP production (cAMP relay) or the cGMP response, we measured the two responses in the KO and RI cell lines. Fig. 4A shows that the cAMP-induced cGMP response and basal cGMP levels are not significantly different between KO and RI cells. However, basal cAMP levels are 2-fold elevated in the KO cells. The initial rate of cAMP accumulation is similar in KO and RI cells, but the KO cells continue to accumulate cAMP for a longer period, resulting in about 1.5-fold higher cAMP levels (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that PdeE has no function in degrading cGMP but may play a role in regulating the cAMP relay response. T"

PAPK shares homology with members of the Ste20/germinal center kinase family of protein kinases and is ubiquitously expressed as two spliced forms, PAPK-A and PAPK-B, that encode for proteins of 418 and 189 amino acids, respectively. The expression of endogenous PAPK-A protein increased after growth factor withdrawal in murine hematopoietic and fibroblast cells. When tested in an in vitro kinase assay, PAPK-A was activated in response to the stress-inducing agent hydrogen peroxide and slightly by fetal calf serum. Biochemical characterization of the PAPK-A-initiated pathway revealed that this novel kinase does not affect MAP kinase activity but can stimulate both c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and ERK6/p38γ. The kinase activity of PAPK appears to be required for the activation of ERK6/p38γ but not JNK1. When an inducible construct of PAPK-A was expressed in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells, the cells exhibited distinct cytoskeletal changes and became resistant to apoptotic cell death induced by serum withdrawal, effects of PAPK that require its kinase activity. These data suggest that PAPK is a new member of the Ste20/germinal center kinase family that modulates cytoskeletal organization and cell survival.

It has also been recognized that this family of kinases plays a key role in several other known yeast signaling pathways. They include the control of morphological changes, cytokinesis, response to nutrient starvation, and localizing cell growth with respect to the division plate (3Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Over the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of mammalian homologues of Ste20 kinases identified. Based on their structure, these mammalian Ste20-like kinases can be divided into two subfamilies (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The first class, p21-activated kinases (PAKs),1 is activated upon binding to the guanosine triphosphatases Cdc42 and/or Rac1. Upon binding to Cdc42/Rac1-GTP, PAKs undergo a conformational change, which enables autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase to occur (7Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). PAKs have been shown to be involved in changes in cell motility, morphology (8Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A.

The second class of Ste20-related kinases is the germinal center kinase (GCK), which contains an N-terminal catalytic domain and lacks the p21-binding domain.

Several members of the GCK group have been shown to be potent and selective activators of SAPK/JNK or p38. In the present study, using a subtractive screen for polyploidy induction, we cloned and characterized a widely expressed molecule termed polyploidy-associated protein kinase (PAP kinase; PAPK), a novel member of the mammalian Ste20/GCK kinase family. We demonstrate in this report that PAPK, like many other GCK family members, is able to specifically activate the JNK and ERK6/p38γ pathway when overexpressed in 293T cells. In addition, overexpression of PAPK in NIH3T3 cells resulted in resistance to cell death and led to distinct changes in cell morphology. Our results suggest that PAPK represents a novel molecule regulating cytoskeleton structures and cell survival. Expression vectors of pcDNAIII-HA-ERK2, pcDNAIIIHA-JNK1, pcDNA-HA-p38α, pCEFL-HA-p38β, pCEFL-HA-ERK6/p38γ, and pCEFL-HA-ERK5 were described previously (49Sakabe K. Teramoto H. Zohar M. Behbahani B.

HCD-57 cells, an erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent erythroleukemia cell line, were maintained as described previously (54Nishigaki K. Thompson D. Hanson C. Yugawa T. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interleukin 3-dependent BaF3, FDCP2, and 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS and 10% WEHI-conditioned medium (as an IL-3 source). NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the regulatory GAL4-DBD/hPR-LBD/p65 AD fusion protein from the pSwitch plasmid (GeneSwitch-3T3) were obtained from Invitrogen. To obtain clones with mifepristone-inducible expression of PAPK-A and PAPK-A(K89M), GeneSwitch-3T3 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the pGene/V5-His plasmid (Invitrogen) carrying the coding region of Myc-tagged PAPK-A, PAPK-A(K89M) cDNA, and empty vector by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and subjected to selection for stable transfectants with 0.4 mg of Zeocin per ml. Two to 3 weeks later, colonies were picked, expanded, and tested for induction of the transgene by mifepristone (1 × 10−8m) (Invitrogen). 293T and HeLa cells in 60-mm culture dishes (2 × 106) were transfected with various expression plasmids by LipofectAMINE 2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA subtraction was performed using a PCR-selected cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech). The mRNA from C19 cells cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium was used as the “driver.” The mRNA from polyploid C19 cells cultured for 5 days in serum-free medium was used as the “tester.” The subtractive screening was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A partial fragment of PAPK was obtained as a candidate-positive cDNA clone. 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses for the cDNA fragment obtained were performed using C19 erythroleukemia cDNA as a template with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The internal primers used were 5′-CATCTTGCACGGCACACTCCTACAGGAACAC-3′ (sense for 3′-RACE) and 5′-CACTGTTGGCAGCTGGCTTTGGGTTATTTCTCC-3′ (antisense for 5′). Each RACE product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Full-length mouse PAPK-A and PAPK-B were obtained by PCR using cDNA from C19 cells as a template with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech).EcoRI-SalI fragments of full-length PAPK-A and PAPK-B were cloned into pCMV-Myc (Clontech). A kinase-inactive form of PAPK-A (PAPK-A-K89M) was created by substituting lysine 89 with a methionine using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the mutagenic primers 5′-GAACACTGGTAACTGTAATGATTACAAACCTGGAAAG-3 (sense) and 5′-CTTTCCAGGTTTGTAATCATTACAGTTACCAGTGTTC-3′ (antisense) (the mutated bases are underlined) by PCR and cloned into pCMV-myc. An antiserum against PAPK was raised in rabbits by immunization with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids (amino acids 399–418, SPWSELEFQFPDDKDPVWEF). Anti-PAPK antibodies were typically used at a 1:1000 dilution. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared with the FastTrac Kit (Invitrogen). Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blots were purchased from Origene. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and aprotinin and leupeptin at 1 μg/ml each). Cells were lysed on ice for 20 min, and supernatant was collected at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting, as described previously (54Nishigaki K. Thompson D. Hanson C. Yugawa T. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (7E10, Clontech), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Stratagene), mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-JNK antibody (Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti-phospho-JNK antibody (Cell Signaling). For the PAPK and MAP kinase assays, protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (7E10) or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) at 4 °C for 5 h or overnight, respectively. Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmorthovanadate for the MAP kinase assay or 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmorthovanadate for the PAPK assay). Samples were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 5 or 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 200 μm cold ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer. In vitro kinase assays were performed using as substrates myelin basic protein (MBP; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for ERK6/p38γ, ERK5, and PAPK; GST-Elk1 (residues 307–428; Cell Signaling) for ERK2; or GST-ATF2 (residues 19–96; Cell Signaling) for JNK, p38α, and p38β. Samples were separated by SDS-14% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to autoradiography. In order to induce apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing vectors, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plates for 1 day and then washed in dmem. Cells were cultured with serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of mifepristone (1 × 10−8m). At the indicated times, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) and visualized by using a fluorescence microscope. Abnormal nuclei were scored for apoptosis in a blind fashion. To analyze a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis, we carried out Western blot analysis by using a mouse monoclonal antibody to cleaved PARP (7C9; Cell Signaling). 1 × 105 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were cultured for 1 day in serum containing medium and then transferred to dmem with 10% FCS in the presence mifepristone (1 × 10−8m). At the indicated times, the cultures were examined by phase contrast microscopy, and the percentages of cells undergoing morphological change were counted. Three separate experiments were carried out, and for each experiment, a total of 300 cells per culture were examined for each time point. The percentage of cells exhibiting extensions that were longer than the length of the cell body was determined. In the course of studying erythroleukemia (MEL) cell lines derived from mice infected with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus, we observed that growing these cells in serum-free medium induced a dramatic change in their morphology. Within 3–5 days, the cells changed from erythroblastic to giant polyploid cells (Fig.1A). Although the altered cells resemble megakaryocytes, they do not express typical megakaryocyte markers such as acetylcholinesterase and CD41 (data not shown). In order to isolate genes in MEL cells whose expression is altered after induction of this morphological change, we performed a subtractive cDNA screening using mRNAs from the MEL cell line C19 (53Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) before and after induction. Among the isolated cDNA clones, we found a cDNA fragment corresponding to a gene that is up-regulated during induction of polyploidy. Northern blot analysis using this cDNA revealed that the corresponding mRNA for this gene is normally present in C19 cells but is dramatically up-regulated 5 days after induction of the cells to polyploidy (Fig.1B). 3′- and 5′-RACE analyses showed that at least two mRNA variants with different 3′-sequences were isolated, and their cDNAs were sequenced (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis revealed that the larger of the two should encode a polypeptide of 418 amino acids that contains a kinase domain (amino acids 58–369) in the center of the coding region. The smaller message appears to be encoded by a gene containing a stop codon within the kinase-encoding domain and should encode for a 189-amino acid polypeptide lacking 172 amino acids from the C terminus. We named these proteins polyploidy-associated protein kinase (PAPK)-A and PAPK-B. The calculated molecular mass of PAPK-A is 46.8 kDa, whereas that of PAPK-B is 21.4 kDa. Sequence analysis indicates that PAPK-A is a novel protein kinase belonging to the Ste20/GCK family of serine/threonine kinases. When the kinase domain of PAPK-A is compared with those of other protein kinases in this family (Fig. 2B), it shows the highest homology to that of NY-BR-96 (52% homology) and SPAK (30% homology). The phylogenetic tree for the PAPK-A kinase domain is shown in Fig.2C. Within the sequence of PAPK-A there are two consensus Src homology 3-binding sites (PXXP) (55Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) at amino acids 382 and 397, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions, and a consensus AKT phosphorylation site (RXRXXS) (56Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) at amino acid position 16 (residues 11–16). When the sequence for PAPK-A was BLASTed against the assembled mouse genomic sequence in the NCBI data base, it was found on mouse chromosome 1. The expression pattern of PAPK was examined using a mouse multitissue Northern blot (Fig.3). When PAPK-A cDNA was used as a probe, a 2.4-kb transcript was shown to be expressed ubiquitously, with higher expression levels in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and testis. A similar pattern was observed using a probe corresponding to nucleotides 692–863 of PAPK-A, which are missing in PAPK-B. To identify and characterize the PAPK-A protein, we produced anti-PAPK-A antibody by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the predicted protein. The specificity of the anti-PAPK antibody was confirmed using 293T cells transfected with a Myc-tagged PAPK-A cDNA expression plasmid. Both the anti-PAPK antibody and the anti-Myc antibody recognized the same protein (data not shown). Because the antibody is directed against the C terminus of PAPK-A, which is missing in PAPK-B, it recognizes only PAPK-A and detects a 48-kDa protein in the C19 and DS19 (53Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 54Nishigaki K. Thompson D. Hanson C. Yugawa T. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7893-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) MEL cell lines (Fig. 4A). When C19 and DS19 cells are induced to polyploidy by growth in serum-free medium, the level of PAPK-A protein is significantly increased (Fig.4A). However, when serum-grown MEL cells are induced to differentiate with the chemical hexamethylenebisacetamide, PAPK-A levels decrease (Fig. 4B). In addition to MEL cells, a large amount of PAPK-A protein can also be detected in the mouse T-cell line EL4 grown in serum but not in other mouse cell lines examined, including the Epo-dependent erythroleukemia cell line HCD-57, the IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines FDCP2 and 32D, the IL-3-dependent proB cell line BaF3, and the embryonic mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (Fig. 4A). Of interest, however, is the observation that the levels of PAPK-A can be increased by withdrawing Epo from HCD-57 cells (Fig. 4C) or removing IL-3 from FDCP2, 32D, or BaF3 cells (data not shown), each of which results in apoptosis of the cells. These data suggest that PAPK-A is up-regulated during apoptosis. Furthermore, when NIH3T3 cells were starved for 24 h in DMEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PAPK-A expression increased, and when cells were re-fed with DMEM plus 10% FCS, PAPK-A levels gradually decreased over 24 h to the steady state level (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these data suggest that PAPK-A expression levels are regulated by growth factor deprivation and that this novel kinase may play a role in the apoptotic response. To determine whether PAPK has protein kinase activity, we transfected 293T cells with Myc-tagged PAPK-A, isolated the protein from the cell lysate by immunoprecipitation with an anti-myc monoclonal antibody, and carried out an immune complex kinase assay using myelin basic protein (MBP) as an exogenous substrate. Cells transfected with empty vector or with vector expressing Myc-tagged PAPK-B, which is missing the majority of the kinase domain of PAPK-A and is not expected to have any kinase activity, were used as controls. Although the immunoprecipitates from cell lysates prepared from 293T cells transfected with vector alone or with PAPK-B phosphorylated MBP to a limited extent, the kinase activity was markedly increased in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with PAPK-A (Fig. 5). These data indicate that PAPK-A, but not PAPK-B, is a functional protein kinase. To eliminate the possibility that an associated kinase might be co-precipitating with PAPK-A, we generated a kinase-inactive form of PAPK-A, designated K89M-PAPK-A, by replacing lysine 89 in the ATP-binding domain with a methionine. When tested in the same immune complex kinase assay, the level of phosphorylation of MBP by the kinase-inactive mutant was less when compared with that of wild-type PAPK-A (Fig. 5). Thus, in addition to its own kinase activity, PAPK-A may also function as a scaffold for other protein kinases as this kinase-inactive mutant of PAPK-A still resulted in some MBP phosphorylation. To determine whether PAPK-A is activated by any of the cellular stimuli that are known to activate MAP kinases, we transfected HeLa cells with Myc-tagged PAPK-A and carried out the PAPK-A kinase assay after exposing the cells to various cellular stresses or cytokines (Fig.6). PAPK-A kinase activity markedly increased (greater than 5-fold) after treatment of the cells with H2O2 and slightly (almost 2-fold) after exposure to fetal calf serum. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor-α, anisomycin, NaCl, or IL-1 (Fig. 6), as well as with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or sorbitol (data not shown), did not increase PAPK-A activity. The level of overexpressed PAPK-A was verified by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody (bottom panel). Similar data were obtained using 293T cells (data not shown). Thus, PAPK-A may be stimulated by a limited number of extracellular stimuli. To determine whether PAPK is a component of any of the known MAP kinase pathways, we tested the effect of overexpression of PAPK-A and PAPK-B on the activation of various MAP kinases (Fig. 7). 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged ERK2, JNK1/SAPK, p38α, p38β, ERK5, or ERK6/p38γ with or without mammalian expression vectors enc"
