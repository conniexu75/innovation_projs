https://openalex.org/W2163551061,"Adult attachment style refers to individual personality traits that strongly influence emotional bonds and reactions to social partners. Behavioral research has shown that adult attachment style reflects profound differences in sensitivity to social signals of support or conflict, but the neural substrates underlying such differences remain unsettled. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how the three classic prototypes of attachment style (secure, avoidant, anxious) modulate brain responses to facial expressions conveying either positive or negative feedback about task performance (either supportive or hostile) in a social game context. Activation of striatum and ventral tegmental area was enhanced to positive feedback signaled by a smiling face, but this was reduced in participants with avoidant attachment, indicating relative impassiveness to social reward. Conversely, a left amygdala response was evoked by angry faces associated with negative feedback, and correlated positively with anxious attachment, suggesting an increased sensitivity to social punishment. Secure attachment showed mirror effects in striatum and amygdala, but no other specific correlate. These results reveal a critical role for brain systems implicated in reward and threat processing in the biological underpinnings of adult attachment style, and provide new support to psychological models that have postulated two separate affective dimensions to explain these individual differences, centered on the ventral striatum and amygdala circuits, respectively. These findings also demonstrate that brain responses to face expressions are not driven by facial features alone but determined by the personal significance of expressions in current social context. By linking fundamental psychosocial dimensions of adult attachment with brain function, our results do not only corroborate their biological bases but also help understand their impact on behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2169895464,"Background Accumulating evidence indicates that RNA oxidation is involved in a wide variety of neurological diseases and may be associated with neuronal deterioration during the process of neurodegeneration. However, previous studies were done in postmortem tissues or cultured neurons. Here, we used transgenic mice to demonstrate the role of RNA oxidation in the process of neurodegeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrated that messenger RNA (mRNA) oxidation is a common feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients as well as in many different transgenic mice expressing familial ALS-linked mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In mutant SOD1 mice, increased mRNA oxidation primarily occurs in the motor neurons and oligodendrocytes of the spinal cord at an early, pre-symptomatic stage. Identification of oxidized mRNA species revealed that some species are more vulnerable to oxidative damage, and importantly, many oxidized mRNA species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Oxidative modification of mRNA causes reduced protein expression. Reduced mRNA oxidation by vitamin E restores protein expression and partially protects motor neurons. Conclusion/Significance These findings suggest that mRNA oxidation is an early event associated with motor neuron deterioration in ALS, and may be also a common early event preceding neuron degeneration in other neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2084184971,"Key vasculogenic (de-novo vessel forming) and angiogenic (vessel remodelling) events occur in the mouse embryo between embryonic days (E) 8.0 and 10.0 of gestation, during which time the vasculature develops from a simple circulatory loop into a complex, fine structured, three-dimensional organ. Interpretation of vascular phenotypes exhibited by signalling pathway mutants has historically been hindered by an inability to comprehensively image the normal sequence of events that shape the basic architecture of the early mouse vascular system. We have employed Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) using frequency distance relationship (FDR)-based deconvolution to image embryos immunostained with the endothelial specific marker PECAM-1 to create a high resolution, three-dimensional atlas of mouse vascular development between E8.0 and E10.0 (5 to 30 somites). Analysis of the atlas has provided significant new information regarding normal development of intersomitic vessels, the perineural vascular plexus, the cephalic plexus and vessels connecting the embryonic and extraembryonic circulation. We describe examples of vascular remodelling that provide new insight into the mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis, vascular guidance cues and artery/vein identity that directly relate to phenotypes observed in mouse mutants affecting vascular development between E8.0 and E10.0. This atlas is freely available at http://www.mouseimaging.ca/research/mouse_atlas.html and will serve as a platform to provide insight into normal and abnormal vascular development."
https://openalex.org/W1993796429,"In nature, yeasts are subject to predation by flies of the genus Drosophila. In response to nutritional starvation Saccharomyces cerevisiae differentiates into a dormant cell type, termed a spore, which is resistant to many types of environmental stress. The stress resistance of the spore is due primarily to a spore wall that is more elaborate than the vegetative cell wall. We report here that S. cerevisiae spores survive passage through the gut of Drosophila melanogaster. Constituents of the spore wall that distinguish it from the vegetative cell wall are necessary for this resistance. Ascospores of the distantly related yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe also display resistance to digestion by D. melanogaster. These results suggest that the primary function of the yeast ascospore is as a cell type specialized for dispersion by insect vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2052534171,"Previously, we have identified a novel CCCH zinc finger protein family as negative regulators of macrophage activation. To gain an overall insight into the entire CCCH zinc finger gene family and to evaluate their potential role in macrophage activation, here we performed a genome-wide survey of CCCH zinc finger genes in mouse and human. Totally 58 CCCH zinc finger genes in mouse and 55 in human were identified and most of them have not been reported previously. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the mouse CCCH family was divided into 6 groups. Meanwhile, we employed quantitative real-time PCR to profile their tissue expression patterns in adult mice. Clustering analysis showed that most of CCCH genes were broadly expressed in all of tissues examined with various levels. Interestingly, several CCCH genes Mbnl3, Zfp36l2, Zfp36, Zc3h12a, Zc3h12d, Zc3h7a and Leng9 were enriched in macrophage-related organs such as thymus, spleen, lung, intestine and adipose. Consistently, a comprehensive assessment of changes in expression of the 58 members of the mouse CCCH family during macrophage activation also revealed that these CCCH zinc finger genes were associated with the activation of bone marrow-derived macrophages by lipopolysaccharide. Taken together, this study not only identified a functional module of CCCH zinc finger genes in the regulation of macrophage activation but also provided the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging gene family."

The study determined magnitude and causes of avoidable blindness in India in 2007 among the 50+ population. Methods and Findings Sixteen randomly selected districts where blindness surveys were undertaken 7 to 10 years earlier were identified for a follow up survey. Stratified cluster sampling was used and 25 clusters (20 rural and 5 urban) were randomly picked in each district.. After a random start, 100 individuals aged 50+ were enumerated and examined sequentially in each cluster. All those with presenting vision <6/18 were dilated and examined by an ophthalmologist. 42722 individuals aged > = 50 years were enumerated, and 94.7% examined. Based on presenting vision,, 4.4% (95% Confidence Interval[CI]: 4.1,4.8) were severely visually impaired (vision<6/60 to 3/60 in the better eye) and 3.6% (95% CI: 3.3,3.9) were blind (vision<3/60 in the better eye). Prevalence of low vision (<6/18 to 6/60 in the better eye) was 16.8% (95% CI: 16.0,17.5). Prevalence of blindness and severe visual impairment (<6/60 in the better eye) was higher among rural residents (8.2%; 95% CI: 7.9,8.6) compared to urban (7.1%; 95% CI: 5.0, 9.2), among females (9.2%; 95% CI: 8.6,9.8) compared to males (6.5%; 95% CI: 6.0,7.1) and people above 70 years (20.6%; 95% CI: 19.1,22.0) compared to people aged 50–54 years (1.3%; 95% CI: 1.1,1.6). Of all blindness, 88.2% was avoidable. of which 81.9% was due to cataract and 7.1% to uncorrected refractive errors/uncorrected aphakia. Conclusions Cataract and refractive errors are major causes of blindness and low vision and control strategies should prioritize them. Most blindness and low vision burden is avoidable."
https://openalex.org/W2018541716,"In numerous cell types, tumoral cells, proliferating cells, bacteria, and yeast, respiration is inhibited when high concentrations of glucose are added to the culture medium. This phenomenon has been named the “Crabtree effect.” We used yeast to investigate (i) the short term event(s) associated with the Crabtree effect and (ii) a putative role of hexose phosphates in the inhibition of respiration. Indeed, yeast divide into “Crabtree-positive,” where the Crabtree effect occurs, and “Crabtree-negative,” where it does not. In mitochondria isolated from these two categories of yeast, we found that low, physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate slightly (20%) stimulated the respiratory flux and that this effect was strongly antagonized by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16bP). On the other hand, F16bP by itself was able to inhibit mitochondrial respiration only in mitochondria isolated from a Crabtree-positive strain. Using permeabilized spheroplasts from Crabtree-positive yeast, we have shown that the sole effect observed at physiological concentrations of hexose phosphates is an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by F16bP. This F16bP-mediated inhibition was also observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria, extending this process to mammalian cells. From these results and taking into account that F16bP is able to accumulate in the cell cytoplasm, we propose that F16bP regulates oxidative phosphorylation and thus participates in the establishment of the Crabtree effect.

In aerobic organisms, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are coordinated to fulfill the cell energy demand. In some conditions, such as glucose addition to the cells, one can observe an increase in glycolytic flux, whereas respiration is inhibited. This has been observed in tumoral cells (1.Crabtree H.G. Biochem. J. 1929; 22: 1289-1298Crossref Google Scholar), nontumoral proliferating cells (2.Greiner E.F. Guppy M. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31484-31490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some bacteria (3.Mustea I. Muresian T. Cancer. 1967; 20: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and some yeast species (4.Van Urk H. Voll W.S. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these cases, glucose induces a transition to a mostly fermentative metabolism. This phenomenon has been named the “Crabtree effect,” after its discoverer (1.Crabtree H.G. Biochem. J. 1929; 22: 1289-1298Crossref Google Scholar). The physiological events that could clearly explain the occurrence of the Crabtree effect are currently unknown, although many hypotheses have been laid (4.Van Urk H. Voll W.S. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Gatt S. Racker E. J. Biol.

Juarez O. Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Moreno-Sanchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been proposed, for instance, that it could originate from a competition between mitochondria and glycolytic enzymes for free ADP and inorganic phosphate (5.Gatt S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sanchez N.S. Calahorra M. González-Hernandez J.C. Peña A. Yeast. 2006; 23: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, the respiration of isolated mitochondria is decreased in the presence of ADP-consuming systems, such as reconstituted glycolysis or the phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system (5.Gatt S. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, after glucose addition, ADP levels remain constant or even increase in yeast (6.Chapman C. Bartley W. Biochem. J. 1969; 111: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9.Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Bunoust O. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and hepatoma cells (7.Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Juarez O. Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Moreno-Sanchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in both models, there is a transient decrease in cytoplasmic Pi levels (7.Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Juarez O. Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Moreno-Sanchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10.den Hollander J.A. Ugurbil K. Brown T.R. Shulman R.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5871-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), pointing to a possible role of Pi or phosphate potential (ΔGp) in this process. It has been proposed that one of the short term events leading to the Crabtree effect is an overflow through pyruvate decarboxylase, since it has been observed that in Crabtree-positive yeast strains, its activity increases after a glucose pulse (4.Van Urk H. Voll W.S. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, pyruvate decarboxylase seems to be an important bypass of pyruvate dehydrogenase during oxidative metabolism (11.Boubekeur S. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Castroviejo M. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21044-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that changes in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability could be critical for the regulation of the Crabtree effect (12.Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From results obtained with reconstituted systems (12.Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with mitochondria isolated from potato tubers (13.Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis could close the voltage-dependent anionic channel and consequently limit the passage of molecules such as ADP toward the intermembrane space. In permeabilized yeast cells, it has been shown that NADH is not involved in the voltage-dependent anionic channel closure and that in situ produced NADH is channeled through voltage-dependent anionic channel to the intermembrane space, where the external NADH dehydrogenases are located (14.Averet N. Aguilaniu H. Bunoust O. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Another possible effector involved in the Crabtree effect is Ca2+ (15.Evtodienko Y.V. Teplova V.V. Duszyński J. Bogucka K. Wojtczak L. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In Ehrlich ascites tumors and in Zajdela hepatoma cells, it has been observed that there is a glucose-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels along with an enhanced mitochondrial uptake of this cation. Inside the mitochondria, Ca2+ would inhibit ATP synthase by enhancing the interaction with IF1, its inhibitory subunit (16.Wojtczak L. Teplova V.V. Bogucka K. Czyz A. Makowska A. Wieckowski M.R. Duszynski J. Evtodienko Y.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, is not clear whether this Ca2+ accumulation is a common event in all Crabtree-positive cells, since in AS-D30 hepatoma cells, calcium levels are not modified after glucose addition (7.Rodriguez-Enriquez S. Juarez O. Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Moreno-Sanchez R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, to date, no clear experimental results have allowed determination of the early event leading to the Crabtree effect. With regard to this Crabtree effect, yeast species are either negative (e.g. Candida utilis) or positive (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Yeast thus constitutes a good experimental model to study this effect. Under its alternative designation of glucose repression, the Crabtree effect has indeed been thoroughly studied in S. cerevisiae, in which short term and long term events have been defined. Regarding the latter class of events, when S. cerevisiae grows using high glucose concentrations as carbon source, it represses oxidative metabolism by down-regulating the synthesis of mitochondrial respiratory chain components and by inhibiting enzymatic activities of the Krebs and glyoxylate cycles. At the same time, the expression of glycolytic enzymes is enhanced (reviewed in Ref. 17.Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas long term effects have been thoroughly studied and are very well understood, the origin of the short term events is ill defined. It has been proposed that during glucose repression, metabolic intermediates could have a regulatory role in both short and long term events, functioning as “metabolic messengers” (18.Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). For instance, in mutants that accumulate different glycolysis metabolites, the transcription of glycolytic genes increases, pointing to a relationship between internal metabolite levels and enzyme expression (19.Muller S. Boles E. May M. Zimmermann F.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4517-4519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (e.g. glucose phosphorylation to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) 4The abbreviations used are: G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; T6P, trehalose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; JO2, respiratory flux; F16bP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. seems to be important for signaling processes induced by glucose (20.Rolland F. Wanke V. Cauwenberg L. Ma P. Boles E. Vanoni M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1: 33-45PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Colombo S. Ronchetti D. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Martegani E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46715-46722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22.Tisi R. Baldassa S. Belotti F. Martegani E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); also, trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) might regulate the glycolytic flux by modulating hexokinase activity (23.Blazquez M.A. Lagunas R. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar)). Therefore, a yeast mutant that lacks trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (Tps1p) overaccumulates glycolysis hexose phosphates in response to glucose (24.Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether metabolic intermediates could function as messengers in long or short term regulatory events. In S. cerevisiae, cytoplasmic levels of glycolysis hexose phosphates increase after glucose addition to the culture medium (25.Diderich J.A. Raamsdonk L.M. Kuiper A. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. van Dam K. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 165-172PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ernandes J.R. De Meirsman C. Rolland F. Winderickx J. de Winde J. Brandao R.L. Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1998; 14: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the possible role of glycolysis intermediates as metabolic messengers, we investigated whether some of these could contribute to the short term Crabtree effect (i.e. function as signaling molecules during glucose-induced repression of oxidative metabolism). In order to study such a process, we took advantage of the existence of Crabtree-positive (S. cerevisiae) and Crabtree-negative (C. utilis) yeast strains. In both kinds of isolated mitochondria, we found that low, physiological concentrations of G6P and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) stimulated the respiratory flux (JO2), and this effect was strongly antagonized by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16bP). On the other hand, F16bP by itself inhibited mitochondrial respiration only in mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae. We also observed that in the yeast mutant Δtps1, which accumulates F16bP in response to glucose addition, the Crabtree effect is enhanced as compared with the parental strain. Moreover, F16bP-mediated inhibition of respiratory flux was also observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Based on these results and taking into account that F16bP accumulates in the cell cytoplasm under certain conditions, we propose that F16bP has an effector role in the repression of oxidative metabolism observed in the course of the Crabtree effect. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae (Yeast Foam, an industrial strain) and C. utilis (laboratory strain) were used for mitochondria preparation. Cultures were obtained by growing cells in YPL medium (1% yeast extract, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.12% ammonium sulfate, supplemented with 2% lactate as carbon source, pH 5.5). Yeast cells were harvested in midlog growth phase for spheroplasts and mitochondria preparation. The laboratory strains W303 1-A (wild type: Mat a, ade 2-1, trp1-1, leu 2-3/112, his 3-11-15, ura 3-1, can 1-100, GAL, SUC2) and YSH 648 (Mat a, ade 2-1, trp1-1, leu 2-3/112, his 3-11-15, ura 3-1, can 1-100, GAL, SUC, tps1::TRP1) (27.Noubhani A. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Thevelein J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4566-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were grown in YPGal medium (1% yeast extract, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.12% ammonium sulfate, pH 5.5, supplemented with 2% galactose as carbon source) and collected at 1 unit of optical density. Spheroplasts and Mitochondria Preparation—Spheroplasts were obtained according to Avéret et al. (28.Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were resuspended in buffer A (1 m sorbitol, 1.7 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm iodoacetate, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8). Yeast mitochondria were isolated from spheroplasts as described elsewhere (29.Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and they were suspended in buffer B (0.6 m mannitol, 5 mm MES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8). Rat liver mitochondria were obtained according to Saavedra-Molina et al. (30.Saavedra-Molina A. Uribe S. Devlin T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from male Wistar rats weighing 180–200 g and suspended in buffer C (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). Protein determination was done using the biuret method with BSA as a standard. Respiration Assay—The rate of oxygen consumption was measured in a thermostatically controlled chamber at 28 °C equipped with a Clark electrode connected to a recorder. Spheroplasts (1 mg of protein/ml) or mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in buffer A or B, respectively. NADH (1 mm for mitochondria or 10 mm for spheroplasts) or 100 mm ethanol was used as respiratory substrate. For rat liver mitochondria, 5 mm glutamate/malate was used. In order to achieve proper permeabilization, spheroplasts were incubated for 10 min with nystatin (20 μg/ml) at 28 °C before each experiment. For cytochrome c oxidase-mediated respiration, mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of antimycin (2.5 μg/mg of protein), 2.5 mm ascorbate, and 100 μmN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. To induce state 3 respiration, ADP was added at the concentration indicated in the figure legends. To determine cellular respiration, galactose-grown cells (wild type W303 1-A and Δtps1) or lactate-grown cells (Yeast Foam and C. utilis) collected in midlog phase were placed in an oxygraph. Determination of Mitochondrial Complex III (Ubiquinol:Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase) Activity—Mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in buffer B in the presence of 1 mm KCN, 2 mm ferricyanide, and 100 mm ethanol as respiratory substrate. Since isolated S. cerevisiae mitochondria do not have a complex I (31.Ohnishi T. Kawaguchi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1797-1806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but rather internal and external NADH dehydrogenases that donate their electrons to the quinone pool, the ferricyanide reduction rate in these conditions is representative of the ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity. Absorbance changes were followed at 436 nm in a Safas spectrophotometer (Monaco). The rate of ferricyanide reduction was calculated from the slope of absorbance change as a function of time. A molar extinction coefficient (ϵ) of 0.21 mm–1 cm–1 was used. Measurement of Mitochondrial Transmembranal Electrical Potential Difference (Δψ) by Fluorescent Probe Distribution—ΔΨ was estimated from fluorescent quenching of the lipophilic cationic dye rhodamine 123 (32.Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (0.3 mg/ml) were incubated in the mitochondrial buffer supplemented with rhodamine 123 (Sigma) (0.5 μg/ml) in the presence of 100 mm EtOH as respiratory substrate. The rhodamine fluorescence signal at each steady state was recorded with a Kontron SFM 25 fluorimeter at 28 °C. The excitation wavelength was 485 nm, and fluorescence emission was continuously collected at 525 nm. Metabolite Separation and Quantification by HPIC (High Performance Ionic Chromatography)—High Performance Ionic Chromatography (HPIC) was carried out on a DX 500 chromatography work station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with GP50 gradient pump and ED50 electrochemical and UV detectors. System management and data acquisition were controlled through Peaknet 4.3 software (Dionex). Separation and quantification of sugar phosphates was carried out on a CarboPac PA10 column (250 × 4 mm) equipped with a Dionex PA1 guard column according to Ref. 33.Loret M.O. Pedersen L. François J. Yeast. 2007; 24: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. In yeast cells, the addition of large amounts of glucose results in a metabolic shift toward fermentation and in the accumulation of glycolysis hexose phosphates (25.Diderich J.A. Raamsdonk L.M. Kuiper A. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. van Dam K. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 165-172PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ernandes J.R. De Meirsman C. Rolland F. Winderickx J. de Winde J.

Since accumulation of hexose phosphates occurs concomitantly with an inhibition of respiration, we tested the possibility of a direct role of these intermediates in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Each one of the three glycolysis hexose phosphates (G6P, F6P, and F16bP) was tested. Fig. 1 shows the effect of G6P, F6P, and F16bP on nonphosphorylating respiration. The respiration was stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of G6P and F6P. Although the stimulation mediated by G6P was considerable, it should be stressed that cytosolic concentrations from 1 to 6 mm have been reported; thus, higher concentrations of G6P are not physiological, and only the stimulation induced by up to 5 mm G6P is physiologically meaningful. In the presence of F6P, this increase was less important, and for physiological concentrations (less than 1 mm), there was no effect. On the other hand, F16bP, at physiological concentrations (2–10 mm) (25.Diderich J.A. Raamsdonk L.M. Kuiper A. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. van Dam K.

This effect is not dependent on the respiratory substrate, since the same effect was also observed when using ethanol as substrate instead of NADH (data not shown). Under phosphorylation conditions, G6P and F6P had no significant effect on the respiratory rate (Fig. 2), whereas the inhibition in the presence of F16bP was still observed (20%). This indicates that the F16bP-mediated inhibition is present regardless of the respiratory state.FIGURE 2Effect of glycolysis-derived hexose phosphates on the respiratory flux of isolated yeast mitochondria under phosphorylating conditions. Reaction mixture and respiratory substrate were the same as in Fig. 1 except that 1 mm ADP was added. Respiratory rates were measured after the addition of various concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate (▪), fructose 6-phosphate (○), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (▴), as indicated.

Up to 20 mm, the addition of either G6P or F6P did not change the transmembrane potential value (Table 1). Furthermore, the ΔΨm did not vary up to 8 mm F16bP and slightly (10 mV) decreased upon the addition of 20 mm F16bP (Table 1). Based on these results, the hypothesis of a possible uncoupling effect induced by G6P and F6P was ruled out. The F16bP-mediated decrease of the respiratory rate in either state, plus the null to slight decrease in ΔΨm strongly suggested that at least one of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes is inhibited.TABLE 1Mitochondrial transmembranal electrical potential difference in the presence of hexose phosphatesΔψ0 mm2 mm4 mm6 mm8 mm10 mm20 mmmVG6P178 ± 4178 ± 3175 ± 5177 ± 4174 ± 5175 ± 4173 ± 3F6P178 ± 4177 ± 5178 ± 5180 ± 4180 ± 3180 ± 5178 ± 3F16bP178 ± 4177 ± 5175 ± 3175 ± 4176 ± 7171 ± 6168 ± 3 Open table in a new tab During the fermentative shift, every hexose phosphate increases in the cytosol. Thus, the mitochondria are in the presence of all of these hexoses at the same time. Therefore, we tested whether the G6P-induced stimulation of the respiratory rate could be inhibited by F16bP. G6P (3 mm)-induced stimulation was reverted by 1.5 mm F16bP (Fig. 3). Moreover, the F16bP (7 mm)-induced inhibition was present (i.e. 25%; 154 nanoatoms of oxygen/min/mg of protein versus 204 nanoatoms of oxygen/min/mg of protein). This indicates that under physiological conditions, the effect of glycolysis hexose phosphates on oxidative phosphorylation is that of F16bP (i.e. an inhibition of the respiratory rate). As mentioned above and in view of the results observed for flux and ΔΨm in the presence of each hexose phosphate (see above), we identified the respiratory chain complex(es) whose activity is affected by these hexose phosphates. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes an irreversible step of the respiratory chain and has been identified as an important step for controlling the respiratory fluxes both in phosphorylating and nonphosphorylating conditions (35.Mazat J.P. Jean-Bart E. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 7-15Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36.Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Denis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Complex IV activity is strongly inhibited by F16bP (Fig. 4). This inhibition, which is similar regardless of the respiratory state, is important at low concentrations and reaches ∼30% of inhibition for 5 mm F16bP. Furthermore, G6P and F6P had no effects on cytochrome c oxidase activity (data not shown). We then assessed complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity in the presence of these glycolysis intermediates. Both hexose monophosphates stimulated the basal activity of complex III (Fig. 5). This activation was similar for both hexose monophosphates, reaching a maximal stimulation at ∼150% of the basal value. However, this maximal stimulation was obtained for nonphysiological concentrations of these intermediates, and only a slight stimulation was observed in the presence of physiological (3 mm G6P and 1 mm F6P) concentrations of hexose monophosphates. An F16bP-induced inhibition was also observed on this respiratory complex. Furthermore, hexose phosphate-mediated effects shown in Fig. 5 were sensitive to antimycin A (data not shown), indicating that the ferricyanide reduction rate assessed here was indeed mediated by complex III. Since hexose monophosphates and F16bP have, respectively, stimulatory and inhibitory effects over complex III activity (Fig. 5), we decided to determine whether these antagonistic effects could be observed on the functionally isolated complex III. Indeed, G6P-mediated stimulation of complex III could be reverted by F16bP, and basal activity was almost restored (Fig. 6). To this point, we have used mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae as an experimental model. However, to extrapolate our results to the in vivo situation, it was necessary to study mitochondria in a more physiological context. One approach that has been used to undertake bioenergetic studies in situ is the use of permeabilized cells (28.Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Mol. Cell.

To determine the effect of F16bP on the mitochondrial respiratory rate in situ, we evaluated nystatin-permeabilized spheroplast respiration in the presence of this hexose. To avoid F16bP metabolism, we omitted the cofactors required for adequate function of the glycolytic enzymes and added iodoacetate in respiration buffer. Fig. 7 shows that in nystatin-permeabilized spheroplasts, F16bP inhibited the nonphosphorylating respiratory rates by 50%. The range of concentrations used to obtain the maximum inhibition was similar to that employed on isolated mitochondria: 6–10 mm for state 4 and 2–4 mm for state 3 (data not shown). Of note, these concentrations are within the physiological range (25.Diderich J.A. Raamsdonk L.M. Kuiper A. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Teixeira de Mattos M.J. van Dam K.

However, an exceedingly high concentration was required to observe a stimulation of respiratory flux (∼120 mm) (data not shown), indicating that there might be a constraint for metabolite diffusion toward mitochondria or the intermembrane space. A similar situation was observed in permeabilized cells for NADH in yeast (28.Averet N. Fitton V. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes (37.Fontaine E.M. Keriel C. Lantuejoul S. Rigoulet M. Leverve X.M. Saks V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These data suggested that cancer epithelial cells control P2X7 mRNA expression through targets in the 3′-UTR P2X7. Moreover, because the decrease of P2X7 mRNA was quantitatively as great as that of the protein in cancer cells (22Li X. Zhou L. Feng Y.H. Abdul-Karim F. Gorodeski G.I. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2006; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is possible that P2X7 mRNA is degraded at a faster rate in cancer cells than in normal epithelial cells. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which cancer epithelial cells control the expression of P2X7 mRNA post-transcriptionally. Degradation of mRNA can be mediated by two main mechanisms as follows: cis-dependent trans-acting regulatory proteins (28Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that post-transcriptional regulation of P2X7 mRNA expression involves miRNAs. miRNAs are small, noncoding 18–25-nucleotide RNAs that regulate mRNA targets and control critical functions across various biological processes (31Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. Downing J.R. Jacks T. Horvitz H.R. Golub T.R.

We found putative target sites for miR-186 and miR-150 within the 3′-UTR of P2X7, and both of these cis-elements conferred instability to the transcript. Mutagenesis of these sites confirmed that they are important for the maintenance of P2X7 mRNA stability. The data showed that levels of miR-186 and miR-150 were higher in cancer than in normal cells, both in vivo and in cultured cells. In addition, treatment with miR-186 and miR-150 inhibitors increased P2X7 mRNA, predominantly in the normal cells. Also, in the host human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK293) cells heterologously expressing a luciferase reporter containing the full-length human 3′-UTR-P2X7, treatment with miR-186 and miR-150 inhibitors increased luciferase activity. To determine whether a decrease in transcription or RNA stability produced the decreased luciferase activity, HEK293 cells containing the 3′-UTR-P2X7 reporter and miR-186 and miR-150 mimics were treated with actinomycin D, and the results showed a decrease in luciferase activity in the presence and absence of the drug. These data suggest that miR-186 and miR-150 stimulate a decrease in P2X7 mRNA steady-state levels by targeting instability sites within the 3′-UTR of the P2X7 gene. The data suggest that the reduced expression of P2X7 in cancer epithelial cells is the result of high steady-state levels of miR-186 and miR-150 in cancer cells, which activate the instability domains and decrease P2X7 mRNA levels possibly by inducing degradation of the transcript. Human Tissues—Discarded human tissues were obtained according to IRB protocols 12-03-50 and 03-90-300 from the Human Tissue Procurement Facility of University Hospital CASE Medical Center/the Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Procurement Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. Cross-sections of uterine (ectocervical and endometrial), bladder, and breast segments were obtained from paraffin-embedded blocks that were prepared by the Department of Pathology initially to establish the diagnosis for the patient. For the purpose of this study, additional parallel 10-μm sections were cut, and slides intended for immunostaining were made by the Department of Pathology according to standard procedures. This part of the study included tissues obtained from four women with cervical cancers, three women with endometrial cancers, two women and one man with bladder cancers, and three women with breast cancers. Included for each case were cross-sections of the cancer tissue and an adjacent histologically normal tissue. Discarded human endometrial and ectocervical tissues from women undergoing hysterectomy for indications unrelated to this study were obtained according to the above IRB protocols also from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (NCI, National Institutes of Health) through the Human Tissue Resource Network, Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus. These tissues were used for mRNA and microRNA assays. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid N2, shipped on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until assayed. Included were tissues obtained from two women with endometrial adenocarcinomas, three women with cervical squamous carcinomas, and from four women with histologically normal cervix. The histological diagnoses presented below were made by the Departments of Pathology at University Hospitals of Cleveland or at the Ohio State University. No attempt was made to categorize results by ethnic origin or race of the patients.

P2X7-Antisense Oligonucleotides—P2X7-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and random control oligonucleotides (RCO) were designed from the published sequence of the human P2X7 gene (NM_002562). The sequences of the 20-mer ASO that would hybridize to the coding region of exon 7 (nt 724–741) and the RCO are shown in Table 1. In the RCO the antisense sequence was randomly replaced with adenine and thymine residues so that the oligonucleotides had the same length (20-mer) and GC content (33%) as the ASO. The RCO was designed such that no cross-hybridization against the P2X7 gene would occur. To assess the effects of the ASO and RCO on P2X7 mRNA expression, cultured cells were treated with or without ASO or RCO at concentrations of 10 μm. qPCR assays were carried out after 2 days, and Western blots and apoptosis determinations were made after 3 days.TABLE 1Sequences of P2X7 oligonucleotides, miR-186 and miR-150, and primers for P2X7 3′-UTR and luciferase The underlined segments within the miR-186 and miR-150 sequences are the putative seed sequences that base pair with their respective targets. Open table in a new tab 3′-UTR-P2X7 Assays—Fig. 1, top, shows the sequence of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR, 1272 nt) of the human P2X7 gene (NM_002562).

Primers for amplification of the segments are shown in Table 1. The corresponding cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription using human keratinocyte RNA as the template and oligo(dT) (16Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J.

The full-length P2X7 3′-UTR was cloned by digestion of the two PCR fragments with XbaI and StuI and ligation of the products into pGL3 promoter luciferase reporter vector (SV40 promoter, Promega, Madison, WI), containing XbaI-5′ and XbaI-3′ sites, using the rapid ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). P2X7 3′-UTR Segments 1–3 were cloned by digestion with XbaI and ligation into the same vector. Primers for experiments testing putative miR-186 and miR-150 target regions within the human P2X7 3′-UTR are shown in Table 1. Each complementary pair of primers was ligated into the pGL3 promoter vector XbaI site and cloned as described above. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Control plasmids or test plasmids (P2X7-3′-UTR full-length luciferase, P2X7-3′-UTR-Segment-1-luciferase, P2X7-3′-UTR-Segment-2-luciferase, or P2X7-3′-UTR-Segment-3-luciferase) were transfected into hEVEC or HeLa cells. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2·105 cells per well, resulting in subconfluent cultures. After 14 h of incubation the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium plus 100 μl of serum-free medium (per well) containing 2.5 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 750 ng of DNA of the control or test vectors. After 48 h cells were shifted to fresh medium lacking plasmids, and at times 0, 3, and 6 h, cells were harvested in RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; RNeasy mini kit). Total RNA was extracted, and luciferase mRNA levels were determined by the one-step real time RT-PCR using the primers described in Table 1. qPCR assays utilized 600 ng of RNA/sample as described (22Li X.

https://openalex.org/W2058828220,"Stochastic resonance is a nonlinear phenomenon whereby the addition of noise can improve the detection of weak stimuli. An optimal amount of added noise results in the maximum enhancement, whereas further increases in noise intensity only degrade detection or information content. The phenomenon does not occur in linear systems, where the addition of noise to either the system or the stimulus only degrades the signal quality. Stochastic Resonance (SR) has been extensively studied in different physical systems. It has been extended to human sensory systems where it can be classified as unimodal, central, behavioral and recently crossmodal. However what has not been explored is the extension of this crossmodal SR in humans. For instance, if under the same auditory noise conditions the crossmodal SR persists among different sensory systems.Using physiological and psychophysical techniques we demonstrate that the same auditory noise can enhance the sensitivity of tactile, visual and propioceptive system responses to weak signals. Specifically, we show that the effective auditory noise significantly increased tactile sensations of the finger, decreased luminance and contrast visual thresholds and significantly changed EMG recordings of the leg muscles during posture maintenance.We conclude that crossmodal SR is a ubiquitous phenomenon in humans that can be interpreted within an energy and frequency model of multisensory neurons spontaneous activity. Initially the energy and frequency content of the multisensory neurons' activity (supplied by the weak signals) is not enough to be detected but when the auditory noise enters the brain, it generates a general activation among multisensory neurons of different regions, modifying their original activity. The result is an integrated activation that promotes sensitivity transitions and the signals are then perceived. A physiologically plausible model for crossmodal stochastic resonance is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2150534859,"The far-red fluorescent protein mKate (lambda(ex), 588 nm; lambda(em), 635 nm; chromophore-forming triad Met(63)-Tyr(64)-Gly(65)), originating from wild-type red fluorescent progenitor eqFP578 (sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolor), is monomeric and characterized by the pronounced pH dependence of fluorescence, relatively high brightness, and high photostability. The protein has been crystallized at a pH ranging from 2 to 9 in three space groups, and four structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography at the resolution of 1.75-2.6 A. The pH-dependent fluorescence of mKate has been shown to be due to reversible cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore phenolic ring. In the non-fluorescent state at pH 2.0, the chromophore of mKate is in the trans-isomeric form. The weakly fluorescent state of the protein at pH 4.2 is characterized by a mixture of trans and cis isomers. The chromophore in a highly fluorescent state at pH 7.0/9.0 adopts the cis form. Three key residues, Ser(143), Leu(174), and Arg(197) residing in the vicinity of the chromophore, have been identified as being primarily responsible for the far-red shift in the spectra. A group of residues consisting of Val(93), Arg(122), Glu(155), Arg(157), Asp(159), His(169), Ile(171), Asn(173), Val(192), Tyr(194), and Val(216), are most likely responsible for the observed monomeric state of the protein in solution."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of an IP-10 and IL-2 based tests for the diagnosis of M.tuberculosis-infection in recently exposed children from Nigeria.Samples were obtained from 59 children at high risk of infection with M.tuberculosis (contacts of adults with smear and culture-positive tuberculosis) and 61 at low risk (contacts of smear-negative/culture-positive tuberculosis or community controls). IP-10 and IL-2 was measured in plasma after stimulation of whole-blood with M.tuberculosis specific antigens and mitogen. Previously developed criteria for positive IP-10 and IL-2 tests were used and the diagnostic performances of the IP-10 and IL-2 tests were compared with the Quantiferon In-Tube (QFT-IT) and the Tuberculin Skin Tests (TST). In response to M.tuberculosis specific antigens, the high-risk children expressed significantly higher levels of IP-10 (1358 pg/ml[IQR 278-2535 pg/ml]) and IL-2 (164 pg/ml[11-590 pg/ml]) than low risk groups 149 pg/ml(25-497 pg/ml), and 0 pg/ml(0-3 pg/ml), respectively. There was excellent agreement (>89%,k>0.80) between IP-10, IL-2 tests and QFT-IT, better than with TST (>74%,k>0.49). The IP-10 and IL-2 responses were strongly associated with M.tuberculosis exposure and with grade of infectiousness of the index cases (p<0.0001). IP-10, IL-2, and TST but not QFT-IT was associated with age of the child in the low risk groups (p<0.02).IP-10 is expressed in high levels and results of the IP-10 test were comparable to the QFT-IT. IL-2 was released in low amounts in response to the antigens and not in response to the mitogen therefore IL-2 seems a less useful marker. We have demonstrated that IP-10 and possibly IL-2 could be alternative or adjunct markers to IFN-gamma in the diagnosis infection with M.tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2140446904,"Identification of biological mediators in sarcopenia is pertinent to the development of targeted interventions to alleviate this condition. Iron is recognized as a potent pro-oxidant and a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species in biological systems. It is well accepted that iron accumulates with senescence in several organs, but little is known about iron accumulation in muscle and how it may affect muscle function. In addition, it is unclear if interventions which reduced age-related loss of muscle quality, such as calorie restriction, impact iron accumulation. We investigated non-heme iron concentration, oxidative stress to nucleic acids in gastrocnemius muscle and key indices of sarcopenia (muscle mass and grip strength) in male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats fed ad libitum (AL) or a calorie restricted diet (60% of ad libitum food intake starting at 4 months of age) at 8, 18, 29 and 37 months of age. Total non-heme iron levels in the gastrocnemius muscle of AL rats increased progressively with age. Between 29 and 37 months of age, the non-heme iron concentration increased by approximately 200% in AL-fed rats. Most importantly, the levels of oxidized RNA in gastrocnemius muscle of AL rats were significantly increased as well. The striking age-associated increase in non-heme iron and oxidized RNA levels and decrease in sarcopenia indices were all attenuated in the calorie restriction (CR) rats. These findings strongly suggest that the age-related iron accumulation in muscle contributes to increased oxidative damage and sarcopenia, and that CR effectively attenuates these negative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2143198037,"Severe anaemia is a common, frequently fatal, condition in African children admitted to hospital, but its long term outcome is unknown. Early reports that survivors may be at risk of additional late morbidity and mortality may have significant implications for child survival in Africa. We assessed the short and long term outcome of severe anaemia in Malawian children and identified potential risk factors for death and further severe anaemia.For 18 months, we followed up children (6-60 months old) presenting to hospital with severe anaemia (haemoglobin <or=5 g/dl) and their hospital and community controls with the aim to compare all cause mortality and severe anaemia recurrence rates between the groups, and to identify risk factors for these adverse outcomes. A total of 377 cases, 377 hospital controls and 380 community controls were recruited. Among cases, the in-hospital mortality was 6.4% and post-discharge all cause mortality was 12.6%, which was significantly greater than in hospital controls (2.9%) or community controls (1.4%) (Log rank test, p<0.001). The incidence of recurrence of severe anaemia among the cases was 0.102 per child-year (95% Confidence Interval 0.075-0.138), and was significantly higher than the 0.007 per child-year (95% CI 0.003-0.015) in the combined controls (p<0.0001). HIV was the most important risk factor both for post-discharge mortality (Hazard Ratio 10.5, 95% CI 4.0-27.2) and for recurrence of severe anaemia (HR 5.6, 95% CI 1.6-20.1).Severe anaemia carries a high 'hidden' morbidity and mortality occurring in the months after initial diagnosis and treatment. Because severe anaemia is very common, this is likely to contribute importantly to overall under-five mortality. If not adequately addressed, severe anaemia may be an obstacle to achievement of the Millennium development goal No.4 on child survival. Strategies to diagnose and properly treat HIV infected children early most likely will reduce the high post-discharge mortality in severe anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2162671614,"When a part of the body moves, the sensation evoked by a probe stimulus to that body part is attenuated. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain this robust and general effect. First, feedforward motor signals may modulate activity evoked by incoming sensory signals. Second, reafferent sensation from body movements may mask the stimulus. Here we delivered probe stimuli to the right index finger just before a cue which instructed subjects to make left or right index finger movements. When left and right cues were equiprobable, we found attenuation for stimuli to the right index finger just before this finger was cued (and subsequently moved). However, there was no attenuation in the right finger just before the left finger was cued. This result suggests that the movement made in response to the cue caused ‘postdictive’ attenuation of a sensation occurring prior to the cue. In a second experiment, the right cue was more frequent than the left. We now found attenuation in the right index finger even when the left finger was cued and moved. This attenuation linked to a movement that was likely but did not in fact occur, suggests a new expectation-based mechanism, distinct from both feedforward motor signals and postdiction. Our results suggest a new mechanism in motor-sensory interactions in which the motor system tunes the sensory inputs based on expectations about future possible actions that may not, in fact, be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2003926325,"Intravenous injections of cocaine HCl are habit-forming because, among their many actions, they elevate extracellular dopamine levels in the terminal fields of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. This action, thought to be very important for cocaine's strong addiction liability, is believed to have very short latency and is assumed to reflect rapid brain entry and pharmacokinetics of the drug. However, while intravenous cocaine HCl has almost immediate effects on behavior and extracellular dopamine levels, recent evidence suggests that its central pharmacological effects are not evident until 10 or more seconds after IV injection. Thus the immediate effects of a given intravenous cocaine injection on extracellular dopamine concentration and behavior appear to occur before there is sufficient time for cocaine to act centrally as a dopamine uptake inhibitor. To explore the contribution of peripheral effects of cocaine to the early activation of the dopamine system, we used brain microdialysis to measure the effects of cocaine methiodide (MI)—a cocaine analogue that does not cross the blood brain barrier—on glutamate (excitatory) input to the dopamine cells. IP injections of cocaine MI were ineffective in cocaine-naïve animals but stimulated ventral tegmental glutamate release in rats previously trained to lever-press for cocaine HCl. This peripherally triggered glutamate input was sufficient to reinstate cocaine-seeking in previously trained animals that had undergone extinction of the habit. These findings offer an explanation for short-latency behavioral responses and immediate dopamine elevations seen following cocaine injections in cocaine-experienced but not cocaine-naïve animals."
https://openalex.org/W1999481398,"Effective tracking of immunotherapeutic cells is essential for monitoring the migration of injected cells to the target tissue. Here we report the use of near-infrared (NIR) -emitting fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, called quantum dots (QDs), for noninvasive in vivo tracking of dendritic cell (DC) migration into lymph nodes. The effect of QDs on DC viability and maturation was systematically investigated using MTT assays and FACS analysis. We found that the labeling of DCs with QDs had no effect on DC phenotype or maturation potential. Cytokine and migration assays revealed that there were no significant changes in either cytokine production or chemokine-dependent migration of QD-labeled DCs relative to unlabeled cells; in both labeled and unlabeled cells, cytokine production and migratory capacity was increased by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, QDs did not influence allogenic naive T cell activation or uptake of exogenous antigens. Notably, we also demonstrated that it was possible to track QD-labeled DCs injected into the footpad into popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes using NIR fluorescence. Taken together, our protocols establish the potential of noninvasive in vivo imaging of NIR-emitting QDs for tracking immunotherapeutic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2160257473,"Vivax malaria remains a major cause of morbidity in the subtropics. To undermine the stability of the disease, drugs are required that prevent relapse and provide reservoir reduction. A 14-day course of primaquine (PQ) is effective but cannot safely be used in routine practice because of its interaction with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency for which testing is seldom available. Safe and effective use of PQ without the need for G6PD testing would be ideal. The efficacy and safety of an 8-week, once weekly PQ regimen was compared with current standard treatment (chloroquine alone) and a 14-day PQ regimen.200 microscopically confirmed Plasmodium vivax patients were randomly assigned to either once weekly 8-week PQ (0.75 mg/kg/week), once weekly 8-week placebo, or 14-day PQ (0.5mg/kg/day) in North West Frontier Province, Pakistan. All patients were treated with a standard chloroquine dose and tested for G6PD deficiency. Deficient patients were assigned to the 8-week PQ group. Failure was defined as any subsequent episode of vivax malaria over 11 months of observation. There were 22/71 (31.0%) failures in the placebo group and 1/55 (1.8%) and 4/75 (5.1%) failures in the 14-day and 8-week PQ groups, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios were: for 8-week PQ vs. placebo-0.05 (95%CI: 0.01-0.2, p<0.001) and for 14-day PQ vs. placebo-0.01 (95%CI: 0.002-0.1, p<0.001). Restricted analysis allowing for a post-treatment prophylactic effect confirmed that the 8-week regimen was superior to current treatment. Only one G6PD deficient patient presented. There were no serious adverse events.A practical radical treatment for vivax malaria is essential for control and elimination of the disease. The 8-week PQ course is more effective at preventing relapse than current treatment with chloroquine alone. Widespread use of the 8-week regimen could make an important contribution to reservoir reduction or regional elimination where G6PD testing is not available.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00158587."
https://openalex.org/W2066377184,"Nuclear export of mRNA requires several key mRNA-binding proteins that recognize and remodel the mRNA and target it for export via interactions with the nuclear pore complex. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, Nab2, which is essential for mRNA export, specifically recognizes poly(A) RNA and binds to the nuclear pore-associated protein, myosin-like protein 1 (Mlp1), which functions in mRNA export and quality control. Specifically, the N-terminal domain of Nab2 (Nab2-N; residues 1-97) interacts directly with the C-terminal globular domain of Mlp1 (CT-Mlp1: residues 1490-1875). Recent structural and binding studies focused on Nab2-N have shown that Nab2-N contains a hydrophobic patch centered on Phe(73) that is critical for interaction with Mlp1. Engineered amino acid changes within this patch disrupt the Nab2/Mlp1 interaction in vitro. Given the importance of Nab2 and Mlp1 to mRNA export, we have examined the Nab2/Mlp1 interaction in greater detail and analyzed the functional consequences of disrupting the interaction in vivo. We find that the Nab2-binding domain of Mlp1 (Mlp1-NBD) maps to a 183-residue region (residues 1586-1768) within CT-Mlp1, binds directly to Nab2 with micromolar affinity, and confers nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA. Furthermore, we show that cells expressing a Nab2 F73D mutant that cannot interact with Mlp1 exhibit nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA and that this nab2 F73D mutant genetically interacts with alleles of two essential mRNA export genes, MEX67 and YRA1. These data provide in vivo evidence for a model of mRNA export in which Nab2 is important for targeting mRNAs to the nuclear pore for export."
https://openalex.org/W2086634152,"FBI-1 (Pokemon/ZBTB7A) is a proto-oncogenic transcription factor of the BTB/POZ (bric-à-brac, tramtrack, and broad complex and pox virus zinc finger) domain family. Recent evidence suggested that FBI-1 might be involved in adipogenic gene expression. Coincidentally, expression of FBI-1 and fatty-acid synthase (FASN) genes are often increased in cancer and immortalized cells. Both FBI-1 and FASN are important in cancer cell proliferation. SREBP-1 is a major regulator of many adipogenic genes, and FBI-1 and SREBP-1 (sterol-responsive element (SRE)-binding protein 1) interact with each other directly via their DNA binding domains. FBI-1 enhanced the transcriptional activation of SREBP-1 on responsive promoters, pGL2-6x(SRE)-Luc and FASN gene. FBI-1 and SREBP-1 synergistically activate transcription of the FASN gene by acting on the proximal GC-box and SRE/E-box. FBI-1, Sp1, and SREBP-1 can bind to all three SRE, GC-box, and SRE/E-box. Binding competition among the three transcription factors on the GC-box and SRE/E-box appears important in the transcription regulation. FBI-1 is apparently changing the binding pattern of Sp1 and SREBP-1 on the two elements in the presence of induced SREBP-1 and drives more Sp1 binding to the proximal promoter with less of an effect on SREBP-1 binding. The changes induced by FBI-1 appear critical in the synergistic transcription activation. The molecular mechanism revealed provides insight into how proto-oncogene FBI-1 may attack the cellular regulatory mechanism of FASN gene expression to provide more phospholipid membrane components needed for rapid cancer cell proliferation.

FBI-1 (factor that binds to the inducer of short transcripts of human immunodeficiency virus-1, also called Pokemon, ZBTB7A) is a member of the BTB/POZ domain class of transcription regulatory proteins (1Bardwell V.J.

Serial analysis of gene expression analysis revealed that expression of FBI-1 is increased in multiple cancers (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Recently, FBI-1 was shown to cause cancer in the thymus, liver, and spleen by repressing the tumor suppressor gene ARF that in turn lowers the expression of another tumor suppressor p53 gene (11Maeda T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of SREBPs as follows: SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are transcribed from the same SREBP-1 gene, each by a distinct promoter. The two SREBP-1 proteins are identical except the extreme N termini. SREBP-1a has 28 unique amino acids from its first exon and SREBP-1c has only four (in addition to the initiator Methionine). SREBP-2 is encoded by the separate gene SREBP-2 that encodes a single mRNA (15, 16 and references therein). The relative levels of SREBP-1a and -1c mRNA were shown to vary over the 50-100-fold range in different tissues. The predominant isoform in adult liver and adipocytes is SREBP-1c, so it may be the key protein involved in SREBP-1-dependent processes in these tissues. SREBP-1a is also the predominant form in spleen and in all cultured cells, including cancer cells (17Shimomura L. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). It is possible that the more active SREBP-1a isoform is preferentially expressed to meet the cellular need for more cholesterol and fatty acids during periods of rapid cell proliferation. SREBP-1a has a potent activation domain in the N-terminal region, which interacts efficiently with co-activators such as p300/CREB-binding protein (18Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Sp1 (19Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and the mammalian mediator complex (21Yang F. Vought B.W. Satterlee J.S. Walker A.K. Jim, Sun Z.Y. Watts J.L. DeBeaumont R. Saito R.M. Hyberts S.G. Yang S. Macol C. Iyer L. Tjian R. van den Heuvel S. Hart A.C. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2006; 442: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The shorter N terminus of SREBP-1c is a weak activation domain and interacts weakly with the same transcriptional co-activators. SREBP-1a is a potent transcription activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, including those that mediate the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides. SREBP-1c, with its weak and short N-terminal transcription activation domain, preferentially enhances transcription of genes required for fatty acid synthesis but not cholesterol synthesis. SREBP-2 preferentially activates cholesterol synthesis (15, 16 and references therein). One of the key metabolic enzymes of which expression is controlled by SREBP-1 is fatty-acid synthase (FASN) (16Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). FASN catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to produce the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate (22Wakil S.J. Lipids. 2004; 39: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The expression of FASN is very low in almost all nonmalignant adult tissues but is highly expressed in many cancer types (17Shimomura L. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Cancer cells show increased de novo fatty acid synthesis, and in fact, FASN is the only enzyme capable of fatty acid synthesis in most carcinomas (23-25 and references therein). Although FASN is active in cancer cells, as in liver and other lipogenic tissues, the fate of the palmitate differs between cancer cells and lipogenic tissues. In liver and adipose tissue, fatty acid synthesis occurs to store excess calories from carbohydrate as triglyceride. But most human cancers do not store significant amounts of triglyceride. Endogenously synthesized fatty acids in cancer cells are esterified to phospholipids to supply membrane components of rapidly proliferating cancer cells (26Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 280: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Swinnen J.V. Van Veldhoven P.P. Timmermans L. De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Vanderhoydonc F. Van de Sande T. Heemers H. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is important to investigate how the FASN gene is regulated not only in the normal cellular context but also in the context of cancer cells. The transcriptional regulatory network of FASN gene expression under various physiological conditions is complex and involves multiple transcription factors. Transcription factor-wise, specificity proteins 1 and 3 (Sp1 and Sp3), nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), upstream stimulatory factor, retinoic X receptor, liver X receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) have binding sites on the promoter of the FASN gene (28 and references therein). Among them, the SREBP-1 and Sp1 are major regulators acting on the proximal promoter and activate transcription synergistically by binding to the SRE (or SRE/E-box) and GC box, respectively (29Magana M.M.

They interact with each other, and the interaction was suggested to be important in synergistic transcription activation of the FASN gene. Accordingly, other proteins interacting either with SREBP-1 or Sp1 are probably important in the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in lipid biosynthesis (29Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J.

We recently found that FBI-1 interacts with both SREBP-1 and Sp1 and that FBI-1 modulates the transcriptional activation by Sp1 (4Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). FBI-1 appears to be involved in cell proliferation, preadipocyte differentiation, and adipogenesis (8Laudes M. Christodoulides C. Sewter C. Rochford J.J. Considine R.V. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A.

The expression of the FBI-1 is gradually increased up to 2 days after the induction of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3L1 cells, and its expression then decreases markedly thereafter. Also, FBI-1 overexpression in 3T3-L1 cells results in more lipid accumulation during differentiation as well. Based on these observations, it was suggested that FBI-1 may be important for adipocyte differentiation where it may activate expression of adipogenic genes, including FASN (8Laudes M. Christodoulides C. Sewter C. Rochford J.J. Considine R.V. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol.

In addition, others recently found that FBI-1 stimulates cell proliferation and is a potent proto-oncogene (11Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We suspected that the proto-oncogene FBI-1 may increase FASN gene expression in cancer cells and thereby provide phospholipid cell membrane components to meet the lipid needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. In this study, we show that the molecular interactions involving Sp1, SREBP, proto-oncogene FBI-1, and proximal promoter DNA elements are important in the transcription activation of the FASN gene that occurs in many cancer cell types. The data may have significant implications for understanding how proto-oncogene FBI-1 plays a role in lipid biosynthesis and cell proliferation during adipogenesis as well as oncogenesis.

Oligonucleotide primers used for PCR are as follows: FBI-1 (LRF-1), forward, 5′-GCCTGGCTGTGCGACGTGGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGCAGGCGGGCGGCGCTGA-3′; SREBP-1, forward, 5′-GATCGGATCCGAGAAGCGCACAGCCCACAA-3′, and reverse 5′-GATCCTCGAGGCTTTTGTGGACAGCAGTGC-3′; FASN, forward, 5′-GATCGAATTCAACCATGGAGGAGGTGGTGATAGCCGGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GATCCTCGAGTGCCAGCAAGCTGGAGGAGCAGGC-3′; Sp1, forward, 5′-CGTGGATCCACAGGTGAGCTTGACCTCACAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTGCGGCCGCCTATATGATCTGTATTTGACCAG-3′; and GAPDH, forward, 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGC-3′. Western Blot Analysis of FBI-1, SREBP, FASN, GAPDH in 293Trex, HCT116, and Prostate LNCaP Cells—Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, Complete Mini-Protease mixture). Cell extracts (25-50 μg) were separated using 8-12% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride Membrane (Bio-Rad), and blocked with 5% skim milk (BD Biosciences). Blotted membranes were incubated with antibodies against FLAG tag (Sigma), FBI-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), GAPDH (Chemicon, CA), SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FASN (prepared by us), His tag, and Myc tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse, rabbit, or goat IgG (Vector Laboratories). Protein bands were visualized with ECL solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture and Transcriptional Analysis of the SREBP-responsive pGL2-6x(SRE)-Luc Promoter by SREBP-1 and FBI-1 by Transient Transfection—Human liver Alexander, human kidney HEK293A, human colon HCT116, mouse embryonic NIH/3T3, and African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells were cultured in the medium recommended by the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and supplemented with 10-15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and grown for 16 h before transfection. To test the effect of FBI-1 on the transcriptional activation of the SREBP-1-responsive promoter, the mammalian cells were transfected with the mixture of 1.1 μg of the reporter pGL2-6x(SRE)-tk∗-Luc plasmid (0.2 μg), pcDNA3-FBI-1 (0.6 μg), and pcDNA3 SREBP-1a or -1c (0.025 μg), using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and lysed, and luciferase activities were analyzed. Luciferase activity was normalized with co-transfected β-galactosidase activity or the protein concentration of the cell lysates. To investigate the functional consequences of molecular interaction between the SREBP-1 and the ZFDBDFBI-1 on the transcription of pGL2-6x(SRE)-tk∗-Luc, the cells (HEK293A or Alexander) were co-transfected with the mixture of 1.1 μg of pGL2-6x(SRE)-tk∗-Luc (0.3 μg), pcDNA3-FBI-1, or pcDNA3-ZFDBDFBI-1 (0.6 μg) and pcDNA3 SREBP-1a or -1c (0.025 μg), using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed as described above. GST Fusion Protein Purification, in Vitro Transcription and Translation, and GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—The Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with either GST or GST-bHLHSREBP-1 proteins expression vector (pGEX4T3-bHLHSREBP-1) was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. After E. coli pellets were lysed and sonicated in lysis buffer (1× PBS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme), recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose 4 beads (Peptron, Daejeon, Korea). Purified proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to quantitate and assess purity. The same volume of protein-agarose bead complex was used for all GST fusion protein pulldown assays. The four full-length and truncated [35S]methionine-labeled FBI-1 polypeptides were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation by incubating 1 μg of the pcDNA3.0 FBI-1 or its deletion mutants [pcDNA3.0 POZ FBI-1 (aa 1-131), pcDNA3.0 FBI-1ΔPOZ (aa 132-584), pcDNA3.0 FBI-1 C-term (aa 376-584)] expression vectors, 2 μl of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix (Promega, WI) at 30 °C for 90 min. Purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with GSH-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h in HEMG buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml)). After agarose-GST protein complexes were washed, 10 μl of in vitro translated FBI-1 proteins were added and incubated in HEMG buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. The reactions mixtures were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed, denatured, and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were exposed to x-ray film using an image-intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co.). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293A cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml)). Lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. 500 μg of the lysates were incubated with anti-FBI-1 (or anti-SREBP-1) antibody (2 μg) and subsequently with protein A-agarose (20 μl) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The immunoprecipitates were washed, denatured, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blotted membranes were incubated with following antibodies, Ab-SREBP-1 (or Ab-FBI-1) and Ab-GAPDH. Membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) and developed with the ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunostaining and Cellular Localization of FBI-1 and SREBP-1—Human liver Alexander cells were grown on the coverslips placed in a 6-well culture dish (Sunshine Works, Seoul, Korea), and the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.0-FLAG-FBI-1 expression plasmid (0.6 μg) and pcDNA3.1-SREBP-1a-Myc. After 24 h, the cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in 97:3 cold methanol/formaldehyde for 20 min at -20 °C. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS. Next, cells were incubated in 5% normal horse serum to block nonspecific binding and further incubated with mouse anti-FLAG primary antibody (0.5 μg/100 μl) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (0.5 μg/100 μl) (Jackson Laboratories). For double staining, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and blocked with 5% normal horse serum. Washed cells were incubated with rabbit anti-SREBP-1a antibody and subsequently with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (0.5 μg/100 μl). After washing and mounting, immunostained cells were examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Transcriptional Analysis of FASN WT or Mt Gene Promoter—Because FBI-1 activated the transcription of the SREBP-responsive pGL2-6x(SRE)-tk∗-Luc, we investigated whether FBI-1 can also activate the transcription of the SREBP-1-responsive FASN gene promoter. Three different FASN gene promoters, which have short proximal promoter sequences and are differing only in the context of key proximal regulatory elements (pGL2-FASN1-Luc, pGL2-F"
https://openalex.org/W2083735024,"Background Trials in Africa indicate that medical adult male circumcision (MAMC) reduces the risk of HIV by 60%. MAMC may avert 2 to 8 million HIV infections over 20 years in sub-Saharan Africa and cost less than treating those who would have been infected. This paper estimates the financial and human resources required to roll out MAMC and the net savings due to reduced infections. Methods We developed a model which included costing, demography and HIV epidemiology. We used it to investigate 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence of male circumcision was lower than 80% and HIV prevalence among adults was higher than 5%, in addition to Uganda and the Nyanza province in Kenya. We assumed that the roll-out would take 5 years and lead to an MC prevalence among adult males of 85%. We also assumed that surgery would be done as it was in the trials. We calculated public program cost, number of full-time circumcisers and net costs or savings when adjusting for averted HIV treatments. Costs were in USD, discounted to 2007. 95% percentile intervals (95% PI) were estimated by Monte Carlo simulations. Results In the first 5 years the number of circumcisers needed was 2 282 (95% PI: 2 018 to 2 959), or 0.24 (95% PI: 0.21 to 0.31) per 10 000 adults. In years 6–10, the number of circumcisers needed fell to 513 (95% PI: 452 to 664). The estimated 5-year cost of rolling out MAMC in the public sector was $919 million (95% PI: 726 to 1 245). The cumulative net cost over the first 10 years was $672 million (95% PI: 437 to 1 021) and over 20 years there were net savings of $2.3 billion (95% PI: 1.4 to 3.4). Conclusion A rapid roll-out of MAMC in sub-Saharan Africa requires substantial funding and a high number of circumcisers for the first five years. These investments are justified by MAMC's substantial health benefits and the savings accrued by averting future HIV infections. Lower ongoing costs and continued care savings suggest long-term sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W2090818200,"Increased O(2)* and NO production is a key mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. A crucial segment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is succinate ubiquinone reductase (SQR or Complex II). In SQR, oxidative impairment and deglutathionylation of the 70-kDa flavin protein occurs in the post-ischemic heart ( Chen, Y. R., Chen, C. L., Pfeiffer, D. R., and Zweier, J. L. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 32640-32654 ). To gain insights into the oxidative modification of the 70-kDa protein in the post-ischemic myocardium, we used the identified S-glutathionylated peptide ((77)AAFGLSEAGFNTACVTK(93)) of the 70-kDa protein as a chimeric epitope incorporating a ""promiscuous"" T cell epitope to generate a high titer polyclonal antibody, AbGSC90. Purified AbGSC90 showed a high binding affinity to isolated SQR. Antibodies of AbGSC90 moderately inhibited the electron transfer and superoxide generation activities of SQR. To test for protein nitration, rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary ligation followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Tissue homogenates were immunoprecipitated with AbGSC90 and probed with antibodies against 3-nitrotyrosine. Enhancement of protein tyrosine nitration was detected in the post-ischemic myocardium. Isolated SQR was subjected to in vitro protein nitration with peroxynitrite, leading to site-specific nitration at the 70-kDa polypeptide and impairment of SQR electron transfer activity. Protein nitration of SQR further impaired its protein-protein interaction with Complex III. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis indicated that Tyr-56 and Tyr-142 were involved in protein tyrosine nitration. When the isolated SQR was subjected to in vitro S-glutathionylation, oxidative modification and impairment mediated by peroxynitrite were significantly decreased, thus confirming the protective effect of S-glutathionylation from the oxidative damage of nitration."
https://openalex.org/W2019938015,"Background The urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and contraceptive agents in recent years. In the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. Methodology/Principal Findings Toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (MDCK) cells, human sperm cells, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of MDCK cells was also tested. A homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromides (CnTAB), with varying alkyl chains were shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (CMC), all of them at concentrations significantly below the CMC. In general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than C. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than MDCK cells. This suggests that the CnTAB may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. None of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection of MDCK cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to MDCK cells. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies."
https://openalex.org/W2007059717,"The RAS small GTPases orchestrate multiple cellular processes. Studies on knock-out mice showed the essential and sufficient role of K-RAS, but not N-RAS and H-RAS in embryonic development. However, many physiological functions of K-RAS in vivo remain unclear. Using wild-type and fli1:GFP transgenic zebrafish, we showed that K-ras-knockdown resulted in specific hematopoietic and angiogenic defects, including the impaired expression of erythroid-specific gene gata1 and sse3-hemoglobin, reduced blood circulation and disorganized blood vessels. Expression of either K-rasC40 that links to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, or Akt2 that acts downstream of PI3K, could rescue both hematopoietic and angiogenic defects in the K-ras knockdown. Consistently, the functional rescue by k-ras mRNA was significantly suppressed by wortmannin, a PI3K-specific inhibitor. Our results provide direct evidence that PI3K-Akt plays a crucial role in mediating K-ras signaling during hematopoiesis and angiogenesis in vivo, thus offering new targets and alternative vertebrate model for studying these processes and their related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2117079151,"Background It is known that primary sequences of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis are well conserved in organisms that produce sterols de novo. However, we provide evidence for a preservation of the corresponding genes in two animals unable to synthesize cholesterol (auxotrophs): Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Principal Findings We have been able to detect bona fide orthologs of several ERG genes in both organisms using a series of complementary approaches. We have detected strong sequence divergence between the orthologs of the nematode and of the fruitfly; they are also very divergent with respect to the orthologs in organisms able to synthesize sterols de novo (prototrophs). Interestingly, the orthologs in both the nematode and the fruitfly are still under selective pressure. It is possible that these genes, which are not involved in cholesterol synthesis anymore, have been recruited to perform different new functions. We propose a more parsimonious way to explain their accelerated evolution and subsequent stabilization. The products of ERG genes in prototrophs might be involved in several biological roles, in addition to sterol synthesis. In the case of the nematode and the fruitfly, the relevant genes would have lost their ancestral function in cholesterogenesis but would have retained the other function(s), which keep them under pressure. Conclusions By exploiting microarray data we have noticed a strong expressional correlation between the orthologs of ERG24 and ERG25 in D. melanogaster and genes encoding factors involved in intracellular protein trafficking and folding and with Start1 involved in ecdysteroid synthesis. These potential functional connections are worth being explored not only in Drosophila, but also in Caenorhabditis as well as in sterol prototrophs."
https://openalex.org/W2144995506,"Background Induction of the heat shock response (HSR) and increased expression of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) provide mechanisms to ensure proper protein folding, trafficking, and disposition. The importance of HSPs is underscored by the understanding that protein mis-folding and aggregation contribute centrally to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a cell-based hsp70-luciferease reporter gene assay system to identify agents that modulate the HSR and show here that clinically relevant concentrations of the FDA-approved ALS drug riluzole significantly increased the heat shock induction of hsp70-luciferse reporter gene. Immuno-Western and -cytochemical analysis of HSF1 show that riluzole increased the amount of cytosolic HSF1 to afford a greater activation of HSF1 upon heat shock. The increased HSF1 contributed centrally to the cytoprotective activity of riluzole as hsf1 gene knockout negated the synergistic activity of riluzole and conditioning heat shock to confer cell survival under oxidative stress. Evidence of a post-transcriptional mechanism for the increase in HSF1 include: quantitation of mRNAhsf1 by RT-PCR showed no effect of either heat shock or riluzole treatment; riluzole also increased the expression of HSF1 from a CMV-promoter; analysis of the turnover of HSF1 by pulse chase and immunoprecipitation show that riluzole slowed the decay of [35S]labeled-HSF1. The effect of riluzole on HSF1 was qualitatively different from that of MG132 and chloroquine, inhibitors of the proteasome and lysosome, respectively, and appeared to involve the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway as RNAi-mediated knockdown of CMA negated its effect. Conclusion/Significance We show that riluzole increased the amount of HSF1 to amplify the HSR for cytoprotection. Our study provides novel insight into the mechanism that regulates HSF1 turnover, and identifies the degradation of HSF1 as a target for therapeutics intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2031452771,"While genome-wide gene expression data are generated at an increasing rate, the repertoire of approaches for pattern discovery in these data is still limited. Identifying subtle patterns of interest in large amounts of data (tens of thousands of profiles) associated with a certain level of noise remains a challenge. A microarray time series was recently generated to study the transcriptional program of the mouse segmentation clock, a biological oscillator associated with the periodic formation of the segments of the body axis. A method related to Fourier analysis, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, was used to detect periodic profiles in the dataset, leading to the identification of a novel set of cyclic genes associated with the segmentation clock. Here, we applied to the same microarray time series dataset four distinct mathematical methods to identify significant patterns in gene expression profiles. These methods are called: Phase consistency, Address reduction, Cyclohedron test and Stable persistence, and are based on different conceptual frameworks that are either hypothesis- or data-driven. Some of the methods, unlike Fourier transforms, are not dependent on the assumption of periodicity of the pattern of interest. Remarkably, these methods identified blindly the expression profiles of known cyclic genes as the most significant patterns in the dataset. Many candidate genes predicted by more than one approach appeared to be true positive cyclic genes and will be of particular interest for future research. In addition, these methods predicted novel candidate cyclic genes that were consistent with previous biological knowledge and experimental validation in mouse embryos. Our results demonstrate the utility of these novel pattern detection strategies, notably for detection of periodic profiles, and suggest that combining several distinct mathematical approaches to analyze microarray datasets is a valuable strategy for identifying genes that exhibit novel, interesting transcriptional patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2026737235,"Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial genetic factors may influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. To explore this hypothesis further, we re-sequenced the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) from 159 patients with multiple sclerosis and completed a haplogroup analysis including a further 835 patients and 1,506 controls. A trend towards over-representation of super-haplogroup U was the only evidence for association with mtDNA that we identified in these samples. In a parallel analysis of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, we also found a trend towards association with the complex I gene, NDUFS2. These results add to the evidence suggesting that variation in mtDNA and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes may contribute to disease susceptibility in multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1965038092,"Although several reports have indicated that eNOS is a highly sensitive calpain substrate, the occurrence of a concomitant Ca2+-dependent activation of the synthase and of the protease has never been analyzed in specific direct experiments. In this study, we have explored in vivo how eNOS can undergo Ca2+-dependent translocation and activation, protected against degradation by activated calpain. Here we demonstrate that following a brief exposure to Ca2+-loading, the cytosolic eNOS-HSP90 complex recruits calpain in a form in which the chaperone and the synthase are almost completely resistant to digestion by the protease. Furthermore, in the presence of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, a significant decrease in NO production and an extensive degradation of eNOS protein occurs, indicating that dissociation from membranes and association with the chaperone is correlated to the protection of the synthase. Experiments with isolated membrane preparations confirm the primary role of HSP90 in dissociation of eNOS from caveolae. Prolonged exposure of cells to Ca2+-loading resulted in an extensive degradation of both eNOS and HSP90, accompanied by a large suppression of NO production.

It must be emphasized that several reports have described the proteolytic degradation of NO synthases, but its occurrence has been related to an intense intracellular Ca2+ overload induced by exocytotic conditions or the removal of incorrectly folded NO synthase molecules. In this respect, it has been reported that HSP90 can affect the proteolysis of eNOS by regulating heme insertion and formation of the active dimeric enzyme form. At present, very little is known about the regulation of eNOS trafficking between different subcellular compartments. However, on the basis of the above considerations, it can be assumed that an efficient in vivo mechanism must be operating to protect the synthase in its native active state from uncontrolled calpain-mediated proteolysis, which could markedly reduce eNOS activity. In previous studies (16Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Bertuccio M. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS J. 2008; 274: 6116-6127Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+, calpain can be recruited in a ternary complex containing eNOS, HSP90, and the protease. In this associated form, HSP90 and NOS become resistant to calpain digestion. We have also shown that in intact cells and in rat tissues, the level of HSP90 expression is directly correlated with the extent of NOS degradation. Accordingly, in rat aorta, under conditions of calpain activation, endothelial NOS is much more vulnerable to proteolytic degradation than neuronal NOS (17Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Bertuccio M. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS J. 2008; 274: 6116-6127Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), since HSP90 is more abundant in brain. In the present study, we have further explored in Ca2+-loaded endothelial cells the role of HSP90 in: (i) the protection of eNOS from calpain digestion, (ii) the intracellular redistribution of the synthase, and (iii) the control of NO production. We are now reporting that following an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by Ca2+-ionophore or acetylcholine treatment, eNOS dissociates from caveolin-1 and translocates to the cytosol. Under these conditions, no changes in the intracellular distribution of HSP90 occurred because the bulk of the chaperone remained largely diffused in the cytosol. Disruption of the eNOS-caveolin-1 interaction was accompanied by its activation and by NO production. In isolated membrane preparations, the release of eNOS required the presence of HSP90; Ca2+-CAM alone is significantly less efficient. In the presence of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, NO production was largely decreased, and the synthase was extensively degraded. Immunoprecipitation of HSP90 from cell lysates revealed that only in Ca2+-loaded cells, cytosolic diffusion of eNOS was accompanied by the formation of an eNOS-HSP90-calpain heterotrimeric complex. Taken together, these results indicate a novel role of HSP90 that operates in vivo in protecting eNOS from calpain-mediated degradation in the course of the intracellular dynamic redistribution that accompanies the enzyme activation and NO production. We are herewith proposing that HSP90 participates in the eNOS activation cycle, not only through its role in dissociation and stabilization of the active synthase form, but also for its crucial effect in preserving the enzyme from proteolytic degradation by calpain.

Subcellular Translocation of eNOS in Ca2+-loaded Cells—Previous reports (14Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol.

To better define the biochemical relevance of this process, we have analyzed by confocal microscopy the changes in eNOS localization under conditions of an increased [Ca2+]i, also promoting activation of the enzyme. In resting cells, co-immunolocalization experiments revealed that eNOS is mostly associated with caveolin-1 protein, present in both plasma membranes and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1A). Following an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by cell treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore, eNOS dissociates from membranes and becomes detectable as a diffused cytosolic enzyme, no longer co-localized with caveolin-1 (Fig. 1B). Identical results were also obtained by stimulation with the natural agonist acetylcholine, which promotes an increase in free [Ca2+]i through its mobilization from intracellular stores (Fig. 1C). In both resting and Ca2+-stimulated cells, the bulk of HSP90 remains preferentially distributed in the soluble cytosolic fraction without changes in its protein level (Fig. 1, D and E). Dissociation from the membranes and diffusion of eNOS into the cytosol is not accompanied by changes in the total level of eNOS protein (Fig. 1E) and therefore the large increase in the fluorescence can be attributed to the large fraction of eNOS molecules translocated from caveolae to cytosol. During a brief period of Ca2+-loading, eNOS activity becomes detectable, confirming that the enzyme redistribution is part of its activation mechanism (Fig. 1F). Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of a cell-permeable calpain substrate (Fig. 1G) also occurred, indicating that the protease has undergone activation. However, it is interesting to note that, under these conditions, no degradation of eNOS and HSP90 could be detected, indicating that both proteins were protected from Ca2+-dependent proteolysis. eNOS Protection in Ca2+-loaded Cells—To correlate the changes in intracellular eNOS localization with its activation and protection from calpain digestion, the steps of the eNOS activation mechanism involved in such a protective process were investigated.

Immunoblotting analysis revealed that more than 60–70% of the total amount of eNOS protein had been degraded (Fig. 2C). Under these conditions, HSP90 was only 10–15% digested with respect to the initial amount (Fig. 2C). These degradation processes occurring in Ca2+-loaded cells in the presence of geldanamycin were mediated by active calpain, as indicated by the recovery of both eNOS and HSP90 proteins in cells treated with the synthetic calpain inhibitor CI-1 (Fig. 2). Thus, following inhibition of HSP90, both diffusion into the cytosol and protection of eNOS from calpain degradation are prevented. To better characterize the role of HSP90 in these processes, we have evaluated the role of the chaperone protein in dissociation of eNOS from isolated membranes as well as in the formation of soluble protein complexes. As shown in Fig. 3, a very low amount of eNOS was displaced from membranes following the addition of Ca2+-CAM, whereas in the concomitant presence of isolated HSP90, a large release of eNOS was observed. The presence of ATP did not modify the extent of release, but that of geldanamycin reduced almost completely the release of eNOS from membranes, suggesting that the ATPase activity of HSP90 (42Peng X.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1511-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have previously observed that in the presence of Ca2+, the eNOS-HSP90 complex can recruit calpain generating a ternary complex in which both eNOS and HSP90 were resistant to degradation by the endogenous calpain (17Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Bertuccio M. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS J. 2008; 274: 6116-6127Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of such a ternary complex was analyzed by means of the immunoprecipitation of cytosolic HSP90. As shown in Fig. 4, in the soluble fraction of resting cells, despite the high availability of HSP90, no co-immunoprecipitation of eNOS was detected, in accordance with the observations shown in Fig. 1, indicating that almost all eNOS is present in a particulate form. Following cell-loading with Ca2+, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the presence in the soluble fraction of complexes containing in addition to HSP90, eNOS and calpain. The formation of these complexes was not affected by the presence of ATP. Thus, HSP90 plays a dual role: (i) promoting the release of the Ca2+-CAM-eNOS complex from caveolin-1, a step liberating the synthase from its natural inhibitor, and (ii) protecting eNOS from calpain digestion in the cytosol. The removal of eNOS from membranes and the recruitment of calpain into the eNOS-HSP90 complexes are both involved in the maintenance of an active synthase form. This is supported by the results shown in Fig. 5 indicating that in the absence of geldanamycin, intracellular NO production is not modified by the presence of calpain inhibitor-1 (CI-1). However, in the presence of geldanamycin, eNOS activity is also not detectable in the presence of CI-1. These results are in agreement with those shown in Fig. 2 indicating that in cells treated with geldanamycin and CI-1, eNOS was protected from degradation and was almost completely confined onto the membranes in association with caveolin-1. Effect of Ca2+-loading for a Prolonged Period of Time on the Level of eNOS and HSP90—We have previously observed that a prolonged intracellular elevation of [Ca2+] induced a calpain-mediated extensive degradation of eNOS (17Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Bertuccio M. Pontremoli S. Melloni E. FEBS J. 2008; 274: 6116-6127Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To verify in the present experimental model if the protective effect of HSP90 could be overcome by prolonged calpain activation, we have exposed endothelial cells to Ca2+-loading for 30 min. Under these conditions (Fig. 6, A and B), eNOS fluorescence as well as eNOS total protein levels were largely reduced both in the membrane and in the cytosolic compartment, and following the addition of geldanamycin, these digestive processes were further enhanced. As expected, after 30 min of Ca2+-loading, NO synthase activity was also largely decreased (Fig. 6C). As expected, a higher intracellular calpain activity was detectable (for comparison see Fig. 1E), further indicating the involvement of the protease in the digestion of eNOS and HSP90 proteins. These data could explain the observations indicating the loss of NOS activity in dystrophic muscles (48Chaubourt E. Voisin V. Fossier P. Baux G. Israel M. De La Porte S. J. Physiol.

Recent experimental evidence has provided new information on this reversible caveolin-eNOS interaction, confirming that eNOS activation occurs in response to an increase in [Ca2+]i and that CAM and HSP90 are required for eNOS dissociation from the membranes and for activation of the enzyme. Moreover in reconstructed systems, it has been demonstrated that HSP90 is more efficient than CAM in displacing eNOS from caveolae (9Jiang J. Cyr D. Babbit R.W. Sessa W.C. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49332-49341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Gratton J. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa C. J. Biol.

We are presenting observations obtained by confocal microscopy and using isolated membranes confirming that translocation of eNOS from its particulate localization in the cytosol is accompanied by activation of the synthase without consumption of the enzyme. In fact, it has never been considered that even transient changes in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, besides eNOS activation, also produce translocation of active calpain at the membrane level and that native eNOS is highly sensitive to calpain digestion, which inactivates the synthase by cleaving a peptide bond close to the CAM binding site (4Kone B.C. Kuncewicz T. Zhang W. Yu Z. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F178-F190Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Averna M. Stifanese R. DeTullio R. Salamino F. Bertuccio M. Pontremoli S.

Thus, to protect eNOS from calpain digestion, it is reasonable to assume that under conditions of intracellular elevation of Ca2+, the presence of a protective mechanism is required. The digestion by calpain might be functionally relevant, because the protease degrades, in contrast to the proteasome pathway, native enzyme forms, including active eNOS. Although digestion of NOS has been proposed as a mechanism for regulating NO production, an extensive loss of the synthase should be related to the onset of pathological states, characterized by alteration in tissue Ca2+ homeostasis, such as hypertension (54Mitchell B.M.

In the present report, we are showing that in Ca2+-loaded cells, this protective mechanism involves eNOS translocation to cytosol mediated not only by Ca2+-CAM but especially by functionally active HSP90. This subcellular redistribution of eNOS parallels the onset of NO production, indicating that the sequential events leading to cytosolic diffusion and subsequent activation of eNOS are dependent on its binding to HSP90. We have also demonstrated that the formation of complexes with HSP90 protects eNOS from calpain digestion; an effect promoted by the recruitment of the protease molecules in the soluble HSP90-eNOS complexes also causing the separation of these proteins from the active membrane-bound calpain. This conclusion is supported by the effect of geldanamycin, which by inhibiting HSP90 prevents the formation of the heterocomplexes, and thus calpain-mediated proteolysis of eNOS freely occurs. The protection of eNOS can be attributed to two distinct effects. The first one can be ascribed to the dissociation from the membranes that translocates the synthase away from the active protease molecules and the second to steric constraints of calpain, resulting from its binding to HSP90, which prevents degradation of both eNOS and of the chaperone protein present in the heterocomplex. All these findings are summarized in the model shown in Fig. 7, which includes the novel HSP90-based mechanism operating in the eNOS activation cycle. Finally, our observations indicate that the function of HSP90 cannot only be related to the recovery of misfolded proteins, but also to the preservation of the native structures, increasing their resistance to proteolysis. This conclusion is supported by recent reports indicating that low molecular mass heat shock proteins exert a protective role on calpain digestion (60Lu X.Y. Chen L. Cai X.L. Yang H.T. Cardiovasc.

https://openalex.org/W2167398623,"The caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) is a telencephalic auditory area that is selectively activated by conspecific vocalizations in zebra finches and canaries. We recently demonstrated that temporal and spectral dynamics of auditory tuning in NCM differ between these species [1]. In order to determine whether these differences reflect recent experience, we exposed separate groups of each species and sex to different housing conditions. Adult birds were housed either in an aviary with conspecifics (NORM), with heterospecifics (canary subjects in a zebra finch aviary, and vice versa: (CROSS)), or in isolation (ISO) for 9 days prior to testing. We then recorded extracellular multi-unit electrophysiological responses to simple pure tone stimuli (250–5000 Hz) in awake birds from each group and analyzed auditory tuning width using methods from our earlier studies. Relative to NORM birds, tuning was narrower in CROSS birds, and wider in ISO birds. The trend was greater in canaries, especially females. The date of recording was also included as a covariate in ANCOVAs that analyzed a larger set of the canary data, including data from birds tested outside of the breeding season, and treated housing condition and sex as independent variables. These tests show that tuning width was narrower early in the year and broader later. This effect was most pronounced in CROSS males. The degree of the short-term neural plasticity described here differs across sexes and species, and may reflect differences in NCM's anatomical and functional organization related to species differences in song characteristics, adult plasticity and/or social factors. More generally, NCM tuning is labile and may be modulated by recent experience to reflect the auditory processing required for behavioral adaptation to the current acoustic, social or seasonal context."
https://openalex.org/W2120756317,"Integrins govern cellular adhesion and transmit signals leading to activation of intracellular signaling pathways aimed to prevent apoptosis. Herein we report that attachment of oligodendrocytes (OLs) to fibronectin via alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptors rendered the cells more resistant to apoptosis than the cells attached to laminin via alpha(6)beta(1) integrins. Investigation of molecular mechanisms involved in alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-mediated cell survival revealed that ligation of the integrin with fibronectin results in higher expression of activated Lyn kinase. Both in OLs and in the mouse brain, Lyn selectively associates with alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, not with alpha(v)beta(5) integrin, leading to suppression of acid sphingomyelinase activity and preventing ceramide-mediated apoptosis. In OLs, knockdown of Lyn with small interfering RNA resulted in OL apoptosis with concomitant accumulation of C(16)-ceramide due to activation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Knocking down ASMase partially protected OLs from apoptosis. In the brain, ischemia/reperfusion (IR) triggered rearrangements in the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-Lyn kinase complex leading to disruption of Lyn kinase-mediated suppression of ASMase activity. Thus, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed an increased association of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-Lyn kinase complex with ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, GluR2 and GluR4, after cerebral IR. Sphingolipid analysis of the brain demonstrated significant accumulation of ceramide and sphingomyelin hydrolysis. The data suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of ASMase activity during cell adhesion in which Lyn acts as a key upstream kinase that may play a critical role in cerebral IR injury."
https://openalex.org/W2042836716,"Histamine, a potent inflammatory mediator, has multiple effects on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This study investigates the effect of histamine on the expression of early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1), a master transcription factor that regulates the expression of an array of atherogenic genes in atherosclerotic lesions. Histamine markedly and rapidly induces Egr-1 mRNA and protein expression in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Histamine-induced Egr-1 expression is dependent on the activation of the H1 receptor. Histamine also rapidly and transiently activates protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) prior to Egr-1 induction. Using specific pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA technology, we determined that PKCδ and ERK, but not p38 and JNK, mediate histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Our data provide the first evidence that histamine regulates expression of Egr-1 in mammalian cells and demonstrate a novel role of PKCδ in up-regulation of Egr-1 expression. The present study reveals the following regulatory mechanism: histamine up-regulates Egr-1 expression in primary HAECs via the H1 receptor and the PKCδ-dependent ERK activation pathway.

All of this accumulating evidence supports the notion that histamine promotes the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Early growth response factor 1 (Egr-1) has emerged as a key regulator in the development of atherosclerosis. A zinc finger nuclear protein, Egr-1 regulates a set of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, with subsequent thrombosis and restenosis, by acting as a master transcription factor (15.Khachigian L.M. Circulation Res. 2006; 98: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16.Blaschke F. Bruemmer D. Law R.E. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The products of this set of genes include pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, coagulation factors, and matricellular modulators. To the best of our knowledge, whether histamine has an influence on Egr-1 expression in any mammalian cell type is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between histamine and the key transcription factor Egr-1 in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), one type of vascular wall cells involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Our data reveal a novel effect of histamine on Egr-1 expression. Furthermore, the results from this study determined for the first time the molecular mechanism by which histamine regulates Egr-1 expression, as well as reveal a novel function of protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) in up-regulation of Egr-1 expression. Most significantly, our data point to a central role of Egr-1 in histamine-triggered inflammation and atherosclerosis.

Cell Culture—HAECs supplied by Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) were cultured in Medium 200 with special LSGS supplements (Cascade Biologics). Cells were starved for 16 h before stimulation with histamine. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Non-silencing siRNA (20 nm), PKCδ siRNA (20 nm), and PKCα siRNA (20 nm) were transfected into HAECs using the RNAi MAX transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The non-silencing siRNA was used as a negative control. 48 h after transfection, the cells were starved for 16 h followed by treatment either with or without histamine. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA of the cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to electrophoresis in formaldehyde/agarose gels. RNA was transferred onto Nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes as described previously (17.Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 752-bp fragment of human Egr-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and used as a probe to detect human Egr-1 mRNA. The primers used were: forward, 5′-CTA CGA GCA CCT GAC CGC AG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAT CAC AGG ACT CCA CTG GGC-3′. Western Blot Analysis—HAECs were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Western blot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5%-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors) with sonication for 20 s on ice. Cellular proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were then probed with the specific antibodies, and the specific protein bands were visualized by ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as described previously (18.Cui M.Z. Zhao G. Winokur A.L. Laag E. Bydash J.R. Penn M.S. Chisolm G.M. Xu X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All data are representative of a minimum of three experiments. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between multiple groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc t tests. A single comparison analysis was made using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t tests. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Histamine Markedly Induces Egr-1 mRNA Expression in HAECs—To determine whether histamine has any effect on Egr-1 expression, cultured HAECs were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated with various concentrations of histamine (0.1–100 μm) for 30 min. Total RNA was extracted from cells, and Egr-1 mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, histamine markedly induced Egr-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum increase in the level of Egr-1 mRNA was produced by a histamine concentration of 10 μm, a concentration that falls in the range detected in human atherosclerotic lesions (4.Tanimoto A. Wang K.Y. Murata Y. Kimura S. Nomaguchi M. Nakata S. Tsutsui M. Sasaguri Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also noticed that histamine rapidly and transiently induced Egr-1 mRNA accumulation, which peaked at 30 min and declined to the basal level 2 h after commencing stimulation (Fig. 1, C and D). Histamine Increases Egr-1 Protein Expression in HAECs and Other Mammalian Cell Types—To determine whether histamine-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression is associated with increased levels of Egr-1 protein, we evaluated the effect of histamine on Egr-1 protein expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, histamine dose-dependently induced Egr-1 protein expression and reached its maximal induction level at 10 μm. Histamine rapidly and transiently increased the production of Egr-1 protein (Fig. 2, C and D); maximal expression was reached at ∼1 h and declined to basal levels by 3 h. These data indicate that histamine-induced levels of Egr-1 mRNA contributed to the increased levels of Egr-1 protein in HAECs. In testing whether histamine induces Egr-1 expression in mammalian cell types other than HAECs, we found that histamine induces Egr-1 expression in epithelial-like HeLa cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and the prostate adenocarcinoma cells DU145 and LNCaP (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that histamine induces Egr-1 expression in various types of mammalian cells. Histamine Induction of Egr-1 Expression Is Dependent on the H1 Receptor but Not the H2 Receptor—Histamine exerts its function through four types of G-protein-coupled receptors (1.Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Ohtsu H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2006; 16: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An early study indicates that H1 receptor is expressed in human endothelial cells (5.Takagishi T. Sasaguri Y. Nakano R. Arima N. Tanimoto A. Fukui H. Morimatsu M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent report suggests that histamine receptor 2 (H2) is also expressed in human endothelial cells (19.Li H. Burkhardt C. Heinrich U.R. Brausch I. Xia N. Forstermann U. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine which of the receptors indeed mediates histamine-induced Egr-1 expression in HAECs, we pretreated HAECs with one of the H1 receptor-specific antagonists, either mepyramine or chlorpheniramine, or with the H2 receptor-specific antagonist cimetidine for 40 min. The cells were then stimulated with histamine (10 μm) for 1 h, and the expression of Egr-1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. Pretreatment with one of the specific H1 antagonists, either mepyramine (10 μm) or chlorpheniramine (10 μm), completely blocked the histamine-induced expression of Egr-1 protein; however, pretreatment with the H2 receptor-specific antagonist cimetidine (10 μm) had no effect on histamine-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that histamine induction of Egr-1 expression depends on the activation of the H1 receptor, but not the H2 receptor. Histamine Activates PKCδ, and ERK, p38, and JNK MAPKs in HAECs—To investigate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression, we first assessed histamine activation of PKC. PKC consists of three subgroups: conventional PKC (cPKC) (α, β, and γ), novel PKC (nPKC) (ϵ, δ, η, and θ), and atypical PKC (aPKC) (ζ and λ). Although PKCα, β, ϵ, δ, η, θ, and ζ have been reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (20.Krizbai I. Szabo G. Deli M. Maderspach K. Lehel C. Olah Z. Wolff J.R. Joo F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Haller H. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we found that histamine induced phosphorylation of only PKCδ, but not the other sub-types of PKC (Fig. 4, A and B). Histamine induction of PKCδ phosphorylation was detectable after a 45-s stimulation, reaching a peak at 2–15 min and declining to basal level after 60 min (Fig. 4, A and B). We also evaluated the effect of histamine on the activation of MAPK pathways. MAPKs include ERK, p38 and JNK. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, starved HAECs were treated with histamine (10 μm) for various time periods, and we found that histamine activated all three MAPKs in HAECs. The maximum effect occurred around 2–15 min and dropped to basal levels after 30 min of stimulation. These data suggest that the activation of PKCδ and MAPKs may be involved in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. H1 Receptor Mediates the Activation of ERK, p38 and JNK, but Only the Activation of ERK Is Responsible for Histamine-induced Egr-1 Expression—Data presented in Fig. 3 clearly indicated that histamine-induced Egr-1 expression is mediated by the H1 receptor. To determine which histamine receptor is responsible for the histamine-induced phosphorylation of these MAPKs, the antagonists specific for the H1 and H2 receptors were used to treat HAECs for 40 min, prior to 5 min of stimulation with histamine. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the H1 receptor antagonists, either mepyramine (10 μm) or chlorpheniramine (10 μm), completely blocked the phosphorylation of these MAPKs. In contrast, the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine had no effect on phosphorylation of the three MAPKs. These results, in combination with the data presented in Fig. 3, indicate that both histamine-induced Egr-1 expression and MAPK activation are mediated by the H1 receptor, but not the H2 receptor in HAECs. Next, we determined whether and which specific MAPK is functionally involved in histamine induction of Egr-1 expression. Pretreatment of HAECs with either of the ERK kinase inhibitors PD98059 or U0126, but not the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, completely blocked histamine-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 5, C and D). These results indicate that H1 receptor-mediated ERK activation, but not H1 receptor-mediated p38 or JNK activation mediates histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Histamine Activates PKCδ via the H1 Receptor—We next examined which histamine receptor mediates histamine-induced PKCδ activation. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, specific histamine H1 receptor antagonists mepyramine (10 μm) and chlorpheniramine (10 μm) completely blocked histamine-induced phosphorylation of PKCδ. In contrast, the specific H2 inhibitor cimetidine (10 μm) had no effect on histamine activation of PKCδ. These results along with the results shown in Fig. 5, A and B, indicate that histamine activates PKCδ and MAPK pathways via the H1 receptor. Specific PKC Inhibitors GF109203X and Go6983, and PKCδ-selective Inhibitor Rottlerin Inhibit ERK MAPK Activation and Egr-1 Expression—To determine the functional role of histamine-activated PKCδ in Egr-1 expression, we applied several specific inhibitors of PKC isotypes to evaluate their effects on histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, we observed that GF109203X (20 μm), a specific inhibitor of PKCα, β, ϵ, δ, and ζ (22.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V.

Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or Go6983 (10 μm), a specific inhibitor of PKCα, β, γ, δ, and ζ (24.Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), completely blocked both histamine-induced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression. These results suggest that PKC is involved in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Pretreatment of cells with Go6976 (10 μm), a specific PKCα and β inhibitor (23.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on histamine-induced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression, suggesting that PKCα and β are not involved in histamine induction of Egr-1 expression. These results, in combination with the fact that PKCα, β, ϵ, δ, η, θ, and ζ are reportedly expressed in endothelial cells (20.Krizbai I. Szabo G. Deli M. Maderspach K. Lehel C. Olah Z. Wolff J.R. Joo F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Haller H. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggest that PKCϵ, δ, η, θ, and ζ may be involved in the regulation of Egr-1 expression in response to histamine stimulation. However, it is noted that among these PKC isotypes, only PKCδ is rapidly and markedly phosphorylated upon histamine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine the functional role of PKCδ in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression, we examined whether rottlerin, a selective PKCδ inhibitor (25.Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), affected Egr-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, pretreatment of HAECs with rottlerin (10 μm) for 40 min prior to histamine stimulation completely blocked histamine-induced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that PKCδ mediates histamine induction of ERK activation and Egr-1 expression. We also noticed that the general PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Go6983, as well as the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, completely blocked histamine-induced JNK phosphorylation, but did not block p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). These results suggest that PKCδ also mediates activation of JNK, but not of p38, although the histamine-induced activation of JNK and p38 does not contribute to Egr-1 expression (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, we observed that pretreatment with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin, a Gi/o inhibitor, had no effect on histamine-induced ERK phosphorylation and Egr-1 expression, indicating that the G-proteins, which contribute to histamine-induced Egr-1 expression in HAECs, are not Gi/o proteins. Knockdown of PKCδ Expression by Specific PKCδ siRNA Abolished Histamine Induction of Both ERK MAPK Activation and Egr-1 Expression—To confirm our finding that both histamine-induced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression are mediated by PKCδ, we employed the RNA interference approach by using specific siRNA to deplete endogenous PKCδ expression. We examined whether depletion of PKCδ affected histamine-induced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression in HAECs. PKCδ siRNA, non-silencing siRNA (negative control) and PKCα siRNA (relative kinase control) were transfected into HAECs for 48 h, and then the cells were starved for 16 h followed by treatment with 10 μm histamine. As shown in Fig. 8, A and B, we found that PKCδ-specific siRNA, which knocked down endogenous PKCδ expression by nearly 85%, reduced ERK activation and Egr-1 expression by 80 and 86%, respectively. In contrast, a related kinase control, PKCα siRNA, which knocked down PKCα expression by 80%, had no effect on either ERK activation or Egr-1 expression. The non-silencing RNA (the negative control), as expected, also had no effect on ERK activation and Egr-1 expression. Taken together, these data strongly support the conclusion that histamine induces Egr-1 expression via a PKCδ-mediated ERK pathway. cAMP Response Element-binding Protein (CREB), a Nuclear Transcription Factor, Is a Downstream Component of the ERK Pathway and Is Activated by Histamine; CREB Is Implied in the Regulation of Histamine-induced Egr-1 Expression in HAECs—To further understand the molecular mechanism of the regulation of histamine-induced Egr-1 expression downstream from ERK in HAECs, we examined whether histamine activates CREB, which has been shown to mediate Egr-1 expression in various types of cells (17.Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, the results from a series of experiments reveal (1.Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Ohtsu H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2006; 16: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) histamine induces rapid and profound phosphorylation of CREB, which is detectable at 2 min and peaks at 30 min; (2.Higuchi S. Tanimoto A. Arima N. Xu H. Murata Y. Hamada T. Makishima K. Sasaguri Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) specific histamine H1 receptor antagonists mepyramine (10 μm) and chlorpheniramine (10 μm) completely blocked histamine-induced phosphorylation of CREB. In contrast, the specific H2 inhibitor cimetidine (10 μm) had no effect on histamine activation of CREB, indicating that the histamine receptor H1 mediates CREB phosphorylation; (3.Fang Y.I. Namiki H. Tsunoda E. Shioda S. Shibata M. Nakatani M. Katagiri T. Takeyama Y. Ohata H. Honda K. Momose K. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) knockdown of PKCδ expression using siRNA of PKCδ markedly reduces histamine-induced phosphorylation of CREB; and (4.Tanimoto A. Wang K.Y. Murata Y. Kimura S. Nomaguchi M. Nakata S. Tsutsui M. Sasaguri Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) pretreatment with the ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 or U0126 blocks histamine-induced phosphorylation of CREB. Taken together, these results are in line with our findings that histamine induces Egr-1 expression via the histamine receptor H1-mediated PKCδ-regulated ERK pathway. These results reveal that CREB is a downstream component of the histamine-triggered ERK pathway and imply that histamine-activated CREB mediates Egr-1 expression in HAECs. The role of histamine in the development and progression of atherosclerosis has been highlighted by two independent in vivo studies. One of these studies showed that the histamine H1 receptor antagonist reduced intimal hyperplasia (13.Miyazawa N. Watanabe S. Matsuda A. Kondo K. Hashimoto H. Umemura K. Nakashima M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 362: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); the other study reported that histamine synthesis enzyme knock-out mice (HDC–/– mice) showed reduced neointimal thickening and a decreased intima-to-media thickness ratio (14.Sasaguri Y. Wang K.Y. Tanimoto A. Tsutsui M. Ueno H. Murata Y. Kohno Y. Yamada S. Ohtsu H. Circulation Res. 2005; 96: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In regard to how histamine influences inflammation and atherosclerosis in endothelial cells, evidence has shown that histamine induces expression of genes such as p-selectin (9.Asako H. Kurose I. Wolf R. DeFrees S. Zheng Z.L. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Granger D.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), ICAM1, VCAM1 (10.Kimura S. Wang K.Y.

Res. 2001; 61: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cyclooxygenase-2 (27.Tan X. Essengue S. Talreja J. Reese J. Stechschulte D.J. Dileepan K.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7899-7906Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and tissue factor (11.Steffel J. Akhmedov A. Greutert H. Luscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2005; 112: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The products of these genes have been shown to promote inflammation and atherogenesis (28.Packard R.R. Libby P. Clin. Chem. 2008; 54: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 29.Linton M.F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Importantly, Egr-1 functions as a key transcription factor, regulating the expression of these genes (15.Khachigian L.M. Circulation Res. 2006; 98: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30.Sayasith K. Brown K.A. Lussier J.G. Dore M. Sirois J. J. Mol.

Biochem. 2007; 102: 1442-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, there is no information regarding whether and how histamine regulates Egr-1 expression in mammalian cells. To address this question, we set out to determine the effect of histamine on the expression of Egr-1 in primary HAECs. Our results reveal, for the first time, that histamine markedly and rapidly induces transcription factor Egr-1 expression in mammalian cells. Although both the H1 and H2 histamine receptors are reportedly expressed in endothelial cells (5.Takagishi T. Sasaguri Y. Nakano R. Arima N. Tanimoto A. Fukui H. Morimatsu M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Li H. Burkhardt C. Heinrich U.R. Brausch I. Xia N. Forstermann U. Circulation. 2003; 107: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the H1 receptor, but not the H2 receptor, mediates the histamine signal leading to Egr-1 expression. Related to our finding, previous studies have shown that histamine-induced expression of p-selectin (9.Asako H. Kurose I. Wolf R. DeFrees S. Zheng Z.L. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Granger D.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), ICAM1, VCAM1 (10.Kimura S. Wang K.Y. Tanimoto A. Murata Y. Nakashima Y. Sasaguri Y. Pathol. Int. 2004; 54: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), IL6, IL8 (8.Li Y. Chi L. Stechschulte D.J. Dileepan K.N. Microvasc. Res. 2001; 61: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cyclooxygenase-2 (27.Tan X. Essengue S. Talreja J. Reese J. Stechschulte D.J. Dileepan K.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7899-7906Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and tissue factor (11.Steffel J. Akhmedov A. Greutert H. Luscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2005; 112: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is mediated by the H1 receptor in vascular endothelial cells. Taken together, our results and the previous observations support a notion that histamine-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor Egr-1 and its downstream inflammatory genes is selectively mediated by the H1 receptor in endothelial cells. Our data from the experiments investigating the intracellular signaling cascade demonstrate that ERK MAPK mediates histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. The role of MAPK in histamine induction of endothelial gene expression has not been well explored, although a previous report suggested that ERK, p38, and JNK MAPK may all contribute to histamine induction of tissue factor expression (11.Steffel J. Akhmedov A. Greutert H. Luscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2005; 112: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that activation of ERK, but not of JNK or p38, is required for histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. These results not only provide further support for the essential role of MAPK in histamine activation of vascular endothelial cells, but also reveal a specific ERK MAPK pathway leading to histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. We systematically determined which specific PKC isoform was responsible for histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Information available in the literature shows that PKCα, β, ϵ, δ, η, θ, and ζ are expressed in endothelial cells (20.Krizbai I. Szabo G. Deli M. Maderspach K. Lehel C. Olah Z. Wolff J.R. Joo F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Haller H. Ziegler W. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). First, we examined which specific isoform of PKC was activated by histamine. Interestingly, we observed that PKCδ was the only one being rapidly phosphorylated upon histamine stimulation, starting after 45 s and reaching its maximum phosphorylation between 2 and 15 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Second, the fact that the H1 receptor antagonists blocked both histamine-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 3) and histamine-induced PKCδ activation (Fig. 6) suggests the possibility that PKCδ may be involved in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Third, general PKC inhibitors GF109203X and Go6983 completely blocked Egr-1 expression, indicating that PKC is indeed involved in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 7). Fourth, rottlerin, a selective PKCδ inhibitor, dramatically reduced histamine-induced Egr-1 expression, strongly suggesting a functional role of PKCδ in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 7). This speculation is further supported by the fact that Go6976, a specific inhibitor of PKCα and -β, had no effect on histamine-induced Egr-1 expression, ruling out the involvement of PKCα and β in histamine induction of Egr-1 expression (Fig. 7). Fifth, to confirm the functional role of PKCδ in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression, we employed the RNA interference approach, which has recently emerged as a powerful tool to deplete the expression of a protein of interest. We found that depletion of PKCδ, but not PKCα, nearly completely blocked histamine-induced Egr-1 expression and ERK activation (Fig. 8). Thus, our data clearly establish a functional role of PKCδ in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression in HAECs. Our findings provide the first evidence that activated PKCδ mediates up-regulation of the expression of the key transcription factor Egr-1. In a previous study, PKCδ was constitutively activated in senescent fibroblast cells, and overactivation of PKCδ may have accounted for the loss of the ability of these cells to replicate in response to growth factors. As cells become senescent, they become unable to express growth-associated immediate-early genes, including c-fos and Egr-1 (33.Wheaton K. Riabowol K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7298-7311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, PKCδ could have divergent functions in either up-regulating or down-regulating gene expression in proliferating or non-proliferating cells. Indeed, the involvement of PKCδ in both anti-apoptosis and pro-apoptosis has been reported (34.Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Our results also reveal that the histamine-triggered pathway leading to Egr-1 expression is distinct from the hypoxia-induced pathway, in which activation of PKCα or PKCβ leads to Egr-1 expression in endothelial cells and in a monocyte-like cell line (35.Lo L.W. Cheng J.J. Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Liu Y.C. Wang D.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36.Yan S.F. Lu J. Zou Y.S. Soh-Won J. Cohen D.M. Buttrick P.M.

These results indicate that these specific PKC isoforms serve as the central mediators for Egr-1 expression in various cell types and in response to different stimuli. In further pursuit of the molecular mechanism of the regulation of Egr-1 expression downstream from ERK, we identified that CREB, a nuclear transcription factor shown to turn on Egr-1 transcription in several cell types (17.Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26.Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), is a downstream component of the histamine-induced ERK pathway. These results imply a nuclear regulatory role of CREB in histamine-induced Egr-1 expression. Taken together, our results not only provide the first evidence that histamine induces Egr-1 expression in mammalian cells, but also reveal novel insights into the mechanism by which histamine regulates Egr-1 expression. Our data clearly establish a signaling pathway that mediates histamine induction of Egr-1, i.e. the effect of histamine is specifically mediated by the H1 receptor, the activated PKCδ and the ERK cascade. Our data also imply that CREB, a downstream component of the ERK pathway, regulates Egr-1 expression in HAECs. Because it was reported previously that histamine induces the expression of p-selectin (9.Asako H. Kurose I. Wolf R. DeFrees S. Zheng Z.L. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Granger D.N. J. Clin.

Circulation. 2005; 112: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells, and that Egr-1 can serve as a transcription factor for regulating these genes in response to other stimuli (15.Khachigian L.M. Circulation Res. 2006; 98: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 30.Sayasith K. Brown K.A. Lussier J.G. Dore M. Sirois J. J. Mol.

Of particular significance is that our findings imply that histamine-induced Egr-1 transcription activity could serve as a central control regulating transduction of the histamine signal and consequently governing histamine induction of multiple inflammatory genes, which in turn, trigger inflammation and atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2067103740,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common complex disease with a genetic component. While several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be associated with risk of MI, they do not fully explain the observed genetic component of MI. We have been investigating the association between MI and SNPs that are located in genes and have the potential to affect gene function or expression. We have previously published studies that tested about 12,000 SNPs for association with risk of MI, early-onset MI, or coronary stenosis. In the current study we tested 17,576 SNPs that could affect gene function or expression. In order to use genotyping resources efficiently, we staged the testing of these SNPs in three case-control studies of MI. In the first study (762 cases, 857 controls) we tested 17,576 SNPs and found 1,949 SNPs that were associated with MI (P<0.05). We tested these 1,949 SNPs in a second study (579 cases and 1159 controls) and found that 24 SNPs were associated with MI (1-sided P<0.05) and had the same risk alleles in the first and second study. Finally, we tested these 24 SNPs in a third study (475 cases and 619 controls) and found that 5 SNPs in 4 genes (ENO1, FXN (2 SNPs), HLA-DPB2, and LPA) were associated with MI in the third study (1-sided P<0.05), and had the same risk alleles in all three studies. The false discovery rate for this group of 5 SNPs was 0.23. Thus, we have identified 5 SNPs that merit further examination for their potential association with MI. One of these SNPs (in LPA), has been previously shown to be associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2019170713,"Asthma is a complex trait for which different strategies have been used to identify its environmental and genetic predisposing factors. Here, we describe a novel methodological approach to select candidate genes for asthma genetic association studies. In this regard, the Genes to Diseases (G2D) computational tool has been used in combination with a genome-wide scan performed in a sub-sample of the Saguenay−Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ) asthmatic familial collection (n = 609) to identify candidate genes located in two suggestive loci shown to be linked with asthma (6q26) and atopy (10q26.3), and presenting differential parent-of-origin effects. This approach combined gene selection based on the G2D data mining analysis of the bibliographic and protein public databases, or according to the genes already known to be associated with the same or a similar phenotype. Ten genes (LPA, NOX3, SNX9, VIL2, VIP, ADAM8, DOCK1, FANK1, GPR123 and PTPRE) were selected for a subsequent association study performed in a large SLSJ sample (n = 1167) of individuals tested for asthma and atopy related phenotypes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (n = 91) within the candidate genes were genotyped and analysed using a family-based association test. The results suggest a protective association to allergic asthma for PTPRE rs7081735 in the SLSJ sample (p = 0.000463; corrected p = 0.0478). This association has not been replicated in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohort. Sequencing of the regions around rs7081735 revealed additional polymorphisms, but additional genotyping did not yield new associations. These results demonstrate that the G2D tool can be useful in the selection of candidate genes located in chromosomal regions linked to a complex trait."
https://openalex.org/W1975479383,"Pathogenic bacteria experience nitrosative stress from NO generated in the host and from nitrosating species such as S-nitrosoglutathione. The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni responds by activating gene expression from a small regulon under the control of the NO-sensitive regulator, NssR. Here, we describe the full extent of the S-nitrosoglutathione response using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of batch- and chemostat-cultured C. jejuni. In addition to the NssR regulon, which includes two hemoglobins (Cgb and Ctb), we identify more than 90 other up-regulated genes, notably those encoding heat shock proteins and proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance and iron metabolism/transport. Up-regulation of a subset of these genes, including cgb, is also elicited by NO-releasing compounds. Mutation of the iron-responsive regulator Fur results in insensitivity of growth to NO, suggesting that derepression of iron-regulated genes and augmentation of iron acquisition is a physiological response to nitrosative damage. We describe the effect of oxygen availability on nitrosative stress tolerance; cells cultured at higher rates of oxygen diffusion have elevated levels of hemoglobins, are more resistant to inhibition by NO of both growth and respiration, and consume NO more rapidly. The oxygen response is mediated by NssR. Thus, in addition to NO detoxification catalyzed by the hemoglobins Cgb and possibly Ctb, C. jejuni mounts an extensive stress response.

However, the molecular basis by which Msx2 conducts chondrogenesis is currently unclear. In this study, we examined the role of Msx2 in chondrocyte differentiation using mouse primary chondrocytes and embryonic metatarsal explants. Treatment with BMP2 up-regulated the expression of Msx2 mRNA along with chondrocyte differentiation in murine primary chondrocytes. Overexpression of wild-type Msx2 stimulated calcification of primary chondrocytes in the presence of BMP2. We also found that constitutively active Msx2 (caMsx2) enhanced BMP2-dependent calcification more efficiently than wild-type Msx2. Consistently, caMsx2 overexpression up-regulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase and collagen type X induced by BMP2. Furthermore, organ culture experiments using mouse embryonic metatarsals indicated that caMsx2 clearly stimulated the maturation of chondrocytes into the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic stages in the presence of BMP2. In contrast, knockdown of Msx2 inhibited maturation of primary chondrocytes. The stimulatory effect of Msx2 on chondrocyte maturation was enhanced by overexpression of Smad1 and Smad4 but inhibited by Smad6, an inhibitory Smad for BMP2 signaling. These data suggest that Msx2 requires BMP2/Smad signaling for its chondrogenic action. In addition, caMsx2 overexpression induced Ihh (Indian hedgehog) expression in mouse primary chondrocytes. Importantly, treatment with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor for hedgehogs, blocked Msx2-induced chondrogenesis. Collectively, our results indicated that Msx2 promotes the maturation of chondrocytes, at least in part, through up-regulating Ihh expression."

Combination therapy with three antiplatelet agents might maximise the benefit of antiplatelet treatment in the secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke. Methodology/Principal Findings A randomised, parallel group, observer-blinded phase II trial compared the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole with aspirin alone. Adult patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within 5 years were included. The primary outcome was tolerability to treatment assessed as the number of patients completing randomised treatment. Recruitment was halted prematurely after publication of the ESPRIT trial (which confirmed that combined aspirin and dipyridamole is more effective than aspirin alone). 17 patients were enrolled: male 12 (71%), mean age 62 (SD 13) years, lacunar stroke syndrome 12 (71%), median stroke/TIA onset to randomisation 8 months. Treatment was discontinued in 4 of 9 (44%) patients receiving triple therapy vs. none of 8 taking aspirin (p = 0.08). One recurrent stroke occurred in a patient in the triple group who was noncompliant of all antiplatelet medications. The number of patients with adverse events and bleeding complications, and their severity, were significantly greater in the triple therapy group (p<0.01). Conclusions/Significance Long term triple antiplatelet therapy was asociated with a significant increase in adverse events and bleeding rates, and their severity, and a trend to increased discontinuations. However, the patients had a low risk of recurrence and future trials should focus on short term therapy in high risk patients characterised by a very recent event or failure of dual antiplatelet therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2093880953,"Previously encountered stimuli can bring to mind a vivid memory of the episodic context in which the stimulus was first experienced (“remembered” stimuli), or can simply seem familiar (“known” stimuli). Past studies suggest that more attentional resources are required to encode stimuli that are subsequently remembered than known. However, it is unclear if the attentional resources are distributed differently during encoding and recognition of remembered and known stimuli. Here, we record eye movements while participants encode photos, and later while indicating whether the photos are remembered, known or new. Eye fixations were more clustered during both encoding and recognition of remembered photos relative to known photos. Thus, recognition of photos that bring to mind a vivid memory for the episodic context in which they were experienced is associated with less distributed overt attention during encoding and recognition. The results suggest that remembering is related to encoding of a few distinct details of a photo rather than the photo as a whole. In turn, during recognition remembering may be trigged by enhanced memory for the salient details of the photos."
https://openalex.org/W1969142432,"Protein HMGB1, an abundant nuclear non-histone protein that interacts with DNA and has an architectural function in chromatin, was strikingly shown some years ago to also possess an extracellular function as an alarmin and a mediator of inflammation. This extracellular function has since been actively studied, both from a fundamental point of view and in relation to the involvement of HMGB1 in inflammatory diseases. A prerequisite for such studies is the ability to detect HMGB1 in blood or other biological fluids and to accurately measure its concentration.In addition to classical techniques (western blot, ELISA) that make use of specific anti-HMGB1 antibodies, we present here a new, extremely sensitive technique that is based on the fact that hemicatenated DNA loops (hcDNA) bind HMGB1 with extremely high affinity, higher than the affinity of specific antibodies, similar in that respect to DNA aptamers. DNA-protein complexes formed between HMGB1 and radiolabeled hcDNA are analyzed by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels using the band-shift assay method. In addition, using a simple and fast protocol to purify HMGB1 on the basis of its solubility in perchloric acid allowed us to increase the sensitivity by suppressing any nonspecific background. The technique can reliably detect HMGB1 at a concentration of 1 pg per microliter in complex fluids such as serum, and at much lower concentrations in less complex samples. It compares favorably with ELISA in terms of sensitivity and background, and is less prone to interference from masking proteins in serum.The new technique, which illustrates the potential of DNA nanoobjects and aptamers to form high-affinity complexes with selected proteins, should provide a valuable tool to further investigate the extracellular functions of HMGB1 and its involvement in inflammatory pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1970193266,"Background Dendritic cells (DCs) play major roles in mediating immune responses to mycobacteria. A crucial aspect of this is the priming of T cells via chemokines and cytokines. In this study we investigated the roles of chemokines RANTES and IP-10 in regulating protective responses from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) 10 kDa Culture Filtrate Protein-10 (CFP-10) differentiated DCs (CFP10-DCs). Methods and Findings Infection of CFP10-DCs with mycobacteria down-modulated RANTES and IP-10 levels. Pathway specific microarray analyses showed that in addition to RANTES and IP-10, mycobacteria infected CFP10-DCs showed reduced expression of many Th1 promoting chemokines and chemokine receptors. Importantly, T cells co-cultured with RANTES and IP-10 conditioned CFP10-DCs mediated killing of mycobacteria from infected macrophages. Similarly, T cells recruited by RANTES and IP-10 conditioned CFP10-DCs mediated significant killing of mycobacteria from infected macrophages. IFN-gamma treatment of CFP10-DCs restored RANTES and IP-10 levels and T cells activated by these DCs mediated significant killing of virulent M. tb inside macrophages. Adoptive transfer of either RANTES and IP-10 or IL-12 and IFN-gamma conditioned CFP10-DCs cleared an established M. tb infection in mice. The extent of clearance was similar to that obtained with drug treatment. Conclusions These results indicate that chemokine and cytokine secretion by DCs differentiated by M. tb antigens such as CFP-10 play major roles in regulating protective immune responses at sites of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2126471071,"Background The identification of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion has prompted investigation to establish whether there has been any alteration in the vCJD agent following this route of secondary transmission. Any increase in virulence or host adaptation would require a reassessment of the risk analyses relating to the possibility of a significant secondary outbreak of vCJD. Since there are likely to be carriers of the vCJD agent in the general population, there is a potential for further infection by routes such as blood transfusion or contaminated surgical instruments. Methodology We inoculated both wild-type and transgenic mice with material from the first case of transfusion associated vCJD infection. Principal Findings The strain transmission properties of blood transfusion associated vCJD infection show remarkable similarities to the strain of vCJD associated with transmission from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Conclusions Although it has been hypothesized that adaptation of the BSE agent through secondary passage in humans may result in a greater risk of onward transmission due to an increased virulence of the agent for humans, our data presented here in two murine models suggest no significant alterations to transmission efficiency of the agent following human-to-human transmission of vCJD."
https://openalex.org/W2137989519,"The mouse Xin repeat-containing proteins (mXinalpha and mXinbeta) localize to the intercalated disc in the heart. mXinalpha is able to bundle actin filaments and to interact with beta-catenin, suggesting a role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to N-cadherin/beta-catenin adhesion. mXinalpha-null mouse hearts display progressively ultrastructural alterations at the intercalated discs, and develop cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. The up-regulation of mXinbeta in mXinalpha-deficient mice suggests a partial compensation for the loss of mXinalpha. To elucidate the evolutionary relationship between these proteins and to identify the origin of Xin, a phylogenetic analysis was done with 40 vertebrate Xins. Our results show that the ancestral Xin originated prior to the emergence of lamprey and subsequently underwent gene duplication early in the vertebrate lineage. A subsequent teleost-specific genome duplication resulted in most teleosts encoding at least three genes. All Xins contain a highly conserved beta-catenin-binding domain within the Xin repeat region. Similar to mouse Xins, chicken, frog and zebrafish Xins also co-localized with beta-catenin to structures that appear to be the intercalated disc. A putative DNA-binding domain in the N-terminus of all Xins is strongly conserved, whereas the previously characterized Mena/VASP-binding domain is a derived trait found only in Xinalphas from placental mammals. In the C-terminus, Xinalphas and Xinbetas are more divergent relative to each other but each isoform from mammals shows a high degree of within-isoform sequence identity. This suggests different but conserved functions for mammalian Xinalpha and Xinbeta. Interestingly, the origin of Xin ca. 550 million years ago coincides with the genesis of heart chambers with complete endothelial and myocardial layers. We postulate that the emergence of the Xin paralogs and their functional differentiation may have played a key role in the evolutionary development of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2001321614,"We previously demonstrated that human platelets activated with SFLLRN release PAR-1 activation peptide, PAR-1-(1–41), even in the presence of hirudin. This observation suggests that during their activation, platelets generate a protease that activates PAR-1. In this study, PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides were detected 10 s after ≤1.0 nm α-thrombin, 10 μm SFLLRN, or 100 μm AYPGKF were added to platelets. When SFLLRN or AYGPKF were added to platelets, generation of PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides was complete at 10 s. Generation of both PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides in response to 1 nm α-thrombin was significantly inhibited by affinity-purified anti-PAR-1-(35–62) IgY, anti-PAR-4-(34–54) IgY, and by the specific PAR-1 antagonist BMS 200261, but not by the PAR-4 antagonist YD3. Effective inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to 1.0 nm α-thrombin occurred only in the presence of both anti-PAR span antibodies. We conclude that platelet activation initiated with ≤1.0 nm α-thrombin proceeds via simultaneous PAR-1 and -4 activation. Inhibiting the activation of either PAR inhibits activation of the other.

The lowest concentration of PAR-4-(1–47) detected by this ELISA is 5 pm. This ELISA did not detect up to 10 nm synthetic PAR-1-(1–41) (Enzyme Research Laboratories). Similarly, the ELISA measuring PAR-1 activation peptide did not detect up to 10 nm synthetic PAR-4-(1–47). Neither the PAR-1-(1–41) nor the PAR-4-(1–47) ELISA could detect any of the major proteins (i.e. fibrinogen, 70 μg/ml; human serum albumin, 40 μg/ml; von Willebrand factor, 2 units/ml; factor V/Va, 2 μg/ml; platelet factor 4, 5 μg/ml; fibronectin, 2 μg/ml; thrombospondin, 25 μg/ml) known to be released from platelets in response to α-thrombin (21.Longenecker G.L. The Platelets, Physiology and Pharmacology. Academic Press, Cedar Knolls, NJ1985Google Scholar). Measurement of Changes in Intracellular [Ca2+]—For intracellular calcium mobilization studies, 10 μm Fura-PE3 (AM) (TEF Labs, Austin, TX) was added to the platelet-rich plasma, incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by the washing procedure outlined above for isolating washed platelets. Platelets were preincubated with inhibitors as described. Aliquots (190 μl) of washed platelets (5 × 1011/liter) loaded with 10 μm Fura-PE3 (AM) were added in duplicate to black 96-well plates. Using the Fluoroskan Ascent microplate fluorometer (Thermo Labsystems, Thermo Electron Corp., Milford, MA), the Fura-PE3 (AM)-labeled platelets were subjected to excitation wavelength of 340 nm while measuring emission at 510 nm. The extracellular [CaCl2] was 2 mm. The intensity of fluorescence was measured for 120 s after addition of 10 μl of agonist. After each experiment the platelets were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by the addition of 10 mm EGTA to obtain the maximum and minimum fluorescence, respectively. The [Ca2+] mobilized was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+] = Kd (F – Fmin)/(Fmax – F) (22.Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium, A Practical Approach. Oxford Press, New York1991: 33-35Google Scholar) using a dissociation constant for Fura-PE3 (AM) and Ca2+ of 264 nm. After 2 min, the total area under the curve was calculated. Measurement of ATP Release—Washed platelets (5 × 1011/liter) were incubated with PAR-1 and -4 antagonists as previously described. Control and treated washed platelet preparations were stimulated with 0.5 or 1.0 nm α-thrombin, 10 μm SFLLRN, or 100 μm AYGPKF without stirring. After 180 s, 50-μl aliquots were added to 200 μl of a solution containing 1 μm FPR-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), 1 μm d-EGR-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), and 6.25 mm EDTA, and mixed well. The samples were then centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g and the supernatants removed. ATP levels in the supernatants were determined in duplicate using the ATP determination kit (A-22066; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence of the samples was measured using a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The [ATP] in the experimental samples were interpolated from a standard curve. The effect of each PAR antagonist on the concentration of ATP measured in the absence of platelets or platelet supernatants was insignificant (data not shown). Flow Cytometric Quantification of the Density of PAR-1 on Washed Platelets—Washed platelet preparations were incubated in the absence or presence of 1.0 nm α-thrombin, 10 μm SFLLRN, or 100 μm AYPGKF without stirring for 180 s, and 5 mm EDTA and 1 μm hirudin (Berlex, Canada, Inc. Pointe Claire, QB, Canada) were then added. The platelets were divided and incubated for 1 h with: 1) buffer alone; 2) 12.5 μg/ml affinity purified anti-PAR-1 span-IgY, washed, then incubated for 1 h with 0.25 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); or 3) 1 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated WEDE15 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Platelets incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG alone were indistinguishable from unlabeled platelets, as determined by flow cytometry. The expression of PAR-1 on the surfaces of 10,000 platelets was quantified by flow cytometry, as previously described (16.Ofosu F.A. Freedman J. Dewar L. Song Y. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using t tests, paired t tests, and one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Activation of Both PAR-1 and -4 on Human Platelets Occurs Rapidly in Response to Low Concentrations of α-Thrombin—Cleavages of PAR-1 at Arg41–Ser42 and PAR-4 at Arg47–Gly48 in response to α-thrombin were investigated using two sensitive and specific ELISAs to measure release of PAR-1-(1–41) and PAR-4-(1–47), respectively, into supernatants of washed human platelets. Because the first 21 residues of PAR-1 were hypothesized to be cleaved prior to the expression of PAR-1 on platelets (4.Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar), ELISAs that measured the release of 3 potential PAR-1 extracellular domain peptides (i.e. PAR-1-(1–21), PAR-1-(22–41), and PAR-1-(1–41)) were developed (23.Furman M.I. Nurden P. Berndt M.C. Nurden A.T. Benoit S.E. Barnard M.R. Ofosu F.A. Michelson A.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Only PAR-1-(1–41) was detected in the supernatants of platelets activated with α-thrombin when the above 3 equally sensitive ELISAs were employed in that study. Generation of PAR-1-(1–41) only, but not either of the shorter PAR-1 peptides, suggests that most of the first 21 residues of PAR-1 are not removed prior to PAR-1 expression on human platelets. We had also ruled out platelet activation-dependent extrusion of PAR-1 from platelets and microparticle formation as possible mechanisms for PAR-1-(1–41) generation during platelet activation (16.Ofosu F.A. Freedman J. Dewar L. Song Y. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations led us to develop the ELISA for PAR-4-(1–47) to directly quantify PAR-4 activation as release of this activation peptide. In initial experiments, platelets were incubated for up to 10 min with 0.5, 1.0, or 10 nm α-thrombin. At 10 s after α-thrombin addition, both PAR activation peptides were detected in all platelet supernatants indicating that activation of both PAR-1 and -4 begins rapidly even in response to 0.5 nm α-thrombin (supplementary materials). The concentration of PAR peptide released depended on the initial concentration of α-thrombin but only for the first 10 s. Less PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides were generated at 10 min in response to 10 nm α-thrombin, than were generated in response to the two lower thrombin concentrations. The observation that more PAR-1 and -4 were activated over 10 min in response to ≤1.0 nm than 10 nm α-thrombin supports previous reports that a platelet-derived protease, sensitive to inhibition by SBTI and Pefabloc SC, helps to propagate PAR-1 activation (16.Ofosu F.A. Freedman J. Dewar L. Song Y. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that PAR-1-(1–41) can activate platelets (24.Furman M.I. Liu L. Benoit S.E. Becker R.C. Barnard M.R. Michelson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PAR-1 activation peptide generation by this protease is not inhibited by hirudin, FPR-chloromethyl ketone, or tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Platelet aggregation responses to SFLLRN, AYPGKF, or α-thrombin were abrogated by soybean trypsin inhibitor or 4 mm Pefabloc SC. In contrast, platelet aggregation responses to SFLLRN or AYPGKF were unaffected by 1 μm FPR-chloromethyl ketone or 1 μm d-EGR-chloromethyl ketone (data not shown). To better characterize platelet responses to SFLLRN, AYPGKF, or ≤1 nm thrombin, the PAR activation peptides released into the platelet supernatants were measured, as were platelet CD62 expression (α-granule release), CD63 expression (lysosomal granule release), [14C]serotonin and ATP release (dense granules), aggregation, and intracellular calcium mobilization. Both PAR-1-(1–41) (Fig. 1A) and PAR-4-(1–47) (Fig. 1B) were detected in the supernatants of washed human platelets 10 s after the addition of α-thrombin, SFLLRN, or AYPGKF. The release of PAR activation peptides was more rapid in response to the two tethered ligand agonists, than in response to 0.5 or 1.0 nm α-thrombin. The maximum concentrations of PAR-1-(1–41) and PAR-4-(1–47) that were generated in response to either tethered ligand agonist were observed at 10 s. To determine whether other platelet agonists also elicit PAR-1 and -4 activation peptide generation, platelets were incubated with 500 μm arachidonic acid, 2 μg/ml collagen, or 10 μm ADP plus 40 μg/ml fibrinogen. PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides were not released in response to collagen or ADP/fibrinogen. However, PAR-1 and -4 peptides were released in response to arachidonic acid. The profiles describing the concentrations of the two activation peptides generated were similar to those obtained with SFLLRN and AYPGKF (data not shown). The platelets aggregated as expected in response to arachidonic acid, collagen, and ADP/fibrinogen (58 ± 6, 69 ± 4, and 40 ± 10%, respectively; mean ± S.E., for 4 determinations). Therefore, generation of PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides is not a general feature of all agonist-mediated platelet activation. The early differences in PAR-1 and PAR-4 activation peptide release in response to 0.5 or 1.0 nm α-thrombin are reflected in differences in all the platelet responses measured. As summarized in Table 1, platelets incubated with 1 nm α-thrombin aggregated significantly more, released more [14C]serotonin and ATP, and mobilized 2-fold more intracellular calcium, than did platelets stimulated with 0.5 nm α-thrombin. Furthermore, more platelets expressed CD62 and CD63 on their surfaces in response to 1.0 nm than in response to 0.5 nm α-thrombin at all 3 time points, with expression of both markers approaching their maxima at 60 s.TABLE 1Platelets respond more effectively to 1.0 nm than to 0.5 nm α-thrombinPlatelet responseTime0.5 nm α-Thrombin1.0 nm α-Thrombinp values% Aggregation18064 ± 4 (56)79 ± 1 (100)<0.0001% [14C]Serotonin released18033 ± 3 (60)64 ± 2 (104)<0.0001Δ[Ca2+]i(area under curve; nm·s)12016,000 ± 4,000 (4)36,000 ± 8,000 (4)0.0467[ATP] released (nm)180640 ± 230 (7)1100 ± 250 (7)0.0097% Platelets expressing CD621021 ± 2 (107)39 ± 2 (154)<0.00016065 ± 3 (107)82 ± 2 (155)<0.000118070 ± 2 (107)87 ± 1 (154)<0.0001% Platelets expressing CD631026 ± 2 (91)41 ± 2 (132)<0.00016051 ± 2 (92)68 ± 2 (131)<0.000118053 ± 2 (92)72 ± 2 (134)<0.0001 Open table in a new tab To explore possible connections between PAR-1 and PAR-4 activation and the subsequent platelet aggregation, the Spearman correlation coefficients relating percent platelet aggregation after 180 s with the levels of the peptides in platelet supernatants at 10, 60, and 180 s were calculated (Table 2). (The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) quantifies the degree to which the ranks of two variables vary together, with an r = 1 indicating a perfect correlation and r = 0 indicating that the two variables do not vary together.) The percent platelet aggregation achieved with 0.5 or 1.0 nm α-thrombin best correlated with the concentrations of PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides in the platelet supernatants at 10 and 60 s. Thus, in the first 60 s after α-thrombin addition, activation of PAR-1 and -4 partially determines the platelet aggregation response. There was no such correlation between the release of PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides and platelet aggregation in response to either SFLLRN or AYPGKF.TABLE 2Platelet aggregation initiated with 0.5 or 1.0 nm α-thrombin correlates with early PAR-1 and PAR-4 activation0.5 nm α-Thrombin1.0 nm α-Thrombin10 s60 s180 s10 s60 s180 s[PAR-1 peptide]0.645ap < 0.05.0.529ap < 0.05.0.2930.496ap < 0.05.0.396ap < 0.05.0.323ap < 0.05.[PAR-4 peptide]0.429ap < 0.05.0.457ap < 0.05.-0.0370.418ap < 0.05.0.301ap < 0.05.0.097a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Simultaneous Inhibition of PAR-1 and -4 Blocks Platelet Responses to 1.0 nm α-Thrombin—The involvement of both PAR-1 and -4 in propagating the responses of human platelets to α-thrombin was explored using anti-PAR-1 span and anti-PAR-4 span antibodies. Because anti-PAR-1 span IgY eliminated release of PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides and aggregation of most washed platelet preparations in response to 0.5 nm α-thrombin, we used 1 nm α-thrombin for these studies. Anti-PAR-1 span IgY reduced levels of both PAR-1 and -4 activation peptides in platelet supernatants at 10 (Table 3) and 60 s (not shown), demonstrating that inhibition of PAR-1 cleavage also delays and inhibits PAR-4 cleavage. To a lesser degree, anti-PAR-4 span IgY also inhibited both PAR-1 and PAR-4 cleavage at 10 (Table 3) and 60 s (not shown). By 180 s, however, inhibition of PAR activation by either antibody had become less marked (not shown). When both antibodies were added together, PAR-1 cleavage was eliminated and PAR-4 cleavage was greatly reduced. When platelets were stimulated with 1 nm α-thrombin, elimination of PAR-1 activation peptide generation by the combination of anti-PAR-1 span and anti-PAR-4 spa"
https://openalex.org/W2022330010,"The roles of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived pigment pyocyanin (PYO) as an oxidant and activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB were tested in a cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cell line, CF15. 100 microm PYO on its own had no effect or only small effects to activate NF-kappaB (<1.5-fold), but PYO synergized with the TLR5 agonist flagellin. Flagellin activated NF-kappaB 4-20-fold, and PYO increased these activations >2.5-fold. PYO could have synergized with flagellin to activate NF-kappaB by redox cycling with NADPH, generating superoxide (O(2)*), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and hydroxyl radical (HO*). Cytosol-targeted, redox-sensitive roGFP1 and imaging microscopy showed that 1-100 microm PYO oxidized CF15 cytosol redox potential (Psi(cyto)) from -325 mV (control) to -285 mV. O(2)* (derived from KO(2)*. or xanthine + xanthine oxidase) or H(2)O(2) oxidized Psi(cyto) dose-dependently but did not activate NF-kappaB, even in the presence of flagellin, and 400 microm H(2)O(2) inhibited NF-kappaB. Overexpressing intracellular catalase decreased effects of PYO and H(2)O(2) on Psi(cyto) but did not affect flagellin + PYO-activated NF-kappaB. Catalase also reversed the inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2) on NF-kappaB. The HO* scavenger DMSO did not alter the effects of PYO on Psi(cyto) and NF-kappaB. The synergistic NF-kappaB activation was calcium-independent. Thus, in the presence of flagellin, PYO activated NF-kappaB through a redox- and calcium-independent effect."
https://openalex.org/W2080310211,"Familial clustering of colorectal cancer occurs in 15-20% of cases, however recognized cancer syndromes explain only a small fraction of this disease. Thus, the genetic basis for the majority of hereditary colorectal cancer remains unknown. EPHB2 has recently been implicated as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of EPHB2 to hereditary colorectal cancer. We screened for germline EPHB2 sequence variants in 116 population-based familial colorectal cancer cases by DNA sequencing. We then estimated the population frequencies and characterized the biological activities of the EPHB2 variants identified. Three novel nonsynonymous missense alterations were detected. Two of these variants (A438T and G787R) result in significant residue changes, while the third leads to a conservative substitution in the carboxy-terminal SAM domain (V945I). The former two variants were found once in the 116 cases, while the V945I variant was present in 2 cases. Genotyping of additional patients with colorectal cancer and control subjects revealed that A438T and G787R represent rare EPHB2 alleles. In vitro functional studies show that the G787R substitution, located in the kinase domain, causes impaired receptor kinase activity and is therefore pathogenic, whereas the A438T variant retains its receptor function and likely represents a neutral polymorphism. Tumor tissue from the G787R variant case manifested loss of heterozygosity, with loss of the wild-type allele, supporting a tumor suppressor role for EPHB2 in rare colorectal cancer cases. Rare germline EPHB2 variants may contribute to a small fraction of hereditary colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2092923920,"The gene encoding ribonucleotide reductase 3 (RNR3) is strongly induced in response to DNA damage. Its expression is strictly dependent upon the TAFII subunits of TFIID, which are required for the recruitment of SWI/SNF and nucleosome remodeling. However, full activation of RNR3 also requires GCN5, the catalytic subunit of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex. Thus, RNR3 is dependent upon both TFIID and SAGA, two complexes that deliver TATA-binding protein (TBP) to promoters. Furthermore, unlike the majority of TFIID-dominated genes, RNR3 contains a consensus TATA-box, a feature of SAGA-regulated core promoters. Although a large fraction of the genome can be characterized as either TFIID- or SAGA-dominant, it is expected that many genes utilize both. The mechanism of activation and the relative contributions of SAGA and TFIID at genes regulated by both complexes have not been examined. Here we delineated the role of SAGA in the regulation of RNR3 and contrast it to that of TFIID. We find that SAGA components fulfill distinct functions in the regulation of RNR3. The core promoter of RNR3 is SAGA-dependent, and we provide evidence that SAGA, not TAFIIs within TFIID, are largely responsible for TBP recruitment. This taken together with our previous work provides evidence that SAGA recruits TBP, whereas TFIID mediates chromatin remodeling. Thus, we described an unexpected shift in the division of labor between these two complexes and provide the first characterization of a gene that requires both SAGA and TFIID.

Thus, we described an unexpected shift in the division of labor between these two complexes and provide the first characterization of a gene that requires both SAGA and TFIID. The activation of genes requires the assembly of large macromolecular complexes at the promoter which function to alter chromatin structure and drive the assembly of the general transcription machinery (1Cosma M.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 3Li B.

Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This process is generally believed to occur in stages, the first being chromatin remodeling and exposure of the promoter followed by the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC). 2The abbreviations used are: PIC, preinitiation complex; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; PNT, polynucleotide tracts, RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; SAGA, Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAFII, TBP-associated factors; URS, upstream repression sequence; UAS, upstream activating sequence; IP, immunoprecipitated. A rate-limiting step in this process is the delivery of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the core promoter. TBP is recruited to the promoter of genes as part of one of a number of multisubunit complexes (4Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 5Pugh B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), although it is not known if monomeric TBP can bind to promoters in vivo. TFIID and SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex) are the two major pathways that deliver TBP to promoters in yeast. Promoters can be characterized as TAFII-independent or TAFII-dependent (6Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TAFII-independent promoters have a low TAFII occupancy (7Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R.

In fact, genome-wide expression data and computational studies predict a “bipolar genome.” SAGA regulates highly inducible stress responsive genes, whereas TFIID regulates constitutive housekeeping genes (15Huisinga K.L. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 573-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SAGA-regulated genes tend to have consensus TATA boxes, and TFIID-regulated genes do not (16Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 17Mencia M. Moqtaderi Z. Geisberg J.V. Kuras L. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 823-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Even the precise positioning of the core promoter nucleosome at SAGA-versus TFIID-dependent genes differs (18Ioshikhes I.P. Albert I. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These results have led to a model where genes are regulated by TFIID or SAGA. However, many genes in yeast (and likely many more in metazoans) rely on both SAGA and TFIID, and GCN5 and TAF1 are considered redundant throughout the genome (19Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Why two TBP recruiting complexes are utilized at a single gene is not clear, and the analysis of the contributions of these two redundant complexes at a single locus has not been undertaken. SAGA, like many transcription factor complexes, performs multiple functions in gene expression. A large body of genetic, structural, and functional characterization of SAGA subunits has identified “modules” within the complex, the SPT, TAFII, and ADA/GCN5 (for review, see Refs. 20Baker S.P. Grant P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5329-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Timmers H.T. Tora L. Trends Biochem.

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The activities of SAGA can be classified into two groups. The first is histone modification, which includes acetylation and regulation of ubiquitylation, and the second is the delivery of TBP to promoters. Because the expression of some genes is more sensitive to the deletion of subunits within one module versus another, it is believed that the importance of each activity differs among genes. We have used RNR3 as a model gene to study the mechanism of TAFII-dependent gene regulation (23Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Z. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39240-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The activation of RNR3 requires a transient activation function in Crt1 and the abundant transcription factor Rap1 (26Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7399-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Tomar R.S. Zhang S. Brunkre-Reese D.L. Wolcott H.N. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crt1 is the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that recruits Ssn6-Tup1 to the promoter to repress transcription by positioning nucleosomes, recruiting histone deacetylases and interfering with mediator (28Zhang Z.

DNA damage signals cause the release of repression and coverts Crt1 into a transient activator. Crt1 then recruits TFIID and SWI/SNF and ultimately disassociates from the promoter (26Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7399-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TFIID maintains the remodeled state and a high level of transcription by stabilizing the binding of Rap1 directly or indirectly through the retention of SWI/SNF (27Tomar R.S. Zhang S. Brunkre-Reese D.L. Wolcott H.N. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutation or depletion of multiple TFIID subunits impairs the action of this gene and other ribonucleotide reductase genes (24Li B. Reese J.C.

RNR3 has a consensus TATA-box, and its core promoter is insensitive to TAFII mutations; the TAFII dependence of this gene is mediated by the upstream repression/activating sequences (URS/UAS) (24Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite being TFIID-dependent, it has the features of a SAGA-dependent gene; thus, it is likely to be regulated by both complexes. However, the contributions of TFIID versus SAGA at the gene are unclear. Here, we carried out an analysis of the role of SAGA in regulating RNR3. Strains containing mutations in different functional modules of SAGA were analyzed for RNR3 expression. We found that RNR3 is more sensitive to inactivation of the TBP recruitment module than the histone modification module, suggesting that SAGA delivers TBP to the promoter. Consistent with this model, the core promoter of RNR3 is very sensitive to the inactivation of the TBP module of SAGA. We propose a model where the primary function of SAGA is to deliver TBP to the RNR3 core promoter and that of TFIID is to mediate the chromatin remodeling step through the UAS/URS of the gene. Thus, we have uncovered unexpected roles of these two coactivator complexes at RNR3, which likely applies to other genes in yeast and metazoans. Strains and Media—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table 1. All strains are derived from PH499 (MATa ade2-101ochre his3-200 leu2-1 ura3-52 trp1-63 lys2-801amber). Cells were cultivated at 30 °C in YPD (yeast extract 1%, peptone 2%, and dextrose 2%) medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml adenine. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was added to a final concentration of 0.03% for 2.5 h where indicated (+MMS). Gene deletions were carried out by homologous recombination using PCR-generated cassettes (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Reese J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8833-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RNR3-lacZ-derived reporter plasmids were described in a previous manuscript (24Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The promoter activity was measured by Northern blotting using a probe to lacZ. Northern Blotting and Chromatin Mapping—Cells from 10 ml of yeast culture (A600 = 0.5 ∼ 1) were harvested for total RNA extraction. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-XL membrane (GE Biosciences) by capillary blotting. Probes comprising the entire open reading frames of RNR3 or Scr1 were prepared by the polymerase chain reaction and gel-purified. The signal of scR1 (small cytoplasmic RNA) in each sample was used to correct for recovery and loading of RNA. Additional details have been published elsewhere (33Reese J.C. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease mapping of nucleosomes by indirect end-labeling was carried out using a published protocol (24Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described in previous publications (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 100 ml of yeast culture (A600 = 0.5–1.0) was treated or not with 0.03% MMS for 2.5 h before cross-linking with formaldehyde (1% v/v) for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched with 125 mm glycine. Whole cell extracts were prepared by glass bead disruption and sheared into fragments averaging 400 bp in size using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Philadelphia PA). Whole cell extracts containing equal amounts of DNA were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies against the various factors. Extracts were supplemented with sarkosyl to a final concentration of 0.4% (w/v) when TAF1 and Swi2 cross-linking was examined. RNAPII antibody was obtained from commercial sources (8WG16, Covance, Berkeley, CA). The following antibodies were raised in rabbits and are described in previous publications (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell.

The protein-immune complexes were recovered using 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Biosciences). After washing and reversing the cross-links, the IP DNA and input DNA were analyzed by semiquantitative PCR with primers directed toward RNR3 (32Zhang H. Reese J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8833-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Sharma V.M. Tomar R.S. Dempsey A.E. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3199-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The percentage IP was calculated from these values, and data are expressed relative to the cross-linking observed in untreated wild type cells. At least three independent experiments were analyzed, and data are presented as the means and S.D. of these repetitions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data were analyzed by Student's t test. For detecting nucleosome eviction over the RNR3 promoter, cells were processed as described above, except that the chromatin was extensively sheared into fragments averaging about 200 bp in length. Chromatin was precipitated using an antibody to the core domain of H3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Antibody to acetylated H3 (9Dudley A.M. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Sermwittayawong D. Tan S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3791-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Identification of the Role of SAGA in the Activation of RNR3—SAGA is the histone acetyltransferase complex responsible for the DNA damage-induced increase in histone H3 acetylation at the RNR3 promoter (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previously we examined mutants of the Gcn5-Ada module, GCN5 and ADA2. However, as described above, SAGA is modular in nature, and its subunits carry out distinct functions (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Qiu H. Hu C. Yoon S. Natarajan K. Swanson M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4104-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Barbaric S.R. Horz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3468-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) such as the covalent modification of histones and TBP recruitment. Because RNR3 has a consensus TATA-box, a feature of SAGA-regulated genes (16Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), we explored the role of SAGA in recruiting TBP to the promoter. We constructed strains containing deletions of GCN5, SPT3, and SPT7 and examined the induction of RNR3 after treatment with the DNA damage agent MMS. Similar to our previous results, deleting GCN5 partially reduced RNR3 activation to a level ∼40% that of the level observed in wild type cells (Fig. 1). Similar results were observed in ada2Δ and ada3Δ mutants (Ref. 25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, RNR3 expression is partially dependent upon the histone acetylation function of SAGA. Deletion of SPT3, which is required for TBP recruitment to other SAGA-regulated genes, had a much stronger effect on activation than deleting GCN5. Deleting SPT8, another subunit of TBP recruitment module of SAGA, had a similar effect on RNR3 expression as deleting SPT3 (data not shown). Finally, deleting SPT7, which is required for SAGA integrity, had the strongest effect on activation (Fig. 1). This phenotype suggests disrupting both the histone modifying functions (GCN5) and TBP recruitment functions (SPT3) of the complex result in a stronger defect in RNR3 activation. To test this, a double gcn5Δ/spt3Δ mutant was constructed and analyzed. This double mutant had a stronger activation defect than the single mutants but still slightly less than the spt7Δ mutant. Furthermore, a comparison of the strengths of the phenotypes of the various mutants suggests that the dominant function of SAGA at RNR3 is TBP recruitment through the Spt3 module and not histone modification via the Gcn5/ADA module. Spt3 and Spt7 Are Required for TBP Recruitment and PIC Formation—Activation of RNR3 requires cells to detect and transduce DNA damage signals to the RNR3 promoter. DNA damage checkpoint-dependent release of Crt1 is required for expression of the RNR genes (26Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7399-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); thus, the activation defects in the mutants could be indirect and caused by the inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. To verify that mutating SAGA does not indirectly affect RNR3 expression by disrupting checkpoint function, we examined the cross-linking of Crt1 to the promoter. MMS treatment reduced Crt1 cross-linking in wild type cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with the activation of the checkpoint and release of the repressor. Likewise, MMS treatment reduced Crt1 cross-linking in the three SAGA mutants, suggesting that SAGA is not required for checkpoint activation and that SAGA directly regulates RNR3 at the level of transcription. The small reduction in Crt1 cross-linking in undamaged cells in the mutants is within experimental error and is not likely to be significant. A feature of a prototypical TFIID-dependent gene is that TBP recruitment to its promoter is not or is weakly, dependent upon SAGA (38Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Zhu X. Li L. Shen W.C. Dixit B.L. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1240-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Disabling the TBP recruitment module (spt3Δ) had a stronger effect on RNR3 activation than disabling the histone acetylation module (Fig. 1), suggesting that SAGA participates in the recruitment of TBP to this gene. We examined the recruitment of TBP, TAF1, and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter of RNR3 using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The data show that the MMS-induced cross-linking of RNAPII correlated well with the levels of RNR3 mRNA in each of the mutants; deletion of GCN5 partially reduced recruitment, whereas deleting SPT3 or SPT7 essentially eliminated it (compare Fig. 1 with Fig. 2B). Next, we examined TBP recruitment to the promoter. Consistent with the idea that the Spt3 module of SAGA is required for TBP recruitment to RNR3, mutation of SPT3 or SPT7 severely compromised the recruitment of TBP (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, TBP recruitment was not affected in the gcn5Δ mutant. This indicates that TBP recruitment does not require H3 acetylation and suggests that a SAGA complex lacking Gcn5 is capable of recruiting TBP to RNR3. Similar results were observed at GAL1 and other SAGA-dependent genes, and a stable subcomplex of SAGA is detected in a gcn5Δ mutant (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 38Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7365-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 41Qiu H. Hu C. Zhang F. Hwang G. Swanson M. Boonchird C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3461-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The most striking result is that TBP recruitment is normal, but RNAPII recruitment is reduced in this mutant. This suggests that Gcn5, presumably through histone modification, is required for stable or multiple rounds of RNAPII recruitment. A similar phenotype is observed when histone acetylation is constitutively increased by deleting the two histone deacetylases RPD3 and HOS2 (36Sharma V.M. Tomar R.S. Dempsey A.E. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3199-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, reducing or misregulating histone acetylation adversely affects RNAPII recruitment, suggesting that dynamic histone modifications are required for high levels of RNAPII recruitment to RNR3. We have previously shown that activation of RNR3 correlates with increased recruitment of TAFIIs (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Z. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7399-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We analyzed the recruitment of TAF1p, an integral component of TFIID, to RNR3 in the three classes of SAGA mutants. MMS treatment caused a 3-fold recruitment of TAF1p in wild type cells, and deletion of GCN5 had minimal to no effect on recruitment (Fig. 2D). The difference in cross-linking between the wild type cells and the gcn5Δ mutant under induced conditions is slight and probably not statistically significant (Student's t test, p ≤ 0.11). Examination of the TAF1p cross-linking in the spt3Δ and spt7Δ mutants revealed no significant increase in response to MMS treatment, suggesting TAFII recruitment is defective in these mutants (Fig. 2D). Thus, the recruitment of TAF1 mirrors that of TBP in the SAGA mutants and SAGA is required for TFIID recruitment. SAGA Is Required for Nucleosome Eviction and SWI/SNF Recruitment—We have previously used micrococcal nuclease mapping to identify the requirement for GCN5 in the disruption of nucleosome positioning at RNR3 (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deleting GCN5 reduced the extent of nucleosome remodeling under the activated condition but did not eliminate it. Furthermore, deleting GCN5 actually increased the recruitment of SWI/SNF to the promoter. Here, we extended the analysis to the other SAGA mutants and also monitored the eviction of the core promoter nucleosome using antibodies to the core domain of H3. As reported previously (27Tomar R.S. Zhang S. Brunkre-Reese D.L. Wolcott H.N. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Zhang H. Reese J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8833-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), MMS treatment caused a significant reduction in the occupancy of the nucleosome over the core promoter (Fig. 3A). We interpret this as eviction of the nucleosome caused by remodeling. The recruitment of Swi2, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is increased under this condition, indicating a link between SWI/SNF recruitment and nucleosome eviction (Fig. 3B). Deleting SPT3 or SPT7 eliminated the eviction of the core promoter nucleosome and eliminated the MMS-induced recruitment of SWI/SNF (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, Spt3 and Spt7 are required for SWI/SNF recruitment and nucleosome eviction. As noted before (25Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), deleting GCN5 actually increased SWI/SNF recruitment both in the treated (p ≤ 0.03) and untreated (p ≤ 0.04) cells (Fig. 3B). The increase in recruitment in untreated cells is surprising but also correlated with a reduction in H3 cross-linking under the same conditions (Fig. 3A). Next, we analyzed H3 acetylation of the core promoter nucleosome in the SAGA mutants. Deletion of GCN5 or SPT7 strongly reduced the MMS-induced increase in H3 acetylation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the level of acetylation was reduced in these mutants in untreated cells too. This suggests that a basal level of acetylation is present before DNA damage. In contrast, deleting SPT3 had a lesser effect on H3 acetylation, suggesting that the histone acetylation function of SAGA is partially intact in this mutant. These results mirror those described at the GAL1 locus, where deleting SPT3 had a relatively minor effect on histone acetylation (9Dudley A.M. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined the cross-linking of Tup1 to RNR3. The activation of RNR3 correlates with the release of Tup1, and release of the corepressor is required for activation (28Zhang Z. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39240-39250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MMS treatment caused the reduced cross-linking of Tup1 to the promoter (Fig. 3D) in wild type cells, and deletion of SPT3 or SPT7 did not significantly affect Tup1 cross-linking in the repressed state or its release upon MMS treatment. This further reinforces the idea that the DNA damage response and the release of the repressor are not affected by deletion of SAGA subunits. Some differences are observed in the gcn5Δ mutant. There is a slightly reduced amount of Tup1 at the promoter in the repressed state. The reduced Tup1 in the repressed state may be related to the reduced nucleosome density in this mutant (Fig. 3A) and enhanced SWI/SNF recruitment (Fig. 3B), but the cause and effect relationship is unclear at this time. Nucleosomes adopt precise translational positions at RNR3 in the repressed state (23Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Positioning requires the cooperative ac"
https://openalex.org/W2086043621,"Memory is believed to depend on activity-dependent changes in the strength of synapses, e.g. long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which can be determined by the sequence of coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity, respectively. It remains unclear, however, whether and how coincident activity of converging efferent pathways can enable LTP and LTD in the pathways simultaneously. Here, we report that, in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, stimulation (600 pulses, 5 Hz) to Schaffer preceding to commissural pathway within a 40-ms timing window induced similar magnitudes of LTP in both pathways onto synapses of CA1 neurons, with varied LTP magnitudes after reversal of the stimulation sequence. In contrast, in urethane-anesthetized or freely-moving rats, the stimulation to Schaffer preceding to commissural pathway induced Schaffer LTP and commissural LTD simultaneously within a 40-ms timing window, without affecting synaptic efficacy in the reversed stimulation sequence. Coincident activity of Schaffer pathways confirmed the above findings under pentobarbital and urethane anesthesia. Thus, coincident activity of converging afferent pathways tends to switch the pathways to be LTP only or LTP/LTD depending on the activity states of the hippocampus. This network rule strengthens the view that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity may well contribute to memory process of the hippocampal network with flexibility or stability from one state to another."

https://openalex.org/W2107136491,"Armadillo, the Drosophila orthologue of vertebrate ss-catenin, plays a dual role as the key effector of Wingless/Wnt1 signalling, and as a bridge between E-Cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. In the absence of ligand, Armadillo is phosphorylated and targeted to the proteasome. Upon binding of Wg to its receptors, the ""degradation complex"" is inhibited; Armadillo is stabilised and enters the nucleus to transcribe targets.Although the relationship between signalling and adhesion has been extensively studied, few in vivo data exist concerning how the ""transcriptional"" and ""adhesive"" pools of Armadillo are regulated to orchestrate development. We have therefore addressed how the subcellular distribution of Armadillo and its association with E-Cadherin change in larval wing imaginal discs, under wild type conditions and upon signalling. Using confocal microscopy, we show that Armadillo and E-Cadherin are spatio-temporally regulated during development, and that a punctate species becomes concentrated in a subapical compartment in response to Wingless. In order to further dissect this phenomenon, we overexpressed Armadillo mutants exhibiting different levels of activity and stability, but retaining E-Cadherin binding. Arm(S10) displaces endogenous Armadillo from the AJ and the basolateral membrane, while leaving E-Cadherin relatively undisturbed. Surprisingly, DeltaNArm(1-155) caused displacement of both Armadillo and E-Cadherin, results supported by our novel method of quantification. However, only membrane-targeted Myr-DeltaNArm(1-155) produced comparable nuclear accumulation of Armadillo and signalling to Arm(S10). These experiments also highlighted a row of cells at the A/P boundary depleted of E-Cadherin at the AJ, but containing actin.Taken together, our results provide in vivo evidence for a complex non-linear relationship between Armadillo levels, subcellular distribution and Wingless signalling. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of Armadillo in regulating the subcellular distribution of E-Cadherin."

There are five thrombospondins (THBSs) 3The abbreviations used are: THBS, thrombospondin; PSACH, pseudoachrondroplasia; MED, multiple epiphyseal dysplaisa; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. in humans that are involved in diverse processes such as angiogenesis, cell motility, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix organization (1.Adams J.C. Lawler J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These secreted calcium-binding glycoproteins fall into two groups (see Fig. 1A). Group A THBSs (THBS-1 and THBS-2) form trimers and are composed of an N-terminal module, an oligomerization domain, a von Willebrand Factor type C homology module, three THBS type 1 or properdin-like modules, and a signature domain containing three epidermal growth factor-like modules (EGF1, EGF2, and EGF3), a calcium-binding wire, and a lectin-like C-terminal module (see Fig. 1A). Group B THBSs (THBSs 3–5) form pentamers, lack von Willebrand factor type C and properdin modules, and have an extra EGF-like module (EGF2′) in the signature domain (see Fig. 1A) (1.Adams J.C. Lawler J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of portions of THBS-1 and THBS-2 revealed that the wire module is composed of 13 calcium-binding repeats: eight C-type (23 residues) and five N-type (13 or 15 residues), with a disulfide-bonded insert in the first C-type repeat (repeat 1C) (2,3). The THBS-2 signature domain binds 30 calcium ions, one in EGF2 at the EGF1-EGF2 interface, 26 in the wire, and three in the lectin-like module. The THBS-2 signature domain denatures in two major peaks as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (4.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each of these can be deconvoluted into two components (51.0 and 53.1 °C for the low temperature peak; 78.8 and 82.7 °C for the high temperature peak) (5.Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The four components likely represent the nonreversible melting of the wire repeat 1C-lectin and wire repeat 9C-lectin interactions followed by the reversible melting of the EGF-like and wire modules (4.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5.Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The melting events, therefore, are presumed to report on the interactions among the EGF2, EGF3, wire, and lectin-like modules revealed in the crystal structures of the THBS signature domain (2,3) (see Fig. 1B). These interactions involve the wire module wrapping around the lectin-like module, making contact at repeats 1C and 9C and forming a hairpin turn composed of repeats 10N-13C. The hairpin turn is in close association with EGF2 and EGF3 (3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the insert in wire repeat 1C interacts extensively with EGF3 (see Fig. 1B). Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED/EDM1) are autosomal dominant forms of skeletal dysplasias (7.Posey K.L. Yang Y. Veerisetty A.C. Sharan S.K. Hecht J.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PSACH is caused exclusively by mutations in THBS-5, also called COMP (cartilage oligomeric protein; the gene name is COMP). PSACH is marked by short stature, lax joints, and early osteoarthritis. MED results in mild to moderate short stature and joint pain and is caused by mutations in collagen IX or matrilin-3, as well as in THBS-5 (7.Posey K.L. Yang Y. Veerisetty A.C. Sharan S.K. Hecht J.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Patients with disease-linked THBS-5 mutations, of which there are more than 100 (3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A.

Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), therefore suffer from a spectrum of phenotypes from severe PSACH to mild MED. Mice genetically manipulated to lack THBS-5 do not have a PSACH or MED phenotype (8.Svensson L. Aszodi A. Heinegard D. Hunziker E.B. Reinholt F.P. Fassler R. Oldberg A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4366-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas mice expressing mutant THBS-5 recapitulate much of the phenotype of the same mutations in humans (7.Posey K.L.

The mouse results strongly suggest that diseases caused by mutations of THBS-5 are caused by an altered protein rather than absence of the protein. Pathological examinations of cartilage from PSACH patients and chondrocytes expressing mutant THBS-5 revealed enlarged distended endoplasmic reticula containing an accumulation of THBS-5, collagen IX, and matrillin-3 in association with chaperones (11.Vranka J.

However, because less protein is secreted to the extracellular matrix, and the resulting extracellular matrix is poorly organized, disease may also be due to an extracellular matrix less able to support the stresses and strains of normal activity (7.Posey K.L.

Thus, the known COMP mutations can be considered a fairly comprehensive list of residues that are important for signature domain structure and function. When mapped on the structures of THBS-1 and THBS-2 constructs, all of the THBS-5 mutations that cause PSACH or MED localize to the wire or lectin-like modules (2.Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). Based on such mapping, it has been proposed that disease-causing mutations impair interactions between the wire and lectin-like modules or binding of calcium to the wire, both leading to protein destabilization (2.Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, equilibrium dialysis, far UV circular dichorism spectra, sedimentation velocity, electron microscopy, and NMR studies of recombinant wire repeats of THBS-5 or full-length THBS-5 protein with mutations of calcium-binding residues suggest that the wire module is unstructured and/or disrupted and binds less calcium than wild-type protein (21.Kleerekoper Q.

Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, Thur et al. (25.Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) found that D361Y and delD469 mutations of calcium-binding residues in recombinant full-length THBS-5 protein do not lead to changes in far UV circular dichroism, even though these same mutations impact far UV circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, and calcium-binding of constructs comprising only the wire. These findings indicate that other parts of THBS-5 compensate for mutations that are highly disruptive of the wire module in isolation. Reasoning that the THBS-5 mutations serve as a guide on how to perturb the extensive intermodular interfaces and calcium binding found in THBS signature domains, we introduced 10 such mutations into the THBS-2 signature domain, for which the structures of the wire and lectin-like modules are known (see Figs. 1B and 2) (3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We concentrated on six PSACH or MED mutations that would be expected to disrupt interactions between the wire and lectin-like modules and compared these with four of the many mutations that target calcium binding to residues in the wire repeats (see Table 1 and Figs. 1B and 2). Because changes in protein stability and structure are implicated in the pathology of the mutations when found in THBS-5, we examined the impact of the mutations on protein stability using DSC and on protein structure using binding to 4B6.13, an anti-THBS-2 monoclonal antibody to an epitope in repeat 1C (Fig. 1B) for which the interactions among EGF3, the wire, and the lectin-like module are required for binding, as a sensitive probe of globally determined local structure (26.Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 10 mutations caused a spectrum of changes in protein stability and structure that are manifested in multiple parts of the signature domain.TABLE 1Summary of results The abbreviations are as follows: NA, not applicable; 1C, 9C, 2N, 5N, and 10N, wire repeats; L, lectin-like module; SP, single peak; NB, no binding; LB, low binding; ND, not done; cELISA, competition ELISA; dELISA, direct ELISA.

Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wild-type human and mouse proteins and the mouse protein mutated to carry the 4B6.13 epitope have been previously described (26.Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The signature domain of human THBS-2 comprises residues 551–1172 with ADP and ARGHHHHHH N- and C-terminal tails. The signature domain of mouse THBS-2 also comprises residues 551–1172, but with ADL and NAGHHHHHH N-terminal and C-terminal tails. The missense mutation or deletion was introduced by PCR mutagenesis into DNA encoding the signature domain THBS-2. Correct orientation and sequence of PCR-amplified DNA were verified by sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The wild-type and mutated THBS-2 signature domain proteins were expressed by infecting High Five insect cells in SF900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C with high titer virus (>108 plaque-forming units/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of ∼5. Conditioned medium was collected ∼65 h post-infection. Histidine-tagged proteins were purified at room temperature from the medium in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and fast protein liquid chromatography purification using an ion exchange HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), as described previously (3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.-l.A. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm less the absorbance at 320 nm and divided by the calculated extinction coefficient of 1.24 ml mg-1 cm-1 for all proteins (28.Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC experiments were performed at the University of Wisconsin Biophysics Instrumentation Facility using a Microcal VP-differential scanning calorimeter equipped with Origin 7 software. Proteins (7.9–15.8 μm) were dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. The scans were conducted from 15 to 95 °C at a rate of 60 °C h-1. The solutions were cooled to 15 °C and then repeated to assess reversibility. As previously seen for the wild-type THBS-2 signature domain (4.Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5.Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in all proteins the low temperature peak was nonreversible, and the high temperature peak was partially or fully reversible. Appropriate buffer scans were used for reference subtraction, and the data were normalized using protein concentrations, including an estimated 2% dilution upon introduction into the DSC sample cell. The scans were done in duplicate, and the reported patterns and peak melting points were reproducible. Area-fitting analyses were performed with the DSC Origin 7 software package. Manual fit base lines were subtracted from sample scans that were corrected for reference sample and concentration. This curve was then fitted to a non-two-state model, based on the nonreversibility of the low temperature peak, with various numbers of components. The fits were refined using several iterations until the χ2 value stabilized. Based on similar analyses on wild-type THBS-1 and THBS-2 signature domain proteins, which both modeled best as four components (5.Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we started with a fourevent model. The optimal number of components was determined as the minimum that resulted in a substantial decrease in the χ2 value. For example, if two components gave a χ2 value of 1 × 105, three components gave a χ2 value of 1 × 104, and four components gave a χ2 value of 9 × 103, we would consider three to be the likely number of components. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Proteins in 2 mm calcium were tested in competition ELISA for binding to 4B6.13 as described (26.Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to assess whether various concentrations of soluble protein in 2 mm calcium were able to compete with surface adsorbed recombinant full-length THBS-2 for binding of the monoclonal antibody. These competition ELISA experiments were repeated, each with triplicate data points, on multiple occasions and with at least two separate preparations of protein. The data were normalized to the appropriate control and expressed as the means of the different experiments ± S.E. A variation of the competition ELISA was done with a fixed concentration of soluble protein and varying calcium concentrations, with the lowest concentration maintaining the interaction of 4B6.13 with the absorbed full-length wild-type THBS-2 protein. These experiments used 1.5 μg/ml full-length THBS-2 for coating and 1 μm soluble protein for competition. These competition ELISA experiments each had triplicate data points. The data were normalized to the appropriate control and expressed as the means of the different data points ± standard deviation. Direct ELISA experiments with monoclonal antibody 4B6.13 were conducted as described (5.Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), plating protein at 10 μg/ml and using Costar 3590 high binding polystyrene plates. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human THBS-2 antibodies (29.Tooney P.A. Sakai T. Sakai K. Aeschlimann D. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used to test whether the various proteins were adsorbed to the plate at similar concentrations. These direct ELISA experiments were repeated, each with triplicate data points, on multiple occasions and with at least two separate preparations of protein. The data were normalized to the appropriate control and expressed as the means of the different experiments ± S.E. To relate the amount of plated protein to density of 4B6.13 epitope in adsorbed protein in 2 mm calcium, proteins were adsorbed at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/ml, and binding to 4B6.13 or rabbit polyclonal antibodies (29.Tooney P.A. Sakai T. Sakai K. Aeschlimann D. Mosher D.F. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was determined by direct ELISA. These direct ELISA experiments each had triplicate data points. The data were normalized to the appropriate control and expressed as the means of the different data points ± standard deviation. The data were plotted as percentages of control versus log concentration of competing proteins or log calcium concentration in the case of the competition ELISAs and calcium concentration or log protein concentration during adsorption in the case of the direct ELISAs. Mutations at Intermodular Interfaces Destabilize the THBS-2 Signature Domain—Mapping the THBS-5 PSACH and MED mutations onto the THBS-2 signature domain structure reveals clusters of mutations of residues that lie at the intermodular interfaces between wire repeat 1C and one side of the lectin-like module and between wire repeat 9C and the opposite side of the lectin-like module (Fig. 1B and Ref. 3.Carlson C.B.

These residues are not predicted to bind calcium (2,3). To evaluate two related hypotheses, that the mutations disrupt the interface (3.Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M.

Thus, choosing from among eight described disease-associated missense mutations involving non-calcium-binding residues at the wire repeat 1C-lectin interface, we introduced four into homologous sites in the THBS-2 signature domain: L697P and S726L in wire repeat 1C, and T1013M and T1013R in the lectin-like module (Fig. 2A). The two mutations of Thr1013 were selected because protein trafficking studies have indicated a difference between these proteins, with the T1013R homologue leading to more severe trafficking defects (20.Chen T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1965306136,"The retinoid X receptor β gene (Rxrb) is located just upstream of the α2(XI) collagen chain gene (Col11a2) in a head-to-tail manner. However, the domain structures of these genes are unknown. Col11a2 is specifically expressed in cartilage. In the present study, we found Rxrb expression in various tissues with low expression in the cartilage. Col11a2 1st intron enhancer directed cartilage specific expression when linked to the heterologous promoter in transgenic mice. These results suggest the presence of enhancer-blocking elements that insulate Rxrb promoter from the Col11a2 enhancer. So far, most of insulators examined in vertebrates contain a binding site for CTCF. We found two possible CTCF-binding sites: one (11P) in the intergenic region between Rxrb and Col11a2 by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and the other in the 4th intron of RXRB by data base search. To examine the function of these elements, we prepared bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene constructs containing a 142-kb genomic DNA insert with RXRB and COL11A2 sequences in the middle. Mutation of 11P significantly decreased the RXRB promoter activity in muscular cells and significantly increased expression levels of RXRB in chondrosarcoma cells. In transgenic mouse assays, the wild-type BAC transgene partly recapitulated endogenous Rxrb expression patterns. A 507-bp deletion mutation including 11P enhanced the cartilage-specific activity of the RXRB promoter in BAC transgenic mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CTCF was associated with RX4, but not with 11P. Our results showed that the intergenic sequence including 11P insulates Rxrb promoter from Col11a2 enhancer, possibly associating with unknown factors that recognize a motif similar to CTCF.

Cartilage is a highly specialized tissue that serves as the template for skeletal development and lines the joint surface. Cartilage consists of an abundant extracellular matrix maintained by chondrocytes. The collagen network provides scaffolding for proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and confers tensile strength important for resisting compression and shearing loads in cartilage. Cartilage collagen fibrils are heterotypic fibrils composed of types II, IX, and XI collagens. The type XI collagen molecules co-assemble stoichiometrically with the major collagen, type II collagen, to form cartilage fibrils, whereas type IX collagen is associated with the surface of the fibrils (1Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H.

The type XI collagen molecule is composed of three distinct subunits: α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) (3Morris N.P. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type XI collagen likely regulates the diameter of cartilage collagen fibrils (4Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R.

Mutations in the α2(XI) collagen chain gene are associated with certain forms of human chondrodysplasia, Stickler syndrome and otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, indicating that type XI collagen is intimately involved in skeletal morphogenesis (6Vikkula M.

This alignment is conserved in organisms ranging from humans to zebrafish. The distance between the termination codon of Rxrb and the ATG codon of Col11a2 is 2,441 bp in humans, 2,161 bp in rats, 2,123 bp in mice, and 13,800 bp in zebrafish. The COL11A2 is 30-kb in size, consisting of more than 50 exons and RXRB is 7-kb in size, consisting of 10 exons. The three retinoid X receptors, RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ, belong to the family of nuclear hormone receptors that are ligand-activated transcription factors (9Germain P. Staels B. Dacquet C. Spedding M. Laudet V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). RXR is an obligatory component of various nuclear receptor heterodimers such as the retinoic acid receptor, vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor RXRs play an integrative role in a number of nuclear receptor-mediated pathways. RXRα and RXRβ transcripts are widely expressed in embryo and adult tissues, whereas the distribution of RXRγ transcripts is more restricted (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of mice lacking RXRβ died before birth or at birth. Male mice that survived were sterile due to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (11Kastner P. Mark M. Leid M. Gansmuller A. Chin W. Grondona J.M. Decimo D. Krezel W. Dierich A. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). RXRβ and RXRγ are expressed in the striatum and control the function of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway (12Krezel W. Ghyselinck N. Samad T.A. Dupe V. Kastner P. Borrelli E. Chambon P. Science. 1998; 279: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). RXR forms heterodimers with liver X receptor and farnesoid X-activated receptor and regulates cholesterol balance (13Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Thus, the fidelity of the spatiotemporal expression of RXRβ is crucial for the normal development of a wide variety of tissues.The organization of eukaryotic genomes necessarily results in the proximity of domains with distinct functions. The identity of domains is maintained by classical transcriptional regulatory elements, such as enhancers, silencers, and upstream activating sequences. In some cases, specific DNA sequences, referred to as insulators (14Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Nature Rev. 2006; 7: 703-713Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and their associated binding proteins have a role in establishing or maintaining discrete interdomain boundaries. Insulators have been divided into two classes: enhancer-blocking insulators, which prevent distal enhancers from activating a promoter when placed between an enhancer and promoter, and barrier insulators, which block heterochromatinization and the consequent silencing of a gene (15Wallace J.A. Felsenfeld G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the enhancer blocking activity of insulators is associated with a binding site for the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which recognizes long and diverse nucleotide sequences. CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein with 11 zinc finger DNA-binding domains. Thus far, CTCF remains as the only major protein implicated in the establishment of insulators in vertebrates (16Felsenfeld G. Burgess-Beusse B. Farrell C. Gaszner M. Ghirlando R. Huang S. Jin C. Litt M. Magdinier F. Mutskov V. Nakatani Y. Tagami H. West A. Yusufzai T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There has been great interest in identifying other binding sites for CTCF. Several recent high-throughput ChIP-chip analyses and comparative genomic studies have identified tens of thousands of potential CTCF-binding sites in the human and mouse genomes (17Bao L. Zhou M. Cui Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D83-D87Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Kim T.H. Abdullaev Z.K. Smith A.D. Ching K.A. Loukinov D.I. Green R.D. Zhang M.Q. Lobanenkov V.V. Ren B.

A. 2007; 104: 7145-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the ChIP-chip analysis for CTCF is 88%; thus, there are some false-negative results (18Kim T.H. Abdullaev Z.K.

Recently, it was discovered that cohesin binds to many of the CTCF-binding sites, co-localizing with CTCF to insulate promoters from distinct enhancers (20Wendt K.S. Yoshida K. Itoh T. Bando M. Koch B. Schirghuber E. Tsutsumi S. Nagae G. Ishihara K. Mishiro T. Yahata K. Imamoto F. Aburatani H. Nakao M. Imamoto N. Maeshima K. Shirahige K. Peters J.M.

Yokomori K. Dillon N. Aragon L. Fisher A.G. Merkenschlager M. Cell. 2008; 132: 422-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar).Despite the proximity of Rxrb and Col11a2, the dissimilarities in their expression patterns and functions suggest the existence of an intergenic boundary. To investigate this possibility, we first clarified differences in the expression patterns of the two genes and examined whether the cartilage-specific enhancer of Col11a2 could affect transcriptional activities of heterologous promoters. We then searched for a CTCF-binding site between the two genes. We examined whether the intergenic sequence and CTCF-binding site affected the activities of the Rxrb promoter by using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene constructs that cover the entire Rxrb and Col11a2 genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNorthern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from various mouse tissues at 16.5 days postcoitus and from cell lines by using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA). Ten micrograms of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through formaldehyde-agarose gels and then transferred onto Nytran membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were labeled with [32P]dCTP by using the Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse Col11a2 and Rxrb cDNAs.Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were digested with DNase to eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA before real-time quantitative RT-PCR. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen). The PCR amplification proceeded in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of SYBR PremixExTaq (Takara, Japan), and 4 pmol of primers specific for rat Rxrb and Col11a2. The quantified individual RNA expression levels of rat Col11a2 and rat Rxrb were normalized to the respective rat Gapdh expression levels.

L6, FR, and H4IIE cells were obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).Histology and in Situ Hybridization—Mouse embryos were dissected with a stereomicroscope, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RNA in situ hybridization was performed by using 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes as previously described (40D-Pelton R.W. Dickinson M.E.

The fragment of 2.3 kb of the first intron sequence of Col11a2 as an enhancer was cloned into the SalI/PstI polylinker site located downstream of the SV-40 polyadenylation signal of ADbeta to create pAD-LacZ-Int. Nf-LacZ-Int was created by inserting the 2.3-kb fragment of the first intron sequence of Col11a2 as an enhancer into the SalI/PstI polylinker site located downstream of the SV-40 polyadenylation signal of pNf-LacZ (27Tsumaki N.

Transgenic mice were produced by microinjecting each of the inserts into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6x DBA) as described previously (8Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Generation 0 (G0) embryos were sacrificed at 13.5 days postcoitus and processed for expression analysis of the reporter gene. Transgenic embryos were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from the placenta or tail as described previously (8Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). X-Gal staining of mouse bodies and sections was performed as previously described (28Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo., 3rd Ed.

CTCF cDNA was transferred to pTNT vector and used for in vitro synthesis of CTCF protein with the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI, catalog number L1170). Nuclear extracts from RCS cells were prepared using CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were prepared as described under supplementary data.DNA fragments were denatured, end-labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and annealed to prepare radiolabeled probes. The radiolabeled probes were gel purified and combined with equal amounts of in vitro-synthesized CTCF protein or equal amounts of nuclear extracts. For binding reactions, we used a buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol in the presence of 10 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) and unlabeled 10 nm double-strand synthesized oligonucleotides containing an Sp1-binding site, as SP1-like factors can bind to GC-rich segments and obscure the binding of CTCF (29Awad T.A.

The reaction mixtures of a 10-μl final volume were incubated for 20 min at room temperature followed by electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear extracts in the presence of 0.2 ng/μl salmon sperm DNA. For super-shift assays, the reaction mixture was combined with 2 μl of anti-CTCF antibody (Upstate number 07-729) or normal rabbit IgG and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C before the addition of radiolabeled probes. The primers and synthesized oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S2.ChiP Assay—We used the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate number 17-295), according to the manufacturer's protocol as described under supplementary data.We performed quantitative real-time PCR in triplicate with DNA prepared with anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody and input DNA. We used the LightCycler FastStart DNA Masterplus HybProbe kit (Roche number 03-515-575001) in a LightCycler (Roche). Amplification reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl with 20 pm (each) primers and FRET probes (0.4 μl of each primer per reaction), 5 μl of template DNA, and 1× Master mixture (4 μl/reaction).We performed quantitative real-time PCR in triplicate with DNA prepared with anti-CTCF antibody, DNA prepared with anti-Rad21 antibody, DNA prepared with anti-BORIS antibody, and input DNA by using primer pairs designed for 11P and RX4. We used LightCycler and SYBR Green reagent (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Data were analyzed with LightCycler software by the Fit Point method to minimize noise and obtain the best possible correlation coefficient between standards. The -fold difference for a particular target sequence was determined by calculating the ratio of the amount of the target sequence in the immunoprecipitation to the amount of the target sequence in the input DNA. Primers and FRET probes were selected from human and rat retinoid X receptor and α2(XI) collagen chain gene sequences using Roche Primer design software. Primers and FRET probes were obtained from Sigma and Nihon Gene Research Laboratories Inc. (Sendai, Japan), respectively. The primers and FRET probes are listed in supplemental Table S3.BAC Transgene Construction—A human BAC clone, CTD-2054I15 (WT), which contains RXRB and COL11A2 in the middle, was purchased from Invitrogen. Modifications of a BAC clone were performed as described under supplementary data. Constructs were checked with digestion with various restriction enzymes and PCR analysis. The primers used in BAC modifications are listed in supplemental Table S4.Colony Assays—Two micrograms of the BAC transgene constructs (WT-Pur, 11Psub-Pur, 11Pdel-Pur, and RX4sub-Pur) were transfected into 1 × 106 L6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 10-cm dishes (supplemental Fig. S2). After 24 h, cells were selected by puromycin (5 μg/ml). After 10 days of selection, dishes were stained with crystal violet and the colonies were counted.Establishment of Transgenic RCS Cells—The BAC transgene constructs (SV40-Pur/WT, SV40-Pur/11Psub, and SV40-Pur/11Pdel) were transfected into 1 × 106 RCS cells in 10-cm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (supplemental Fig. S2). After 24 h, cells were selected by puromycin (3 μg/ml). After 14 days of selection, colonies were picked-up and replated in 24-well dishes. We established 12, 14, and 18 independent RCS cell lines for SV40-Pur/WT, SV40-Pur/11Psub, and SV40-Pur/11Pdel transgenes, respectively. Total RNAs were extracted from each transgenic cell and subjected to real-time RT-PCR to analyze the relative expression levels of rat Col11a2, rat Rxrb, human COL11A2, and human RXRB mRNAs. We normalized the quantified individual RNA expression levels of rat Col11a2 and rat Rxrb to the respective rat Gapdh expression levels, and those of human COL11A2 and human RXRB were normalized to the respective puromycin expression levels. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1.Production and Genotyping of Transgenic Mouse Lines— BAC transgene constructs (WT-LacZ, 11Psub-LacZ, 11Pdel-LacZ, and RX4sub-LacZ) were purified with the Qiagen large construct kit (Qiagen, number 12462), following the manufacturer's instructions. The BAC DNA constructs were linearized by digestion with PacI. The linearized transgenes (2–5 ng/μl) in injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) were microinjected into fertilized ova (supplemental Fig. S2). Founder embryos at E13.5 were sacrificed and genotyped with three sets of PCR primers (JM281/JM282, JM283/JM284, and NT418/419) located at both ends and the middle of the linearized BAC transgene DNA. The primers are listed in supplemental Table S4.RESULTSDifferent Expression Patterns between the Rxrb and the Col11a2 Genes—To delineate differences in the transcriptional activities of Rxrb and Col11a2 in various tissues, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs of these genes in samples from identical tissues or cells. Northern hybridization analysis on tissue samples showed that Col11a2 mRNAs were abundant in limb buds but not in the intestine, brain, liver, or lung of mouse embryos at 16.5 days postcoitus (Fig. 1A). The Rxrb mRNAs were clearly detected in all of these tissues. Northern hybridization analysis on cultured cells showed that Col11a2 mRNA was abundant in RCS but not in L6 (rat skeletal muscle), FR (rat fibroblast), PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma), and H4IIE (rat hepatoma) cells. The Rxrb mRNAs were clearly detected in all these cells except for the RCS cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis on cultured cells revealed that relative mRNA expression levels of Col11a2 to Gapdh were much higher in RCS as compared with the levels in L6, FR, PC12, and H4IIE cells (Fig. 1B). The relative mRNA expression levels of Rxrb were low in RCS cells as compared with the levels in other cells. In situ hybridization performed on semi-serial sections showed that Col11a2 mRNA was highly and specifically expressed in cartilage (Fig. 1C). Rxrb mRNA was detected in various tissues, with abundant expression in muscle. Signals for Rxrb mRNA were present in cartilage; these signals were weak compared with the signals in other tissues. In summary, we confirmed the previous reports that the Col11a2 gene was transcribed specifically in cartilage. We found that Rxrb was expressed in a variety of tissues; interestingly, Rxrb was weakly expressed in cartilage.Lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 are more highly acetylated in the neighborhood of transcriptionally active promoters and enhancers than those in regions of transcriptional inactivity (30Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We examined the acetylation levels and patterns of histone H3 from the Rxrb to Col11a2 genes using RCS and L6 cells (Fig. 2A). A ChIP assay with anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody showed that the promoter region of Rxrb and the promoter and first intron regions of Col11a2 were hyperacetylated as compared with other regions in RCS cells. Acetylation levels of histone H3 were low except for the promoter region of Rxrb in L6 cells; these results are consistent with the expression levels of Rxrb and Col11a2 in L6 cells.FIGURE 2Histone H3 acetylation at Rxrb/Col11a2 loci and the enhancer activities of the 1st intron of Col11a2 to heterologous promoters. A, histone H3 acetylation across the Rxrb/Col11a2 genes. The graphs show the relative chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 from RCS cells (top) and L6 cells (middle). Co-immunoprecipitating sequences were detected by using real-time RT-PCR. The bottom section shows the name and position of primer pairs and FRET probes used for analysis. To locate the primer position, the translational start site of Col11a2 was set as +1. Error bars indicate mean ± S.D. (n = 3). B–D, transgenic mice bearing the LacZ reporter gene constructs driven by the Col11a2 enhancer linked to a heterologous promoter. B, four of eight AD-LacZ transgenic founder embryos with LacZ expression are shown. C, we obtained six AD-LacZ-Int transgenic founder embryos with LacZ expression. Four embryos showed cartilage-specific LacZ expression (4, 8, 19, and 22), and 2 embryos showed LacZ expression in other tissues (9 and 27). D, we obtained 4 Nf-LacZ-Int transgenic founder embryos with LacZ expression. Three embryos showed cartilage-specific LacZ expression (2, 17, and 19), and 1 embryo showed LacZ expression in various tissues including cartilage (12).
