https://openalex.org/W1982756399,"Periodic band precipitation in porous media is explained by means of the Hirsch effect (specific semipermeability of the precipitate occurring only as long as both the precipitate-forming ions are present). The possibility of getting Liesegang bands in immunological precipitates is underlined, and a suggestion is made how to avoid them."

https://openalex.org/W2037397397,A new determination has been made of the half-life of the beta emitter sulfur-35. Approximately 400 measurements were taken over a period of a year and a half. These data were corrected for the dead time of the counter and then treated statistically. The half-life was found to be 86.35 +/- 0.17 days.

https://openalex.org/W1963839862,"IN 1907 Fischer and Massenez (Z. anorg. Chem., 52, 202, 1907) obtained a concentration of 17 per cent. by weight of ozone when they electrolysed a solution of sulphuric acid, using a very high current density. Since ozone can be produced by this method, it would seem probable that a high current density at the cathode might aid in producing the ozone form of hydrogen. When a solution of sulphuric acid is electrolysed, using the above principle, the hydrogen that escapes at the cathode contains an active con stituent which combines with pure nitrogen to form ammonia. Some of the ammonia formed is collected in the absorption bulb, but quite a large portion of it remains dissolved in the sulphuric acid solution. This active constituent in the hydrogen that is evolved at the cathode is probably the ozone form, and is produced perhaps in a manner analogous to the ozone form of oxygen. The per cent. of the active gas formed varies with the current density and the concentration of the acid."

https://openalex.org/W2043427031,"the existence of filter-passing bacterial variants capable of reproducing themselves in such a form as true morphologic entities. He also claims to have effected the reversion of this filter-passing form, in its well established state, to the parent form, although adequate experimental details have not been published. In brief, Kendall's procedure consists in growing the nonfiltrable form of an organism in a special medium prepared from hog intestine which (according to Kendall) is free from products of protein degeneration, particularly peptones. Inoculation of the filtrate of such a culture into the usual peptone broth and into fresh peptone-free medium results, he reported, in the development of turbidity only in the latter after twenty-four hours. A filtrate of this, inoculated into his peptone-free medium, again produces turbidity. This procedure may be repeated indefinitely. Regarding the behavior of the peptone broth inoculated with these filtrates, Kendall firstla stated that there was no evidence of bacterial growth. Later lc he observed that the first few tubes in the series showed bacterial growth, which diminished as a result of repeated passage and filtration in the peptone-free medium, the organism finally losing altogether its ability to grow in the peptone-containing medium. A more detailed discussion of Kendall's medium, his experimental procedure, and our attempts to repeat these observations follow:"
