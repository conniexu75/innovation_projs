https://openalex.org/W3193999063,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital areas is of a particular concern, since the close interaction between health care personnel and patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which allows virus to be easily spread between them and subsequently to their families and communities. Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel is essential to reduce the frequency of infections and outbreaks during the pandemic considering that they work in high-risk areas. In this research, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were tested in vitro and shown to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cultured cells. Subsequently, we assess the effects of mouthwash and nose rinse with ARGOVIT® silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in health workers consider as high-risk group of acquiring the infection in the General Tijuana Hospital, Mexico, a hospital for the exclusive recruitment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We present a prospective randomized study of 231 participants that was carried out for 9 weeks (during the declaration of a pandemic). The ""experimental"" group was instructed to do mouthwash and nose rinse with the AgNPs solution; the ""control"" group was instructed to do mouthwashes and nose rinse in a conventional way. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower in the ""experimental"" group (two participants of 114, 1.8%) compared to the ""control"" group (thirty-three participants of 117, 28.2%), with an 84.8% efficiency. We conclude that the mouth and nasal rinse with AgNPs helps in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health personnel who are exposed to patients diagnosed with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3193702746,"Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues' retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98)-which alleged that the MMR vaccine can cause children to develop autism-as a primary cause of US vaccine skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98's publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect.We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major television and newspaper outlets.AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98's publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01).Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR.Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines. We conclude by offering several recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence."
https://openalex.org/W3193828926,"The educational integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been put to the test because of the need to implement «emergency remote education» as a result of COVID-19. Within this context of uncertainty («viral modernity»), flexible education is an option to promote a more just, equitable, accessible and creative educational system. In order to properly interpret the effects of this unique educational circumstance, it is essential to study the previous situation in terms of the use of digital technologies in teaching practices. The objective of the study is to describe the educational integration of ICT and the teacher education model to obtain evidence that contributes to understanding the phenomenon. To this end, a questionnaire consisting of two self-reporting tools and a scale on the description of teaching practice with ICT was applied. The sample is made up of teachers from public primary and secondary schools (N = 251). Data collection was carried out in the months prior to the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A univariate analysis of the variables and contrast tests of non-parametric hypotheses was carried out, along with calculation of the reliability and construction validity of the measuring instruments. The results reveal the most frequent types of teaching practice with ICT and the spaces where digital technologies are commonly used. Various weaknesses can be identified in digital competence among teachers, as well as in the initial/continuing training model, which contribute to the understanding of the difficulties encountered during ""emergency remote education"". Participation in ICT didactic innovation projects and the performance of ICT Coordination are associated with more experiential training. Flexible education requires a redefinition of the teacher training model that encourages learning anywhere, anytime."
https://openalex.org/W3194828042,"The rising demand for popcorn necessitates improving the popping quality with higher yield of popcorn cultivars. Towards this direction several Quantitative Traits Loci (QTLs) for popping traits have been identified. However, identification of accurate and consistent QTLs across different genetic backgrounds and environments is necessary to effectively utilize the identified QTLs in marker-assisted breeding. In the current study, 99 QTLs related to popping traits reported in 8 different studies were assembled and projected on the reference map ""Genetic 2005"" using BioMercator v4.2 to identify metaQTLs with consistent QTLs. Total ten metaQTLs were identified on chromosome 1 (7 metaQTLs) and 6 (3 metaQTLs) with physical distance ranging between 0.43 and 12.75 Mb, respectively. Four identified metaQTLs, viz., mQTL1_1, mQTL1_5, mQTL1_7 and mQTL6_2 harboured 5-8 QTL clusters with moderately high R2 value. The clustered QTLs were from two or more experiments. Based on the expression pattern in endosperm and pericarp tissues, a total of 229 genes were selected. Nineteen of these genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Of the 19 genes specifically involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 11 of them were in these regions, implying the importance of these clustered QTLs. MetaQTL1_1 at bin location 1.01 coincided with the reported QTLs related to various agronomic traits like stalk diameter, tassel length, leaf area and plant height. The identified metaQTLs can be further explored for fine mapping and candidate gene identification, which can be validated by loss or gain of function. Identified metaQTLs can be used for introgression of popping traits towards enhancing the popping ability."
https://openalex.org/W3193906071,"Globally, the growing volume of waste tires and plastics has posed significant concerns about their sustainable and economical disposal. Pyrolysis provides a way for effective treatment and management of these wastes, enabling recovery of energy and produces solid pyrolytic char as a by-product. The use of pyrolytic chars in asphalt binder modification has recently gained significant interest among researchers. As asphalt binder aging influences the cracking, rutting, and moisture damage performance of asphalt binder and the mixtures, evaluation of aging characteristics of char modified asphalt binders is quite important. The main objective of this study is the investigation of the aging characteristics of asphalt binders modified with waste tire pyrolytic char (TPC) and waste plastic pyrolytic char (PPC) through rheological and spectroscopic evaluations. To imitate short-term and long-term aging conditions, the asphalt binders were first treated in a rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and then in a pressure aging vessel (PAV). The aging characteristics were determined using four rheological aging indices based on complex modulus (G*), phase angle (δ), zero shear viscosity (ZSV), and non-recoverable creep compliance ( J nr ) from multiple stress creep and recovery (MSCR) test. The fatigue cracking potential was then measured through binder yield energy test (BYET). These parameters were measured through a dynamic shear rheometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy analyses were then used to investigate changes in chemical composition due to aging in the char modified binders. Both TPC and PPC improved the high-temperature deformation resistance properties of asphalt binder. The TPC-modified binder showed better aging resistance than the control and PPC-modified binders, based on the different rheological and spectroscopic indices. The pyrolytic char modified binders also demonstrated good fatigue performance."
https://openalex.org/W3194905548,"Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety profiles of XEN implant versus trabeculectomy as a surgical intervention for primary glaucoma Methods A retrospective cohort study of mild to moderate stage glaucoma patients, who had undergone either XEN implantation or trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C, was performed in a tertiary eye center Results Fifty-seven eyes for XEN implant and 57 eyes for trabeculectomy with medically uncontrolled glaucoma were included. Preoperative IOP was 16–33 mmHg. Visual field mean deviation was -9.11±6.93 dB in XEN group, and -9.67±5.06 dB in trabeculectomy group (p = 0.195). At the 24-month timepoint, mean IOP was reduced from 21.6±4.0 to 14.6±3.5 mmHg (32.4% reduction) in the XEN group (p&lt;0.001), and from 22.5±5.8 to 12.5±4.1 mmHg (44.4% reduction) in the trabeculectomy group (p&lt;0.001). Final IOP in XEN was significantly higher than trabeculectomy (p = 0.008) with lesser mean IOP percentage reduction at month 24 (p = 0.045). Mean number of medications was reduced from 2.2±1.4 to 0.5±0.7 in XEN group (p&lt;0.001), and from 2.4±0.7 to 0.8±1.3 in trabeculectomy group (p&lt;0.001). Final number of medications was not different between the groups (p = 0.225). Surgical success was comparable between XEN and trabeculectomy group. Overall success was 71.4% vs. 73.3% (p = 0.850), and complete success was 62.9% vs. 62.2% (p = 0.954), respectively. XEN had lower rate of numerical hypotony than trabeculectomy. No serious complication occurred in either procedure group. Conclusion At 24 months, XEN showed a rate of success comparable to that of trabeculectomy. Although XEN had a higher final IOP than trabeculectomy, XEN achieved 32% IOP reduction, and achieved final IOP in mid-teen level. No serious complication occurred in either group. XEN can be applied for treatment of mild to moderate stages of glaucoma in Southeast Asian patients."
https://openalex.org/W3193450360,"Social distancing measures implemented by governments worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic have proven an effective intervention to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people’s accounts on their behaviours in a sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (May 1–31, 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (August 5 –September 21, 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken.681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual’s control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was reported by interviewees as, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, environmental constraints, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence was statistically associated with and reported as lack of trust in Government, support from friends, and lack of knowledge about rules. In addition, interviewees reported individual risk assessment and decision making on the extent to following the rules, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area. Our findings indicate that unintentional and intentional non-adherence should be improved by Government partnerships with local communities to build trust in social distancing measures; tailored messaging to young adults emphasising the need of protecting others whilst clarifying the risk of transmission; and ensuring COVID-secured environments by working with environmental health officers."
https://openalex.org/W3193998270,"Three new uranyl complexes [(UO2)(OAc)2(CMZ)], [(UO2)(OAc)2(MP)] and [(UO2)(OAc)2(SCZ)] were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, powder XRD analysis, and molar conductivity. The IR analysis confirmed binding to the metal ion by the sulfur and ethoxy oxygen atoms in the carbimazole (CMZ) ligand, while in the 6-mercaptopurine (MP) ligand, the sulfur and the N7 nitrogen atom of a purine coordinated binding to the metal ion. The third ligand showed a 1:1 molar ratio and bound via sulfonamide oxygen and the nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring. Analysis of the synthesized complexes also showed that acetate groups had monodentate binding to the (UO22+). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP level showed similar structures to the experimental results. Theoretical quantum parameters predicted the reactivity of the complexes in the order, [(UO2)(OAc)2(SCZ)] > [(UO2)(OAc)2(MP)]> [(UO2)(OAc)2(CMZ)]. DNA binding studies revealed that [(UO2)(OAc)2(SCZ)] and [(UO2)(OAc)2(CMZ)] have the highest binding constant (Kb) among the uranyl complexes. Additionally, strong binding of the MP and CMZ metal complexes to human serum albumin (HSA) were observed by both absorbance and fluorescence approaches. The antibacterial activity of the complexes was also evaluated against four bacterial strains: two gram-negative; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, and two gram-positive; Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. [(UO2)(OAc)2(MP)] had the greatest antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumonia, the gram-positive bacteria, with even higher activity than the standard antibiotic. In vitro cytotoxicity tests were also performed against three human cancer lines, and revealed the most cytotoxic complexes to be [(UO2)(OAc)2(SCZ)], which showed moderate activity against a colon cancer cell line. Thus, uranyl addition enhances the antibacterial and anticancer properties of the free ligands."
https://openalex.org/W3194668021,"Background Cardiac injury associated with cytokine release frequently occurs in SARS-CoV-2 mediated coronavirus disease (COVID19) and mortality is particularly high in these patients. The mechanistic role of the COVID19 associated cytokine-storm for the concomitant cardiac dysfunction and associated arrhythmias is unclear. Moreover, the role of anti-inflammatory therapy to mitigate cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. Aims and methods We investigated the effects of COVID19-associated inflammatory response on cardiac cellular function as well as its cardiac arrhythmogenic potential in rat and induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM). In addition, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IL-1β antagonist Canakinumab using state of the art in-vitro confocal and ratiometric high-throughput microscopy. Results Isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were exposed to control or COVID19 serum from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe ARDS and impaired cardiac function (LVEF 41±5%; 1/3 of patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CK 154±43 U/l). Rat cardiomyocytes showed an early increase of myofilament sensitivity, a decrease of Ca 2+ transient amplitudes and altered baseline [Ca 2+ ] upon exposure to patient serum. In addition, we used iPS-CM to explore the long-term effect of patient serum on cardiac electrical and mechanical function. In iPS-CM, spontaneous Ca 2+ release events were more likely to occur upon incubation with COVID19 serum and nuclear as well as cytosolic Ca 2+ release were altered. Co-incubation with Canakinumab had no effect on pro-arrhythmogenic Ca 2+ release or Ca 2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling, nor significantly influenced cellular automaticity. Conclusion Serum derived from COVID19 patients exerts acute cardio-depressant and chronic pro-arrhythmogenic effects in rat and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Canakinumab had no beneficial effect on cellular Ca 2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling. The presented method utilizing iPS-CM and in-vitro Ca 2+ imaging might serve as a novel tool for precision medicine. It allows to investigate cytokine related cardiac dysfunction and pharmacological approaches useful therein."
https://openalex.org/W3194734118,"Background Provision of donor human milk is handled by established human milk banks that implement all required measures to ensure its safety and quality. Detailed human milk banking guidelines on a European level are currently lacking, while the information available on the actual practices followed by the European human milk banks, remains limited. The aim of this study was to collect detailed data on the actual milk banking practices across Europe with particular emphasis on the practices affecting the safety and quality of donor human milk. Materials and methods A web-based questionnaire was developed by the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA) Survey Group, for distribution to the European human milk banks. The questionnaire included 35 questions covering every step from donor recruitment to provision of donor human milk to each recipient. To assess the variation in practices, all responses were then analyzed for each country individually and for all human milk banks together. Results A total of 123 human milk banks completed the questionnaire, representing 85% of the European countries that have a milk bank. Both inter- and intra-country variation was documented for most milk banking practices. The highest variability was observed in pasteurization practices, storage and milk screening, both pre- and post-pasteurization. Conclusion We show that there is a wide variability in milk banking practices across Europe, including practices that could further improve the efficacy of donor human milk banking. The findings of this study could serve as a tool for a global discussion on the efficacy and development of additional evidence-based guidelines that could further improve those practices."
https://openalex.org/W3195956812,"The spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistant parasites remains one of the major challenges for malaria control and elimination in Sub Saharan Africa. Monitoring of molecular markers conferring resistance to different antimalarials is important to track the spread of resistant parasites and to optimize the therapeutic lifespan of current drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of known mutations in the drug resistance genes Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr and Pfdhps in two different epidemiological settings in Cameroon. Dried blood spots collected in 2018 and 2019 from asymptomatic individuals were used for DNA extraction and then the Plasmodium infection status was determined byPCR. Detection of SNPs was performed by nested PCR followed by allele-specific restriction analysis (ASRA). The prevalence of each genotype was compared between sites using the Chi square and Fisher's exact tests. A high prevalence of the Pfcrt K76 wild type allele was found in both sites (88.5 and 62.29% respectively; P< 0,0001). The prevalence of Pfmdr1 mutations 86Y and 1246Y was respectively 55.83 and 1.45% in Mfou and 45.87 and 5.97% in Tibati, with significant difference between the studied areas (P<0.0001). Overall, the Pfdhfr triple-mutant genotype (51I/59R/108N) was highly prevalent (> 96%), however no SNP was detected at codon 164. In Pfdhps, the prevalence of the 437G mutation reached (90%) and was at higher frequency in Mfou (P< 0.0001). Overall, the Pfdhps mutations 540E and 581G were less common (0.33 and 3.26%, respectively). The quadruple resistant genotype (Pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N+Pfdhp437G) was found almost 90% of the samples. The wild-type genotype (Pfdhfr N51/C59/S108/164I+Pfdhps A437/K540/A581) was never identified and the sextuple mutant (Pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N+Pfdhp437G/540E/581G), kwon as super resistant appeared in two samples from Tibati. These findings demonstrate declining trends in the prevalence of mutations conferring resistance to 4-aminoquinolines, especially to chloroquine. However, a high level of mutations in P. falciparum genes related to SP resistance was detected and this raises concerns about the future efficacy of IPTp-SP and SMC in Cameroon."
https://openalex.org/W3193889783,"The use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock remained controversial due to the paucity of data.The retrospective case-control study included 671 adult patients who presented to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital from January 01, 2017 to December 31, 2019 with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were categorized into the CHF group and the non-CHF group. The primary outcome was to evaluate the compliance with ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus within 6 hours of presentation. The comparison of baseline characteristics and secondary outcomes were done between the groups who received ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus. For the subgroup analysis of the CHF group, it was divided based on if they received ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus or not, and comparison was done for baseline characteristics and secondary outcomes. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to explore the differences between the groups for in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation.The use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus was low in both the CHF and non-CHF groups [39% vs. 66% (p<0.05)]. Mortality was higher in the CHF group [33% vs 18% (p<0.05)]. Multivariable analysis revealed that the use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus decreased the chances of mortality by 12% [OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.95 (p<0.05)]. The use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus did not increase the odds of mechanical ventilation [OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.05 (p = 0.78)]. In subgroup analysis, the use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus decreased the chances of mortality by 5% [OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99, (p<0.05)] and did not increase the odds of mechanical ventilation. The presence of the low ejection fraction did not influence the chance of getting fluid bolus.The use of ≥30 mL/Kg fluid bolus seems to confer protection against in-hospital mortality and is not associated with increased chances of mechanical ventilation in heart failure patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W3194844456,"Young adults receive health screenings at lower rates than other age groups, and it may be difficult to detect diseases in the early stages for this group. We examined differences in health status relative to smoking in a young age group using the results of health screenings conducted in engaged and newly married couples in a cross-sectional database.The participants in this study were 808 young adults who visited a municipal hospital health screening center from July 2017 to March 2019. They completed a self-administered questionnaire, and physical measurements and a blood test were taken. They were classified into non-cigarette smokers, past cigarette smokers, and current cigarette smokers according to smoking behavior. In this study, we compared metabolic syndrome, the main components of which include obesity, high blood pressure, high blood triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol and insulin resistance, with smoking behavior.The mean age of the participants was 30.9±3.3 years (males 32.0±3.2, females 29.8±3.1), and 13.9% were current cigarette smokers (males 22.8%, females 5.1%). The proportion of men in their 30s was 76.6% for male group and 50.0% for female group, indicating that the male group had a relatively higher proportion of older and current smokers. Significant differences were found in age, sex, blood pressure, metabolic abnormalities, and drinking status according to smoking status. Cigarette smokers had a 2.4-fold greater risk of metabolic syndrome (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-3.96) than non-cigarette smokers; in particular, they had a 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.44-4.55) greater risk of hypertriglyceridemia and a three-fold (95% CI, 1.45-6.35) greater risk of low HDL cholesterol.In comparison with non-single, young and generally healthy city dwellers, the risk of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers, and in particular, it was confirmed that the risk of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterolemia was higher. Smoking cessation is necessary, even for the young, because smoking may cause changes in blood lipids even if the smoking duration is short."

The force analysis of large bus in slope-curve section was carried out, and the mechanical equations of large bus under the limit conditions of sideslip and rollover in slope-curve section were established. TruckSim simulation test platform was used to establish a three-dimensional road model and large bus mechanical model at a design speed of 100 km/h. Input parameters, such as cross-wind speed and road friction coefficient, simulate the impact of wind-rain/snow coupling. Under the combined action of wind-rain/snow, the operation test of large bus in slope-curve section was carried out, and the key parameters and indicators of the sideslip and rollover of large bus in slope-curve section were outputted and analyzed. The sudden change point of lateral acceleration is the judging condition for sideslip of large bus in slope-curve section under different road friction coefficient (0.2-0.7), changing from 0.15m/s2 and stabilizing to 0.52 m/s2, and a 0N vertical reaction force of the inner tire is the critical judging condition for rollover under road friction coefficient0.8, and the operating speed thresholds were proposed under different road friction coefficient. This study is expected to provide theoretical support for the speed limit of large bus in slope-curve section under adverse weather."
https://openalex.org/W3194048007,"The transcription factor Nkx3.2 (Bapx1) is an important chondrocyte maturation inhibitor. Previous Nkx3.2 knockdown and overexpression studies in non-mammalian gnathostomes have focused on its role in primary jaw joint development, while the function of this gene in broader skeletal development is not fully described. We generated a mutant allele of nkx3.2 in zebrafish with CRISPR/Cas9 and applied a range of techniques to characterize skeletal phenotypes at developmental stages from larva to adult, revealing loss of the jaw joint, fusions in bones of the occiput, morphological changes in the Weberian apparatus, and the loss or deformation of bony elements derived from basiventral cartilages of the vertebrae. Axial phenotypes are reminiscent of Nkx3.2 knockout in mammals, suggesting that the function of this gene in axial skeletal development is ancestral to osteichthyans. Our results highlight the broad role of nkx3.2 in zebrafish skeletal development and its context-specific functions in different skeletal elements."
https://openalex.org/W3195376470,"Organic anion-transporting polypeptides, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 are multispecific membrane proteins mediating the hepatocellular uptake of structurally diverse endo- and exogenous compounds, including various kinds of drugs. Co-administration of OATP1B/2B1 substrates may lead to altered pharmacokinetics or even toxicity. Therefore, the study of the interaction with these OATPs is essential in drug development and is recommended by international regulatory agencies, the FDA, EMA, and PMDA. In general, radiolabeled indicators are used to measure drug interactions of OATPs, and, lately, fluorescent probes are also gaining wider application in OATP tests. However, all of the currently available methods (either radioactive or fluorescence-based) comprise multiple steps, including the removal of the indicator in the end of the experiment. Hence, they are not ideally suited for high-throughput screening. In the current study, in order to find an indicator allowing real-time assessment of hepatic OATP function, we searched for an activatable fluorogenic OATP substrate. Here, we show that 8-acetoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (Ace), a fluorogenic derivative of the hepatic OATP substrate pyranine (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate) enters the cells via OATP1B1/3 or OATP2B1 function. In living cells, Ace is then converted into highly fluorescent pyranine, allowing “no-wash” measurement of OATP function and drug interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ace can be used in an indirect assay termed as competitive counterflow suitable to distinguish between transported substrates and inhibitors of OATP1B1. The fluorescence-based methods described here are unique and open the way toward high-throughput screening of interactions between new molecular entities and OATPs."
https://openalex.org/W3196198785,"In this era of globalization, airline transportation has greatly increased international trade and travel within the World Airport Network (WAN). Unfortunately, this convenience has expanded the scope of infectious disease spread from a local to a worldwide occurrence. Thus, scholars have proposed several methods to measure the distances between airports and define the relationship between the distances and arrival times of infectious diseases in various countries. However, such studies suffer from the following limitations. (1) Only traditional statistical methods or graphical representations were utilized to show that the effective distance performed better than the geographical distance technique. Researchers seldom use the survival model to quantify the actual differences among arrival times via various distance methods. (2) Although scholars have found that most diseases tend to spread via the random walk rather than the shortest path method, this hypothesis may no longer be true because the network has been severally altered due to recent COVID-related travel reductions. Therefore, we used 2017 IATA (International Air Transport Association) to establish an airline network via various chosen path strategies (random walk and shortest path). Then, we employed these two networks to quantify each model’s predictive performance in order to estimate the importation probability function of COVID-19 into various countries. The effective distance model was found to more accurately predict arrival dates of COVID-19 than the geographical distance model. However, if pre-Covid airline data is included, the path of disease spread might not follow the random walk theory due to recent flight suspensions and travel restrictions during the epidemic. Lastly, when testing effective distance, the inverse distance survival model and the Cox model yielded very similar importation risk estimates. The results can help authorities design more effective international epidemic prevention and control strategies."

In early 2021, an epidemiologic survey highlighted the coinfection adenoviruses with other viruses (orthoreovirus infection) as being particularly deleterious within the poultry industry. Here, we investigated the Loop L1 HVR1-4 region of the hexon gene with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) designation and RSCU inclusive of all the mutations.

https://openalex.org/W3195688285,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of respiratory airflow have the potential to change the clinical assessment of regional airway function in health and disease, in pulmonary medicine and otolaryngology. For example, in diseases where multiple sites of airway obstruction occur, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CFD simulations can identify which sites of obstruction contribute most to airway resistance and may therefore be candidate sites for airway surgery. The main barrier to clinical uptake of respiratory CFD to date has been the difficulty in validating CFD results against a clinical gold standard. Invasive instrumentation of the upper airway to measure respiratory airflow velocity or pressure can disrupt the airflow and alter the subject's natural breathing patterns. Therefore, in this study, we instead propose phase contrast (PC) velocimetry magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas as a non-invasive reference to which airflow velocities calculated via CFD can be compared. To that end, we performed subject-specific CFD simulations in airway models derived from 1H MRI, and using respiratory flowrate measurements acquired synchronously with MRI. Airflow velocity vectors calculated by CFD simulations were then qualitatively and quantitatively compared to velocity maps derived from PC velocimetry MRI of inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas. The results show both techniques produce similar spatial distributions of high velocity regions in the anterior-posterior and foot-head directions, indicating good qualitative agreement. Statistically significant correlations and low Bland-Altman bias between the local velocity values produced by the two techniques indicates quantitative agreement. This preliminary in vivo comparison of respiratory airway CFD and PC MRI of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas demonstrates the feasibility of PC MRI as a technique to validate respiratory CFD and forms the basis for further comprehensive validation studies. This study is therefore a first step in the pathway towards clinical adoption of respiratory CFD."
https://openalex.org/W3195885927,"Although low skeletal muscle mass has an adverse impact on the treatment outcomes of cancer patients, whether the relationship between preoperative skeletal muscle mass and gastrectomy outcomes in gastric cancer (GC) differs between men and women is unclear. The study aimed to clarify this relationship based on gender.Between January 2007 and December 2015, 1054 patients who underwent gastrectomy for GC at Osaka City General Hospital were enrolled in this study. We evaluated sarcopenia by the skeletal muscle index (SMI), which was measured by computed tomography (CT) using areas of muscle in the third lumbar vertebral body (L3). Male and female patients were each divided into two groups (low skeletal muscle and high skeletal muscle).The SMI emerged as an independent predictor of 5-year overall survival (OS) in male GC patients (Hazard ratio 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73-3.63, p < 0.001) based on multivariate analysis. However, this index was not an independent predictive determinant of 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS). The SMI was not an independent predictor of either OS or CSS in female GC patients. The incidence of leakage and major complication (Clavien Dindo grade ≧ 3) did not differ significantly across groups.Preoperative skeletal muscle mass is a valuable prognostic predictor of OS in male GC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3194883049,"Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is the core element of health-related physical fitness evaluation. High pressure and low oxygen in Tibet (over 3,500 m above sea level) may negatively impact the residents' CRF. The 20-m shuttle run test (20mSRT) is the most popular field-based assessment and estimate of CRF in children and adolescents worldwide. However, normative CRF data for the children and adolescents residing in China's plateau region are unavailable, which prevents comparability among those living at high-altitudes around the world.To measure the CRF of Chinese children and adolescents aged 9-18 years living in Tibet at altitudes exceeding 3,500 m, and to identify correlations between this metric and demographic characteristics (age, sex, and ethnicity). These data were then compared with those generated in the lowland (Shanghai, China) and various global regions.20mSRT performance (number of completed laps) and predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) were used as indicators of CRF. We measured the CRF of 1,717 healthy children and adolescents aged 9-18 years living in Tibet. The CRF data from school-age subjects in Shanghai (2,437 boys and 2,396 girls) and worldwide (1,142,026 students from 50 countries/regions in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania) were collated from published papers.The average CRF of the participants from Tibet was 39.8 mL/kg/min. The male subjects (n = 876; 41.1 ± 4.42 mL/kg/min) had a higher average CRF than their female counterparts (n = 841; 37.8 ± 5.40 mL/kg/min). CRF decreased with age in both sexes at statistical significance (F = 1249.9, p for trend 0.05). The indigenous Tibetans (n = 1289; 40.1 ± 3.71 mL/kg/min) had a significant higher average CRF than those of Han descent (n = 394; 38.9 ± 4.70 mL/kg/min) (p < 0.05).Children and adolescents aged 7-18 years residing above 3,500 m in Tibet displayed lower CRF traits compared with their counterparts from the plains area and other high altitude places. CRF varied according to age, sex, and ethnic group. Given the importance of CRF in children and adolescents, effective intervention strategies should be implemented to improve CRF in children and adolescents on the plateau."
https://openalex.org/W3195306940,"Desminopathy is the most common intermediate filament disease in humans. The most frequent mutation causing desminopathy in patients is a R350P DES missense mutation. We have developed a rat model with an analogous mutation in R349P Des. To investigate the role of R349P Des in mechanical loading, we stimulated the sciatic nerve of wild-type littermates (WT) (n = 6) and animals carrying the mutation (MUT) (n = 6) causing a lengthening contraction of the dorsi flexor muscles. MUT animals showed signs of ongoing regeneration at baseline as indicated by a higher number of central nuclei (genotype: P < .0001). While stimulation did not impact central nuclei, we found an increased number of IgG positive fibers (membrane damage indicator) after eccentric contractions with both genotypes (stimulation: P < .01). Interestingly, WT animals displayed a more pronounced increase in IgG positive fibers with stimulation compared to MUT (interaction: P < .05). In addition to altered histology, molecular signaling on the protein level differed between WT and MUT. The membrane repair protein dysferlin decreased with eccentric loading in WT but increased in MUT (interaction: P < .05). The autophagic substrate p62 was increased in both genotypes with loading (stimulation: P < .05) but tended to be more elevated in WT (interaction: P = .05). Caspase 3 levels, a central regulator of apoptotic cell death, was increased with stimulation in both genotypes (stimulation: P < .01) but more so in WT animals (interaction: P < .0001). Overall, our data indicate that R349P Des rats have a lower susceptibility to structural muscle damage of the cytoskeleton and sarcolemma with acute eccentric loading."
https://openalex.org/W3193336686,"Background Public health policies with varying degrees of restriction have been imposed around the world to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the implementation of government policies and the Nowruz holidays on the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, using an intervention time series analysis. Methods Daily data on COVID-19 cases registered between February 19 and May 2, 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO)’s website. Using an intervention time series modeling, the effect of two government policies on the number of confirmed cases were evaluated, namely the closing of schools and universities, and the implementation of social distancing measures. Furthermore, the effect of the Nowruz holidays as a non-intervention factor for the spread of COVID-19 was also analyzed. Results The results showed that, after the implementation of the first intervention, i.e., the closing of universities and schools, no statistically significant change was found in the number of new confirmed cases. The Nowruz holidays was followed by a significant increase in new cases (1,872.20; 95% CI, 1,257.60 to 2,476.79; p&lt;0.001)), while the implementation of social distancing measures was followed by a significant decrease in such cases (2,182.80; 95% CI, 1,556.56 to 2,809.04; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The Nowruz holidays and the implementation of social distancing measures in Iran were related to a significant increase and decrease in COVID-19 cases, respectively. These results highlight the necessity of measuring the effect of health and social interventions for their future implementations."
https://openalex.org/W3194167741,"Different factitious hosts were used to mass rear Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead in different parts of the globe because thorough details were lacking in both the laboratory and the field. The objective of this study was to compare, parasitoid, T. japonicum reared in different factitious hosts. Three commonly used factitious host eggs, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton), Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and Sitotroga cerealella Olivier were tested under laboratory conditions and then in the field over a yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulus (Walker) of rice. The highest parasitism by T. japonicum was observed on E. kuehniella eggs. The parasitoid's highest emergence (88.99%) was observed on S. cerealella eggs at 24 h exposure, whereas at 48 h it was on E. kuehniella eggs (94.66%). Trichogramma japonicum females that emerged from E. kuehniella eggs were significantly long-lived. The days of oviposition by hosts and the host species were significant individually, but not their interaction. Higher proportions of flying T. japonicum were observed when reared on E. kuehniella and C. cephalonica eggs. Field results showed that T. japonicum mass-reared on E. kuehniella showed higher parasitism of its natural host, S. incertulus eggs. Hence, by considering these biological characteristics and field results, E. kuehniella could be leveraged for the mass rearing of quality parasitoids of T. japonicum in India, the Asian continent and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3195408272,"The accurate prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses (ADIs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has not been well investigated. Hence, a longitudinal nationwide surveillance study analyzing the current status and national trend of opportunistic complications in HIV-infected patients in Japan is warranted.A nationwide surveillance of opportunistic complications in HIV-infected patients from 1995 to 2017 in Japan was conducted. An annual questionnaire was sent to 383 HIV/AIDS referral hospitals across Japan to collect information (CD4+ lymphocyte count, time of onset, outcome, and antiretroviral therapy [ART] status) of patients diagnosed with any of 23 ADIs between 1995 and 2017.The response and case capture rates of the questionnaires in 2017 were 53% and 76%, respectively. The number of reported cases of opportunistic complications peaked in 2011 and subsequently declined. Pneumocystis pneumonia (38.7%), cytomegalovirus infection (13.6%), and candidiasis (12.8%) were associated with the cumulative incidence of ADIs between 1995 and 2017. The mortality rate in HIV-infected patients with opportunistic complications substantially decreased to 3.6% in 2017. The mortality rate was significantly higher in HIV patients who received ART within 14 days of diagnosis of complications than in those who received ART 15 days after diagnosis (13.0% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.01).We have demonstrated a 23-year trend of a newly diagnosed AIDS status in Japan with high accuracy. The current data reveal the importance of Pneumocystis pneumonia as a first-onset illness and that early initiation of ART results in poor outcomes in HIV patients in Japan."

Based on 42 groundwater sampling points, a Piper diagram, the Shukarev classification, the Pearson correlation analysis, Gibbs plots and the ion proportional coefficient method are used to analyze the chemical characteristics and material source. The results show that the groundwater quality in the study area varies greatly from north to south. In the northern inland area (AREA I), the main anions and cations are <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi> <mml:mi>C</mml:mi> <mml:msubsup><mml:mi>O</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math> and Ca 2+ , and the hydrochemical characteristics are mainly HCO 3 − Ca , HCO 3 ⋅ SO 4 − Ca and HCO 3 − Mg . The ion concentration distribution is uniform, and the groundwater quality is good. By using Gibbs plots and the ion proportional coefficient method, the main source of ions is the dissolution of potassium feldspar, albite and carbonate rock. In contrast, in the southern coastal area (AREA II), the main anions and cations are Cl − and Na + , and the hydrochemical characteristics are mainly Cl − Na . The ion concentration distribution presents a strong spatial difference. The closer the groundwater sampling point is to seawater, the worse the overall groundwater quality. Evaporite dissolution, seawater intrusion, cation exchange effects and human activities are the main factors affecting the groundwater quality in this area. In conclusion, the groundwater quality in northern inland area (AREA I) is better, mainly controlled by the dissolution of rocks. The groundwater quality in southern coastal area (AREA II) changes greatly, mainly controlled by seawater."
https://openalex.org/W3193478905,"Host-associated microbes can interact with macro-organisms in a number of ways that affect host health. Few studies of host-associated microbiomes, however, focus on fungi. In addition, it is difficult to discern whether a fungal organism found in or on an ectotherm host is associating with it in a durable, symbiotic interaction versus a transient one, and to what extent the habitat and host share microbes. We seek to identify these host-microbe interactions on an amphibian, the Colorado boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas). We sequenced the ITS1 region of the fungal community on the skin of wild toads (n = 124) from four sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, across its physiologically dynamic developmental life stages. We also sampled the common habitats used by boreal toads: water from their natal wetland and aquatic pond sediment. We then examined diversity patterns within different life stages, between host and habitat, and identified fungal taxa that could be putatively host-associated with toads by using an indicator species analysis on toad versus environmental samples. Host and habitat were strikingly similar, with the exception of toad eggs. Post-hatching toad life stages were distinct in their various fungal diversity measures. We identified eight fungal taxa that were significantly associated with eggs, but no other fungal taxa were associated with other toad life stages compared with their environmental habitat. This suggests that although pre- and post-metamorphic toad life stages differ from each other, the habitat and host fungal communities are so similar that identifying obligate host symbionts is difficult with the techniques used here. This approach does, however, leverage sequence data from host and habitat samples to predict which microbial taxa are host-associated versus transient microbes, thereby condensing a large set of sequence data into a smaller list of potential targets for further consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3193700421,"Biological functions, including glycemic control and bone metabolism, are highly influenced by the body's internal clock. Circadian rhythms are biological rhythms that run with a period close to 24 hours and receive input from environmental stimuli, such as the light/dark cycle. We investigated the effects of circadian rhythm disruption (CRD), through alteration of the light/dark schedule, on glycemic control and bone quality of mice. Ten-week-old male mice (C57/BL6, n = 48) were given a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) and kept on a dayshift or altered schedule (RSS3) for 22 weeks. Mice were divided into four experimental groups (n = 12/group): Dayshift/LFD, Dayshift/HFD, RSS3/LFD, and RSS3/HFD. CRD in growing mice fed a HFD resulted in a diabetic state, with a 36.2% increase in fasting glucose levels compared to the Dayshift/LFD group. Micro-CT scans of femora revealed a reduction in inner and outer surface expansion for mice on a HFD and altered light schedule. Cancellous bone demonstrated deterioration of bone quality as trabecular number and thickness decreased while trabecular separation increased. While HFD increased cortical bone mineral density, its combination with CRD reduced this phenomenon. The growth of mineral crystals, determined by small angle X-ray scattering, showed HFD led to smaller crystals. Considering modifications of the organic matrix, regardless of diet, CRD exacerbated the accumulation of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (fAGEs) in collagen. Strength testing of tibiae showed that CRD mitigated the higher strength in the HFD group and increased brittleness indicated by lower post-yield deflection and work-to-fracture. Consistent with accumulation of fAGEs, various measures of toughness were lowered with CRD, but combination of CRD with HFD protected against this decrease. Differences between strength and toughness results represent different contributions of structural and material properties of bone to energy dissipation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that combination of CRD with HFD impairs glycemic control and have complex effects on bone quality."
https://openalex.org/W3194128221,"Andros Island, The Bahamas, composed of porous carbonate rock, has about 175 inland blue holes and over 50 known submerged ocean caves along its eastern barrier reef. These ocean blue holes can have both vertical and horizontal zones that penetrate under the island. Tidal forces drive water flow in and out of these caves. King Kong Cavern has a vertical collapse zone and a deep penetration under Andros Island that emits sulfidic, anoxic water and masses of thin, mucoid filaments ranging to meters in length and off-white turbid water during ebb flow. Our objective was to determine the microbial composition of this mucoid material and the unconsolidated water column turbidity based on the concept that they represent unique lithoautotrophic microbial material swept from the cave into the surrounding ocean. Bacterial DNA extracted from these filaments and surrounding turbid water was characterized using PCR that targeted a portion of the 16S rRNA gene. The genus Arcobacter dominated both the filaments and the water column above the cave entrance. Arcobacter nitrofigilis and Arcobacter sp. UDC415 in the mucoid filaments accounted for as much as 80% of mapped DNA reads. In the water column Arcobacter comprised from 65% to over 85% of the reads in the depth region from about 18 m to 34 m. Bacterial species diversity was much higher in surface water and in water deeper than 36 m than in the intermediate zone. Community composition indicates that ebb flow from the cavern influences the entire water column at least to within 6 m of the surface and perhaps the near surface as well."

The current study is aimed to study the Ethiopian women's level of knowledge on the mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and its associated factors using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey Data.Data of 15,683 women were extracted from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. Descriptive statistics and multilevel ordinal logistic regression were respectively used for the descriptive and analytical studies.41.1% [95% CI: 39.5%, 42.7%] of the Ethiopian reproductive-age women have adequate knowledge of the mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. 77%, 84% and 87.8% of the women respectively know that human immunodeficiency virus can be transmitted during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding. There are wider regional variations in the women's level of knowledge of the mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Being an urban resident, having better educational status, being from a wealthy household, owning of mobile phone, frequency of listening to the radio, frequency of watching television, and being visited with field workers were significantly associated with having adequate knowledge of the mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus.Despite all collective measures put in a place by different stakeholders to prevent the mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ethiopia, a large proportion of the Ethiopian women do not know about the mother-to-child transmission of the disease. Stakeholders working on HIV prevention and control should give due emphasis to promoting mobile phone technology and other media like radio and television by giving due focus to rural residents and poor women to promote the current low level of the knowledge. Emphasis should also be given to the information, education, and communication of the mother-to-child transmission of the disease through community-based educations."

The objective of this study was to investigate actual speeds of skiers on signposted groomed slopes and to measure their skill to accurately estimate them with regard to environmental conditions such as visibility, sky cover, snow quality, wind and temperature.The data were obtained from a sample of 421 adult recreational skiers taking ski courses. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between actual and estimated speed for all participants. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to measure the effect of environmental conditions on both the skiers' actual speeds and their errors of estimation. Values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance.The Pearson correlation coefficient between estimated and actual speed was 0.90 (P < 0.001). Skiers underestimated their actual speed on average by 13.06 km/h or 24.1%. Visibility, quality of snow and wind speed were shown to significantly affect both actual maximum speed and estimated speed. Good visibility, grippy snow and calm wind were associated with both the highest actual maximum speed and the lowest ability to estimate it.Certain environmental conditions are associated with the actual speed at which skiers travel and with their ability to estimate it. Visibility, quality of snow and wind speed seem to influence both actual speed and the ability to estimate it while sky cover and temperature do not. A reinforced understanding of skiing speed on signposted groomed slopes is useful to gain insight into crashes and the mechanisms of resulting injuries, to evaluate means of protection and to devise successful prevention policies in ski resorts."

Also, two cross-sectional studies were used as comparison (EpiHealth, LifeGene). PA was assessed by questionnaires on a four or five-level scale.Taking results from several samples into account, an increase in PA from middle-age up to 70 years was found in males, but not in females. Following age 70, a decline in PA was seen. Young adults reported both a higher proportion of sedentary behavior and a higher proportion high PA than the elderly. Females generally reported a lower PA at all ages. PA was mainly associated with serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol, but also weaker relationships with fasting glucose, blood pressure and BMI were found. These relationships were generally less strong in elderly subjects.Using data from multiple longitudinal samples the development of PA over the adult life span could be described in detail and the relationships between PA and cardiovascular risk factors were portrayed. In general, a higher or increased physical activity over time was associated with a more beneficial cardiovascular risk factor profile, especially lipid levels."

https://openalex.org/W3195280574,"Background Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increases adverse perinatal outcomes in women with the disorder. About 16% of all still births and 10% of early neonatal deaths are accounted by HDP. In Ethiopia, HDP complicates about 6% of all pregnancies. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes among women with HDP in Jimma Medical Center, southwest Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on a total of 777 women who gave birth from June 2017 to March 2020 at Jimma Medical Center, southwest Ethiopia. Women with HDP and normotensive women who gave birth at or after 28 weeks of gestation were enrolled as exposed and unexposed respectively. Simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were reviewed using structured data collection performa that was prepared after reviewing relevant literatures. Data were entered to Epi-Data then exported to STATA version 13 for analysis. The adverse perinatal outcomes risk were examined using log binomial and modified Poisson regression model with robust standard errors. Results In this study, the overall incidence of adverse perinatal outcome was higher among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) than normotensive women (64.1% versus 32.8%). After adjusting for confounders, women with HDP were at higher risk of babies with low birth weight (adjusted RR = 2.88 (2.2, 3.75)), preterm birth(aRR = 2.31(1.7, 3.14)), fifth minute low Apgar score (aRR = 2.6(1.53, 4.42)), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (aRR = 1.77(1.32, 2.37), stillbirth (aRR = 2.02(1.11, 3.01)), and perinatal mortality (aRR = 3.88(1.97, 7.66)) than normotensive women. Conclusion Women with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy were at higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes than normotensive women who gave birth at Jimma Medical Center, southwest Ethiopia. Therefore, health care providers should strengthen prevention, early diagnosis and prompt management of HDP in order to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3195508679,"The pepper resistance gene Bs3 triggers a hypersensitive response (HR) upon transcriptional activation by the corresponding effector protein AvrBs3 from the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas. Expression of Bs3 in yeast inhibited proliferation, demonstrating that Bs3 function is not restricted to the plant kingdom. The Bs3 sequence shows striking similarity to flavin monooxygenases (FMOs), an FAD- and NADPH-containing enzyme class that is known for the oxygenation of a wide range of substrates and their potential to produce H2O2. Since H2O2 is a hallmark metabolite in plant immunity, we analyzed the role of H2O2 during Bs3 HR. We purified recombinant Bs3 protein from E. coli and confirmed the FMO function of Bs3 with FAD binding and NADPH oxidase activity in vitro. Translational fusion of Bs3 to the redox reporter roGFP2 indicated that the Bs3-dependent HR induces an increase of the intracellular oxidation state in planta. To test if the NADPH oxidation and putative H2O2 production of Bs3 is sufficient to induce HR, we adapted previous studies which have uncovered mutations in the NADPH binding site of FMOs that result in higher NADPH oxidase activity. In vitro studies demonstrated that recombinant Bs3S211A protein has twofold higher NADPH oxidase activity than wildtype Bs3. Translational fusions to roGFP2 showed that Bs3S211A also increased the intracellular oxidation state in planta. Interestingly, while the mutant derivative Bs3S211A had an increase in NADPH oxidase capacity, it did not trigger HR in planta, ultimately revealing that H2O2 produced by Bs3 on its own is not sufficient to trigger HR."
https://openalex.org/W3193576904,"The xylan backbone of arabinoxylan (AX), the major cell wall polysaccharide in the wheat starchy endosperm, is synthesised by xylan synthase which is a complex of three subunits encoded by the GT43_1, GT43_2 and GT47_2 genes. RNAi knock-down of either GT43_1 or all three genes (triple lines) resulted in decreased AX measured by digestion with endoxylanase (to 33 and 34.9% of the controls) and by monosaccharide analysis (to 45.9% and 47.4% of the controls) with greater effects on the amount of water-extractable AX (to 20.6 and 19.9% of the controls). Both sets of RNAi lines also had greater decreases in the amounts of substituted oligosaccharides released by digestion of AX with endoxylanase than in fragments derived only from the xylan backbone. Although the GT43_1 and triple lines had similar effects on AX they did differ in their contents of soluble sugars (increased in triple only) and on grain size (decreased in triple only). Both sets of transgenic lines had decreased grain hardness, indicating effects on cell wall mechanics. These results, and previously published studies of RNAi suppression of GT43_2 and GT47_2 and of a triple mutant of GT43_2, are consistent with the model of xylan synthase comprising three subunits one of which (GT47_2) is responsible for catalysis with the other two subunits being required for correct functioning but indicate that separate xylan synthase complexes may be responsible for the synthesis of populations of AX which differ in their structure and solubility."

Scale-up of testing implies a need to accurately forecast and procure benzathine penicillin (BPG) to treat the additionally identified PW with syphilis. Methods Country-reported ANC coverage, PW syphilis screening and treatment coverage values in 2019 were scaled linearly to EMTCT targets by 2030 (constant increasing slope from 2019 figures to 95% in 2030) for 11 focus countries. Antenatal syphilis screening coverage was substituted with HIV screening coverage to estimate potential contribution of rapid dual HIV/syphilis tests in identifying additional PW with syphilis. BPG demand was calculated for 2019–2030 accordingly. Results The estimated demand for BPG (in 2.4 million unit vials) using current maternal syphilis prevalence and treatment coverage will increase from a baseline of 414,459 doses in 2019 to 683,067 doses (+65%) in 2021 assuming immediate replacement of single HIV test kits with rapid dual HIV/syphilis tests for these 11 countries. Continued scale up of syphilis screening and treatment coverage to reach elimination coverage of 95% will result in an estimated demand increase of 160%, (663,969 doses) from 2019 baseline for a total demand of 1,078,428 BPG doses by 2030. Conclusions Demand for BPG will increase following adoption of rapid dual HIV/syphilis test kits due to increases in maternal diagnoses of syphilis. To eliminate congenital syphilis, MNCH clinical programs will need to synergize with disease surveillance programs to accurately forecast BPG demand with scale up of antenatal syphilis screening to ensure adequate treatment is available for pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis."
https://openalex.org/W3193906570,"Many people believe that weather influences their emotional state. Along similar lines, some researchers in affective science are concerned whether testing individuals at a different time of year, a different part of the day, or in different weather conditions (e.g., in a cold and rainy morning vs. a hot evening) influences how research participants feel upon entering a study; thus inflating the measurement error. Few studies have investigated the link between baseline affective levels and the research context, such as seasonal and daily weather fluctuation in temperature, air pressure, and sunshine duration. We examined whether individuals felt more positive or negative upon entering a study by clustering data across seven laboratory experiments (total N = 1108), three seasons, and daily times ranging from 9 AM to 7 PM. We accounted for ambient temperature, air pressure, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. We found that only ambient temperature was a significant predictor of valence. Individuals felt more positive valence on days when it was cooler outside. However, the effect was psychologically negligible with differences between participants above c.a. 30 degrees Celsius in ambient temperature needed to generate a difference in affective valence surpassing one standard deviation. Our findings have methodological implications for studying emotions by suggesting that seasons and part of the day do not matter for baseline affective valence reported by participants, and the effects of ambient temperature are unlikely to influence most research."
https://openalex.org/W3195386565,"The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial demonstrated that higher-risk patients with atrial fibrillation had lower rates of stroke or systemic embolism and a similar rate of major bleeding, on average, when treated with dabigatran 150mg compared to warfarin. Since population-level averages may not apply to individual patients, estimating the heterogeneity of treatment effect can improve application of RE-LY in clinical practice.For 18040 patients randomized in RE-LY, we used patient-level data to develop multivariable models to predict the risk for stroke or systemic embolism and for major bleeding including all three treatment groups (dabigatran 110mg, dabigatran 150mg, and warfarin) over a median follow up of 2.0 years. The mean predicted absolute risk reduction (ARR) for stroke/systemic embolism with dabigatran 150mg compared to warfarin was 1.32% (range 11.6% lower to 3.30% higher risk). The mean predicted ARR for bleeding was 0.41% (range 8.93% lower to 63.4% higher risk). Patients with increased stroke/systemic embolism risk included those with prior stroke/TIA (OR 2.01), diabetics on warfarin (OR 2.00), and older patients on dabigatran 150mg (OR 1.68 for every 10-year increase). Major bleeding risk was higher in patients on aspirin (OR 1.25), with a history of diabetes (OR 1.34) or prior stroke/TIA (OR 1.22), those with heart failure on dabigatran 110mg (OR 1.52), older patients on either dabigatran 110mg or 150mg (OR 1.57 and 1.93, respectively, for each 10-year increase), and heavier patients on dabigatran 110mg or 150mg; patients in a region outside the United States and Canada and with better renal function had lower bleeding risk.There is substantial heterogeneity in the benefits and risks of dabigatran relative to warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation. Using individualized estimates may enable shared decision making and facilitate more appropriate use of dabigatran; as such, it should be prospectively tested.www.clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT00262600."
https://openalex.org/W3195422212,"The tail immersion assay is a widely used method for measuring acute thermal pain in a way which is quantifiable and reproducible. It is non-invasive and measures response to a stimulus that may be encountered by an animal in its natural environment. However, quantification of tail withdrawal latency relies on manual timing of tail flick using a stopwatch, and precise temperatures of the water at the time of measurement are most often not recorded. These two factors greatly reduce the reproducibility of tail immersion assay data and likely contribute to some of the discrepancies present among relevant literature. We designed a device, TailTimer, which uses a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, a digital temperature sensor, and two electrical wires, to automatically record tail withdrawal latency and water temperature. We programmed TailTimer to continuously display and record water temperature and to only permit the assay to be conducted when the water is within ± 0.25°C of the target temperature. Our software also records the identification of the animals using a radio frequency identification (RFID) system. We further adapted the RFID system to recognize several specific keys as user interface commands, allowing TailTimer to be operated via RFID fobs for increased usability. Data recorded using the TailTimer device showed a negative linear relationship between tail withdrawal latency and water temperature when tested between 47-50°C. We also observed a previously unreported, yet profound, effect of water mixing speed on latency. In one experiment using TailTimer, we observed significantly longer latencies following administration of oral oxycodone versus a distilled water control when measured after 15 mins or 1 h, but not after 4 h. TailTimer also detected significant strain differences in baseline latency. These findings valorize TailTimer in its sensitivity and reliability for measuring thermal pain thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W3195933002,"Behavioral studies indicate that honey bees (Apis mellifera) have a capacity for magnetoreception and superparamagnetic magnetite is suggested to be a magnetoreceptor. The long-term inhibition of magnetite formation can be employed to explore the bee's magnetoreception. A recent study shows that magnetite formation, ferritin2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, and the protein synthesis of ferritin2 in trophocytes and oenocytes were all inhibited by a single injection of ferritin2 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the hemolymph of honey bees but how to maintain this knockdown of ferritin2 for the long-term is unknown. In this study, we injected ferritin2 dsRNA into the hemolymph of worker bees three times every six days to maintain long-term inhibition; however, multi-microinjections accelerated the death of the bees. To overcome this problem, we further reared newly emerged worker bees daily with ferritin2 dsRNA throughout their lives, demonstrating no impact on their lifespans. Follow-up assays showed that the mRNA expression and protein synthesis of ferritin2 were persistently inhibited. These findings verified that daily ferritin2 dsRNA ingestion not only displays the long-term inhibition of mRNA expression and protein synthesis of ferritin2, but also did not damage the bees. This method of long-term inhibition can be used in behavioral studies of magnetoreception in honey bees."
https://openalex.org/W3195978848,"Cable-based technologies are the backbone for logistics of timber or construction material on impassable terrain. In Central Europe, the use of standing skylines with pre-stressed, both-sided fixed-anchor cables and multi-span configurations with internal intermediate supports is common. To ensure a safe and cost-effective set-up for cable road operations, it is essential to identify and compute the properties of the skyline (e.g. load path, tensile forces). This task is challenging because it requires dealing with the non-linear behaviour of the cable structure under the load and has to include all significant physical effects. Several approaches have previously been proposed as practical solutions, however not all physical effects were covered by those approaches, such as the inclination-dependent elastic prolongation of the cable or the longitudinal deflection of the sagging carriage. With our new proposed approach, we aim to close this gap of knowledge, and consider all relevant physical effects. We present a non-linear approach that is able to compute the properties of a wide range of standing skyline configurations, including those with additional cables. This approach offers an extensive solution and a flexible framework for considering individual configurations or particularities by adding equations to the equation system."
https://openalex.org/W3196170306,"This study aims to describe knowledge on HIV and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and psychosocial factors among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Lima, Perú, to explore characteristics associated to this knowledge, and determine its impact on sustained viral suppression. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 171 PLWH at the largest referral health care center in Lima. The psychosocial factors measured were depression, risk of alcoholism, use of illegal drugs and disclosure. A participant had ""poor knowledge"" when less than 80% of replies were correct. Sustained viral suppression was defined as two consecutive viral loads under 50 copies/mL. A total of 49% and 43% had poor HIV and ARV knowledge respectively; 48% of the study population screened positive for depression and 27% reported feeling unsupported by the person they disclosed to. The largest gaps in HIV and ARV knowledge were among 98 (57%) that did not recognize that HIV increased the risk of cancer and among 57 (33%) participants that did not disagree with the statement that taking a double dose of ARV if they missed one. Moderate depression was significantly associated to poor HIV and ARV knowledge. Non-disclosure and being on ARVs for less than 6 months were associated with not achieving sustained viral suppression. Our findings highlight important HIV and ARV knowledge gaps of PLWH and a high burden of psychosocial problems, especially of depression, among PLWH in Lima, Peru. Increasing knowledge and addressing depression and disclosure could improve care of PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3194166908,"Studies identified service members of the United States (US) Armed Forces as a high-risk group for suicide. A significant increase in the suicide rate in the US Armed Forces was found in recent years. To date, there is no military suicide statistic available for the German Armed Forces. This study examined attempted and completed suicides in active service members of the German Armed Forces between 2010 and 2016 retrospectively, on the basis of archived personal and medical records in the central archives of the Medical Service of German Armed Forces. The primary goal was to establish a suicide-statistic for the German Armed Forces and to calculate and compare the suicides rates with the German population. Secondary every case’s data was analysed the groups of attempted and completed suicides were compared. 262 attempted suicides and 148 completed suicides were included in this study (N = 410). The suicide rates of the German Armed Forces peaked over the years 2014–2015 with a suicide rate of 15–16/100.000 active military service members and exceeded the civilian suicide rate in Germany of around 12/100.000 people during those years, although no general trend could be determined. These service members were mostly young men (attempted suicide 81.7%, completed suicide 99.3%), at the age of 17 - &lt;35 years old (87% attempted suicide, 68,3% completed suicide), and were employed less than 6 years in the German Armed Forces (attempted suicide 72.9%, completed suicide 46.3%). Service members with attempted suicides belonged mostly to the military North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-rank-group for other ranks (lowermost military professionals) OR-1 –OR-4 (48.1%) or to the rank-group OR-6 –OR-9 in the group of completed suicides (34.5%). Only in about one third of cases a psychiatric diagnosis could be found in the records. Most frequent diagnoses were neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision^ICD-10: F4) in 46.8%, and affective disorders (ICD-10: F3) in 43.3% of all cases. In the majority of cases there were signs for potential stressors in the private sector (attempted suicide 90.6%, completed suicide 82.6%). No typical risk factors which would enable a specific prevention could be identified in this analysis. Therefore, should preventive strategies be aiming at a multi-level intervention program."
https://openalex.org/W3194229192,"Linear aggregation is present in some animals, such as the coordinated movement of ants and the migration of caterpillars and spinylobsters, but none has been reported on rotifers. The rotifers were collected and clone cultured in the laboratory at 25 ± 1°C, under natural light (light intensity ~130 lx, L:D = 14:10). The culture medium(pH = 7.3) was formulated as described by Suga et al., and rotifers were fed on the micro algae Scenedesmus obliquus grown in HB-4 medium to the exponential growth stage. When density was high (150 individuals ml-1), the behavior of rotifers was observed using a stereo microscope (Motic ES-18TZLED). In this paper, linear aggregation in Brachionus calyciflorus was found for the first time, and experiments were carried out to verify the correlation between linear aggregation and culture density of B. calyciflorus. With the increase of density, the number of aggregations increase, the number of individuals in the aggregation increased, and the maintenance time of the aggregation was also increased. Therefore, we speculate that the formation of aggregates is related to density and may be a behavioral signal of density increase, which may transmit information between density increase and formation of dormant eggs."
https://openalex.org/W3196212965,"Protecting children is recognized as a public health priority and supporting parents through the implementation of evidence-based programs is a well-known strategy to achieve this. However, researchers highlight that these programs remain insufficiently implemented in real-world contexts. A knowledge gap exists between the intended implementation of evidence-based parenting programs and their actual implementation on real-world dynamics. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how evidence-based parenting programs have been implemented under real-world conditions by providing a map of available evidence and identifying knowledge gaps. The overall research question is: ""How have evidence-based parenting programs been implemented under real-world conditions?"". The proposed scoping review follows the framework originally described by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac and colleagues, and the Joanna Briggs Institute: (1) identifying the research questions; (2) identifying the relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; (6) consultation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will inform the search strategy. The results will be described in relation to the research questions and in the context of the purpose of the review. This scoping review will help to bridge the implementation gap between research evidence and its translation into practice."
https://openalex.org/W3193632017,"Various therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis are performed to improve symptoms in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Pre-clinical studies have shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) exposure induces angiogenesis. LIPUS may be a new stratergy for treatment of CLI. The purpose of this pilot trial was to evaluate outcomes in patients with CLI who were treated with LIPUS. Fourteen patients with CLI, who were not candidates for angioplasty or surgical revascularization, were enrolled in this study. Historical control data were obtained from the Hiroshima University PAD database. The primary endpoints were major amputation and death. The outcomes were compared in 16 lower limbs of the 14 patients with CLI who were treated with LIPUS and in 14 lower limbs of 14 patients with CLI as historical controls. All patients were followed for after 5 years after treatment with LIPUS. The mean duration of LIPUS exposure in the LIPUS group was 381± 283 days. During the 5-year follow-up periods, there were 3 major amputations and 7 deaths in the LIPUS group and there were 14 major amputations and 7 deaths in the historical control group. The overall amputation-free survival rate was significantly higher in patients who were treated with LIPUS than in historical controls. There was no significant difference between overall mortality-free survival rates in the LIPUS group and historical control group. LIPUS is a noninvasive option for therapeutic angiogenesis with the potential to reduce the incidence of major amputations in patients with CLI."
https://openalex.org/W3194313189,"Early identification of patients with an anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in need of highly specialized care could facilitate the selection of the optimal initial treatment in these patients. This paper describes the development and psychometric evaluation of the Decision Tool Anxiety Disorders, OCD and PTSD (DTAOP), which aims to aid clinicians in the early identification of patients with an anxiety disorder, OCD, or PTSD in need of highly specialized mental healthcare.A systematic literature review and a concept mapping procedure were carried out to inform the development of the DTAOP. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the DTAOP, a cross-sectional study in 454 patients with a DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder was carried out. Feasibility was evaluated by the completion time and the content clarity of the DTAOP. Inter-rater reliability was assessed in a subsample of 87 patients. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the DTAOP and EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) scores were computed to examine the convergent validity. Criterion validity was assessed against independent clinical judgments made by clinicians.The average time required to complete the eight-item DTAOP was 4.6 min and the total DTAOP was evaluated as clear in the majority (93%) of the evaluations. Krippendorff's alpha estimates ranged from 0.427 to 0.839. Based on the qualitative feedback, item wording and instructions were improved. As hypothesized, the DTAOP correlated negatively with EQ-5D-5L scores. The area under the curve was 0.826 and the cut-off score of ≥4 optimized sensitivity (70%) and specificity (71%).The DTAOP demonstrated excellent feasibility and good validity, but weak inter-rater reliability. Based on the qualitative feedback and reliability estimates, revisions and refinements of the wording and instructions were made, resulting in the final version of the DTAOP."
https://openalex.org/W3194733826,"Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS) is a bothersome and sometimes unsafe experience, frequently experienced in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. In this study, the effect of up to four training sessions to decrease VIMS in the VR environment to a minimal level was tested and verified through explicit declarations of all 14 healthy participants that were recruited in this study. Additionally, the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) was used at the end of each training session to measure responses to different aspects of VIMS. Total, gastrointestinal, and central motion sickness were shown to decrease significantly by the last training session, compared to the first one. After acclimatizing to motion sickness, participants' sense of presence and the level of their motion sickness in the VR environment were assessed while actuating three novel and sophisticated VR systems. They performed up to four trials of the Illinois agility test in the VR systems and the real world, then completed MSAQ and Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) at the end of each session. Following acclimatization, the three VR systems generated relatively little motion sickness and high virtual presence scores, with no statistically meaningful difference among them for either MSAQ or IPQ. Also, it was shown that presence has a significant negative correlation with VIMS."
