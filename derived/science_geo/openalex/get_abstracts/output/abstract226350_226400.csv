https://openalex.org/W2036875821,"SINCE the discovery of ‘Paludrine’ (proguanil, N1-p-chlorophenyl-N5-isopropyldiguanide) by Curd, Davey and Rose1, considerable evidence has accumulated that this drug probably differs in its mode of action from most other antimalarials. Direct evidence that proguanil is transformed in the animal body into another, more active, compound was provided by Hawking2 and Hawking and Perry3, who showed that proguanil has no action on in vitro cultures of the exo-erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium gallinaceum or on the blood forms of P. cynomolgi, whereas, under similar conditions, serum from animals dosed with the drug has high antimalarial activity."

https://openalex.org/W2093134538,"WE have shown1 that OO-diethyl-O-p-nitrophenyl thiophosphate, an insecticidal compound generally known as parathion or E605, has not, when pure, any measurable in vitro inhibition of rat's brain cholinesterase. Nevertheless, pure parathion is a powerful inhibitor of cholinesterase in vivo, and there is little doubt that its mammalian toxicity is due to this property. When parathion is administered intraperitoneally to male rats (180–220 gm.) the dose necessary to produce a 50 per cent inhibition of brain cholinesterase within 30 min. is about 1.5 mgm./kgm., a figure of the same order as that required for OS-diethyl-O-p-nitrophenyl thiophosphate, the S-ethyl isomer of parathion, which is a highly active in vitro inhibitor1. With a dose of 3 mgm./kgm. the onset of the typical symptoms of parasympathetic stimulation occurs within 10 min. with both compounds. The cholinesterase activity of rat's blood, which is mainly due to specific enzyme in the red cells, is also unaffected by parathion in vitro; but in vivo it can readily be completely inhibited by injected parathion. There is, however, a slight but significant difference between the action of parathion and its S-ethyl isomer in vivo; when a dose of the former, which produces complete inhibition, is administered intravenously, there is a lag of a few minutes before the inhibition develops, whereas with the same dose of the latter the inhibition reaches completion very rapidly after injection."
https://openalex.org/W2089330695,"IT is generally assumed, after Caspersson1, that the nucleus is the main centre of protein synthesis in the cell. However, this opinion is based on cytochemical and biological observations only (for example, the incapacity for sustained regeneration in many unicellular organisms), and it appeared desirable to test this assumption on biochemical grounds also."

https://openalex.org/W1973640245,"THE transplantation of mammalian eggs into a host uterus is usually achieved by means of an operation on the recipient female. It would clearly be of advantage in several respects if transference could be effected without the necessity of opening the body cavity of the recipient. As described below, mouse eggs transferred directly through the cervical opening into a host uterus have come to term. This seems to be the first mammal in which a direct non-operative transplantation has succeeded. It is suggested that the procedure could be called ‘inovulation’, by analogy with the word insemination1."
https://openalex.org/W2030728800,"SEX-RATIO at birth in man and some other organisms has been a subject of investigation for several decades. No clear evidence has been available indicating its association with any known hereditary trait. The purpose of this note is to point out such an association of sex-ratio with ABO blood groups in man. The data consist of ABO determinations of 1,330 mothers and cord blood of their newborn infants, delivered during the second half of 1944, at the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital in Bombay. The original purpose of that investigation was to study the frequency of subgroups of A in the sample of mothers1 and the incidence of hæmolytic anæmias in their newborn infants2,3. Recently there was occasion to re-examine the data for ABO determinations and sex-ratio in infants. Results of this analysis are given in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2094600999,"THE biological activity of growth hormone1 is found to be greatly reduced following treatment with acetic anhydride, which is known to acetylate protein amino groups specifically2. The relative importance of free α- and ɛ-amino groups has not hitherto been investigated. Purified growth hormone has now been acetylated according to the conditions of Li and Evans1, but with smaller amounts of acetic anhydride so as to avoid complete inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1975151978,"CONTEMPORARY views on the role of adenosine triphosphate in contractile activity include the assumption that the breakdown of this substance is the immediate chemical source for mechanical energy1,2. However, as has recently been emphasized by A. V. Hill3, there is no proof that such a dephosphorylation occurs as an early event in contraction. Furthermore, it has been shown4 that the effects of adenosine triphosphate upon certain physical properties of actomyosin do not primarily involve splitting of the nucleotide. The experiments reported here were undertaken in order to decide whether, indeed, any dephosphorylation of adenosine triphosphate occurs during the contractile phase of a twitch."

https://openalex.org/W1970026934,"ACCORDING to Gates1 the frequency of pure albinos is about 1 in 15–25,000 of the population in Scotland. Owing to the kindness of Miss E. C. MacQuade, an albino woman aged about 45–50 years was brought for colour vision tests. She was a pure albino, according to Gates's classification, having cream-white hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, and only a very slight trace of pigment in the iris. She had a continuous nystagmus owing to photophobia, and a divergent squint, for the same reason, using mainly the left eye while the unused eye wandered. She was very shortsighted. Her mother had fifteen children, seven boys and eight girls. She and a younger sister, now deceased, were the only albinos known among all her relations."

https://openalex.org/W1993628051,"THE gene ‘antennaless’ of Drosophila melanogaster does not necessarily express itself fully in individuals homozygous for it1. In the course of a programme of work designed to isolate, by means of inbreeding and/or selection, a series of families all homozygous for this gene, but differing in degree of exhibition by reason of the various gene milieux present in the various families, it was noticed that high exhibition lines were conspicuously difficult to maintain. In view of the known chemoreceptive function of the antennæ in insects in general2 and in Drosophila in particular3, and the importance of the antennæ in the mating behaviour patterns of various species, experiments were started to see whether the poor results obtained with high exhibition lines could be ascribed to failure of adequate mating responses consequent upon absence of stimuli normally reaching the animal via these organs. Evidence that males were attracted to females by olfactory stimuli had not been obtained in previous experiments3."

https://openalex.org/W1999547272,"A SYSTEMATIC study, such as we contemplate, on the influence of disease on the electrophoresis pattern of serum, requires observations on large numbers of sera. Such an investigation is laborious and time-consuming when the available techniques and apparatus are utilized, because only a very limited number of experiments can be completed in one day. We have, therefore, devised a method whereby two electrophoretic analyses can be made simultaneously using the Tiselius apparatus with a standard central section."

https://openalex.org/W2134327174,"VISUALIZATION of individual granules in beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans is particularly difficult in many species, including man. Aside from electron microscopy, few techniques provide sufficient resolution to detect variations in the size or shape of individual granules owing to their minute size. Phase microscopy of stained specimens has proved satisfactory for observing extreme, deviations from the normal1; but variations of less magnitude are difficult to assess. Strongly fluorescent granules illuminated by long ultra-violet rays (λ 300–400 mµ.) act as self-luminous sources of visible light located within the specimen, and this permits use of the maximum aperture of apochromatic oil-immersion objectives. As the autofluorescence of islet cell granules is weak2, their fluorescence must be intensified for adequate results. Various fluorochrome dyes were tried for this purpose and some yielded results which appear definitely superior to those obtained by either conventional or phase microscopy. The methods evolved are briefly outlined here, as most reports concerning fluorescence microscopy of the pancreas2–4 make little reference to the use of fluorochrome dyes."
