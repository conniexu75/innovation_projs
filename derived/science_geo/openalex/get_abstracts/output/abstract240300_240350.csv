https://openalex.org/W2071925802,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. To block all miRNA formation in zebrafish, we generated maternal-zygotic dicer (MZ dicer ) mutants that disrupt the Dicer ribonuclease III and double-stranded RNA-binding domains. Mutant embryos do not process precursor miRNAs into mature miRNAs, but injection of preprocessed miRNAs restores gene silencing, indicating that the disrupted domains are dispensable for later steps in silencing. MZ dicer mutants undergo axis formation and differentiate multiple cell types but display abnormal morphogenesis during gastrulation, brain formation, somitogenesis, and heart development. Injection of miR-430 miRNAs rescues the brain defects in MZ dicer mutants, revealing essential roles for miRNAs during morphogenesis."

Projected weakening of the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean does not lead to a net cooling in Europe. At any given point in time, even if concentrations are stabilized, there is a commitment to future climate changes that will be greater than those we have already observed."
https://openalex.org/W2167430243,"Autophagic cell death is characterized by the accumulation of vacuoles in physiological and pathological conditions. However, its molecular event is unknown. Here, we show that Atg5, which is known to function in autophagy, contributes to autophagic cell death by interacting with Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). Down-regulation of Atg5 expression in HeLa cells suppresses cell death and vacuole formation induced by IFN-γ. Inversely, ectopic expression of Atg5 using adenoviral delivery induces autophagic cell death. Deletion mapping analysis indicates that procell death activity resides in the middle and C-terminal region of Atg5. Cells harboring the accumulated vacuoles triggered by IFN-γ or Atg5 expression become dead, and vacuole formation precedes cell death. 3-Methyladenine or expression of Atg5K130R mutant blocks both cell death and vacuole formation triggered by IFN-γ, whereas benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) inhibits only cell death but not vacuole formation. Atg5 interacts with FADD via death domain in vitro and in vivo, and the Atg5-mediated cell death, but not vacuole formation, is blocked in FADD-deficient cells. These results suggest that Atg5 plays a crucial role in IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death by interacting with FADD.

These results suggest that Atg5 plays a crucial role in IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death by interacting with FADD. Programmed cell death can be classified based on morphological criteria into several categories. The major extensively studied category, apoptosis, is characterized by membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and preservation of organelles (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Differing from apoptosis, autophagic cell death or type II programmed cell death exhibits the appearance of vacuoles engulfing bulk cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (2Bursch W.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Autophagic cell death is also extensively observed in steroid-triggered cell death during development of Drosophila (5Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Recently, death-associated protein kinase (DAPk) and death-associated related protein kinase-1 (DRP-1) were shown to play a role in IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death (8Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Also, beclin 1 and Atg7 were reported to be associated with autophagic cell death (9Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. von Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). However, evidence is not clear yet that autophagic cell death employs autophagy machinery. The physiological and pathological role of the autophagic cell death is emphasized with various evidences, giving a therapeutic value to autophagic cell death. Autophagic cell death was proposed as the action mechanism of some anticancer agents (4Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Also, Danon disease, cardiomyopathies, and skeletal myopathies with different genetic origins are characterized by the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (11Nishino I. Fu J. Tanji K. Yamada T.

Likewise, an increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease (14Anglade P. Vyas S. Javoy-Agid F. Herrero M.T. Michel P.P. Marquez J. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cataldo A.M. Barnett J.L.

However, most reported pathologies have described the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles without clear evidence for autophagic cell death or its contribution to diseases. Although much information has accumulated over the past decade about genes that mediate the morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagic cell death. In this study, we show that IFN-γ-induced vacuole-associated cell death comprises two-subsequent steps: vacuole formation and cell death. Atg5 (Apg5) (18Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn W.A. Emr S.D.

Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), a key molecule involved in autophagic vacuole formation, is required for the autophagic cell death; Atg5 interacts with death domain of FADD as a necessary step leading to cell death, linking autophagy machinery to type II programmed cell death. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Death Assay—HeLa, MCF-7, and Hep3B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Jurkat, Jurkat (I2-1), and Jurkat (I9-2) cells (19Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) were maintained with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmids. Cells were exposed with various stimuli, and cell death was then assessed by counting GFP-positive cells showing condensed and fragmented nuclei after staining with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) or by trypan blue exclusion assay (>400 cells). Staining of autophagic vacuoles with monodansylcadaverin (MDC; Fluka) was described previously (20Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent microscopy (Axiovert 25; GFP filter-Ex470/40VS495, Em515/30; RFP filter-Ex546/12VS510EmLP590; Zeiss) was performed with an excitation filter range of 470–490 nm or 360–370 nm and a barrier filter of 515 nm or 470–490 nm for GFP, Hoechst 33258, and MDC fluorescence, respectively. DNA and Reagents—The human Atg5, Atg5K130R mutant replacing Lys-130 with Arg (pAtg5K130R-HA), and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) expression plasmids were described previously (21Mizushima N.

Deletion mutants of Atg5 were generated by PCR and cloned into XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3-HA. IFN-γ was obtained from Sigma and LG Biotech. MDC was from Fluka. Etoposide, cis-PLATINUM(II)-diammine dichloride, staurosporine, and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were purchased from Sigma. Z-VAD-fmk (zVal-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) and IETD-fmk (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) were purchased from Bachem. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The death domain region (amino acids 100–179) of FADD was used as bait in the conventional yeast two-hybrid screening using pLexA vector (Clontech) and Jurkat cDNA library (Stratagene). Death domain of FADD was cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pLexA. Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment—Two kinds of antisense oligonucleotides complementary to human Atg5 mRNA (oligonucleotide 15, 5′-CATCTTTGTCATCTGTCA-3′; oligonucleotide 16, 5′-TTGTCAGTTACCAACGTC-3′) were generated. Comparison of the oligonucleotide sequence with data base detected homology only to the Atg5 sequence. C-2 (5′-GCTACTAGTAGCAGCTAC-3′) scrambled sequences served as a control. HeLa cells were treated with Atg5 antisense or scrambled oligonucleotide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Lipofectamine reagent for 3 h and then in the same mixture containing 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 72 h. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenovirus containing Atg5 under the control of hepatoma-specific α-feto protein (AFP) promoter (Rad-AFP-Atg5) was constructed as following. Shuttle vector containing Atg5 under AFP promoter (pΔE1sp1A-AFPe-Atg5-BGH (bovine growth factor)) and adenoviral vector containing the Ad5 genome (vmdl324BstBI) (obtained from Dr. Verca in the University of Fribourgh, Switzerland) were linearized with ScaI and BstBI, respectively, and co-transformed into BJ5183 Escherichia coli (23Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 7: 4805-4810Crossref Google Scholar). To verify the proper homologous recombinants, DNAs purified were digested with HindIII. Rad-AFP-Atg5 was generated after transfection of PacI-digested recombinant into HEK293 cells. Rad-LacZ (β-galactosidase) was hired as a control. All viruses were plaque-purified, propagated, and titered in HEK293 cells using a standard method. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J. Ichijo H. Jung Y.K. Mol.

Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), and anti-human FADD (clone A66-2) and antihuman-tubulin antibodies (clone B-5-1-2) are from Pharmingen and Sigma, respectively. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—In vitro pull-down assay was carried out as described previously (25Choi Y.H. Kim K.B. Kim H.H. Hong G.S. Kwon Y.K. Chung C.W. Park Y.M. Shen Z.J. Kim B.J. Lee S.Y. Jung Y.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-human FADD antibody or preimmune IgG after preclearing with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. After adding additional protein G-Sepharose, the mixtures were further rotated for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and examined with Western blotting after separation by SDS-PAGE. Atg5 Is Required for IFN-γ-induced Cell Death and Vacuole Formation—In an attempt to isolate a protein interacting with death domain of FADD, we have isolated Atg5. To define the role of Atg5 in cell death, we directly targeted the expression of Atg5 with antisense oligonucleotides. Interestingly, IFN-γ-induced cell death was inhibited in HeLa cells transfected with Atg5 antisense oligonucleotides but not with scrambled oligonucleotides (Fig. 1A), and the reduced expression of Atg5, but not relevant protein FADD, was confirmed with Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, insets). Similar effects were confirmed in HeLa cells transfected by Atg5 antisense cDNA (data not shown). However, down-regulation of Atg5 expression did not give any influences on cell death induced by the treatment with etoposide, staurosporine, or cisplatin (Fig. 1B). IFN-γ-induced cell death was previously suggested as an autophagic cell death showing the main characteristics of vacuole formation (8Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, autophagic vacuole formation was addressed by using exogenous GFP-fused microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (GFP-LC3), a specific lysosomal/autophagic biochemical vacuole marker (22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Microscopic analysis showed that IFN-γ treatment induced the appearance of LC3 dots in control cells (Fig. 1C, upper panel) but not in HeLa cells transfected with Atg5 antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 1C, lower panel). IFN-γ-induced vacuole formation was confirmed by MDC staining, too (data not shown). These results indicate that Atg5 is required for IFN-γ-induced cell death and vacuole formation. Biochemical analysis employing Western blotting using anti-LC3 antibody showed that IFN-γ treatment increased the level of LC3-II, the autophagosome-associating form of LC3, as compared with LC3-I (Fig. 1D), indicating that IFN-γ increased the autophagosome membrane association of LC3 for vacuole formation. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Atg5K130R mutant, which is defective in its ability to conjugate with Atg12 during autophagy (22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), inhibited both cell death and MDC-positive vacuole formation triggered by IFN-γ (Fig. 1E). A vacuole formation assay using GFP-LC3 also showed that the expression of Atg5K130R mutant blocked IFN-γ-induced vacuole formation (Fig. 1F, lower panel). These results suggest that the vacuole formation induced by IFN-γ may share similar machinery as autophagy and be associated with cell death via Atg5. Ectopic Expression of Atg5 Induces Cell Death and Vacuole Formation—Inversely, when Atg5 was transiently overexpressed in HeLa and MCF-7 cells for 48 h, we observed the characteristics of cell death, cell shrinkage, and nuclear condensation as examined with Hoechst dye staining (Fig. 2A and B). As compared with p55/TNFR1 (Fig. 2B, left panel), however, Atg5 expression induced the appearance of condensed nuclei without fragmentation (Fig. 2B, right panel). Also, consistent with its inhibitory role in IFN-γ-induced cell death, the expression of Atg5K130R mutant did not exhibit any pro-cell death activity (Fig. 2A). At an earlier time (24 h), the examination of vacuole formation using GFP-LC3 showed that transient expression of Atg5 in HeLa cells induced the accumulation of LC3 dots without significant cell death, increasing the proportion of cells with autophagic vacuoles to 30–60% (Fig. 2C, left panel). A similar increase of vacuole formation was observed at 24 h in Hep3B human hepatoma cells infected with adenovirus expressing Atg5 under the control of hepatoma-specific α-feto protein promoter (Ade-Atg5) (Fig. 2C, right panel). As shown in Fig. 2D, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was observed by Western blotting of Hep3B cells infected with Ade-Atg5 but not in control cells infected with adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Ade-LacZ). We then analyzed the kinetics of vacuole formation and cell death with GFP-LC3 by chasing times in the single cell level (Supplementary Fig. 1). IFN-γ-induced vacuoles began to accumulate at an earlier time (20 h) and sequentially tended to aggregate into bigger spots until 39 h in HeLa cells. At a later time (40 h), most of the cells harboring aggregated vacuoles became shrunken and were eventually dead (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Similarly, vacuole formation was observed at 16 h in the Atg5-transfected cells and apparently followed by the induction of cell death and detachment from the culture plate between 43 and 64.5 h (Supplementary Fig. 1B), linking vacuole accumulation to cell death in the single cell level. These observations demonstrate that IFN-γ- or Atg5-induced vacuole formation precedes cell death and suggest that Atg5 exhibits vacuole formation-associated pro-cell death activity. To map the functional domain of Atg5, we constructed several deletion mutants (Fig. 2E). Subsequently, the ability of each mutant to induce cell death was examined in HeLa cells with transient expression analysis (Fig. 2F). Atg5-(71–170), Atg5-(171–276), and Atg5-(71–276) mutants induced cell death, whereas other mutants including Atg5-(1–70) and Atg5-(1–170) lost their abilities to induce cell death. These results suggest that the C terminus (171–276) of Atg5 contains cell death-inducing activity. Also, the middle region (71–170) of Atg5 is potent to induce cell death, which is inhibited by the N terminus (1–70). A similar expression level of Atg5 mutants was determined with Western blot analysis (Fig. 2F, insets). Identification of Atg5 as a FADD-interacting Molecule—We have isolated Atg5 as a protein interacting with FADD by yeast two-hybrid assay. An in vitro binding assay showed that the radiolabeled Atg5 was pulled-down with purified GST-fused FADD (GST-FADD) and GST-fused death domain of FADD (FADD-DD) but not with GST (Fig. 3A). We determined the domain of Atg5 interacting with FADD after co-transfection into HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that all deletions except Atg5-(1–70) interacted with FADD (Fig. 3B), indicating that the domain of Atg5 interacting with FADD spans the middle and C-terminal region. FADD-interacting domains generally correspond to cell death-inducing activity of Atg5 deletions except Atg5-(1–170). Then protein-protein interaction of endogenous Atg5 and FADD was examined in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis using anti-Atg5 and Atg12 antibodies showed that Atg5 and Atg12 were detected in the immunocomplexes precipitated by anti-FADD antibody and that the amounts of Atg5 detected were almost same in control and IFN-γ-treated cells. These results suggest that Atg5 interacts with FADD and that the interaction is not changed by the treatment with IFN-γ. We could not perform reciprocal immunoprecipitation assay because the molecular weight of FADD overlaps with the light chain of immunoglobulin. Because of the limitation of anti-Atg5 antibody for immunocytochemical analysis, subcellular co-localization of Atg5 with FADD or FADD-DD was examined in HeLa cells after transfection of GFP-fused Atg5 (GFP-Atg5) with either RFP-FADD or RFP-FADD-DD (Fig. 3D). Although GFP-Atg5 alone was detected with diffused pattern in the transfected cells, RFP-FADD and RFP-FADD-DD showed distinct subcellular localizations, aggregated and diffused cytosolic patterns, respectively (Fig. 3D). Co-expression of GFP-Atg5 with RFP-FADD or RFP-FADD-DD induced change in the subcellular localization of GFP-Atg5 to aggregated and diffused cytosolic patterns, overlapping with those of RFP-FADD and RFP-FADD-DD, respectively. These results suggest that Atg5 interacts with FADD via death domain. FADD Is Required for Atg5-mediated Cell Death but Not Vacuole Formation—We then characterized Atg5-mediated cell death by investigating functional significance of the protein-protein interaction between Atg5 and FADD. The role of FADD in Atg5-mediated cell death was addressed by using antisense approaches. Transfection of HeLa cells with FADD antisense cDNA diminished the expression level of endogenous FADD as determined with Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A, insets). Surprisingly, the reduced expression of FADD blocked Atg5-induced cell death to the control level (Fig. 4A). Apoptosis triggered by death receptors, such as p55/TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TRAIL receptors that employ FADD as an adaptor molecule, was inhibited in FADD knock-down cells, whereas apoptosis triggered by etoposide, a non-receptor signal, was not suppressed (Fig. 4B). Similarly, Atg5-induced cell death was also blocked in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (I2-1) and partially in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (I9-2) (Fig. 4C). Further, as shown in Fig. 4D, co-expression of Atg5 with FADD synergistically induced cell death. Expression of Atg5 with FADD-DD was also potent to induce cell death but less potent than FADD. These results indicate that FADD-DD is effective to mediate Atg5-induced cell death. On the contrary, FADD-induced cell death was not affected by the reduced expression of Atg5 in HeLa cells (Fig. 4E) and by the treatment with 3-MA (Fig. 4F), a widely used inhibitor of vacuole formation in autophagy (26Selgen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). These results indicate that FADD is required for Atg5-induced cell death. We then investigated the contribution of FADD to vacuole formation and cell death triggered by IFN-γ. Down-regulation of FADD expression significantly reduced IFN-γ-induced cell death (40–25%) (Fig. 5A and B, upper panel) but not the accumulation of vacuoles (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panel). These results indicate that FADD mediates a downstream event of vacuole formation in Atg5-mediated cell death and IFN-γ-induced cell death. Dissection of Autophagic Cell Death into Two Continuous Steps, Vacuole Formation and Cell Death—To further ensure the dissection of Atg5-mediated autophagic cell death into vacuole formation and cell death, 3-MA, Z-VAD-fmk (pan caspase inhibitor), and IETD-fmk (caspase-8 inhibitor) were employed. IFN-γ-induced cell death was almost completely inhibited by the incubation of HeLa cells with Z-VAD-fmk and partially suppressed by 3-MA (Fig. 6A). IETD-fmk was a little effective in reducing IFN-γ-induced cell death. Similar effects of those inhibitors on Atg5-induced cell death were observed (Fig. 6C). It is notable to observe that 3-MA was more potent to suppress cell death induced by the expression of Atg5 as compared with its effects on IFN-γ-induced cell death, implying that IFN-γ induces both 3-MA-sensitive autophagic cell death in which Atg5 plays a role and 3-MA-insensitive apoptosis (Fig. 7). On the contrary, 3-MA completely blocked IFN-γ- or Atg5-induced accumulation of MDC-positive vacuoles to the control levels (Fig. 6, B and D), whereas Z-VAD-fmk and IETD-fmk failed to show such inhibitory effects. Consistently, administration with 3-MA, but not Z-VAD-fmk and IETD-fmk, abolished the appearance of GFP-LC3 dots in HeLa cells exposed to IFN-γ (Fig. 6E, upper panel) or expressing exogenous Atg5 (Fig. 6E, lower panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate that IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death consists of two continuous but separable processes: 3-MA-inhibitable vacuole formation and Z-VAD-inhibitable, FADD-dependent cell death in which vacuole formation precedes cell death.Fig. 7Proposed roles of Atg5 and FADD in IFN-γ-induced vacuole-associated cell death. IFN-γ (<10,000 units/ml)-induced cell death is mainly contributed by autophagic cell death in which Atg5 mediates IFN-γ-induced vacuole formation and subsequent cell death through interacting with FADD. Although 3-MA suppresses Atg5-mediated vacuole formation and cell death, Z-VAD-fmk inhibits only cell death.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increasing evidence indicates that autophagic cell death is observed during development and neurodegenerative diseases and mainly characterized by the accumulation of vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Typically, HeLa and MCF-7 cells exposed to IFN-γ and tamoxifen, respectively, were demonstrated to undergo autophagic cell death. By using the autophagic cell death model, we show that Atg5 plays a crucial role in autophagic cell death consisting of two continuous events: accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and cell death (Fig. 7). Moreover, excess accumulation of vacuoles is linked to autophagic cell death as follows. (i) Accumulation of autophagic vacuoles is followed by the incidence of cell death in IFN-γ-treated cells. (ii) Treatment with 3-MA blocks IFN-γ-induced cell death. (iii) Knock-down of Atg5 or expression of Atg5K130R mutant suppresses both vacuole formation and cell death. (iv) Overexpression of Atg5 induces vacuole formation and cell death. (v) Z-VAD-fmk suppresses cell death but not vacuole formation. We observed similar results in the tamoxifen-induced autophagic death model of MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Atg5 may play a dual role in autophagy and autophagic cell death. During autophagy, Atg5 is one of the components in a unique non-ubiquitin conjugation reaction that is required for vacuole formation and conjugated to human Atg12 homologue (21Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). In the presence of cell death pressure, autophagy and autophagic cell death may share common machinery utilizing Atg5. The middle and C-terminal region of Atg5 contains a Lys residue for conjugation with Atg12 and binds to FADD for cell death-inducing activity. Also, the observations that Atg5K130R mutant defective in its ability to conjugate with Atg12 failed to induce vacuole-associated cell death suggest that like autophagy, the conjugation of Atg5 with Atg12 may be required for Atg5-mediated cell death. As observed from immunoprecipitation analysis, Atg5 and Atg12 were detected in the complex associated with FADD although we failed to observe the IFN-dependent formation of such protein complexes. Still, the components and biochemical properties of the protein complexes containing FADD-Atg5 remain to be elucidated to better distinguish autophagic cell death from autophagy. In addition, the inhibitory effects of Atg5K130R mutant on autophagic cell death imply that Atg5K130R mutant may act as a dominant negative in autophagic cell death. During preparation of our report, another link of the basic autophagy to autophagic cell death was recently provided by beclin 1 (10Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. von Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), a tumor suppressor protein that interacts with Bcl-2 and is structurally similar to the yeast autophagic gene Apg6/Vps30p (27Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Until recently, it is believed that autophagic cell death and apoptosis are controlled by different mechanisms, mainly by their dependence on caspase. Autophagic cell death employing IFN-γ is generally known to be caspase-independent (4Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 8Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Doses ranging from 500 to 1,000 unit/ml IFN-γ are frequently employed to induce autophagic death of HeLa cells. However, we consistently observed that Z-VAD-fmk was very potent to suppress autophagic death induced by 1,000 units/ml IFN-γ but not effective to inhibit cell death induced by much higher doses of IFN-γ (>10,000 units/ml) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). On the contrary, Z-VAD-fmk could not suppress vacuole formation induced by various does of IFN-γ (Supplementary Fig. 2B). We have utilized IFN-γ obtained from several different sources with the same results. Thus, we believe that depending on the amounts of death signal applied, IFN-γ may trigger Z-VAD-dependent or -independent autophagic cell death. Studies of Drosophila salivary gland cell destruction show that caspases contribute to the autophagic cell death (6Lee C.Y. Clough E.A. Yellon P. Teslovich T.M. Stephan D.A. Baehrecke E.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 350-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Lee C.Y. Cooksey B.A. Baehrecke E.H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and DAPk and DRP-1 control both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death (28Cohen O. Inbal B. Kissil J.L. Raveh T. Berissi H. Spivak-Kroizaman T. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 29Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular events underlying autophagic cell death may depend on the amounts and types of autophagic cell death signals. Even Z-VAD could induce autophagic cell death in L929 cells (10Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. von Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), and whether or not these types of autophagic cell death utilize Atg5 as a death mediator remains to be elucidated. We have identified Atg5 as a protein interacting with death domain of FADD using yeast two-hybrid screening. To our surprise, subsequent analyses exhibit that the pro-cell death activity of Atg5 requires FADD as a downstream mediator. Although overexpression of FADD may activate death effector domain-containing caspases, such as caspase-8, the reduced expression of FADD abrogates Atg5-induced autophagic cell death. FADD is well known as an adaptor molecule mainly mediating receptor-mediated apoptosis. However, many evidences indicate that FADD is a multifunctional protein, displaying diverse activities in non-receptor-mediated apoptosis, necrosis, and cell growth (29Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, FADD may be a turning point that determines diverse signaling fates. Elucidation of signal-dependent stoichiometry of FADD-containing complexes, such as FADD-Atg5 and FADD-caspase, will be important. At present, we do not think that caspase-8, which interacts with FADD, significantly contributes to Atg5-mediated cell death. We failed to observe the activation of caspase-8 with enzymatic assay using fluorogenic substrate during Atg5- and IFN-γ-mediated autophagic cell death (Supplementary Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with the results showing the occurrence of Atg5-induced cell death in caspase-8-deficient cells. In spite of the weak activation of caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. 3), we could not observe the detectable appearance of DNA laddering in dying cells triggered by the expression of Atg5 or by the treatment with IFN-γ (data not shown). However, Z-VAD-inhibitable proteases are likely to be activated downstream of FADD to mediate Atg5- and IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death. Although Z-VAD-fmk is considered as a pan caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (about 50 μm) exhibits its inhibitory effects on other proteases, too, as shown in the disruption of the development of the mammalian preimplantation embryo and in the inhibition of the lysosomal protease (30Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 6: 727-733Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Effective cell death triggered by FADD-DD and Atg5 indicates that FADD-DD may function to activate downstream mediator of autophagic cell death, whereas FADD-DED (death effector domain) is usually required for cell death. Identification of such downstream mediators deserves further characterization. In summary, we show for the first time that Atg5 plays a crucial role in IFN-γ-induced autophagic cell death by interacting with FADD as a necessary step leading to cell death, establishing a role of the Atg gene in cell death with autophagic features.

In genetically engineered mice, apoAV plasma levels are inversely correlated with plasma triglycerides. To elucidate the mechanism by which apoAV influences plasma triglycerides, metabolic studies and in vitro assays resembling physiological conditions were performed. In human APOA5 transgenic mice (hAPOA5tr), catabolism of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was accelerated due to a faster plasma hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Hepatic VLDL and intestinal chylomicron production were not affected. The functional interplay between apoAV and LPL was further investigated by cross-breeding a human LPL transgene with the apoa5 knock-out and the hAPOA5tr to an lpl-deficient background. Increased LPL activity completely normalized hypertriglyceridemia of apoa5-deficient mice; however, overexpression of human apoAV modulated triglyceride levels only slightly when LPL was reduced. To reflect the physiological situation in which LPL is bound to cell surface proteoglycans, we examined hydrolysis in the presence or absence of proteoglycans. Without proteoglycans, apoAV derived either from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, hAPOA5tr high density lipoprotein, or a recombinant source did not alter the LPL hydrolysis rate. In the presence of proteoglycans, however, apoAV led to a significant and dose-dependent increase in LPL-mediated hydrolysis of VLDL triglycerides.

Among the genetic factors, the contribution of variations at the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 locus to the determination of TG levels has been well defined (2Groenendijk M. Cantor R.M. de Bruin T.W.

APOA5, the newest member of the apolipoprotein family, is located at this locus 27 kb distal (3′)to APOA4. It was discovered 3 years ago independently by comparative sequencing (4Pennacchio L.A.

Mice expressing a human APOA5 transgene had one-third lower plasma TG levels, whereas knock-out mice lacking apoa5 had four times higher plasma TG levels (4Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A.

These data indicate that apoAV plays a major role in the regulation of TG metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the influence of apoAV on plasma TG is currently not understood. Because apoAV is an apolipoprotein with high lipid affinity and low elasticity, it has been proposed that apoAV may impair the second step of VLDL assembly by binding to lipids and cellular membranes and therefore reduce liver VLDL production (9Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice with adenoviral overexpression of apoa5, a decreased production rate of VLDL TG has been described (10Schaap F.G. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Vrins C. van der Vliet H.N. Chamuleau R.A.

On the other hand, apoAV could serve as a receptor ligand or bridge TG-rich lipoproteins to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), thereby enhancing the uptake of remnant particles into tissues. In addition, apoAV could accelerate plasma turnover of TG-rich particles. This could happen by a direct activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or by affecting the concentration or function of other apolipoproteins, e.g. apoCIII. It was found recently that mice with transgenic or adenoviral expression of apoAV have faster VLDL-TG turnover rates and that postprandial TG response after lipid load is markedly reduced in these animals (10Schaap F.G. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Vrins C. van der Vliet H.N. Chamuleau R.A. Havekes L.M. Groen A.K. van Dijk K.W. J. Biol.

Both groups suggested an effect of apoAV on LPL-mediated plasma TG hydrolysis. However, the mechanism and possible involvement of other lipoproteins in this process remain unclear. Because apoCIII and apoAV have a directly opposing impact on plasma TGs, it has been proposed that the effects of apoAV could be mediated by apoCIII because genetic modifications of mice at the apoA1/C3/A4/A5 locus frequently result in changes of neighboring gene expression (12Vergnes L.

A possible effect of apoAV on apoCIII levels is further supported by the fact that human APOA5 transgenic (hAPOA5tr) mice had 40% decreased plasma levels of apoCIII, and apoa5-deficient mice (apoa5-/-) had 90% increased plasma levels of apoCIII (4Pennacchio L.A.

Bauge E. Akiyama J. Chang J. Afzal V. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E.M. Fruchart-Najib J. Pennacchio L.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to provide a model for the mechanism of apoAV action. Having ruled out effects of altered lipoprotein synthesis by metabolic studies in various genetically engineered mice, we used an assay employing lipoproteins isolated from these different genotypes and LPL, physiologically immobilized on HSPG, to demonstrate a profound apoAV-dependent difference in TG hydrolysis. Taken together, our findings prompt us to propose a model in which apoAV targets TG-rich lipoproteins to HSPG-bound LPL in the extracellular matrix, enhancing the efficiency of TG-rich lipoprotein hydrolysis. Animal Breeding—The origin of the different mouse lines is as follows: apoa5-deficient (apoa5-/-) and APOA5 transgenic (hAPOA5tr) mice were as described previously (4Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M.

They were fed a regular chow diet containing 4.5% of energy from fat with free access to food and water. Animal experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and approved by the Department of Veterinary Affairs of the State of Hamburg. According to their respective backgrounds, hAPOA5tr and apoa5-/- mice were bred with FVB mice, and hLPLtr and lpl+/- mice were bred with C57BL/6 mice. To obtain apoa5-/- mice with transgenic overexpression of human LPL, the hLPLtr line was crossed two times to the apoa5-deficient background. The final cross was apoa5 heterozygote (apoa5+/-) × apoa5+/- hLPLtr. To obtain lpl-deficient mice with transgenic overexpression of human APOA5, the hAPOA5tr line was crossed two times to the lpl+/- background. The final cross was lpl+/- × lpl+/- hAPOA5tr. Genotyping of Mutant Mice—Genotypes were determined by double PCRs from tail tip DNA. PCRs for hAPOA5tr and apoa5-/- mouse lines were reported previously (4Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A.

To determine the genotype at the mouse lpl locus, a three-primer PCR was used (15Levak-Frank S. Weinstock P.H. Hayek T. Hofmann W. Verdery R. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Biol.

Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—Blood was taken after 6 h of daytime fasting by puncture of the retro-orbital plexus. Plasma TGs and cholesterol were determined using commercial kits (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), which were adapted to microtiter plates. Lipoproteins were separated by sequential ultracentrifugation (18Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) using 60 μl of plasma from individual mice, and TGs and cholesterol were determined in the fractions. To analyze the lipoprotein profile, pooled mouse plasma was separated by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were analyzed by using a BCA test Kit (Pierce). Lipoprotein Production Studies—Anesthetized male mice received intravenous injection with 500 mg/kg Triton WR 1339 (tyloxapol; Sigma) using a 10% (w/v) solution. After 2 min, for hepatic VLDL production, 100 μCi of [2-3H]glycerol (Amersham Biosciences) were injected intravenously. For intestinal chylomicron production, animals were gavaged with 100 μl of olive oil containing 40 μCi of glycerol-tri-[1-14C]oleate (Amersham Biosciences). Animals were bled from the retro-orbital plexus at different time points. Lipids were extracted from serum samples (19Dole V.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was measured. In addition, the increase of plasma TGs was observed. Lipoprotein Turnover Studies—To observe turnover of plasma TGs, VLDL was isolated 60 min after in vivo labeling by injection of 500 μCi of [1-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences) associated with fatty acid-free albumin (Sigma) into mice of the respective genotype (20Aalto-Setala K.

To observe lipoprotein particle turnover, human chylomicrons from apo-CII-deficient donors or mouse VLDLs from different genotypes were labeled in vitro with the non-degradable protein label 125I-tyramine cellobiose as described previously (21Pittman R.C. Taylor Jr., C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For turnover studies, anesthetized mice (7–8 mice/group) received injection in their tail vein with radioactive particles (0.1–1 × 106 cpm of [3H]palmitic acid-TG-VLDL, 2 × 106 cpm of 125I-tyramine cellobiose VLDL or chylomicrons, respectively). Lipoprotein turnover was determined from 15 μl of plasma 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after injection. Data were analyzed for individual animals using a one- and two-pool exponential decay model, and the half-life for each label was calculated. After 30 min, blood was removed by cardiac puncture, the right atrium was opened, and the carcass was perfused through the left ventricle with 10 ml of PBS containing 10 units of heparin. Then, organs were explanted and weighed. For 3H measurements, organs were solubilized in 1.5 ml of Solvable (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 ml was counted in scintillation fluid. In one experiment, 50 μg/ml tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) or Me2SO was added to radiolabeled VLDL prior to injection. Plasma LPL Activity—LPL activity was determined in each mouse line using pre- and post-heparin plasma from age-matched male mice (8–10 weeks old). Fasting mice received a tail vein injection of 100 units/kg heparin (Liquemin; Hoffmann-La Roche). Blood was obtained by retro-orbital bleeding 5 min later, and plasma was frozen at -80 °C. Pre- and post-heparin plasma (5 μl) were assayed using an artificial glycerol tri-[1-14C]oleate-containing lipid emulsion as described previously (22Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To inhibit LPL activity of hepatic lipase, 1 m NaCl was added to independent samples. Antibodies, Recombinant apoAV, and Western and Ligand Blotting— Two polyclonal antisera against the human apoAV C terminus (synthetic peptide sequence HSLHDQGHSHLG) were produced in rabbits by standard methods (Eurogentec, Seraing/Liège, Belgium). Recombinant apoAV was produced using a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. R. O. Ryan (Oakland, CA) (23Beckstead J.A. Oda M.N. Martin D.D. Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Luty R. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9416-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For ligand blotting, different amounts of bovine LPL or apoAV were separated under non-reducing conditions by a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in buffer A (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.1% Tween) for 60 min at room temperature and then incubated with recombinant apoAV (50 ng/ml), recombinant apoE3 (500 ng/ml), or bovine LPL (200 ng/ml), respectively, in buffer A overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Immunodetection was carried out using our anti-apoAV primary polyclonal antiserum (1:2500), anti-apoE (Dako), or anti-LPL (5D2 1:1000; kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Brunzell, Seattle, WA), respectively. For Western blotting, 10 μg of delipidated VLDL were subjected to 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and apolipoproteins were detected (antibodies: apoB, Beckman-Coulter; apoAV, polyclonal antiserum; apoE, Acris; apoCIII, Biodesign International). Corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). The signal was detected with the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Hydrolysis of Lipoproteins—To investigate the hydrolysis rate of lipoproteins by proteoglycan-bound LPL, a previously described assay (24de Man F.H. de Beer F. van der Laarse A. Smelt A.H. Havekes L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2465-2472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was adapted to our requirements. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were incubated for 18h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg of HSPG (from the basement membrane of mouse sarcoma, Sigma H4777) per well in PBS. After washing three times with PBS, the wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% free fatty acid (FFA)-free bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C. Various amounts of bovine LPL (courtesy of Dr. G. Olivecrona, Umea, Sweden) in 0.1 m Tris, 20% glycerol, pH 8.5, were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the wells were washed again three times with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. VLDL was isolated from apoa5-/- or hAPOA5tr mice and adjusted to 1 mm TG concentration with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 1% FFA-free bovine serum albumin. Lipolysis was started by the addition of VLDL to the LPL-containing plates. In some cases, lipoproteins were incubated beforehand with recombinant human apoAV, bovine LPL, or HDL isolated from apoa5-/-, apoa5+/+, or hAPOA5tr mice, respectively. In some experiments, these incubated VLDL particles were re-isolated by ultracentrifugation before lipolysis. Lipolysis was stopped after 10 min by the addition of Triton X-100 (1% final concentration). FFA concentration was measured by using a commercial NEFA C Kit (WAKO Chemicals) adapted to 96-well microtiter plates. As a control, HSPG-coated microtiter plates were incubated with LPL as described and then treated with a solution of 2.4 units/ml heparinase I and heparinase III (both from Sigma), respectively. To compare hydrolysis of TG-rich particles by HSPG-bound LPL with hydrolysis rates of free LPL (liquid phase), all assays were performed in parallel with unbound LPL. For this, 96-well microtiter plates were blocked with PBS containing 1% FFA-free bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, VLDL produced as described above was incubated with various amounts of LPL. The reaction was stopped, and FFAs were measured as described. Hydrolysis of VLDL on CHO Cells—CHO-K1 cells expressing HSPG and HSPG-deficient CHO-745 cells (25Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) were seeded onto 24-well cell culture plates (75,000 cells/well). After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated with and without different amounts of LPL at 4 °C for 60 min. Non-bound LPL was removed by extensive PBS washes before the in vitro hydrolysis was started. Experiments were identically performed as described above with Tris-containing buffers replaced by PBS. After the reaction, the content of every well was transferred into a reaction tube containing Triton X-100 (1% final concentration), and FFAs were determined. Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise stated, results are given as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested using a two-tailed Student's t test or, if more than two groups were compared, with one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's Multiple Comparison Post Test. Analysis of turnover studies was carried out using the computer program Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Chylomicron and VLDL Production and Turnover Studies— To test whether apoAV-mediated reduction in TG was the result of the decreased production of TG-rich lipoproteins, intestinal production of chylomicron and hepatic production of VLDL were measured. For chylomicron production, wild-type and hAPOA5tr mice were gavaged with glycerol tri[1-14C]oleate in olive oil after inhibition of plasma hydrolysis with tyloxapol. Whereas the increasing plasma TGs were the result of both hepatic and intestinal production of TG-rich particles (Fig. 1A, circles), [1-14C]oleic acid in the plasma lipid fraction selectively represented intestinally derived chylomicrons. Up to 4 h, no differences were noted between wild-type and hAPOA5tr mice (Fig. 1A, triangles). For VLDL production, [3H]glycerol was injected 2 min after tyloxapol. The increase in plasma TG showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher production in the hAPOA5tr mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 1B, circles). There was no change in glycerol incorporation into newly assembled VLDL within 2 h (Fig. 1B, triangles). These results indicate that apoAV did not affect the production of TG-rich lipoproteins in either the liver or intestine. Because the production of TG-rich particles was not changed by transgenic apoAV, plasma catabolism of these particles was measured. Experiments using 125I-tyramin cellobiose-labeled human chylomicrons showed that chylomicron particles were removed significantly faster from plasma in hAPOA5tr mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 1C). Organ uptake revealed a significant increase in uptake into adipose tissue and a nonsignificant trend to higher uptake into the muscle and liver of hAPOA5tr mice (data not shown). To analyze VLDL plasma clearance, apoAV-deficient VLDLs were labeled at the TG portion in vivo by injecting [1-3H]palmitic acid into apoa5-deficient mice. After isolation, VLDL apolipoproteins were labeled in vitro with 125I-tyramin cellobiose. In both wild-type and hAPOA5tr mice, plasma removal of VLDL TG followed a one-phase exponential decay with significantly shorter half-life in hAPOA5tr compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1D, circles: wild-type mice, 3.8 ± 0.6 min; hAPOA5tr mice, 2.5 ± 0.8 min; p < 0.01). An organ uptake study completed after 10 min revealed that hAPOA5tr mice had a significantly increased uptake of VLDL fatty acids into muscle (+40%), heart (+150%), and adipose tissue (+95%). Plasma removal of 125I-tyramin cellobiose VLDL particles was significantly slower than TG removal but was also faster in hAPOA5tr mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 1D, triangles: wild-type mice, 6.7 ± 2.0 min; hAPOA5tr mice, 4.2 ± 1.0 min; p < 0.01). ApoAV-mediated acceleration of removal of TG was seen earlier (greatest differences were seen after 2 and 5 min) than that of 125I-tyramin cellobiose particles (greatest differences were seen after 5–20 min). These data show that hAPOA5tr mice have a faster plasma hydrolysis of TG-rich particles and a more rapid organ uptake of remnant particles. To investigate whether apoAV can accelerate VLDL turnover independent of plasma LPL hydrolysis, the LPL inhibitor THL and, after 2 min, in vivo labeled apoAV-deficient VLDL were injected into wild-type and hAPOA5tr mice. As seen above, VLDL catabolism was faster in hAPOA5tr mice compared with wild-type mice without THL (Fig. 1E, circles). However, after administration of THL, catabolism of VLDL TG as well as the differences between the genotypes was completely abolished (Fig. 1E, squares). Furthermore, to test whether the apoAV-mediated acceleration of plasma TG hydrolysis in vivo was really due to apoAV and not the result of other changes in other lipoprotein composition, VLDL from apoa5-/- mice was labeled in vivo with 3H-TG and incubated with PBS or 30 μg/ml recombinant apoAV, and these particles were then injected into apoa5-/-mice. The turnover of VLDL particles supplemented with apoAV was significantly faster compared with apoAV-deficient VLDL in these mice (Fig. 1F). Taken together, apoAV did not influence synthesis of chylomicrons and VLDL but accelerated catabolism of both lipoproteins. ApoAV triggered these effects independently of other apolipoproteins but required active LPL. Interaction of apoAV and LPL in Vivo—Because the effect of apoAV on the catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins turned out to be dependent on LPL, interactions between apoAV and LPL were investigated by cross-breeding apoa5-/- mice with hLPLtr mice. From the final cross (apoa5+/- × apoa5+/- hLPLtr), all expected genotypes were obtained (apoa5-/-, apoa5+/-, and apoa5+/+; each without and with transgenic hLPL, respectively). LPL was able to decrease plasma TG by 69% (Fig. 2A) and VLDL TG by 78% (Fig. 2B) on the apoa5-/- background. This TG-lowering effect of LPL was less pronounced, although highly significant, on the apoa5+/- and apoa5+/+ (wild-type) backgrounds. To produce LPL-deficient mice with transgenic overexpression of human apoAV, the hAPOA5tr line was crossed onto the LPL-deficient background. From the final cross (lpl+/- × lpl+/- hAPOA5tr), all lpl-/- mice died within 24 h, regardless of apoAV expression. All other genotypes (lpl+/-, lpl+/- hAPOA5tr, lpl+/+ and lpl+/+ hAPOA5tr) were present as expected. On both the lpl+/- and lpl+/+ backgrounds, apoAV significantly decreased plasma TG (by 31% and 22%; Fig. 2C) and VLDL TG (by 29% and 28%; Fig. 2D). To test the hypothesis that apoAV increases the catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins by enhancing LPL activity in vivo, pre- and post-heparin LPL activity were measured in different apoa5 genotypes. There were no changes in pre- or post-heparin LPL activity among apoa5-/-, apoa5+/-, apoa5+/+, and hAPOA5tr mice (Fig. 3A). These emulsion-based lipolytic activity measurements were validated by control experiments (Fig. 3B), in which lpl+/-, lpl+/+, and hLPLtr mice showed the expected changes in post-heparin LPL activity. Taken together, these data suggest that increased LPL activity completely compensated for apoa5 deficiency, whereas human apoAV overproduction only slightly modulated TG, even if LPL activity was decreased. This suggests that LPL plays the primary role in plasma hydrolysis, but this process can be modulated by apoAV. However, there is no evidence for a direct activation of LPL by apoAV in post-heparin plasma. VLDL Hydrolysis by Free and HSPG-bound LPL—Because LPL is detached from HSPG after heparin treatment, post-heparin plasma does not resemble the physiological environment of LPL at the vascular endothelium. To analyze the potential interaction between apoAV and LPL on a matrix mimicking the endothelium, a previously described assay (24de Man F.H. de Beer F. van der Laarse A. Smelt A.H. Havekes L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2465-2472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to measure lipolytic activity in a system that was composed of free or HSPG-bound LPL was adapted. In the first set of experiments, VLDLs from hAPOA5tr and apoa5-/- mice were used to further approximate the physiological situation. These lipoprot"

We present results from use of a previously unknown method for characterizing the rheological response of nanometer-thick polymer films. The method relies on the imaging capabilities of the atomic force microscope and the reduction in size of the classical bubble inflation method of measuring the biaxial creep response of ultrathin polymer films. Creep compliance as a function of time and temperature was measured in the linear viscoelastic regime for films of poly(vinyl acetate) at a thickness of 27.5 nanometers. Although little evidence for a change in the glass temperature is found, the material exhibits previously unobserved stiffening in the rubbery response regime."

https://openalex.org/W2078752695,"The adherence of Candida glabrata to host cells is mediated, at least in part, by the EPA genes, a family of adhesins encoded at subtelomeric loci, where they are subject to transcriptional silencing. We show that normally silent EPA genes are expressed during murine urinary tract infection (UTI) and that the inducing signal is the limitation of nicotinic acid (NA), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). C. glabrata is an NA auxotroph, and NA-induced EPA expression is likely the result of a reduction in NAD+ availability for the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2p. The adaptation of C. glabrata to the host, therefore, involves a loss of metabolic capacity and exploitation of the resulting auxotrophy to signal a particular host environment."
https://openalex.org/W2093325895,"Coordination of cytokinesis with chromosome congression and segregation is critical for proper cell division, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, septins, a conserved family of polymerizing guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, localized to the metaphase plate during mitosis. Septin depletion resulted in chromosome loss from the metaphase plate, lack of chromosome segregation and spindle elongation, and incomplete cytokinesis upon delayed mitotic exit. These defects correlated with loss of the mitotic motor and the checkpoint regulator centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) from the kinetochores of congressing chromosomes. Mammalian septins may thus form a mitotic scaffold for CENP-E and other effectors to coordinate cytokinesis with chromosome congression and segregation."

This requires continuous intervention and raises a natural question: Can origami arise through self-organization? We answer this affirmatively by examining the possible physical origin for the Miura-ori leaf-folding patterns that arise naturally in insect wings, leaves, and other laminae-like organelles. In particular, we point out examples where biaxial compression of an elastically supported thin film, such as that due to differential growth, shrinkage, desiccation, or thermal expansion, spontaneously generates these patterns, and we provide a simple theoretical explanation for their occurrence."

We show that O 2 secretion into the swimbladder evolved some 100 million years after another O 2 -secreting system in the eye. We unravel the likely sequence in which the functional components of both systems evolved. These components include ocular and swimbladder countercurrent exchangers, the Bohr and Root effects, the buffering power and surface histidine content of hemoglobins, and red blood cell Na + /H + exchange activity. Our synthesis reveals the dynamics of gains and losses of these multiple traits over time, accounting for part of the huge diversity of form and function in living fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2121680569,"The requirement for notch signaling during vascular development is well-documented but poorly understood. Embryonic and adult endothelial cells (EC) express notch and notch ligands; however, the necessity for cell-autonomous notch signaling during angiogenesis has not been determined. During angiogenesis, EC display plasticity, whereby a subset of previously quiescent cells loses polarity and becomes migratory. To investigate the role of notch in EC, we have used a three-dimensional in vitro system that models all of the early steps of angiogenesis. We find that newly forming sprouts are composed of specialized tip cells that guide the sprout and trunk cells that proliferate and rearrange to form intercellular lumens. Furthermore, we find that notch acts cell-autonomously to suppress EC proliferation, thereby regulating tube diameter. In addition, when notch signaling is blocked, tip cells divide, and both daughter cells take on a tip cell phenotype, resulting in increased branching through vessel bifurcation. In contrast, notch signaling is not required for re-establishment of EC polarity or for lumen formation. Thus, notch is used reiteratively and cell-autonomously by EC to regulate vessel diameter, to limit branching at the tip of sprouts, and to establish a mature, quiescent phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1995254751,The efficacy and short-term modification of neocortical synaptic connections vary with the type of target neuron. We investigated presynaptic Ca2+ and release probability at single synaptic contacts between pairs of neurons in layer 2/3 of the rat neocortex. The amplitude of Ca2+ signals in boutons of pyramids contacting bitufted or multipolar interneurons or other pyramids was dependent on the target cell type. Optical quantal analysis at single synaptic contacts suggested that release probabilities are also target cell-specific. Both the Ca2+ signal and the release probability of different boutons of a pyramid contacting the same target cell varied little. We propose that the mechanisms that regulate the functional properties of boutons of a pyramid normalize the presynaptic Ca2+ influx and release probability for all those boutons that innervate the same target cell.

https://openalex.org/W1981033063,"Recent studies indicate that insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes result from the accumulation of lipids in tissues not suited for fat storage, such as skeletal muscle and the liver. To elucidate the mechanisms linking exogenous fats to the inhibition of insulin action, we evaluated the effects of free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin signal transduction in cultured C2C12 myotubes. As we described previously (Chavez, J. A., and Summers, S. A. (2003) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 419, 101-109), long-chain saturated FFAs inhibited insulin stimulation of Akt/protein kinase B, a central regulator of glucose uptake and anabolic metabolism. Moreover, these FFAs stimulated the de novo synthesis of ceramide and sphingosine, two sphingolipids shown previously to inhibit insulin action. To determine the contribution of either sphingolipid in FFA-dependent inhibition of insulin action, we generated C2C12 myotubes that constitutively overexpress acid ceramidase (AC), an enzyme that catalyzes the lysosomal conversion of ceramide to sphingosine. AC overexpression negated the inhibitory effects of saturated FFAs on insulin signaling while blocking their stimulation of ceramide accumulation. By contrast, AC overexpression stimulated the accrual of sphingosine. These results support a role for aberrant accumulation of ceramide, but not sphingosine, in the inhibition of muscle insulin sensitivity by exogenous FFAs."
https://openalex.org/W2004175200,"The endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by a complex pattern of post-translational modifications. In these studies, we show that eNOS is dynamically regulated by S-nitrosylation, the covalent adduction of nitric oxide (NO)-derived nitrosyl groups to the cysteine thiols of proteins. We report that eNOS is tonically S-nitrosylated in resting bovine aortic endothelial cells and that the enzyme undergoes rapid transient denitrosylation after addition of the eNOS agonist, vascular endothelial growth factor. eNOS is thereafter progressively renitrosylated to basal levels. The receptor-mediated decrease in eNOS S-nitrosylation is inversely related to enzyme phosphorylation at Ser1179, a site associated with eNOS activation. We also document that targeting of eNOS to the cell membrane is required for eNOS S-nitrosylation. Acylation-deficient mutant eNOS, which is targeted to the cytosol, does not undergo S-nitrosylation. Using purified eNOS, we show that eNOS S-nitrosylation by exogenous NO donors inhibits enzyme activity and that eNOS inhibition is reversed by denitrosylation. We determine that the cysteines of the zinc-tetrathiolate that comprise the eNOS dimer interface are the targets of S-nitrosylation. Mutation of the zinc-tetrathiolate cysteines eliminates eNOS S-nitrosylation but does not eliminate NO synthase activity, arguing strongly that disruption of the zinc-tetrathiolate does not necessarily lead to eNOS monomerization in vivo.

Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mammals, NO is synthesized by three synthases responsible for (patho)physiologic NO signaling in the immune, neurological, and cardiovascular systems (reviewed in Ref. 2Andrew P.J. Mayer B.

Similar to all NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, eNOS functions as an obligate homodimer through an association mediated by a cysteine-complexed Zn2+ (zinc-tetrathiolate) at the dimer interface (4Raman C.S.

In its canonical signaling role, NO acts as an intracellular messenger that increases cGMP concentration in target cells by activating guanylate cyclases (9Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, NO is also believed to signal through a guanylate cyclase-independent mechanism mediated by the interaction of reactive nitrogen oxides with the reduced cysteines of proteins, forming cysteine S-nitrosothiols that can effect changes in protein function (10Martinez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This process has been termed “S-nitrosylation” and appears to be a physiologically significant post-translational modification with functional consequences for signal protein activity (reviewed in Ref. 11Stamler J.S.

In this paper, we report that eNOS is tonically S-nitrosylated in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and that the enzyme undergoes rapid transient denitrosylation after the addition of the eNOS agonist, VEGF or insulin. eNOS is thereafter progressively renitrosylated on a time course parallel to that of its return to resting activity levels after receptor-mediated activation. These studies also provide evidence that eNOS S-nitrosylation reversibly attenuates enzyme activity and identify a potentially important pathway for eNOS regulation.

Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—BAEC were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in culture on gelatin-coated 100-mm culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and penicillin-streptomycin (2%). Experiments were performed with cells between passages 5 and 8. Cultures were serum-starved overnight before experiments and drug treatments were performed as described (13Igarashi J. Erwin P.A.

COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained on uncoated culture dishes in the same medium as BAEC (14Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol.

Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The plasmid pKENH encoding HA epitope-tagged wild-type bovine eNOS cDNA (GenBank™ accession number M89952 (46Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar)), its parent plasmid pBKCMV (Stratagene), and eNOS cDNA constructs containing mutations at Ser116 and Ser1179 have been described previously (15Robinson L.J.

Plasmids encoding eNOS mutants deficient in myristoylation (eNOSmyr–) and palmitoylation (eNOSpalm–) have been previously characterized in detail (12Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). pKENH served as the template for creation of eNOS constructs where Cys96 and/or Cys101 were mutated to Ser by PCR mutagenesis using a two-step approach (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Online. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). In the first step, one fragment was generated with the forward primer for the specific mutation site (described below) plus the reverse primer that subtends the eNOS BglII site (5′-TGAGGCAGAGATCTTCACCG-3′). The second fragment was generated with the reverse mutant primer (see below) plus the forward primer subtending the EcoRI site in the polylinker of the plasmid (5′-CGCGAATTCGAAGGAGCCAC-CATGGGCAACTTGAAGAG-3′). The two fragments were then mixed, and the final product was amplified using the EcoRI and BglII primers. The primer sequences for PCR-directed mutagenesis of eNOS Cys96 to Ser were: forward, 5′-GGCCCAGCACTCCCAGGTGCTGCCTGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCAGGCAGCACCTGGGAGTGCTGGGCC-3′. For mutagenesis of eNOS Cys101 to Ser, the primer sequences were: forward, 5′-GGCCCTGCACTCCCAGGTGCAGCCTGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCAGGCTGCACCTGGGAGTGCAGGGCC-3′. To create the double-mutant, eNOSC96S/C101S, eNOSC96S was used as the template for the primers: forward, 5′-GGCCCAGCACTCCCAGGTGCAGCCTGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCAGGCTGCACCTGGGAGTGCTGGGCC-3′. After molecular cloning of the fragments back into the EcoRI/BglII-restricted parental plasmid, the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by standard dideoxynucleotide-sequencing methods (University of Maine DNA Sequencing Laboratory). BAEC and COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid encoding a fusion of eNOS to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eNOS-EGFP) has been described previously (19Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cellular Lysates and Immunoprecipitation—100-mm dishes of cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping cells into 1 ml of lysis buffer comprised of Tris (20 mm, pH 7.4), Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v), deoxycholate (2.5% w/v), NaCl (150 mm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), EDTA (1 mm), NaF (1 mm), and neocuproine (100 μm) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (17Bernier S.G. Haldar S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30707-30715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. A 1:100 dilution of eNOS polyclonal anti-serum or 4 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was incubated with 1 ml of the supernatants at 4 °C with rocking for 1–16 h. After the addition of protein-A/G-agarose and another hour of rocking at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer. eNOS was then eluted from the beads and biotinylated according to the biotin switch method essentially as described (21Kim J.-E. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 9758-9764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or released for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot by boiling in SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (19Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The biotin switch-processed eNOS was then separated by low temperature non-reducing SDS-PAGE for Western blot with avidin-HRP (21Kim J.-E. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 9758-9764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or concentrated further with streptavidinagarose, eluted by boiling with SDS-sample buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions for immunoblot against eNOS as described previously (22Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PL1Google Scholar). All of the steps before biotinylation were performed under low light conditions. Analysis of eNOS Dimer Stability—The thermal stability profile of recombinant eNOS expressed in COS-7 cells was determined using low temperature SDS-PAGE essentially as described (23Venema R.C. Ju H. Zou R. Ryan J.W. Venema V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The lysates were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids encoding recombinant eNOS by scraping the cells into lysis buffer as described above, except that rocking of the lysates at 4 °C was done for 15 min and centrifugation was conducted for 5 min (17Bernier S.G. Haldar S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30707-30715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The supernatants were then mixed with SDS-sample buffer and incubated for 30 min at 0, 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C before low temperature SDS-PAGE (23Venema R.C. Ju H. Zou R. Ryan J.W. Venema V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Western Blots—After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. To detect biotinylated eNOS, these nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 before incubation with avidin-HRP in 5% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because the gels that are used to detect biotinylated proteins are electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions, the protein bands tend to bend and blur more than with standard reducing SDS-PAGE. To detect total eNOS after blotting with avidin-HRP, membranes were stripped using the Immunopure IgG elution buffer for 24 h at room temperature. All of the immunoblots were performed as described previously (13Igarashi J. Erwin P.A. Dantas A.P.V. Chen H. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10664-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Stripping of immunoblots for reblotting was performed with ReBlot antibody stripping solution from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Densitometric analyses of autoradiographs were done using a ChemiImager 400 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Subcellular Fractionation and Measurement of eNOS Activity— eNOS activity was analyzed either in lysates or subcellular fractions prepared from 100-mm dishes of transfected COS-7 cells. Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described with the exception that 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin was added to the cell harvest buffer (buffer 1) comprised of Tris (50 mm, pH 7.4), EDTA (0.1 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (2 mm) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (24Prabhakar P. Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of lysates (2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), resuspension in buffer 1, and 10-s sonication using a Branson 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT) at 20% nominal converter amplitude, the particulate and soluble fractions were resolved by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min) and the particulate fraction was resuspended in an equal volume of buffer 1 (24Prabhakar P. Cheng V. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and eNOS activity was determined by measuring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline by anion-exchange chromatography, essentially as described with the exception that the reaction mixture did not contain dithiothreitol and incubation in the reaction mixture was at 30 °C for 30 min (25Balligand J.L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L. O'Hara D.S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14582-14586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Activity assays of purified eNOS isolated from a baculovirus expression system were performed as described previously (26Busconi L. Michel T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 655-659PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—BAEC grown on coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding eNOS-EGFP and HA-tagged eNOSC96S/C101S at 50–60% confluence using FuGENE 6. Cell fixing, permeabilization, incubation with polyclonal anti-HA antibody (1:250 dilution), Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:850 dilution), mounting, and imaging at the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School were performed as described previously (27Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Images were processed using two-dimensional no-neighbors deconvolution by MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, Downington, PA) before three-dimensional reconstruction. Other Methods—Mean values for individual experiments are plotted ± S.E. Data plotting and statistical analyses (ANOVA) were performed using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Dynamic eNOS S-Nitrosylation in Endothelial Cells—Our initial experiments explored the hypothesis that eNOS is S-nitrosylated in endothelial cells. We exploited a method developed to detect endogenously S-nitrosylated proteins in cell lysates by biotinylation. After blocking free protein sulfhydryls with methyl methanethiosulphonate, the cell lysates are treated with ascorbate to reduce S-nitrosothiols, which are then labeled with a biotinylated active site reagent (28Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). This “biotin switch” approach allows for reliable detection of protein S-nitrosothiols by Western blot analyses. We found that when eNOS from resting BAEC is processed by the biotin switch method, a robust signal is detected in Western blots probed with avidin-HRP. We then performed characterizations of agonist-induced changes in eNOS S-nitrosylation using VEGF because of its robust eNOS agonist activity (29Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). We had initially anticipated that eNOS S-nitrosylation might increase when the enzyme was activated, but we found that when BAEC are treated with VEGF (10 ng/ml for 5 min) and that eNOS S-nitrosylation reproducibly disappears (n = 7). As shown in Fig. 1A, we performed a time course of VEGF treatments to further analyze changes in eNOS S-nitrosylation. We found that eNOS in resting BAEC is S-nitrosylated and that the enzyme undergoes rapid denitrosylation after 5 min of VEGF-treatment. After this nadir of S-nitrosylation, eNOS is progressively renitrosylated back to basal levels over ∼60 min. Treatment of BAEC with insulin, a less robust eNOS agonist (30Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30821-30827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), produces comparable results (Fig. 1B). We chose to focus on analyses of eNOS S-nitrosylation responses to VEGF, because this agonist has been characterized extensively as a potent eNOS agonist in these cells (31Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). eNOS Renitrosylation Requires NO Synthase Activity—The renitrosylation of eNOS after agonist-modulated denitrosylation suggested to us that eNOS S-nitrosylation is dependent on eNOS activity. To test the dependence of eNOS S-nitrosylation on NOS activity, we pretreated BAEC with the NOS inhibitor N-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMA, 5 mm, 1 h) and then added VEGF (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle for 1 h before harvesting eNOS for biotin switch (32Griffith O.W. Kilbourn R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 375-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of BAEC with l-NMA neither substantively decreases the level of basal eNOS S-nitrosylation nor blocks agonist-induced denitrosylation. However, as shown in Fig. 1C, l-NMA significantly attenuated the extent of renitrosylation of the enzyme after agonist treatment (n = 3, p < 0.05). eNOS Phosphorylation, Subcellular Targeting, and S-Nitrosylation—In parallel with our analyses of dynamic changes in eNOS S-nitrosylation, BAEC were also analyzed for VEGF-modulated changes of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179. Phosphorylation at Ser1179 is correlated with VEGF-modulated increases in eNOS activity and can be blocked by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (29Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 31Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the time course of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179 was inversely related to the extent of eNOS S-nitrosylation (Fig. 1A). Because agonist-induced changes in the pattern of eNOS phosphorylation are influenced by eNOS subcellular localization (19Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we decided to explore the relations among eNOS phosphorylation, subcellular targeting, and S-nitrosylation. We first explored whether mutation of important eNOS phosphoresidues to “phosphonull” Ala or “phosphomimetic” Asp had any effect on eNOS S-nitrosylation. After immunoprecipitation of the eNOS mutants from lysates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells, eNOS was biotinylated by the biotin switch method, concentrated using streptavidin-agarose, and eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer (22Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PL1Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylated eNOS was then detected in immunoblots probed with eNOS antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, biotin switch analyses of eNOS mutants at Ser116 and Ser1179 (sites of agonist-modulated dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively) revealed no substantive differences in S-nitrosylation compared with wild-type eNOS (Fig. 2B) (16Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). We also explored the influence of eNOS targeting on enzyme S-nitrosylation by transfecting COS-7 cells with cDNA encoding wild-type eNOS, which is membrane-associated, with an acylation-deficient eNOS mutant (eNOSmyr–) that is targeted exclusively to the cytosol or with a palmitoylation-deficient eNOS (eNOSpalm–) that has an intermediate phenotype (19Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, when eNOSmyr– is immunoprecipitated from transfected COS-7 cell lysates and processed by the biotin switch method, almost no S-nitrosylation signal is detected, in contrast to the robust signal of wild-type eNOS (91 ± 0.1% decrease in S-nitrosylation for the eNOSmyr– mutant relative to wild-type eNOS, n = 3, p < 0.001). The palmitoylation-deficient eNOS (eNOSpalm–) mutant showed levels of S-nitrosylation that were not substantively different from the wild-type eNOS in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B). There is no substantive difference between the NO synthase activity levels of wild-type eNOS and eNOSmyr– in lysates prepared from transfected COS-7 cells (data not shown and Refs. 12Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lin S. Fagan K.A. Li K.X. Shaul P.W. Cooper D.M. Rodman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17979-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation Inhibits eNOS Activity—We next performed experiments using eNOS purified to homogeneity from a baculovirus expression system to explore whether S-nitrosylation regulates eNOS activity (26Busconi L. Michel T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 655-659PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of purified eNOS with 10 mm ascorbate (which reduces nitrosothiols) enhances eNOS activity to 120 ± 0.1% control sample activity (n = 4, p < 0.001) while reducing eNOS S-nitrosylation intensity to 51 ± 0.1% control (n = 3, p < 0.02). The NO donor DEA/NO (50 μm) attenuates eNOS enzyme activity to 65 ± 0.1% control levels (n = 4, p < 0.001), whereas eNOS S-nitrosylation levels increased to 117 ± 0.1% control sample intensity (n = 3, p < 0.02). The addition of ascorbate (10 mm) to the reaction containing S-nitrosylated eNOS significantly relieved the enzyme inhibition induced by DEA/NO, returning it to 81 ± 0.1% of the control (eNOS plus aged DEA/NO) activity level (n = 4, p < 0.001) and reducing S-nitrosylation levels to 89 ± 0.2% of the control (n = 3, p < 0.02). Identification of eNOS S-Nitrosylated Cysteines—In our next series of experiments, we sought to identify the specific sites of eNOS S-nitrosylation. The zinc-tetrathiolate motif present in eNOS has been proposed as an S-nitrosylation target (4Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and a recent report (34Ravi K. Brennan L.A. Levic S. Ross P.A. Black S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) has confirmed this possibility, showing that eNOS releases Zn2+ and is inactivated by treatment with exogenous NO donors in vitro. We hypothesized that the cysteines comprising eNOS zinc-tetrathiolate complex (Cys96 and Cys101 of each subunit) are the targets of endogenous S-nitrosylation and used PCR-directed mutagenesis to construct site-specific mutants of eNOS, changing the cysteines individually and collectively to serine. We used the biotin switch method to test for S-nitrosylation of eNOS mutants at Cys96 and/or Cys101. As shown in Fig. 4A,"
https://openalex.org/W1968660175,"During animal development, epithelial cell fates are specified according to spatial position by extracellular signaling pathways. Among these, the transforming growth factor beta/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-beta/BMP) pathways are evolutionarily conserved and play crucial roles in the development and homeostasis of a wide range of multicellular tissues. Here we show that in the developing Drosophila wing imaginal epithelium, cell clones deprived of the BMP-like ligand Decapentaplegic (DPP) do not die as previously thought but rather extrude from the cell layer as viable cysts exhibiting marked abnormalities in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization. We propose that in addition to assigning cell fates, a crucial developmental function of DPP/BMP signaling is the position-specific control of epithelial architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2043513860,"Free fatty acids (FFAs) provide an important energy source and also act as signaling molecules. FFAs are known to exert a variety of physiological responses via their G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the GPR40 family. Recently, we identified a novel FFA receptor, GPR120, that promotes secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (Hirasawa, A., Tsumaya, K., Awaji, T., Katsuma, S., Adachi, T., Yamada, M., Sugimoto, Y., Miyazaki, S., and Tsujimoto, G. (2005) Nat. Med. 11, 90-94). Here we showed that FFAs inhibit serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of murine enteroendocrine STC-1 cells, which express two types of GPCRs, GPR120 and GPR40, for unsaturated long chain FFA. We first found that linolenic acid potently activated ERK and Akt/protein kinase B (Akt) in STC-1 cells. ERK kinase inhibitors significantly reduced the anti-apoptotic effects of linolenic acid. Inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a major target of which is Akt, significantly reduced the anti-apoptotic effects. Transfection of STC-1 cells with the dominant-negative form of Akt also inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect. These results suggested that the activation of ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways is required for FFA-induced anti-apoptotic effects on STC-1 cells. Transient transfection of STC-1 cells with GPR120 cDNA, but not GPR40 cDNA, enhanced inhibition of caspase-3 activation. RNA interference experiments showed that reduced expression of GPR120, but not GPR40, resulted in reduced ERK activation and reduced effects of FFAs on caspase-3 inhibition. Collectively, these results demonstrated that FFAs promote the activation of ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways mainly via GPR120, leading to the anti-apoptotic effect of STC-1 cells.

For example, impairment of insulin-mediated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in muscle (1Thompson A.L. Lim-Fraser M.Y. Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Am. J.

However, it is also suggested that FFAs may act as ligands for cell-surface receptors because fatty acid derivatives, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, have their specific cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (3Coleman R.A.

Pharmacological analysis of GPR40 and its tissue distribution suggested that GPR40 is abundantly expressed in the pancreas as a functional receptor for long chain FFAs and that FFAs amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells by activating GPR40 (5Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. Tanaka H. Maruyama M. Satoh R. Okubo S. Kizawa H. Komatsu H. Matsumura F. Noguchi Y. Shinohara T. Hinuma S. Fujisawa Y. Fujino M. Nature. 2003; 422: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated very recently (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar) that an orphan GPCR, GPR120, which is abundantly expressed in intestine, functions as a receptor for unsaturated long chain FFAs. Furthermore, we showed that the stimulation of GPR120 by FFAs promotes the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1Thompson A.L. Lim-Fraser M.Y. Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E577-E584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). However, other physiological functions of GPR120 triggered by FFA stimulation are uncertain. In the present study, we show that unsaturated long chain FFAs, such as linolenic acid, inhibit apoptosis of a murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1 under serum-free conditions. Also, we reveal that inhibition of apoptosis by the FFAs of STC-1 cells is mediated through GPR120. This is the first real evidence that FFA-induced apoptosis inhibition is mediated through GPCR. Materials—Fatty acids and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were obtained from Sigma. U0126, PD98059, SB203580, U73122, U73343, LY294002, wortmannin, and forskolin were purchased form Calbiochem. SP600125 was from Biomol. Pertussis toxin (PT) was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Culture and Treatment—We used a murine enteroendocrine cell line STC-1, an immortalized mouse cell line derived from small bowel endocrine tumors, that arose as a consequence of the mating of two independent transgenic mouse lines, rat insulin promoter simian virus 40 Tag × rat insulin promoter-polyoma small Tag (11Sidhu S.S. Thompson D.G. Warhurst G. Case R.M. Benson R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 528: 165-176Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). STC-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% (v/v) horse serum (HS) and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS. STC-1 cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with or without fatty acids. After 24 h of treatment, we used the WST-1 assay kit (Roche Applied Science) to assess viable cell numbers. Total RNA was isolated using Isogen (Nippon Gene) and subjected to RT-PCR. Each FFA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO was adjusted to 0.1% (v/v). FFAs were added to serum-free medium and then sonicated just before use, and the resulting medium was used as serum-free, FFA-containing medium. The medium containing the same amount of Me2SO was used as the control. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The activity of caspase-3 was determined by the EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions (12Katsuma S. Hada Y. Ueda T. Shiojima S. Hirasawa A. Tanoue A. Takagaki K. Ohgi T. Yano J. Tsujimoto G. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with the indicated reagents. Five hours later, the cells were collected and lysed, and caspase-3 activity in the extracts was measured. DNA Fragmentation Assay—DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions (12Katsuma S. Hada Y. Ueda T. Shiojima S. Hirasawa A. Tanoue A. Takagaki K. Ohgi T. Yano J. Tsujimoto G. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, STC-1 cells, cultured in 24-well culture plates, were treated with the indicated reagents. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and enzyme immunoassay using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones was carried out to detect mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmatic fraction of cell lysates. The absorbance was normalized by the total cell number after 24 h of treatment. Plasmids and Transfection—Plasmids were transfected into STC-1 cells using Lipofectamine PLUS or Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). One or 2 days after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h, treated with the indicated reagents, and caspase-3 activity measured as described above. Expression plasmids containing murine GPR120 and GPR40 genes were constructed as described previously (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). pCMV-Gαq, pCMV-GαqQ209L, pCMV-βARK1nt, and pCMV-βARK1ct were kindly provided by J. Yamauchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). Plasmids containing the dominant-negative (DN) JNK and p38 were kindly provided by Y. Izumi (Osaka City Medical School) and S. Mitsuyama (Kumamoto University) (13Izumi Y. Kim S. Namba M. Yasumoto H. Miyazaki H. Hoshiga M. Kaneda Y. Morishita R. Zhan Y. Iwao H. Circ.

The truncated form of Akt (DN-Akt, amino acids 1-147) was isolated from STC-1 cells and cloned into pIRES-neo expression vector (Clontech). Transfection of STC-1 Cells with Short Hairpin RNA Expression Vector—DNA oligonucleotides targeting GPR120 and GPR40 were synthesized and inserted into the short interfering RNA expression vector pSilencer1.0 (Ambion) as described previously (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into STC-1 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were examined for GPR120 and GPR40 mRNA levels by real time RT-PCR. Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed and used for real time PCR analysis by using the DNA Engine Opticon2 System (MJ Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers were as follows: for mouse GPR120, mGPR120-1, 5′-GCATAGGAGAAATCTCATGG-3′; mGPR120-2, 5′-GAGTTGGCAAACGTGAAGGC-3′; for mouse GPR40, GPR40-2, 5′-AGTCCTCGTCACACATATTG-3′; GPR40-3, 5′-AATGCCTCCAATGTGGATAG-3′; for mouse early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1), mEgr-1, 5′-ACGACAGCAGTCCCATCTAC-3′; mEgr-2, 5′-GTTACGCATGCAGATTCGAC-3′; for mouse GAPDH, mGAPDH-1, 5′-TGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC-3′; mGAPD-H-4, 5′-TTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAAC-3′; for human GPR120, hGPR-120-1, 5′-TGGTCATTGTGATCAGTTAC-3′; hGPR120-4, 5′-CATTCCTGCACAGTGTCATG-3′; for human GPR40, hGPR40-1, 5′-TCAGCCTCTCTCTCCTGCTC-3′; hGPR40-4, 5′-CGCACACACTGTCTTCAGGC-3′; for human GAPDH, hGAPDH-1, 5′-TCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCC-3′; and hGAPDH-4, 5′-TTGAAGTCAGAGGAGACCAC-3′. Western Blotting—Activation of ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and Akt in STC-1 cells was assayed by Western blotting as described previously (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with 100 μm of each FFA. After 10 min of stimulation, total cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting using anti-phospho- and anti-total kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Measurement of cAMP Formation—cAMP levels in STC-1 cells were determined as reported previously (15Hatae N. Kita A. Tanaka S. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17977-17981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of test agents along with 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The level of cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay with a cAMP assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate treatment effects. If the analysis of variance value was significant, comparisons between the control and treatment group were performed using analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test to localize the significant difference. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistics were run with InStat 2.00 (GraphPad Software). Free Fatty Acids Enhance Cell Survival of Serum-starved STC-1 Cells—We first examined the effects of saturated and unsaturated FFAs with a chain length of C12 to C22 on cell survival of murine enteroendocrine STC-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, linolenic acid (C18:3), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) markedly promoted cell survival of serum-starved STC-1 cells at 100 μm. Arachidonic acid (C20:4) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) had a moderate effect. Myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16), stearic acid (C18), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3) exhibited a small positive effect on cell survival. Medium chain fatty acids, octanoic acid (C8) and lauric acid (C12), and saturated long chain fatty acids, arachidic acid (C20) and docosanoic acid (C22), did not show any positive effects upon cell survival. In this condition, we did not observe changes in the total number of STC-1 cells by treatment with linolenic acid or palmitoleic acid (data not shown). In addition, we examined this cell survival effect using various doses of linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (1-100 μm), and we found that stimulation of these unsaturated FFAs increased viable cell number in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that saturated FFAs with a chain length of C14 to C18 and mono- and polyunsaturated FFAs of C16 to C22 enhance cell survival of serum-starved STC-1 cells. Free Fatty Acids Inhibit Caspase-3 Activity of Serum-starved STC-1 Cells—The enhanced cell survival of serum-starved STC-1 cells by FFAs could be explained by anti-apoptotic effects. We therefore measured caspase-3 activity that is responsible for apoptosis induction in most cell types. As shown in Fig. 2A,at100 μm, linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid markedly promoted the inhibition of caspase-3 activity in serum-starved STC-1 cells (about 30-40% inhibition of caspase-3 activity). Oleic acid, linoleic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid had little effect (about 10-20% inhibition). Other fatty acids did not show any positive effects on caspase-3 activity after 5 h of stimulation. In addition, we examined this inhibition using various doses of linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (1-100 μm), and we demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effect increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that mono- and polyunsaturated FFAs of C16 to C22 significantly enhance the inhibition of caspase-3 activity in serum-starved STC-1 cells. Free Fatty Acids Inhibit DNA Fragmentation of Serum-starved STC-1 Cells—We next examined the effects of FFAs on serum deprivation-induced DNA fragmentation, which constitutes the final cellular event during apoptosis. DNA fragmentation was assessed quantitatively by an ELISA-based method using anti-histone and anti-DNA antibodies. The results of this analysis showed that at 100 μm, linolenic acid and palmitoleic acid markedly promoted inhibition of DNA fragmentation of serum-starved STC-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Oleic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid had a little effect. Other fatty acids did not show any effects upon DNA fragmentation. In addition, we examined this inhibition with various doses of linolenic acid (3-100 μm), and we showed that the effect increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that mono- and polyunsaturated FFAs of C16 to C22 significantly enhanced inhibition of serum deprivation-induced DNA fragmentation in STC-1 cells. Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activity by Unsaturated FFAs Involves Activation of ERK and Akt in STC-1 Cells—To delineate the signaling pathways involved in unsaturated FFA-promoted inhibition of apoptosis, we examined the activation of ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and Akt/protein kinase B (Akt). As shown in Fig. 4A, these four protein kinases were markedly activated by treatment with linolenic acid. Next, we assessed the effects of specific inhibitors for ERK kinase (U0126 and PD98059), p38 (SB203580), and JNK (SP600125). In addition, we used two inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a major target of which is Akt (16Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 17Dugourd C. Gervais M. Corvol P. Monnot C. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that an ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126, and PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, completely inhibited the activation of ERK and Akt, respectively (Fig. 4B). Also, we measured caspase-3 activity in linolenic acid- or palmitoleic acid-stimulated STC-1 cells with or without pretreatment with these inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 5A, pretreatment with ERK kinase inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors significantly reduced the linolenic acid- or palmitoleic acid-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activity, whereas SB203580 and SP600125 did not have any effects. In addition, we found that the transfection of STC-1 cells with the DN mutant of p38 or JNK did not affect the anti-apoptotic effect of linolenic acid (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, transfection of STC-1 cells with DN-Akt significantly inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of linolenic acid (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways, but not JNK and p38 pathways, leads to linolenic acid-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activity in serum-deprived STC-1 cells.Fig. 5Effects of protein kinase inhibitors on linolenic acid- or palmitoleic acid-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activity. A, effects of protein kinase inhibitors. Serum-starved STC-1 cells were preincubated for 30 min with the following inhibitors: PD98059 (PD, 30 μm), U0126 (10 μm), SB203580 (SB, 10 μm), SP600125 (SP, 10 μm), wortmannin (Wort, 500 nm) or LY294002 (LY, 10 μm). Cells were then stimulated with or without linolenic acid or palmitoleic acid (100 μm) for 5 h. Caspase-3 activity was measured and expressed as a percentage of caspase-3 activity inhibition compared with cells without linolenic acid or palmitoleic acid treatment.

As shown in Fig. 6A, at 100 μm, linolenic acid and palmitoleic acid strongly promoted ERK activation in serum-starved STC-1 cells, whereas oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linolenic acid methyl ester, and octanoic acid showed lesser effects on ERK activation. Because the induction of immediate early response genes is frequently observed concomitant with ERK activation (12Katsuma S. Hada Y. Ueda T. Shiojima S. Hirasawa A. Tanoue A. Takagaki K. Ohgi T.

After 0.5 h of stimulation, Egr-1 was markedly up-regulated by linolenic acid and palmitoleic acid, whereas oleic acid, octanoic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linolenic acid methyl ester had a little effect (Fig. 6B). This induction was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with an ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that Egr-1 induction by FFAs is mainly mediated by ERK activation. Fig. 6 demonstrates that the patterns of ERK activation and early gene induction by FFAs were in accordance with those of FFA-promoted cell survival as shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3. Linolenic Acid-mediated Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activity in Serum-starved STC-1 Cells Is Mediated through GPR120 — STC-1 cells have been shown to express two cell-surface FFA receptors, GPR40 and GPR120, at the same transcriptional level (10Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). To examine which receptor is involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of FFAs on STC-1 cells, we transiently transfected expression vectors containing each FFA receptor and measured the caspase-3 activity of linolenic acid-stimulated transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 7, transfection with an expression plasmid containing GPR120-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), but not GPR40-EGFP, enhanced the inhibition of caspase-3 activity of linolenic acid-stimulated cells. Next, we transfected short hairpin RNA vectors targeting GPR40 and GPR120 into STC-1 cells, and we examined mRNA levels of GPR120 and GPR40 by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 8A, GPR40 or GPR120 mRNA expression was significantly reduced compared with that of cells transfected with the control vector. Then we measured linolenic acid- and palmitoleic acid-induced ERK activation in these cells. Western blotting of phospho-ERK1/2 indicated that reduced expression of GPR120, but not GPR40, decreased the level of linolenic acid- and palmitoleic acid-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 8B). Finally, we examined caspase-3 activity in linolenic acid- and palmitoleic acid-stimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 8C, reduced expression of GPR120, but not GPR40, significantly reduced the effects of linolenic acid and palmitoleic acid on caspase-3 activity inhibition. Collectively, we conclude that our data demonstrate that the linolenic acid- and palmitoleic acid-promoted inhibition of caspase-3 activity in serum-starved STC-1 cells is mainly mediated through GPR120.Fig. 8Knock-down of GPR120, but not GPR40, decreases the effect on linolenic acid-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activity.

https://openalex.org/W1998523488,"Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is a signaling molecule that controls growth and patterning of the developing Drosophila wing. Mutant cells lacking Dpp signal transduction have been shown to activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)–dependent apoptosis and to be lost from the wing disc epithelium. These observations have led to the hypothesis that Dpp promotes cell survival by preventing apoptosis. Here, we show that in the absence of JNK-dependent apoptosis, mutant cells lacking Dpp signal transduction can survive; however, they are still lost from the wing disc epithelium. This loss correlates with extensive cytoskeletal changes followed by basal epithelial extrusion. We propose that Dpp promotes cell survival within disc epithelia by affecting cytoskeletal organization."
https://openalex.org/W2030794862,"The bacA gene product of Escherichia coli was recently purified to near homogeneity and identified as an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity (El Ghachi, M., Bouhss, A., Blanot, D., and Mengin-Lecreulx, D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 30106–30113). The enzyme function is to synthesize the carrier lipid undecaprenyl phosphate that is essential for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and other cell wall components. The inactivation of the chromosomal bacA gene was not lethal but led to a significant, but not total, depletion of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity in E. coli membranes, suggesting that other(s) protein(s) should exist and account for the residual activity and viability of the mutant strain. Here we report that inactivation of two additional genes, ybjG and pgpB, is required to abolish growth of the bacA mutant strain. Overexpression of either of these genes, or of a fourth identified one, yeiU, is shown to result in bacitracin resistance and increased levels of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity, as previously observed for bacA. A thermosensitive conditional triple mutant ΔbacA,ΔybjG,ΔpgpB in which the expression of bacA is impaired at 42 °C was constructed. This strain was shown to accumulate soluble peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors and to lyse when grown at the restrictive temperature, due to the depletion of the pool of undecaprenyl phosphate and consequent arrest of cell wall synthesis. This work provides evidence that two different classes of proteins exhibit undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity in E. coli and probably other bacterial species; they are the BacA enzyme and several members from a superfamily of phosphatases that, different from BacA, share in common a characteristic phosphatase sequence motif."
https://openalex.org/W1993552306,"Cryptochromes are blue light-activated photoreceptors found in multiple organisms with significant similarity to photolyases, a class of light-dependent DNA repair enzymes. Unlike photolyases, cryptochromes do not repair DNA and instead mediate blue light-dependent developmental, growth, and/or circadian responses by an as yet unknown mechanism of action. It has recently been shown that Arabidopsis cryptochrome-1 retains photolyase-like photoreduction of its flavin cofactor FAD by intraprotein electron transfer from tryptophan and tyrosine residues. Here we demonstrate that substitution of two conserved tryptophans that are constituents of the flavin-reducing electron transfer chain in Escherichia coli photolyase impairs light-induced electron transfer in the Arabidopsis cryptochrome-1 photoreceptor in vitro. Furthermore, we show that these substitutions result in marked reduction of light-activated autophosphorylation of cryptochrome-1 in vitro and of its photoreceptor function in vivo, consistent with biological relevance of the electron transfer reaction.

In the second reaction, known as photoactivation, the semi-reduced flavin is converted to the fully reduced form by an electron ultimately provided by an extrinsic reductant. An intraprotein electron transfer pathway connecting the buried flavin to the protein surface has been derived for this photoactivation reaction in Escherichia coli photolyase based on crystallographic structural information and on a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopy (10Cheung M.S.

This pathway comprises a chain of three tryptophan residues (Trp382-Trp359-Trp306) that are conserved throughout the photolyase/cryptochrome family. Recently, a study with purified Arabidopsis cryptochrome-1 (cry1) 1The abbreviation used is: cry1, Arabidopsis cryptochrome-1. demonstrated occurrence of a similar photoreaction, starting from the fully oxidized form of the flavin and involving tryptophan and tyrosine residues as intrinsic electron donors (13Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To explore the possible functional relevance of this reaction to cryptochrome photoreceptor activity, we have substituted redox inactive phenylalanines for two tryptophan residues, Trp400 and Trp324, which are found in the cry1 sequence and crystal structure (7Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) at the homologous positions to Trp382 and Trp306 of E. coli photolyase, respectively. The mutant proteins (W400F and W324F) thereby lack the predicted electron donor proximal to the flavin (Trp400) or exposed to the protein surface (Trp324) and should hence be impaired in electron transfer. If electron transfer is relevant for photoreceptor function, these amino acid substitutions should result in impairment of cry1-dependent blue light responses in vivo. Preparation of Mutant Photoreceptor Proteins—By means of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, single amino acid substitutions (tryptophan to phenylalanine) were introduced into the coding sequence of cry1 at positions Trp324 and Trp400 by using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega (Madison, WI). Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant and wild-type proteins were expressed in a baculovirus expression system and purified by nickel column affinity chromatography as described previously (13Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M.

Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Flavin Photoreduction Assay—Flavin photoreduction in isolated cry1 was performed by irradiation under anaerobic conditions with white light in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol essentially as described (14Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Samples contained between 3 and 24 μm protein, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.3 m imidazole, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and were kept at 12 °C during the experiments. Absorption spectra were measured in a Beckmann DU7400 spectrophotometer. Transient Absorption Spectroscopy—Transient absorption changes were measured with a time resolution of 100 μs as described (13Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), using excitation flashes at 355 nm, 5-ns duration, ∼5 mJ energy per cm2, repetition rate 1.983 Hz. Samples contained ∼10 μm protein, 0.5 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and were kept at 12 °C during the experiments. 32 signals were averaged for each sample. Autophosphorylation Assay—Isolated cryptochrome was radiolabeled as described (15Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2 μg of protein were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 22 °C, either in darkness or under broad band blue light (400–500 nm, 30 μmol m-2 s-1), resolved on polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie dye to visualize the protein bands. Gels were subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography. Phenotypic Analysis of Arabidopsis Mutant Seedlings—Mutant cry1 coding sequences were cloned behind the strong 35S promoter of the binary vector pKYLX6 and transformed into cryptochrome-deficient (cry1cry2 mutant) Arabidopsis plants via agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described (16Ahmad M. Jarillo J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis seedlings expressing wild-type or mutant cry1 were analyzed after 5 days of growth in continuous blue light (30 μmol m-2 s-1) according to methods and procedures described and/or referenced (16Ahmad M. Jarillo J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Ahmad M. Lin C. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Anthocyanin accumulation was quantified by extraction of pigments from 30 seedlings in 1 ml of acidified methanol and measurement of the absorbance at 530 nm, corrected for the contribution of chlorophyll as described (16Ahmad M. Jarillo J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Ahmad M. Lin C. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant cry1 proteins expressed in a baculovirus expression system were checked for pigment content by steady state absorption spectroscopy. As reported previously for wild type cry1 (14Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), both W324F and W400F mutant proteins bound the FAD cofactor in fully oxidized form as evidenced by its characteristic absorption spectrum in the 400–500 nm region (Fig. 1). We applied two different methods to determine whether the mutations affected light-induced electron transfer in the cry1 photoreceptor in vitro, (i) a global assay of flavin photoreduction (Fig. 1) and (ii) a time-resolved study of intraprotein electron transfer (Fig. 2). In the photoreduction assay, wild-type and mutant proteins were subjected to continuous illumination in the presence of the reductant β-mercaptoethanol, and flavin reduction was monitored by absorption changes in the 400–600 nm region. Wild-type protein showed progressive flavin reduction during the course of a half-hour illumination as described previously (14Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Jorns M.S. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), very little reduction was seen either in the W400F or W324F mutant protein (Fig. 1 inset), consistent with interruption of the electron transfer pathway needed for flavin photoreduction. As a specific test for the occurence of intraprotein electron transfer, photoreactions were studied in the absence of external reductant on a much more rapid time scale. The fully oxidized flavin cofactor was excited by a short laser flash and the resulting photoreactions were monitored by transient absorption spectroscopy with 100-μs time resolution. As shown previously (13Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the rapid absorption increase at 520 nm in wild-type cry1 (Fig. 2, upper trace) reflects concomitant formation of the semireduced neutral flavin radical and of a neutral tryptophanyl radical due to tryptophan-to-flavin electron transfer. The subsequent polyphasic absorption decay has been attributed to reduction of the tryptophanyl radical by a tyrosine residue and to electron backtransfer from the flavin radical to the tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals. For both the W324F and W400F mutant proteins, we observed absorbance changes that were approximately five times weaker than in the wild type protein (Fig. 2), strongly suggesting an important role of these two tryptophan residues for flavin photoreduction. During the transient absorption studies, we noticed a strong enhancement in flash-induced fluorescence for the W400F mutant protein (visible in Fig. 2 as a negative spike). According to separate fluorescence measurements under identical excitation conditions, the fluorescence yield ratios were ∼8:2:1 for W400F, W324F, and wild type proteins, respectively (data not shown). The strongly enhanced fluorescence in the W400F mutant protein suggests that W400 is the primary electron donor to the flavin in wild-type cry1 and that this nearby tryptophan quenches fluorescence of the fully oxidized flavin due to fast electron transfer, as suggested for other flavoproteins (19Zhong D. Zewail A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11867-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Mataga N. Chosrowjan H. Taniguchi S. Tanaka F. Kido N. Kitamura M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 8917-8920Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine a possible functional role for cry1 of the light-induced electron transfer, we examined the effect of the same amino acid substitutions on an in vitro autophosphorylation reaction found in purified preparations of cry1 (15Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Shalitin D. Yu X. Maymon M. Mockler T. Lin C. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), This autophosphorylation activity is both light- and redox-sensitive, requires the presence of the flavin cofactor within the apoprotein, and has been proposed as an early step in light activation of the photoreceptor (15Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both W324F and W400F mutant proteins showed basal levels of phosphorylation in the dark, reduced in comparison with wild-type protein at the same concentration (Fig. 3). Significantly, there was no increase in autophosphorylation of mutant protein samples due to illumination by blue light as compared with the dark controls. This was in marked contrast to the wild-type protein, where significant stimulation by blue light occurred. To explore the functional relevance of the electron transfer reaction in vivo (Fig. 4), W324F and W400F mutated coding sequences were cloned into a plant expression vector and were transformed into cryptochrome-deficient Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic seedlings were evaluated by Western blot analysis with anti-cry1 antibody to verify synthesis of the mutant photoreceptor proteins (Fig. 4b). As functional assays for cry1-specific activity in vivo, transgenic seedlings were evaluated for blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation (Fig. 4, a and d) and for blue light-dependent anthocyanin accumulation (16Ahmad M. Jarillo J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17Ahmad M. Lin C. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4c), in comparison with seedlings containing wild-type cry1 protein at a similar concentration. By both these functional assays, activity was shown to be significantly reduced in the two transgenic lines containing a mutant cry1 photoreceptor (W324F and W400F) as compared with seedlings containing wild type cry1 (Fig. 4, c and d). The present study documents a strong correlation between a primary photochemical reaction (electron transfer) and cry1 photoreceptor function, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that substitution of tryptophan residues that are homologous to those that participate in the photoactivation reaction of E. coli photolyase result in marked impairment in electron transfer of isolated cry1 photoreceptors. This impairment is unlikely to be caused by major structural perturbations, as the efficient FAD binding observed in the mutants implies proper contacts with multiple amino acid residues throughout the protein (7Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acid substitutions at the homologous positions in E. coli photolyase do not impair DNA repair activity (18Li Y.F. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hence, although we cannot exclude the possibility of minor structural alterations in the protein resulting from these mutations, we attribute the impairment in electron transfer in the mutants to most likely result from the elimination of essential members of the electron transfer chain. Our results thus suggest that functional electron transfer along the triple tryptophan chain is conserved between plant cryptochromes and their photolyase homologues, revealing a functional significance of the marked amino acid similarity between cryptochromes and photolyases. Although greatly reduced, there was residual electron transfer in the mutant proteins (Fig. 2). This may be due to low yield side pathways involving other tryptophan and/or tyrosine residues that are close to the flavin. According to the crystal structure of the photolyase-like domain of wild-type cry1 (7Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the best candidates are Trp385 (at 7.1 Å edge-to-edge distance from the flavin), Trp356 (7.1 Å), Trp334 (9.2 Å), Trp377 (9.7 Å), and Trp402 (6.9 Å). For comparison, Trp400 is at 4.5 Å from the flavin. Based on an excited state lifetime of several nanoseconds for the fully oxidized flavin (22Heelis P.F. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1982; 11: 15-39Crossref Google Scholar) and on the distance dependence of intraprotein electron transfer rates (23Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), oxidizable residues within ∼10 Å could well reduce the photoexcited flavin with non-negligible yields. A light-dependent autophosphorylation reaction has been speculated to be an early step in activation of the cryptochrome photoreceptor (15Bouly J.P. Giovani B. Djamei A. Mueller M. Zeugner A. Dudkin E.A. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Shalitin D. Yu X. Maymon M. Mockler T. Lin C. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our in vitro phosphorylation assay (Fig. 3), both the W400F and W324F mutant proteins retained basal (light-independent) autophosphorylation, indicating that they retain the capacity for undergoing the autophosphorylation reaction, although somewhat reduced in comparison with wild type protein. The prominent stimulation of autophosphorylation by blue light observed in wild type was, however, completely suppressed in both the W400F and W324F mutant proteins, indicating that intraprotein electron transfer is necessary for light stimulation of this autophosphorylation response. In vivo photoreceptor function of cryptochrome was markedly reduced in both subsititutions (W324F and W400F), as measured both by reduced anthocyanin accumulation and reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under blue light in transgenic plants (Fig. 4). We detected some residual activity in the W324F and W400F mutants. This activity may have resulted from residual electron transfer activity via alternate (and less efficient) electron transfer pathways, as discussed above. Summarizing, our data suggest that light-induced electron transfer provides the trigger for light responsivity of the cry1 photoreceptor. In photolyases, photoactivation converts the semi-reduced flavin with absorption bands in the 500–650 nm region to the fully reduced form that can participate in the DNA repair reaction and has no pronounced absorption bands in the visible. This photoactivation reaction is normally not essential for function as photolyases are typically found in the fully reduced form in living cells and proteins deficient in photoactivation can still function in repair (4Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 18Li Y.F. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the case of plant cryptochromes, action spectroscopy has indicated that there is no significant response to wavelengths of light above 500 nm and that the response maximum is around 450 nm, suggestive of flavin in the oxidized form in vivo (24Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, a primary light reaction for cryptochrome whereby the oxidized flavin undergoes light-dependent photoreduction would appear a reasonable mechanism, which may then trigger subsequent conformational or other biochemical changes that have been suggested to be the basis for signaling (25Yang H.Q. Wu Y.J. Tang R.H. Liu D. Liu Y. Cashmore A.R. Cell. 2000; 103: 815-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Cryptochrome-like photoreceptors have been identified in a number of other organisms including animals, where they have been shown to play an important role in the circadian clock (1Green C.B. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R847-R849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Lin C. Shalitin D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 469-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Christie J.M. Briggs W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11457-11460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). There are significant structural similarities between animal and plant cryptochromes, including conservation of the three tryptophan residues that have been implicated in the electron transfer chain of E. coli photolyase and which we have here demonstrated to be implicated in light-dependent electron transfer in plant cry1. Substitution of some of these tryptophan residues by tyrosine has been reported to reduce activity of Xenopus cryptochromes in an in vitro transfection assay (26Zhu H. Green C.B. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1945-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, since the effect of cryptochrome on reporter gene expression is independent of light in the transfection assay, it cannot be concluded from this experiment that electron transfer is involved in animal cryptochrome activity. On the other hand, mutations of the homologous tryptophans to phenylalanines in Drosophila cryptochrome (27Froy O. Chang D.C. Reppert S.M. Curr.

Therefore it would appear unlikely, in Drosophila cryptochromes, that light activation depends on electron transfer via the same pathway functioning in the plant cry1. Since plant and animal cryptochromes apparently evolved independently from different photolyase ancestors (4Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), they may have a different primary mechanism of action. Alternatively, electron transfer in animal-type cryptochromes may still be important for light activation but may occur via an alternative pathway to that found in plant cryptochrome. Indeed, the type 6-4 photolyases to which the animal cryptochromes are most closely related may utilize an electron transfer pathway involving primarily tyrosine (28Weber S. Kay C.W. Mogling H. Möbius K. Hitomi K. Todo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is therefore intriguing to speculate that the electron transfer activity present in photolyases contains latent signaling potential that has been co-opted for a role in blue-light photoreceptors multiple times throughout the course of evolution."

The isolated receptor was characterized at the molecular level by circular dichroism (CD) and steady-state fluorescence. A specific change in the near-UV CD band associated with the GPCR disulfide bond connecting the third transmembrane domain to the second extracellular loop (e2) was observed upon agonist binding to the purified receptor. This is a direct experimental evidence for a change in the conformation of the e2 loop upon receptor activation. Different variations were obtained depending whether the ligand was an agonist (partial or full) or an inverse agonist. In contrast, antagonist binding did not induce any variation. These observations provide a first direct evidence for the fact that free (or antagonist-occupied), active (partial- or full agonist-occupied) and silent (inverse agonist-occupied) states of the receptor involve different arrangements of the e2 loop. Finally, ligand-induced changes in the fluorescence emission profile of the purified receptor confirmed that the partial agonist stabilized a single, well-defined, conformational state and not a mixture of different states. This result is of particular interest in a pharmacological perspective since it directly demonstrates that the efficacy of a drug is likely due to the stabilization of a ligand-specific state rather than selection of a mixture of different conformational states of the receptor.

G-protein-coupled receptors are versatile biological sensors. They are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as sight, smell, and taste senses (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P.

Signal transduction is specifically associated with GPCR 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; e2, second extracellular loop; DMPC, dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine; RASSL, receptor activated solely by synthetic ligands; TM, transmembrane; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. activation. Although significant progress has been made within the last few years in dissecting GPCR-mediated signal transduction pathways, understanding of the mechanisms underlying receptor activation is still hampered by the lack of information at the molecular level (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Kobilka B.K. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 60: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is largely due to the fact that very few expression systems have proven satisfactory for producing these receptors in a functional state and with sufficient yields for biophysical studies to be carried out (5Stanisala L. Pattus F. Massotte D. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Tate C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Weiss H.M. Grisshammer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Most of the systems that have been developed to elucidate the mechanism of GPCR activation therefore essentially rely on the use of purified rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptor (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 4Kobilka B.K. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 60: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the results obtained so far report on the conformational events occurring at the level of the cytoplasmic side of the receptors. In contrast, few reports give indications on the possible conformational rearrangements certainly occurring in the extracellular part of the receptor, in particular in the extracellular loops. Several models have been developed to conceptualize the mechanisms of activation (9Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The two-state model and the extended ternary model assumes that the receptor exists in an equilibrium between a resting state (R) and an active (R*) state that stimulates the G protein. Agonists preferentially enrich the R* state, whereas inverse agonists select for the R state. In this simple model, the efficacy of a drug can be explained by its relative affinity for the two states. Recent structural and spectroscopy findings revealed that GPCRs (rhodopsin, 5-HT4, and opiate receptors) probably exist in at least three states: an Rg (ground) state that corresponds to the totally inactive “silent” state, an R state (without ligand) that is able to activate to some extent G-proteins, although with a low efficacy, and an R* state that corresponds to the active state stabilized by full agonists (8Okada T.

We have recently described a model system composed of the leukotriene B4 receptor BLT1 isolated in a detergent medium that allowed us to show that formation of the leukotriene B4-BLT1 complex is associated with a specific conformational adaptations of the receptor (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we report on the molecular characterization of the mouse 5-HT4(a) receptor produced in Escherichia coli. Using an expression strategy similar to that described in the case of BLT1, we produced 5-HT4(a) as a functional protein isolated in a detergent-medium. The isolated receptor constituted a useful model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor activation using biophysical methods. We used CD and steady-state fluorescence to analyze the changes induced by different ligands on the receptor conformation. We report evidence that the conformational changes involved in both receptor activation and inactivation affect the geometrical features of its second extracellular loop. Furthermore, we also provide direct evidence for the occurrence of multiple and well defined conformational states of the 5-HT4(a) receptor depending on whether the ligand is a partial, full, or inverse agonist.

Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the last PCR step introduced an AvaI restriction site followed by a factor Xa cleavage site and an acid cleavage site (16Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) at the 5′-end of the receptor encoding sequence and XhoI restriction site at its 3′-end. After AvaI and XhoI digestion, the cDNA fragment was ligated into the similarly digested pET31b vector (Novagen). The expression vector obtained, named here pET31b-5HT4(a), was verified on the basis of restriction digestion mapping and nucleotide sequencing. The construct encodes a fusion protein composed of ketosteroid isomerase followed by m5-HT4(a) receptor and then a His tag, with a factor Xa and an acid cleavage site between ketosteroid isomerase and 5-HT4(a). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The C93S,C184S, and C93S,C184S mutants were obtained by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the pET31b-5HT4(a) vector as a template. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cysteine mutant proteins were produced as described below for the wild-type receptor. No significant differences in the refolding ratios were obtained for these mutants, consistent with the fact that the cysteine mutations in the e2 loop do not affect the secondary structure of the receptor. 5-HT4(a) Expression and Purification—The pET31b-5HT(4a) vector described above was introduced in the E. coli host strain Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1 at 600 nm in 2YT medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.8 mm. 0.2% glucose was also added at this step. Induction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g for 30 min), resuspended in buffer A and lysed by sonication. Centrifugation (27,000 × g for 30 min) afforded an insoluble protein fraction that was washed twice in buffer A containing 1 m urea and then solubilized in buffer B. The solubilized proteins were loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. After washing with buffer B, a linear imidazole gradient (0–200 mm) in the same buffer was applied to elute the polyhistidine-tagged recombinant protein. The eluted fractions containing the fusion protein, as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and extensively dialyzed against buffer C. The N-terminal ketosteroid isomerase fusion partner was removed by incubation of the isolated unfolded fusion protein in acidic conditions, as described by Ryan et al. (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the fusion protein was cleaved with factor Xa. For this, the ketosteroid isomerase-5HT4(a) fusion protein was extensively dialyzed in a 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm lauryldimethylamino oxide, pH 6.5, and digested (enzyme/substrate ratio, 0.5 units of enzyme/mg of protein) for 3 h at 20 °C. The reaction was then stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction mixture was extensively dialyzed in buffer B. In either case (acid or factor Xa), up to 60–70% of the fusion protein was cleaved. The cleavage mixture was then loaded on a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein content in each fraction eluted from the column was determined by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (16Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fractions containing cleaved 5-HT4(a) receptor were pooled. Refolding Assays—The systematic search for refolding conditions was carried out as described by Banères et al. (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The urea-denatured His-tagged receptor was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA matrix at different protein concentrations, and then refolding was carried out by applying a linear gradient to remove urea under a variety of buffer conditions (see “Results”). Dissociation of the receptor from the matrix was then achieved by adding 100 mm imidazole to the refolding buffer. After extensive dialysis in the same buffer, the protein solution was clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 1 h at 20 °C), and the protein amount in the resulting supernatant was estimated by UV absorption spectrometry (see below). The refolding ratio was defined as the ratio of the amount of soluble protein after centrifugation to that initially loaded on the column. 5-HT4(a) Receptor Refolding—The urea-denatured His-tagged 5-HT4(a) receptor was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA matrix and immobilized at a protein/resin ratio of ∼0.3 mg of protein/ml of hydrated Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The resin was previously equilibrated in buffer D. After extensive washing with buffer D, refolding was achieved by applying a linear gradient from buffer D urea to buffer E. Dissociation of the receptor from the matrix was then achieved with buffer E containing 100 mm imidazole. After extensive dialysis in buffer F, the eluted proteins were loaded on a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm) previously equilibrated in buffer F. Elution was carried out with the same buffer at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The nonaggregated material (chemical cross-linking evidence) eluted from the Sephacryl column was then pooled and loaded a 10–30% isokinetic concave exponential sucrose gradient in buffer F. Centrifugation carried out for 7 h at 200,000 × g (Beckman SW41 rotor). The sedimentation pattern was monitored with a turbulence-free flow cell from Molecular Instruments. The nonaggregated fractions recovered from the sucrose gradient were pooled and dialyzed against buffer F. The active receptor was then purified on a GR 113808-affinity column. The ligand was immobilized on an Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) matrix as described for GR 119566X (17Thomas J.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 18Lummis S.C. Martin I.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 18-23PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor was recirculated (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) on the matrix for at least 12 h, and then washing was carried out with buffer F. The receptor was then eluted with buffer F containing 1 mm 5-HT. 5-HT was removed from the eluate by extensive dialysis against buffer F. In the case of the cysteine mutants, the decrease in the affinity for GR 113808 (0.5 and 50 nm for the wild-type and double mutant, respectively) due to the replacement of the Cys residues in the e2 loop by serines ensured that the last purification step only led to an enrichment in active receptor instead of a full purification. The contaminant inactive receptor fraction corresponded to 10–15% of the total protein, as inferred from GR 113808 binding measurements (not shown). Protein Concentration Measurements—All protein concentrations were determined by UV spectrometry using extinction coefficients determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Measurements—The CD spectra are the average of five scans using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a step width of 0.2 nm and a 0.5-s averaging time per point. Protein solutions at concentrations in the 10–6 to 10–5 m range were used. Cell path lengths were 1.00 ± 0.01 and 2 ± 0.01 mm (far- and near-UV measurements, respectively). [θ] are mean residue (Mr = 115) molar ellipticities. Deconvolution was carried out using the Convex Constraint Analysis procedure adapted to membrane proteins (20Fasman G.D. Fasman G. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 381-412Crossref Google Scholar, 21Manalvan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In the case of the cysteine-to-serine mutant, the near-UV CD measurements were carried out at higher protein concentrations (in the 150 μm range) to compensate the decreased affinity of the mutant for the BIMU-8 agonist. In this case, 1.00-mm path lengths giving rise to absorbance values in the 1 range were used to avoid any saturation of the photomultiplicator. Three independent measurements with different protein preparations were systematically carried out. The values given in Figs. 4B and 6B are to the mean value calculated from these three independent experiments. The error bar corresponds to the S.D. from the mean value.Fig. 6Conformational adaptation of the D3.32A mutant upon ligand binding as assessed by CD difference spectroscopy. A, difference CD spectrum in the 240–320-nm range obtained after subtracting the sum of the individual CD spectra of free receptor and ligand from the spectrum of the receptor-ligand complex. The different molecular species used for these calculations are indicated under each profile (see Fig. 5 for a definition of the species).

The error bar corresponds to the S.D. from the mean value calculated from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C on an Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Cary) with an excitation wavelength of 298 nm (bandwidth 2 nm). Protein concentrations in the 10–6 to 10–5m range were used. For emission spectra of the ligand-loaded receptor, emission was recorded 30 min after adding the ligand at a 1:1 molar ratio. Three independent measurements with different protein preparations were systematically carried out. The values given in Fig. 7B are to the mean value calculated from these three independent experiments. The error bar corresponds to the S.D. value. Buffer contributions were subtracted under the same experimental conditions. We systematically checked that the ligand used neither significantly contributed to the emission spectra upon excitation at 290 nm nor displayed a significant absorbance in the 300–360-nm range. Ligand Binding Assays—The ligand binding quantitative parameters were determined by equilibrium dialysis. Dialysis cells from Dianorm were used with two 800-μl cavities separated by 12–14-kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por). Experiments were performed at 20 °C and incubated for 24 h, sufficient time to ensure equilibrium as determined by following the time course for approach to equilibrium in control experiments. Buffer F was used in all dialysis experiments with protein concentration in the 10–10 m range. A series of experiments in the same conditions but in the absence of protein were carried out in parallel to measure nonspecific binding. [3H]GR 113808 concentrations after equilibrium dialysis were determined by scintillation counting. Competition experiments were carried out in the same conditions, in the presence of 0.6 nm [3H]GR 113808 and increasing concentrations of competitor compound. The titration data were analyzed using the PRISM software (Graphpad Inc.) by considering a set of usual models for describing the ligand-receptor interactions. Production of the Recombinant 5-HT4(a) Receptor—Mouse 5-HT4(a) receptor was produced as a recombinant protein in E. coli. The approach used was similar to that previously developed for BLT1 (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It consisted in (i) obtaining high expression yields through the use of a synthetic cDNA optimized for bacterial expression, (ii) accumulating the protein in the insoluble inclusion bodies to avoid toxicity effects associated with membrane addressing, and (iii) searching optimal refolding conditions of the receptor purified from the inclusion bodies. We tested here the ability of different protein partners to optimize the addressing of the receptor to the inclusion bodies. These fusion partners were the T7 tag sequence we used for BLT1 (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), glutathione S-transferase that had been used for producing different GPCRs (22Kiefer H. Vogel R. Maier K. Receptors Channels. 2000; 7: 109-119PubMed Google Scholar), and ketosteroid isomerase, a highly hydrophobic protein produced in large amounts as insoluble aggregates in the E. coli cytoplasm (23Kuliopulos A. Shortle D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8893-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is to be noted that no periplasmic protein such as maltose-binding protein were tested, since we intended to specifically accumulate the receptor in the inclusion bodies. Although some expression was observed with the T7 tag sequence or glutathione S-transferase, the highest expression levels were systematically achieved when ketosteroid isomerase was fused to the N terminus of the receptor. As expected, the ketosteroid isomerase-5-HT4(a) fusion protein was exclusively accumulated in the inclusion bodies with no indication of membrane addressing of the receptor. Lack of membrane addressing limited the toxicity of the expressed protein thus allowing high fermentation rates to be achieved. The fusion protein was recovered from the inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions (i.e. in the presence of both urea and detergents) (see “Experimental Procedures”) and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA column. Typically, 5–8 mg of purified protein were recovered from one liter of bacterial culture. The next step consisted in removing the ketosteroid isomerase fusion partner. After cleavage of the link between the fusion protein and the receptor (see “Experimental Procedures”), the cleaved ketosteroid isomerase and 5-HT4(a) as well as the remaining uncleaved fusion protein were separated through a size exclusion chromatographic step under denaturing conditions. Reconstitution of the Recombinant 5-HT4(a) Receptor—The refolding scheme of the unfolded receptor obtained as described above was similar to the one that we described in the case of BLT1 (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We used a matrix-assisted refolding procedure in which the refolding was carried out with the protein immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA matrix (16Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In our hands, this method has systematically allowed better refolding yields than dialysis probably because of the physical separation of the refolding polypeptides on the column that limits nonspecific protein-protein interactions and thus aggregation (24Li M. Su Z.-G. Janson J.-C. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We investigated, in a systematic step-by-step manner, the biochemical parameters that could minimize aggregation. The factors tested were the detergent nature and concentration, temperature, ionic strength, presence of ionic or nonionic additives, presence of reducing/oxidizing reagents, and protein concentration, as previously described (15Banères J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A refolding yield was calculated for each of the conditions tested. This yield corresponded to the ratio of the amount of soluble protein after and before refolding (see “Experimental Procedures”). Receptor refolding was also assessed at the qualitative level by analyzing both the conformational features of the refolded receptor (far-UV CD evidence) and its ligand-binding properties (equilibrium dialysis; see below). On the basis of these assays, we defined a refolding condition combining a series of biochemical parameters in an optimal manner (see buffer E under “Experimental Procedures”) that allowed a recovery yield of about 10–15% to be achieved. It is to be noted that one of the most crucial parameters to ensure receptor refolding was, as expected for a membrane protein, the chemical nature of the detergent. The best results were obtained when the protein was reconstituted in mixed DMPC/CHAPS micelles in the presence of cholesterol. The active receptor was further purified by ultracentrifugation and ligand-immobilized affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under such conditions, 0.3–0.5 mg of protein were obtained per liter of culture. Secondary and Tertiary Fold of Recombinant 5-HT4(a) Receptor—We carried out a first characterization of the refolded 5-HT4(a) receptor by circular dichroism. As shown in Fig. 1, the far-UV spectrum in the 200–250-nm range was characteristic of a folded protein with a high content of secondary structure (∼50% of α-helix; see deconvolution description under “Experimental Procedures”). The CD spectrum in the near-UV region (250–310 nm) included a negative broad band centered at 265 nm (Fig. 1, profile 1). The position of this band as well as the absence of any fine structure suggested the contribution of a disulfide chromophore (25Woody R.W. Duncker A.K. Fasman G.

To unambiguously assess the origin of this CD band, we replaced the cysteines that were supposed to be connected by a disulfide bridge in the 5-HT4(a) receptor (i.e. Cys93 and Cys184) (26Claeysen S.

Upon mutating either of these cysteines (not shown) or both residues (Fig. 1, profile 2), the intensity of the CD band at ∼265 nm dramatically decreased. No other major alterations in the CD spectrum of the receptor were observed, indicating that these mutations did not drastically affect the overall structural arrangement of the receptor. No additional modification of the receptor near-UV CD spectrum was observed upon treating the C93S,C184S mutant with the nonchiral reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. This indicated that the disulfide-associated CD band essentially resulted from the contribution of the Cys93–Cys184 bridge.

Although activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase involves extensive serine phosphorylation of p47phox, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox in NADPH oxidase-dependent O2−˙ production is unclear. We have shown recently that hyperoxia-induced NADPH oxidase activation in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Here we provided evidence on the role of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in hyperoxia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox and NADPH oxidase activation in HPAECs. Exposure of HPAECs to hyperoxia for 1 h resulted in increased O2−˙ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Src as determined by Western blotting with phospho-Src antibodies. Pretreatment of HPAECs with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (1 μm) or transient expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Src attenuated hyperoxia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and ROS production. Furthermore, exposure of cells to hyperoxia enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox and its translocation to cell peripheries that were attenuated by PP2. In vitro, Src phosphorylated recombinant p47phox in a time-dependent manner. Src immunoprecipitates of cell lysates from control cells revealed the presence of immunodetectable p47phox and p67phox, suggesting the association of oxidase components with Src under basal conditions. Moreover, exposure of HPAECs to hyperoxia for 1 h enhanced the association of p47phox, but not p67phox, with Src.

Oxygen therapy often rescues and reduces the mortality resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, exposure to toxic fumes, and drowning (1Clark L.A. Moon R.E. Respir. Care Clin. N. Am. 1999; 5: 203-219PubMed Google Scholar). However, prolonged exposure to supra-physiological concentrations of oxygen, referred to as hyperoxia, causes extensive damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier resulting in increased permeability and decreased lung function (2Capellier G. Maupoil V. Boussat S. Laurent E. Neidhardt A. Minerva Anesthesiol. 1999; 65: 388-392PubMed Google Scholar).

The vascular endothelium has long been recognized to generate superoxide ( O2−˙), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (·OH), and nitric oxide (NO) via enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. In endothelial cells (ECs), in addition to the mitochondrial electron transport, other potential enzymatic pathways of ROS production include cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450, xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidase, NO synthase, and peroxidase. In the lung, the vascular NADPH oxidase seems to play an important role in excessive production of O2−˙ in atherosclerosis, ischemic lung, pulmonary hypertension, and ventilator-associated lung injury (4Al-Mehdi A.B.

Activated NADPH oxidase is a multimeric protein complex consisting of at least three cytosolic subunits of p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox; a regulatory small molecular weight G-protein of either Rac1 or Rac2 and a membrane-associated cytochrome b558 reductase made up of p22phox and gp91phox. We and others (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J.

IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have shown that most of the subcomponents of phagocytic NADPH oxidase are expressed in vascular ECs. ECs exhibit a low output in of O2−˙ production under basal conditions, and stimulation by TNF-α, pulsatile stretch, hypoxia reoxygenation, and phorbol ester enhanced the ROS generation (12Roy S. Parinandi N.L. Ziegelstein R. Hu Q. Pei Y. Travers J.B. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A role for PKCα and -ζ in TNF-α-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase activation and generation of ROS has been documented in vascular ECs (13Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging that activation of phagocytic and nonphagocytic NADPH oxidase involves serine phosphorylation of p47phox that initiates assembly of the cytoplasmic components and translocation to the membrane for complete association with cytochrome b558 and functioning of the oxidase. In neutrophils, stimulation with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-OH or phorbol ester results in phosphorylation of p47phox and in the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase (14El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p47phox occurs at multiple serine residues suggesting potential involvement of different protein kinases such as PKC, protein kinase A, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (16Fontayne A. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7743-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although several reports have been made on the agonist-induced phosphorylation of p47phox in phagocytes, only a few studies show phosphorylation of p47phox and activation of NADPH oxidase in nonphagocytic cells (17Hohler B. Holzapfel B. Kummer W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Touyz R.M. Yao G. Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), TNF-α-mediated NADPH oxidase activation and O2−˙ production were regulated by PKCζ, and inhibition of PKCζ blocked TNF-α-dependent phosphorylation and targeting of p47phox (13Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Activation of Src kinase by angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) resulted in serine phosphorylation and translocation from the cytosol to the membrane of p47phox with increased O2−˙ generation; however, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox was not evaluated (18Touyz R.M. Yao G. Schiffrin E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that exposure of HPAECs to hyperoxia increases O2−˙/ROS production that was mediated by activation of NADPH oxidase and partly regulated by ERK and p38 MAPK (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284: L26-L38Google Scholar). However, very little is known regarding tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox, activation of NADPH oxidase, and ROS generation in vascular cells. The Src family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in a variety of cellular responses such as motility, adhesion, carcinogenesis, barrier function, and volume regulation (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar, 21Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Of the nine members of the Src family kinases, six (Lyn, Fgr, Blk, Lck, Hck, and Yrk) are expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, whereas c-Src, Yes, and Fyn are ubiquitously expressed (22Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the role of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox and regulation of NADPH oxidase activation in ECs exposed to hyperoxia. By using HPAECs, we demonstrate that hyperoxia activates c-Src but not Yes or Fyn or Lyn, and activation of c-Src regulates NADPH oxidase-mediated O2−˙ production via p47phox tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of Src activation by PP2 or expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Src prevented hyperoxia-mediated phosphorylation of Src, translocation of p47phox to the cell periphery, and generation of ROS mediated by NADPH oxidase. PP3, the inactive analog of PP2, had no effect on hyperoxia-induced c-Src activation, translocation of phospho-Src and p47phox to the cell periphery, and ROS production. Furthermore, hyperoxia increased association between Src and p47phox that was attenuated by PP2 but not by PP3 in HPAECs. These results provide a novel mechanism of hyperoxia-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase involving Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p47phox and its translocation to the membrane for assembly of the oxidase components.

Endothelial Cell Culture—HPAECs, passages between 5 and 8, were grown to contact-inhibited monolayers with typical cobblestone morphology in EGM-2 complete media with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere and grown to contact-inhibited monolayers with typical cobblestone morphology as described previously (10Parinandi N.L.

Cells from T-75 flasks were detached with 0.05% trypsin, resuspended in fresh complete medium, and cultured in 35- or 60-mm dishes or on glass coverslips for immunofluorescence studies. All cells were starved overnight in EGM-2 medium containing 1% FBS prior to exposure to normoxia or hyperoxia. Exposure of Cells to Hyperoxia—HPAECs (∼90% confluence) in complete EGM-2 medium were placed in a humidity-controlled airtight modulator incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA), flushed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 30 min until the oxygen level inside the chamber reached ∼ 95%. HPAECs were then placed in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for the desired lengths of time (1–3 h). The concentration of O2 inside the chamber was monitored with a digital oxygen monitor. The buffering capacity of the cell culture medium did not change significantly during the period of hyperoxic exposure and was maintained at a pH ∼7.4. Adenovirus Production of p47phox—The pGEX-C2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing p47phox was subcloned into the pshuttle-CMV vector. Adenoviral DNA was produced by a double-recombination event between co-transformed adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, and the shuttle vector carrying the p47phox gene. The recombinant plasmid was linearized and transfected into HEK293 cells to generate replication-defective adenovirus. Generation of purified virus (∼1 × 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml) was performed by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core facility. Infection of HPAECs with Adenoviral p47phox—Purified adenovirus (10 pfu/cell; 1.5 × 105 cells) was added to HPAECs grown to ∼70% confluence in 35-mm dishes in complete EGM-2 medium (volume of 1 ml). After 24 h, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh complete medium for an additional 24 h. Vector control or infected cells were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia for 1–3 h followed by measurement of intracellular ROS production and for p47phox protein expression by Western blotting. Transfection and Transient Expression of p47phox-GFP, Constitutively Active and Dominant-negative Src in HPAECs—A plasmid encoding human p47phox was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector to give C-terminally GFP-tagged p47phox (p47phox-GFP). HPAECs (∼50–60% confluence) in 35-mm dishes were transfected with vector control, p47phox-GFP, Src wild type (WT), or Src dominant-negative (Lys-to-Arg substitution at position 296 and Tyr-to-Phe substitution at position 528) cDNA plasmids (1.0 μg of DNA/well) with FuGENE 6 (3 μl/well) according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Applied Science). After 4 h of transfection, the media were aspirated and replaced by EGM-2 complete media, and cells were incubated in a humidified 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere for 48 h post-transfection. Expression of p47phox-GFP was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, whereas expression of WT or dominant-negative Src was verified by Western blotting of the total cell lysates with anti-Src antibody (23Parinandi N.L. Roy S. Shi S. Cummings R.J. Morris A.J. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transfection of HPAECs with p47phox siRNA—To optimize conditions for efficient transfection, HPAECs were transfected with Fl-Luciferase GL2 Duplex siRNA (target sequence, 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′; Dharmacon) as a positive control. HPAECs grown to ∼60–70% confluency in 35-mm dishes were transfected with Gene Silencer® (Gene Therapy System, Inc., San Diego) transfecting agent plus with p47phox siRNA (100 nm) in serum-free EBM-2 medium according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After 3 h post-transfection, 1 ml of fresh complete EGM-2 medium containing 10% FBS was added, and cells were cultured for an additional 24–72 h for analysis of p47phox mRNA by real time PCR and protein expression by Western blotting. RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HPAECs grown on 35-mm dishes using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. One-step RT-PCR was performed in a Light-Cycler using the SYBR Green QuantiTect® RT-PCR kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA). 18 S (sense, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize expression. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.3 μg of total RNA (target gene) or 0.03 μg of total RNA (18 S rRNA), 10 μl of QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR, 0.2 μl of QuantiTech RT Mix, 1.5 μm target primers, or 1 μm 18 S rRNA primers, in a total volume of 20 μl. For all samples, reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 20 min, followed by cycling to 95 °C for 15 min to inactivate the RT enzyme and activate the Taq polymerase. The primers used for p47phox were sense, 5′-AGTCCTGACGAGACGAAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGACGGAAAGTAGCCTGTGA-3′. Amplicon expression in each sample was normalized to its 18 S rRNA content. The relative abundance of target mRNA in each sample was calculated as 2 raised to the negative of its threshold cycle value times 106 after being normalized to the abundance of its corresponding 18 S,(2-(primer Threshold Cycle)/2-(18 S Threshold Cycle)× 106). All primers were designed by inspection of the genes of interest. Negative controls, consisting of reaction mixtures containing all components except target RNA, were included with each of the RT-PCR runs. To verify that amplified products were derived from mRNA and did not represent genomic DNA contamination, representative PCR mixtures for each gene were run in the absence of the RT enzyme after first being cycled to 95 °C for 15 min. In the absence of reverse transcription, no PCR products were observed. Determination of Hyperoxia-induced Production of O2−˙, H2O2, and total ROS—Hyperoxia-induced O2−˙ release by HPAECs was measured by SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction assay or hydroethidine fluorescence as described (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284: L26-L38Google Scholar, 24Edwards S.W. Methods (Orlando). 1996; 9: 563-577Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Formation of H2O2 in the medium was determined by the fluorescence method using Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's recommendation using a standard curve for H2O2 (10Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G.N. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 284: L26-L38Google Scholar). Total ROS production in HPAECs exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia was determined by the DCFDA fluorescence method (25Wei Z. Costa K. Al-Mehdi A.B. Dodia C. Muzykantov V. Fisher A.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, HPAECs (∼90% confluent in 35-mm dishes) were loaded with 10 μm DCFDA in EGM-2 basal medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence of oxidized DCFDA in cell lysates, an index of formation of ROS, was measured with an Aminco Bowman series 2 spectrofluorimeter using excitation and emission set at 490 and 530 nm, respectively, with appropriate blanks. The extent of ROS formation is expressed as percent of normoxic control. ROS Detection in Cells by Fluorescence Microscopy—Hyperoxia-induced ROS formation in cells was also quantified by fluorescence microscopy. HPAECs (∼90% confluent) in 35-mm dishes were loaded with DCFDA (10 μm) in EBM-2 basal medium for 30 min at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 environment. After 30 min of loading, the medium containing DCFDA was aspirated; cells were rinsed once with EGM-2 complete medium; cells were preincubated with agents for the indicated time periods followed by exposure to either normoxia (95% air, 5% CO2) or hyperoxia (95% O2,5%CO2) for 1–3 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS at room temperature and were examined under a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscope with Hamamatsu digital CCD camera (Japan) using a 20× objective lens and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., PA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HPAECs grown on gelatinized 9-mm coverslips to ∼95% confluence were pretreated with either PP2 or PP3 (1 μm), in EGM-2 complete medium as indicated, followed by exposure to either normoxia or hyperoxia for 1–3 h. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS at room temperature, permeabilized for 2 min in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 3.7% formaldehyde, rinsed once with PBS, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed three times in PBS and were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in TBST blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h), thoroughly rinsed with TBST, and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer, 1 h), and slides were prepared with mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed by Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S fluorescence microscope with Hamamatsu digital camera (Japan) using a 60× oil immersion objective and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., PA). Images were analyzed and adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 7 and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). In Vivo Phosphorylation of p47phox by [32P]Orthophosphate— HPAECs (∼90% confluence in 35-mm dishes) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h. The radioactive medium was aspirated, and cells were pretreated with complete EGM-2 alone or EGM-2 containing PP2 (1 μm) for 30 min prior to exposure to either normoxia or hyperoxia for 2–3 h. Total cell lysates (∼500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal goat anti-p47phox antibody (26Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunoi H. Sechler J.M.G. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) for 18 h, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Hydrolysis and Separation of 32P-Labeled Phosphoamino Acids—The radioactive bands corresponding to standard p47phox were excised from PVDF membrane and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 1 ml of 6 n HCl for 4 h at 110 °C in Teflon-coated glass tubes under N2 atmosphere. The hydrolysates were evaporated by N2 gas, and the residues were taken up in ethanol/water (1:1 v/v). Portions of the acid-hydrolyzed extracts were mixed with authentic mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, spotted on Silica Gel 60 plates, and resolved by thin layer chromatography in absolute ethanol, 25% ammonia solution (3.5:2.2 v/v) for 120 min at room temperature; the plates were air-dried, and development was repeated once more in the same solvent, and labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography and standards by spraying the plates with 0.5% ninhydrin in acetone (27Iyer S. Rowe-Rendleman C.L. Bianchi R. Eichberg J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—HPAECs grown on 100-mm dishes (∼90% confluence) were serum-deprived for ∼16–18 h in EBM-2 containing 1% FBS, and all subsequent incubations were carried out in serum-free MEM. Cells were loaded with either PP2 or PP3 (1 μm) for 1 h, and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of modified lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), sonicated on ice with a probe sonicator (three times for 15 s), and centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C for 5 min), and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using Pierce protein assay kit. The supernatants, adjusted to 1 mg of protein/ml (cell lysates) were denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (0.5–1 mg of protein) were incubated overnight with monoclonal anti-Src conjugated to agarose or with anti-p47phox antibodies at 4 °C, centrifuged at 5,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and dissociated by boiling in 2 × SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide precast gels. Protein bands were transferred overnight (24 V, 4 °C) onto PVDF membrane (Millipore), probed with primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol, and immunodetected by using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were scanned (UMAX Power Lock II) and quantified by an automated digitizing system UN-SCAN-IT GEL (Silk Scientific Corp.). In Vitro Phosphorylation of p47phox by Src Kinase—In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant p47phox (28Leto T.L. Michael C.G. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane as indicated above. 32P-Labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography and excised from the mem"
https://openalex.org/W2057935783,"High rates of glucose metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport have been associated with increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This mechanism was also proposed as a possible cause for dysfunction and death of pancreatic β cells exposed to high glucose levels. We examined whether high rates of glucose metabolism increase ROS production in purified rat β cells. Glucose up to 20 mm did not stimulate H2O2 or superoxide production, whereas it dose-dependently increased cellular NAD(P)H and FADH2 levels with an EC50 around 8 mm. On the contrary, glucose concentration-dependently suppressed H2O2 and superoxide formation, with a major effect between 0 and 5 mm, parallel to an increase in cellular NAD(P)H levels. This suppressive effect was more marked in β cells with higher NAD(P)H responsiveness to glucose; it was not observed in glucagon-containing α cells, which lacked a glucose-induced increase in NAD(P)H. Suppression was also induced by the mitochondrial substrates leucine and succinate. Experiments with electron transport chain inhibitors indicate a role of respiratory complex I in ROS production at low mitochondrial activity and low NADH levels. Superoxide production at low glucose is potentially cytotoxic, because scavenging by the superoxide dismutase mimetic agent manganese(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin was found to reduce the rate of β cell apoptosis. Analysis of islets cultured at 20 mm glucose confirmed that this condition does not induce ROS production in β cells as a result of their increased rates of glucose metabolism. Our study indicates the need of β cells for basal nutrients maintaining mitochondrial NADH production at levels that suppress ROS accumulation from an inadequate respiratory complex I activity and thus inhibit a potential apoptotic pathway.

Chronically elevated glucose levels cause major lesions in retina, kidney, neurons, and vascular tissue (1Control The Diabetes Group Complications Trial Research N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22937) Google Scholar). The toxic effects of hyperglycemia can be explained by mechanisms that involve increased glucose metabolism (2Evans J.L.

Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). A primary role is often attributed to an excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ETC, electron transport chain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PI, propidium iodide; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; H2DCF-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; HE, hydroethidine; MnTBAP, manganese(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin; GK, glucokinase. at the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) of cells in an early or late stage of glucose-induced dysfunction (4Nishikawa T.

In endothelial cell lines, glucose-induced ROS production appeared a critical upstream event in the process of hyperglycemic damage (4Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Re-oxidation of glucose-generated NADH and FADH2 by the ETC results in a progressively increasing proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. In isolated mitochondria such a condition increases superoxide production once the gradient reaches a critical threshold (3Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar, 7Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Elevated glucose levels are also suspected of causing dysfunction and/or death of insulin-producing β cells through ROS formation (8Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S119-S124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kilpatrick E.D. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether their toxicity in β cells also involves glucose-induced elevations in cellular NADH and FADH2 levels up to the point that mitochondrial energetic coupling is disrupted and followed by ROS formation. This question needs particular attention, because glucose-responsive β cells are specialized to achieve high rates of glucose catabolism at elevated levels of this nutrient (10Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It also bears pathological relevance because β cells appear particularly susceptible to oxidative stress in view of their reportedly low expression of ROS scavenging enzymes (11Grankvist K. Marklund S.L. Taljedal I.B. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 12Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The notion that elevated glucose concentrations induce ROS formation by β cells comes in part from indirect measurements in islets and β cell lines, using up-regulation of ROS scavenging enzymes or a cytoprotective effect of antioxidants as markers for radical formation (13Laybutt D.R. Kaneto H. Hasenkamp W. Grey S. Jonas J.C. Sgroi D.C. Groff A. Ferran C. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka Y.

Direct evidence is based on real-time microscopic monitoring of superoxide formation in isolated intact and dissociated rat islets (16Bindokas V.P. Kuznetsov A. Sreenan S. Polonsky K.S. Roe M.W.

It is however necessary to compare ROS formation with the actual rates of glucose metabolism and/or the corresponding metabolic redox state of the ETC. The present study is conducted on purified rat β cells and islets following exposure to a broad glucose concentration range. It examines whether high glucose increases cellular ROS and superoxide formation, and how ROS formation is correlated with the cellular metabolic redox state; it also investigates whether any of these processes are associated with a higher rate of β cell death. Materials—MnTBAP (manganese(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Germany). Hydroethidine (HE) and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Atpenin a5 was a kind gift of Dr. Satoshi Omura (The Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan). All other substrates or inhibitors were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Purification of Islet α and β Cells and Analysis of Their Metabolic Redox State—Rat islet cells were prepared from male Wistar rats (250–300 g, Janvier, Le Genest Saint-Isle, France) and separated into a β cell (>90% purity) and an endocrine non-β cell population that is enriched in glucagon-containing alpha-cells (18Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, β cells were further sorted according to their metabolic responsiveness to 7.5 mm glucose using cellular NAD(P)H intensity as parameter to discriminate metabolically responsive from non-responsive β cells (20Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Kiekens R. In't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, primary rat islet cells were studied in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Cohn Analog, Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at the indicated glucose concentration. The metabolic redox state of the isolated cell populations was analyzed after 30-min incubation in humidified air (20% O2/5% CO2) at 37 °C. It was determined by flow cytometry measuring cellular fluorescence of NAD(P)H (argon laser 351–363 nm/400–470 nm) and mitochondrial riboflavin (FAD and FMN, argon laser 488/530 nm) using a dual laser FACStar+® system (BD Biosciences) (19Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mean absolute fluorescence intensities (MFI) ± S.E. are shown for 10,000 propidium iodide (PI, 5 μg/ml) negative islet cells. Measurement of H2O2 and Superoxide in Single Islet Cells—Cellular ROS levels were measured in single cells (50 × 103 cells in 400 μl of medium) after 60 min of incubation in humidified air (20% O2/5% CO2) at 37 °C. For H2O2 detection, cells were pre-loaded for 20 min with 25 μm H2DCF-DA in Ham's F-10 medium (containing 5 μg/ml PI, 10 mm glucose and a final concentration of 0.05% Me2SO). Cells were washed twice to remove excess dye and incubated for 60 min prior to simultaneous detection of dichlorofluorescein (DCF, 530 nm bandpass filter) and NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity in PI-negative cells. Presence of H2DCF-DA itself did not interfere with glucose-induced NAD(P)H generation (data not shown). Endogenous riboflavin fluorescence was two orders of magnitude lower than baseline DCF fluorescence and did not contribute to the DCF signal. Superoxide was detected by FACS measurement of cellular HE oxidation, as described by Kroemer et al. (22Castedo M. Ferri K. Roumier T. Metivier D. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Following 60-min incubations, 2.5 μm HE was added (final Me2SO 0.05%), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min prior to analysis of HE-derived red fluorescence (630 nm bandpass filter). Because this analysis was conducted in the absence of PI, a population of damaged cells (typically 2–3% of total) was excluded based on lower forward scatter and distinctively higher fluorescence in the FL3 channel, the latter effect presumably caused by fluorescence enhancement of DNA-bound oxidized HE (23Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. VasquezVivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Endogenous red fluorescence in unstained cells was not influenced by the glucose concentration. Monitoring the rate of HE oxidation for 15 min after probe addition allowed measurement superoxide generation rate by linear curve fitting (Microsoft Excel, r2 > 0.95). Glucose effects on metabolic redox state and superoxide generation were also measured in cells that were dissociated from islets that had been cultured at low and high glucose. Freshly isolated islets were first cultured overnight at 10 mm glucose and then for an additional 72 h at 6 or 20 mm glucose (in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture supplemented as described above) before dissociation (24Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and FACS analysis. Dot plots of the dispersed islet cells showed two populations, corresponding to β and endocrine non-β cells (18Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) were measured in the β cell population that is characterized by higher forward scatter and higher FAD fluorescence (18Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assays for β Cell Apoptosis—An earlier described fluorescence microscopic method, using PI and Hoechst 33342 (25Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), was used to determine the degree of apoptosis in single β cell preparations. Effects on apoptosis were examined by calculating the apoptosis index, which expresses the degree of apoptosis for an experimental condition X relative to that in the control condition (control = 10 mm glucose); this index is calculated as follows: (% apoptotic cells in X – % apoptotic cells in control)/% living cells in control. In whole islets, the degree of apoptosis was determined by FACS analysis of nuclear fragmentation, as described previously (26Van de Casteele M. Kefas B.A. Ling Z. Heimberg H. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative Detection of Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase 1 mRNA in Islets—Islets were pre-cultured for 5 days in 10 mm glucose prior to exposure for 18 h to the indicated glucose concentration with or without MnTBAP, as described (27Jonas J.C. Guiot Y. Rahier J. Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was extracted with oligo(deoxythymidine)-coated magnetic microbeads (Dyna-beads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) and RNA reverse transcribed with the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit using random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to PCR. The primers and the lengths of PCR-generated fragments are listed in Table I. The thermal cycle profile was initiated during a 4-min denaturing step at 94 °C to release DNA polymerase activity. It was followed by 23–28 cycles of amplification (1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 60–62 °C, then 1-min extension at 72 °C) and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and photographed under UV transillumination using a Kodak Digital Science DC40 camera (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Data were expressed relative to reverse transcription-PCR signals for the housekeeping TATA-box-binding protein gene.Table IOligonucleotide primers and cycling conditions used for reverse transcription-PCR detection of rat islet gene cDNAGeneSense/antisensePrimer sequenceAnnealing (°C)Product size (bp)CatalaseSTCTGCAGATACCTGTGAACTG60357ATAGTCAGGGTGGACGTCAGTGGlutathione peroxidase 1SCTCGGTTTCCCGTGCAATCAG65431AGTGCAGCCAGTAATCACCAAGTATA-box-binding proteinSACCCTTCACCAATGACTCCTATG62190AATGATGACTGCAGCAAATCGC Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of n independent experiments. H2DCF-DA- and HE-derived fluorescence was expressed as a percentage of the value measured in 10 mm glucose exposed cells (relative fluorescence). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance or Student's t test where appropriate. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Metabolic Rate in Islet β Cells Is Inversely Related to Cellular Formation of H2O2 and Superoxide—Glucose is a well known regulator of the metabolic redox state in islet β cells. It concentration-dependently increases the cellular levels of the reduced electron carriers NAD(P)H and FADH2/FMNH2 (Fig. 1A), the latter being reflected by a decrease in mitochondrial riboflavin fluorescence (28Chance B. Ernster L. Garland P.B. Lee C.P. Light P.A. Ohnishi T. Ragan C.I. Wong D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The concentration-response curve for NAD(P)H is sigmoidal with an effect from 2.5 mm onwards and with an EC50 of ∼8 mm; the effect on FADH2/FMNH2 was less pronounced and became only detectable above 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). Consequently, the cells exhibited an increase in the NAD(P)H over FAD/FMN ratio when glucose was increased from 0 to 5 mm glucose. Glucose was found to suppress ROS production as measured by the oxidation of H2DCF-DA that was preloaded in β cells (Fig. 1B). ROS levels were highest in absence of glucose and concentration-dependently decreased, predominantly between 0 and 5 mm, reaching the lowest values at 20 mm glucose (Fig. 1B). Cellular ROS levels in glucose-free media were 40% lower than those following exposure to a toxic concentration of H2O2 (10 min, 100 μm, 2.65- ± 1.0-fold increase in DCF as compared with 10 mm glucose control, p < 0.001, n = 5). Cellular ROS production was also suppressed by two other mitochondrial nutrients, leucine (10 mm) and succinic acid (methyl ester, 20 mm) (Fig. 1B). Addition of the NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (1 mm), a competitive inhibitor of nitric-oxide (NO) synthase, or removal of arginine from the culture medium, did not influence low glucose-induced DCF accumulation (data not shown), suggesting that the latter effect was not secondary to an increase in NO production. β Cells also exhibited a superoxide production that was suppressed by glucose, as indicated by the lower oxidation of HE at increasing glucose concentrations (Fig. 1C). Cellular superoxide levels were 3-fold higher in glucose-free medium than at 10 mm glucose. Increasing the glucose concentration above 10 mm further lowered superoxide levels, not statistically significant at 20 mm (Fig. 1C, n = 7) but at 30 mm glucose (85 ± 3% of 10 mm glucose control; p < 0.05, n = 6). The rate of superoxide generation at low glucose was determined by analyzing the time course of HE oxidation. HE oxidation had linear kinetics (r2 > 0.95) between 5 and 15 min after probe addition. Rates (mean slope ± S.D.) were calculated by linear curve fitting; the rate of superoxide generation at 0 and 2.5 mm glucose was thus found to be, respectively, 2.2 ± 0.3- and 1.9 ± 0.4-fold higher than at 10 mm glucose (p < 0.01 versus 10 mm glucose, n = 5). As for peroxide-like ROS, superoxide production at low glucose was completely suppressed by leucine and succinate (Fig. 1C). Islet non-β cells did not exhibit glucose-induced changes in their metabolic redox state as measured by the cellular NAD(P)H and FAD/FMN levels (Fig. 1A). Their H2O2 and superoxide production did not vary with the glucose concentration (Fig. 1, B and C). It was markedly lower than that in β cells, as illustrated by their 10- and 5-fold lower H2DCF- and HE-derived fluorescence intensities (insets in Fig. 1, B and C). β Cells with Lower Metabolic Responsiveness to Glucose Generate More Superoxide—A comparative analysis of individual β cells indicates a wide variation in their HE- and H2DCF-DA-derived fluorescence intensities and in their NAD(P)H response to glucose (representative dot-plots are shown in Fig. 2). At 10 mm glucose, a small subset (around 10%) of β cells can be distinguished with 10-fold higher HE-derived mean fluorescence intensities (Fig. 2, lower row). With decreasing glucose concentrations, the fraction of the cells recovered in this high superoxide-generating subset gradually increased. These data indicate that glucose reduces the number of β cells with elevated superoxide generation but does not succeed in suppressing it in all cells. Previous work has shown intercellular differences in metabolic responsiveness to glucose (20Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Kiekens R. In't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether β cells with higher metabolic responsiveness to glucose corresponded to those with a more marked glucose-induced suppression of superoxide generation. Highly responsive β cells were separated from those with lower metabolic responsiveness based on their increased NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity at 7.5 mm glucose (21Kiekens R. In't Veld P. Mahler T. Schuit F. Van De Winkel M. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and then compared for glucose metabolic rate and superoxide formation. Highly responsive β cells generated more NAD(P)H and FADH2/FMNH2 (Fig. 3) and did so at lower glucose concentrations. Whereas both subsets presented similar superoxide formation in absence of glucose, the high responsive cells exhibited a much stronger glucose-mediated suppression at all glucose concentrations tested (Fig. 3, lower panel). Addition of 10 or 20 mm glucose only partially suppressed superoxide production in the low responsive subpopulation, which is consistent with the heterogeneity in individual levels that was observed in Fig. 2.Fig. 3Lower rates of superoxide generation in β cells with higher metabolic responsiveness to glucose. Freshly isolated β cells were first sorted in two non-overlapping populations with lower (filled squares) or higher (filled triangles) metabolic NAD(P)H response to 7.5 mm glucose. Following 60-min incubation at 37 °C, NAD(P)H levels (upper panel), riboflavin (FAD-FMN) fluorescence (middle panel) and superoxide generation (lower panel) were measured in these β cell subsets. To allow a direct comparison of redox state and superoxide levels, absolute rather than normalized fluorescence is shown. Data represent average MFI ± S.E.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), sustained exposure of intact islets to high glucose (20 mm) recruited their β cells to a redox state that exhibits a left and upward shift of the NAD(P)H response curve to glucose when compared with β cells from 6 mm glucose-cultured islets (Fig. 4, upper panel). Their higher sensitivity to glucose is also reflected by comparison of the concentration-dependent decrease in cellular FAD fluorescence (Fig. 4, middle): at 2.5 mm, glucose exerted already 48 ± 4% of its reducing effect on cellular NAD(P)H and FADH2 levels. At this concentration, glucose completely suppressed superoxide formation in 20 mm cultured β cells, whereas more than 5 mm was needed in 6 mm cultured β cells (Fig. 4). Between 0 and 10 mm glucose, superoxide accumulation was lower in 20 mm cultured β cells than in 6 mm cultured cells (Fig. 4, lower panel). Role of Respiratory Complex Activity in Superoxide Formation by β Cells—Our observations indicate that glucose-induced suppression of superoxide formation are correlated with an increase in cellular NAD(P)H levels. In freshly isolated β cells, these effects are only partially achieved by 2.5 mm glucose (Fig. 1) but can be amplified by inhibiting NADH consumption through the electron transport chain (ETC). In presence of rotenone (100 nm), an inhibitor of ETC complex I, superoxide formation is completely suppressed (Fig. 5, lower panel), whereby the rise in NAD(P)H is attributed to the rotenone-induced block in H+ transfer from NADH (Fig. 5); the associated rise in reduced flavin is compatible with the inhibitor binding downstream of the FMN site in ETC complex I (28Chance B. Ernster L. Garland P.B. Lee C.P. Light P.A. Ohnishi T. Ragan C.I. Wong D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Hatefi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar effects were achieved by the complex III inhibitor antimycin A (200 nm) (Fig. 5), which is expected to lead to a reduced activity of complex I (30Hatefi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). On the contrary, addition of atpenin a5 (100 nm), a specific inhibitor of complex II-succinate dehydrogenase (31Miyadera H. Shiomi K. Ui H. Yamaguchi Y. Masuma R. Tomoda H. Miyoshi H. Osanai A. Kita K. Omura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), did not increase NADH and reduced-flavin levels and did not reduce superoxide formation (Fig. 5). This inhibitor did not affect the 10 mm glucose-induced rise in NAD(P)H and suppression of superoxide formation (Fig. 5) but prevented succinate from inducing similar effects (Supplementary Fig. S1). In view of the latter effect, the atpenin a5-induced flavin oxidation (Fig. 5) indicates a specific block in fumarate and FADH2 formation at the level of complex II-succinate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that respiratory complex activity consumes NADH and thus decreases NADH-induced protection against superoxide accumulation in conditions of inadequate substrate supply to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The latter condition is then characterized by a low NADH over FAD-FMN ratio as measured in freshly isolated β cells at low nutrient levels (Fig. 1). Superoxide Generation Contributes to Apoptosis of β Cells with Low Metabolic Activity—Glucose concentration-dependently decreases the susceptibility of rat β cells to apoptotic cell death during culture (25Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We tested whether this effect is in part mediated by suppressing superoxide generation. Addition of the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP (50 μm) significantly (p < 0.05, n = 6) reduced superoxide levels in β cells exposed to low glucose concentrations (Fig. 6A, representative dot plots shown in panels B–D). Scavenging of superoxide by MnTBAP also decreased the percent apoptotic, single β cells (Fig. 6E) after 72-h exposure to 3 mm glucose. Similar effects were seen after addition of the mitochondrial fuels leucine (10 mm) or succinate (20 mm) (Fig. 6E), which is consistent with their ability to suppress ROS production in β cells. A similar protective effect was observed when islets were studied instead of isolated β cells. Islets were cultured for 72 h at 3, 10, or 20 mm glucose, with or without the ROS scavenger MnTBAP. The degree of apoptosis was quantified by FACS analysis of cellular DNA, using cycloheximide-treated islets as positive control (25Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B)"

To study the role of collagen VII in these cancers, we examined Ras-driven tumorigenesis in RDEB keratinocytes. Cells devoid of collagen VII did not form tumors in mice, whereas those retaining a specific collagen VII fragment (the amino-terminal noncollagenous domain NC1) were tumorigenic. Forced NC1 expression restored tumorigenicity to collagen VII–null epidermis in a non–cell-autonomous fashion. Fibronectin-like sequences within NC1 (FNC1) promoted tumor cell invasion in a laminin 5–dependent manner and were required for tumorigenesis. Tumor-stroma interactions mediated by collagen VII thus promote neoplasia, and retention of NC1 sequences in a subset of RDEB patients may contribute to their increased susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma."

In order to maintain endothelial barrier function, VE-cadherin function is tightly regulated through mechanisms that involve protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Here, we show that loss of VE-cadherin function results in intercellular gap formation and a drop in electrical resistance of monolayers of primary human endothelial cells. Detailed analysis revealed that loss of endothelial cell-cell adhesion, induced by VE-cadherin-blocking antibodies, is preceded by and dependent on a rapid activation of Rac1 and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, VE-cadherin-associated β-catenin is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon loss of cell-cell contact. Finally, the redox-sensitive proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is activated and recruited to cell-cell junctions following the loss of VE-cadherin homotypic adhesion. Conversely, the inhibition of Pyk2 activity in endothelial cells by the expression of CRNK (CADTK/CAKβ-related non-kinase), an N-terminal deletion mutant that acts in a dominant negative fashion, not only abolishes the increase in β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation but also prevents the loss of endothelial cell-cell contact. These results implicate Pyk2 in the reduced cell-cell adhesion induced by the Rac-mediated production of ROS through the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin.

A loss of VE-cadherin function results in unstable endothelial junctions and a decrease in endothelial monolayer electrical resistance, despite the fact that several other adhesion proteins such as claudin, occludin, and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 are also concentrated at sites of endothelial cell-cell contact (1Dejana E.

Biol. 2004; 24: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, VE-cadherin function is indispensable for the maintenance of the endothelial barrier function. VE-cadherin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via the armadillo family members β- and γ-catenin that bind the actin-binding protein α-catenin (3Dejana E. Bazzoni G. Lampugnani M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Vestweber D. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin function is controlled by cytoskeletal dynamics and by protein phosphorylation events. Lampugnani et al. (5Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and associated catenins is increased in loosely confluent endothelial monolayers, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation is reduced in confluent cells. Recently, a novel VE-protein tyrosine phosphatase was shown to interact with VE-cadherin and to increase VE-cadherin-mediated barrier function (6Nawroth R. Poell G. Ranft A. Kloep S. Samulowitz U.

Salva S.M. Woolkalis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5983-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) reported that the phosphatase SHP-2 (SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase Shp2) interacts with β-catenin and thereby regulates thrombin-induced changes in the endothelial barrier function (7Ukropec J.A.

The specific association of VE-protein tyrosine phosphatase with VE-cadherin and SHP-2 with β-catenin provides further evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of the VE-cadherin-catenin complex is important for the regulation of endothelial cell-cell adhesion. Recently, it became clear that Rac1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g. H2O2) disrupt VE-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion (8van Wetering S. van Buul J.D. Quik S. Mul F.P.

Okuda M. Abe J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1790-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Pyk2, also known as CAKβ/RAFTK/CADTK and FAK2, is a redox-sensitive tyrosine kinase that can be dephosphorylated by SHP-2 (13Cheng J.J. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J. Biol.

To induce the loss of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, we made use of antibodies that block interactions between the extracellular regions of the VE-cadherin protein (15Corada M. Liao F.

This strategy mimics the loss of endothelial integrity induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines or by leukocyte transendothelial migration. We found that the loss of VE-cadherin function activates the small GTPase Rac1 and increases production of ROS, which subsequently leads to the loss of cell-cell adhesion. This reduced cell-cell adhesion is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, which depends on the activation of Pyk2. Together, these data provide novel information on the role of Pyk2 in the regulation of VE-cadherin-based endothelial cell-cell adhesion and endothelial integrity. Reagents and Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to VE-cadherin (cl75), β-catenin, α-catenin, Pyk2, and phosphotyrosine (PY-20) were from BD Transduction Laboratories.

Fetal calf serum was from Invitrogen. Basic fibroblast growth factor was from Roche Applied Science. Phospho-pyk2 (pY402) was purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). EDTA, EGTA, and α-FLAG monoclonal Ab (clone M2) were from Sigma. Cell Cultures and Treatments—Immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (16Hordijk P.L. Anthony E. Mul F.P. Rientsma R. Oomen L.C. Roos D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and primary HUVEC isolated from umbilical cord or purchased from Cambrex (Baltimore, MD) were cultured in fn-coated culture flasks (Nunc, Invitrogen) in Medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% (v/v) pooled heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 units/ml heparin, 300 μg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After reaching confluency, the endothelial cells were passaged by treatment with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). To disrupt VE-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion, cells were treated with either 12.5 or 25 μg/ml anti-VE-cadherin cl75 antibody, as indicated in the figure legends. To study signaling effects during the induced loss of VE-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion, cells were stimulated for only 10 min with cl75, as indicated in figure legends. All of the cell lines were cultured or incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Peptide Synthesis—The Rac17-32 peptide, which inhibits Rac1 function (18Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S. Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was designed in conjunction with the protein transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein (19Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide (YGRKKRRQRRRGTCLLISYTTNAFPGEY) was synthesized at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Adenoviral Infection of CRNK Construct—The recombinant adenoviral vector CRNK was a kind gift of Dr. L. Graves (University of North Carolina) (20Sorokin A. Kozlowski P. Graves L. Philip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21521-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were serum-starved for 30 min and subsequently infected with adenovirus containing the CRNK-construct in serum-free culture medium. After 3 h, medium was replaced by normal culture medium, and following 16–24 h of infection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and used for assays. Immunocytochemistry—HUVEC were cultured on fn-coated glass coverslips, fixed, and immunostained as described previously (16Hordijk P.L. Anthony E. Mul F.P. Rientsma R. Oomen L.C. Roos D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a mAb to VE-cadherin (7H1, 10 μg/ml) or to PY-20 (10 μg/ml). Polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (10 μg/ml), anti-α-catenin (10 μg/ml), and anti-β-catenin (10 μg/ml) were used when endothelial cells were pretreated with mAbs to VE-cadherin. Subsequent visualization was performed with fluorescently labeled secondary Abs (10 μg/ml). F-actin was visualized with Texas Red phalloidin (1 unit/ml). In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml Rac17-32 peptide followed by washing. Images were recorded with a ZEISS LSM510 confocal microscope with appropriate filter settings. Cross-talk between the green and red channel was avoided by use of sequential scanning. Electric Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing—Endothelial cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/well (0.8 cm2) on fn-coated electrode arrays and grown to confluency. After the electrode check of the array and when the basal electrical resistance of the endothelial monolayer reached a plateau, Abs to VE-cadherin were added and electrical resistance was monitored on-line at 37 °C and at 5% CO2 with the electric cell substrate impedance sensing Model-100 Controller from BioPhysics, Inc. (Troy, NY). After 8 h, the data were collected and changes in resistance of endothelial monolayer were analyzed. Permeability—Permeability of HUVEC monolayers cultured on 5-μm pore 6.5-mm Transwell filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was determined using FITC-labeled 3000 Dextran as described previously (8van Wetering S. van Buul J.D. Quik S. Mul F.P. Anthony E.C. ten Klooster J.P. Collard J.G. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The permeability response to thrombin (1 unit/ml) after 30 min was used as a control. After the assay, filters were washed with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing PBS and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% Triton X-100-containing PBS and stained with Texas Red phalloidin to inspect the HUVEC monolayer by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were grown to confluency on fn-coated dishes (50 cm2), washed twice gently with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm orthovanadate with the addition of fresh protease-inhibitor-mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4). After 10 min on ice, cell lysates were collected and precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (15 μl for each sample, Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 s at 4 °C) was incubated with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose that had been coated with 5 μg/ml β-catenin mAb for1hat 4 °C under continuous mixing. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll), and the blots were blocked with blocking buffer (1% (w/v) low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) for 1 h and subsequently incubated at room temperature with the appropriate Abs for 1 h followed by incubation with rabbit-α-mouse-Ig-horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Between the various incubation steps, the blots were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and finally developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Rac1 Activity Assays—Cells were stimulated for the indicated times with cl75 (25 μg/ml) or 5 mm EDTA. Cells were kept on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed for 10 min in lysis buffer, and assayed for Rac activation with glutathione S-transferase-p21-activating kinase, as described by Sander et al. (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Finally, in both assays, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. After the fourth wash, the beads were put into new tubes and subsequently suspended in 2× sample buffer containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Cell Fractionation—Cells were grown to confluency on fn-coated dishes (50 cm2), washed twice gently with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer, as described above, containing 1% Triton X-100 instead of 1% Nonidet P-40. After 10 min on ice, cell lysates were collected and separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 1 min at 4 °C). The pellet fraction contained Triton X-100-insoluble proteins associated to the actin cytoskeleton, and the supernatant contained Triton X-100-soluble cytosolic proteins. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol and were immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE and continued as described above. Measurement of ROS—To measure generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endothelial cells, primary HUVEC cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were loaded with dihydrorodamine-1,2,3 (DHR, 30 μm; Molecular Probes) for 30 min, washed, and subsequently treated with the VE-cadherin Ab cl75, control Ab IgG, or medium. Fluorescence of DHR was quantified by time lapse confocal microscopy. Intensity values are shown as the percentage increase relative to the basal DHR values at the start of the experiment. VE-cadherin is an essential homotypic adhesion molecule that specifically localizes to adherens junctions and controls endothelial integrity. Using Abs that recognize distinct epitopes in the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin, we and others (15Corada M. Liao F. Lindgren M. Lampugnani M.G. Breviario F. Frank R. Muller W.A. Hicklin D.J.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have described differential effects on the permeability of endothelial cells. However, these studies were in part based on diffusion of a fluorescently labeled high molecular weight marker over the endothelial monolayer to measure the endothelial integrity. We now used a more sensitive approach, which is based on real-time analysis of the electrical resistance of endothelial monolayers. This analysis shows that the VE-cadherin-blocking Ab cl75 rapidly reduces the transendothelial resistance, whereas the non-blocking Ab 7H1 did not have any effect on the resistance (Fig. 1A). Previous reports from our group and from others (15Corada M. Liao F. Lindgren M. Lampugnani M.G. Breviario F. Frank R. Muller W.A. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Dejana E.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that blocking VE-cadherin Abs are able to disrupt endothelial junctions and induce a redistribution of VE-cadherin over the endothelial cell surface. We also found that β-catenin became diffusely distributed when the endothelial cells were treated with the cl75 Ab (Fig. 1B). To study whether a loss of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion induced the dissociation of the VE-cadherin complex from the actin cytoskeleton, we fractionated the cl75-treated endothelial cells and analyzed the cytoskeletal and the cytosol/membrane fractions for the presence of α-catenin, which links VE-cadherin and β-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton. These experiments showed that α-catenin shifted from the cytoskeleton to the membrane and cytosol fraction when VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts were disrupted (Fig. 1C). Also, β-catenin translocated to the same fraction as α-catenin upon the loss of cell-cell contact (see Fig. 8B). These data indicate that “outside-in” signaling induced by the loss of VE-cadherin-mediated homotypic interaction dissociates the entire VE-cadherin complex from the cytoskeleton.Fig. 8Pyk2 is involved in endothelial permeability and phosphorylation of β-catenin upon the loss of VE-cadherin function. A, expression of CRNK prevents cl75-induced permeability. HUVEC were cultured and grown to confluency on Transwell filters and infected with Ad CRNK as described under “Materials and Methods” (open bars) or left untreated (closed bars). Subsequently, cells were treated with cl75 or left untreated as described under “Materials and Methods” and FITC-labeled 3000 Dextran was added to the upper compartment of the Transwell. After 3 h, the level of fluorescence in the lower compartment was measured and calculated as the percentage increase compared with control levels. Control levels represent basal leakage of the endothelial monolayer incubated with medium alone. The experiment is performed twice in triplicate. CRNK significantly reduces cl75-induced increase of endothelial monolayer permeability (p < 0.01). B, expression of CRNK prevents cl75-induced loss of endothelial cell-cell adhesion. Cells were cultured on glass covers, infected with Ad CRNK, and treated with cl75. Fixed and permeabilized cells were stained for CRNK expression in green (α-FLAG; a and e), β-catenin in red (b and f), and F-actin in grayscale (d and h). Merge shows CRNK and β-catenin localization (c and g). Bar, 20 μm. C, Pyk2 mediates β-catenin phosphorylation. Cells were treated as described in the legend of Fig. 4B with the exception of the expression of CRNK (lower panel). Upper panel shows increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin after 30 min of incubation with cl75, which is inhibited by CRNK. The middle panel shows equal amounts of β-catenin per immunoprecipitation (I.P.). The experiment was done three times with similar results. D, Pyk2 mediates β-catenin association with the cytoskeleton. Cells were cultured as described in the legend of Fig. 1C. Immunoblotting for β-catenin shows that cl75 treatment induced a loss of β-catenin from the cytoskeletal fraction (upper panel), which is prevented by CRNK. The lower panel shows CRNK expression. A representative of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we have shown by protein transduction that an active mutant of the small GTPase Rac, RacV12, induced the loss of cell-cell contacts of confluent endothelial cells (8van Wetering S. van Buul J.D.

Physiol. 2004; 287: H704-H711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed recently that Rac1 inhibition leads to a loss of VE-cadherin-adhesive capacity. To test whether “outside-in” signaling induced by loss of VE-cadherin function involves Rac1, Rac1-GTP loading was measured by pull-down assays with glutathione S-transferase-p21-activating kinase. These experiments showed that cl75 indeed induces Rac1 activation (Fig. 2A). The response was highest at 5 min, after which it declined somewhat, although Rac1 activation remained elevated up to 30 min (Fig. 2A). Rac1 activation results in increased ROS production in neutrophils as well as in endothelial cells (8van Wetering S. van Buul J.D. Quik S. Mul F.P. Anthony E.C. ten Klooster J.P. Collard J.G.

Therefore, we tested the possibility that Rac activation, effected by the loss of VE-cadherin function, induces ROS production. Consistently, cl75-induced loss of VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts promoted a rapid increase in ROS production (Fig. 2B). Additional experiments showed that irrelevant antibodies such as isotype control IgG1 or medium changes did not mimic the induction of ROS. Moreover, the ROS production is followed by loss of cell-cell contacts, as is observed with real-time phase-contrast microscopy imaging (Fig. 2C, and supplemental movies). These observations indicate that activation of Rac1 and the production of ROS are rapidly induced following the loss of VE-cadherin function. To define whether the cellular response to VE-cadherin-mediated outside-in signaling, i.e. the formation of intercellular gaps, in fact depends on Rac1 signaling, we used a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of Rac1, Tat-Rac17-32. This peptide represents part of the effector loop of Rac1 and competes with Rac1-effector interactions, thus preventing down-stream signaling (18Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S. Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30van Wetering S. van den Berk N. van Buul J.D. Mul F.P. Lommerse I. Mous R. ten Klooster J.P. Zwaginga J.J. Hordijk P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C343-C352Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After 30 min, cl75 had maximally reduced the endothelial resistance of untreated control monolayers (Fig. 2D). Tat-Rac17-32-incubated monolayers showed a reduced response to the cl75 treatment (∼50% reduction in the loss of resistance, Fig. 2D). This indicates that the loss of cell-cell contact depends, at least in part, on Rac1 activity. Interestingly, under control conditions, we observed a small decrease in the electrical resistance of the endothelial monolayer when the confluent endothelial monolayers were incubated with Tat-Rac17-32 (data not shown). This finding suggests that, to maintain stable endothelial junctions, a low level of active Rac1 is required (27Waschke J. Drenckhahn D. Adamson R.H. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H704-H711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these findings indicate that VE-cadherin-mediated outside-in signaling, resulting from a loss of cadherin function, requires Rac1 to induce loss of cell-cell adhesion. Scavenging ROS by incubating the cells with N-acetylcysteine (N-AC) prevented the cl75-induced redistribution of VE-cadherin (Fig. 3A). In line with this result, the Ab-induced increase in endothelial monolayer permeability was prevented by N-AC (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we found that N-AC decreased the permeability of 7H1-treated endothelial monolayers (Fig. 3B) and medium-treated monolayers (data not shown). The effect of thrombin on the permeability seemed to act independently from ROS, because N-AC was not able to prevent thrombin-induced permeability. These findings indicate that Rac-mediated production of ROS regulates the endothelial barrier function and that ROS are important mediators of VE-cadherin outside-in signaling. Low levels of cell-cell contact are associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the VE-cadherin complex (5Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Andriopoulou P. Esser S. Risau W. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2065-2077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since cl75 induces the loss of endothelial cell-cell contacts, we studied its effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional proteins in confluent monolayers. Immunocytochemical analys"

W., and Guse, A. H. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 150, 581–588). The objective of this study was to analyze whether the first subcellular Ca2+ signals obtained upon NAADP stimulation of T-lymphocytes depend on the functional expression of ryanodine receptors. Using combined microinjection and high resolution confocal calcium imaging, we demonstrate here that subcellular Ca2+ signals, characterized by amplitudes between ∼30 and 100 nm and diameters of ∼0.5 μm, preceded global Ca2+ signals. Co-injection of the ryanodine receptor antagonists ruthenium red and ryanodine together with NAADP abolished the effects of NAADP, whereas the d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate antagonist heparin and the Ca2+ entry blocker SKF&96365 were without effect. This pharmacological approach was confirmed by a molecular knock-down approach. Jurkat T cell clones with largely reduced expression of ryanodine receptors did not respond to microinjections of NAADP. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ca2+ release channel sensitive to NAADP in T-lymphocytes is the ryanodine receptor. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a potent Ca2+-mobilizing nucleotide involved in T cell Ca2+ signaling (Berg, I., Potter, B. V. L., Mayr, G. W., and Guse, A. H. (2000) J.

Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) 1The abbreviations used are: NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; InsP3, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; pm, plasma membrane; cyt, cytosol; nuc, nucleus; ROI, region of interest; RyR, ryanodine receptor. is an endogenous nucleotide in eukaryotic cells and to date represents the most powerful Ca2+-releasing compound. This compound was discovered by Lee and co-workers as an impurity of NADP in 1987 (1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its structure was obtained in 1995 (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In contrast to the other known Ca2+-releasing compounds, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (for review see Ref. 3Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (for review see Ref. 4Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Ca2+ channel sensitive to NAADP, is still a matter of debate. Pharmacological Ca2+ release data obtained in sea urchin egg homogenates suggest that neither the InsP3 receptor nor the ryanodine receptor (RyR) represents the molecular target for NAADP (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In addition, NAADP appears not to act on the classical rapidly exchanging Ca2+ store, the endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, a NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ pool was separated from the cADPR- and InsP3-sensitive one by stratification of sea urchin eggs (5Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, this store was identified as the reserve granule of eggs, a lysosome-related organelle (6Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Recently, a lysosome-related acidic Ca2+ store sensitive to NAADP was also detected in higher eukaryotic cells, e.g. pancreatic acinar cells and the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line (7Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J. Galione A. J. Biol.

Although the pharmacological characterization of NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling in sea urchin eggs resulted in the conclusion that a novel Ca2+ channel unrelated to the known intracellular Ca2+ release channels is involved, a number of reports from heart and skeletal muscle and pancreatic acinar cells suggest that RyR are the Ca2+ channels mediating the effect of NAADP (9Mojzisova A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Accordingly, different models resulting from these conflicting data have been postulated. The two-pool model (12Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) consists of two separate Ca2+ pools: a lysosome-related Ca2+ pool with the novel NAADP receptor giving rise to spatiotemporally restricted trigger Ca2+ and an endoplasmic reticulum-related Ca2+ pool with InsP3 receptors and RyR, which then respond to the trigger Ca2+ by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The other model reduced the number of Ca2+ channels sensitive to NAADP to the RyR but postulated different binding proteins for NAADP and cADPR, mediating their effects at the RyR (11Gerasimenko J.V. Maruyama Y. Yano K. Dolman N.J. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that global Ca2+ signaling induced by NAADP in human Jurkat T-lymphocytes depends on functional expression of RyR and also on Ca2+ entry (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because that report was compatible with both models, the present study was conducted to analyze the very initial subcellular Ca2+ release events observed upon NAADP stimulation and, in particular, to understand whether the RyR is necessary also for these spatiotemporally restricted Ca2+ signals. Materials—Fetal calf serum (tetracycline-free) was obtained from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Fura-2/AM, ionomycin, ryanodine, SKF 96365, and ruthenium red were purchased from Calbiochem. NAADP and heparin were supplied by Sigma. cADPR was obtained from Biolog (Bremen, Germany). Cell Culture—Jurkat T-lymphocytes (clone JMP) were cultured as described previously (14Guse A.H. Roth E. Emmrich F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Tet-On Jurkat T cell clones stably transfected with pTRE2-enhanced green fluorescent protein/E2 (abbreviated as clone E2), pTRE2-511/25 (abbreviated as clone 25), and pTRE2-240/10 (abbreviated as clone 10) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with Glutamax I, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (free of tetracycline, Biochrom), 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 400 μg/ml G418-sulfate (15Schwarzmann N.

Ratiometric Ca2+ Imaging—The cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM as described by Kunerth et al. (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and kept in the dark at room temperature until use. Thin glass coverslips (0.1 mm) were coated with bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) and poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). Silicon grease was used to seal small chambers consisting of a rubber O-ring on the glass coverslips. 60 μl of buffer A containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and a 40-μl cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) suspended in the same buffer were added into the small chamber (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The coverslip with cells slightly attached to the bovine serum albumin/poly-l-lysine coating was mounted on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2). Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed as described recently (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used an Improvision imaging system (Tübingen, Germany) built around the Leica microscope at 100-fold magnification. Illumination at 340 and 380 nm was carried out using a monochromator system (Polychromator IV, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Images were taken with a gray-scale CCD camera (type C4742-95-12ER; Hamamatsu, Enfield, United Kingdom) operated in 8-bit mode. The spatial resolution was 512 × 640 pixel at 100-fold magnification. Camera exposure times were 12 (at 340 nm) and 4 ms (at 380 nm). The acquisition rate was ∼1 ratio m 160 ms. Raw data images were stored on a hard disk. Confocal Ca2+ images were obtained by off-line no-neighbor deconvolution using the volume deconvolution module of the Openlab software as described recently for 3T3 fibroblasts (17Bruzzone S. Kunerth S. Zocchi E. De Flora A. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The deconvolved images were used to construct ratio images (340/380). Finally, ratio values were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by external calibration. To reduce noise, ratio images were subjected to median filter (3 × 3) as described previously (16Kunerth S. Mayr G.W. Koch-Nolte F. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Data processing was performed using Openlab software, version 1.7.8, 3.0.9, or 3.5.2 (Improvision, Tübingen, Germany). Microinjection—Microinjections were carried out as described previously (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Kunerth S. Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Gu X. Huang L. Yang Z. Zhang L. Mills S.J. Zhang L.H. Potter B.V.L. Guse A.H. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We used an Eppendorf system (transjector type 5246, micromanipulator type 5171, Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, Hamburg, Germany) with Femtotips II as pipettes. NAADP and/or ruthenium red were diluted to their final concentration in intracellular buffer (20 mm HEPES, 110 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and filtered (0.2 μm) before use. To avoid any contamination of Ca2+ in the solution to be injected, a small amount of Chelex resin beads was added. Injections were made using the semiautomatic mode of the system with the following instrumental settings: injection pressure, 60 (clone JMP) or 40 hectoPascals (clones E2, 10, and 25); compensatory pressure, 30 (clone JMP) or 25 hectoPascals (clones E2, 10, and 25); injection time, 0.5 (clone JMP) or 0.3 s (clones E2, 10, and 25), and velocity of the pipette, 700 μm/s. Under such conditions, the injection volume was 1–1.5% cell volume (19Guse A.H. Berg I. da Silva C.P. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8546-8550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subcellular Ca2+ signaling upon microinjection of 100 nm NAADP into Jurkat T-lymphocytes (clone JMP) remained almost unchanged for a very short, initial period of a few hundred milliseconds (Fig. 1A; time point 37.730 s). Characteristic NAADP-induced subcellular signals were observed (Fig. 1A; time point 37.903 s). These initial signals usually were localized close to the site of injection and rapidly converged into a larger signal still remaining mainly in a zone close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A; time point 38.077 s). The signal spread in a ring-like structure before it also arrived in the central part of the cell (Fig. 1A; time points 38.252 and 38.433 s). Thus, 100 nm NAADP in the microinjection pipette induced a very rapid global response leaving just a very limited period of time, usually <1.5 s, to analyze subcellular Ca2+ signaling events. To expand this pacemaker phase, the pipette concentration of NAADP was reduced to 30 nm, a concentration still sufficient to induce global Ca2+ signaling (20Berg I. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, subcellular Ca2+ signals of very small diameter and amplitude were observed (Fig. 1B; time point 40.562 and 41.260 s). As for the 100 nm NAADP injections, the characteristic ring-like signaling structure became visible before global Ca2+ signaling started (Fig. 1B; time point 42.303 and 43.531 s). Importantly, when intracellular buffer, the vehicle for NAADP injections, was microinjected into Jurkat T-lymphocytes, no alterations in subcellular Ca2+ signaling were observed (Fig. 1C). These control data, together with the fact that in the very initial period after microinjection almost no changes in Ca2+ signaling were observed, suggest that (i) the subcellular signals were caused by NAADP and that (ii) the temporal resolution of image acquisition was sufficient to analyze the very initial NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals. A magnified view of the images showing NAADP-induced subcellular Ca2+ signals revealed that, in case of the 100 nm injection, the signals were more concentrated in one part of the cell, almost merging into one much bigger Ca2+ signal (Fig. 2A, arrow; diameter of the merged signal ∼2 μm). However, individual small Ca2+ signals with diameters characteristic for Ca2+ quarks (diameter ∼0.5 μm) were still observed in close vicinity to the bigger signal (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). Upon 30 nm NAADP microinjections, mainly the smaller Ca2+ signals were observed (Fig. 2B, arrowheads). Very recently, we have shown that global Ca2+ signals evoked by microinjection of NAADP in T cells were completely dependent on functional expression of RyR (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, these data left open the possibility that NAADP may initially activate a Ca2+ channel different from the RyR, giving rise to local Ca2+ signals, which then by the process of CICR would trigger RyR, according to the 2-pool model proposed originally by Cancela et al. (12Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the 2-pool model and a model where RyR directly (or via an additional binding protein) responds to NAADP (11Gerasimenko J.V. Maruyama Y. Yano K. Dolman N.J. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Gerasimenko O.V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), subcellular NAADP-induced Ca2+ signals as described in Figs. 1 and 2 were analyzed under further experimental conditions. Ca2+ signaling was analyzed in T cells co-injected with the following: (i) NAADP and the RyR antagonists ruthenium red and ryanodine; (ii) NAADP and the InsP3 antagonist heparin; or (iii) NAADP and the Ca2+ entry blocker SKF 96365. As reported previously (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the global Ca2+ signal observed upon NAADP injection was completely abolished when ruthenium red was co-injected (Fig. 3A). An analysis of small subcellular regions of interest (ROI) set either close to the plasma membrane (pm), the cytosol (cyt), or the nucleus (nuc) revealed an oscillatory behavior of the local [Ca2+] (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the amplitude of local Ca2+ signals increased with time in the presence of NAADP (Fig. 3B, black tracings). In contrast, when NAADP was co-injected with ruthenium red, the subcellular signals remained at similar amplitudes compared with buffer injections (Fig. 3B, red and blue tracings). Quantitative evaluation of an array of microinjection and preincubation data revealed the following. Co-injection of the antagonists of RyR, ruthenium red and ryanodine (the latter at a high inhibitory concentration), completely blocked subcellular Ca2+ signals evoked by NAADP, regardless of the subcellular localization of the signals (Fig. 4). In contrast, neither co-injection of the InsP3 antagonist heparin nor preincubation with the Ca2+ entry blocker SKF 96365 antagonized subcellular signals evoked by NAADP (Fig. 4). Rather, a weak stimulatory effect of both heparin microinjection and preincubation with SKF 96365 in the absence and presence of NAADP (co-)injection was observed (Fig. 4). The weak agonistic effect of heparin at the RyR and the weak Ca2+-mobilizing properties of SKF 96365 are well documented (21Bezprozvanny I.B. Ondrias K. Kaftan E. Stoyanovski D.A. Ehrlich B.E. Mol.

Autoinactivation of the NAADP signaling system by injection of a high concentration of NAADP resulted in signal amplitudes comparable to buffer injections. In addition, subcellular Ca2+ signals evoked by the established RyR agonist cADPR were fully blocked by this procedure (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effect of various Ca2+ signaling inhibitors on the amplitude of NAADP evoked subcellular Ca2+ signals. Local responses were recorded in the cytosol close to the pm, in the cyt, or in the nuc and expressed as the difference between the maximal peak amplitude and the amplitude of the surrounding area as shown for an example in Fig. 3. Pipette concentrations of inhibitors are as follows: ruthenium red (RuRed) (10 μm); ryanodine (Rya) (20 mm); and heparin (Hep) (1 mg/ml) (note that these concentrations are diluted 1:50–1:100 in the cytosol). The cells were preincubated with SKF 96365 (30 μm) for 15 min in the extracellular medium. Peak amplitudes are given as the mean ± S.E. (n = 5–14 cells for each condition); p values were obtained from the Student's t test as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the spatiotemporal pattern of Ca2+ signaling evoked by NAADP compared with the pattern induced by the established RyR agonist cADPR did not result in significant differences (Fig. 5) as can be seen from the images (Fig. 5A) and the ROI tracings close to the pm, in the cyt, or in the nuc (Fig. 5B). Although the pharmacological data and the spatiotemporal characteristics of NAADP-mediated subcellular Ca2+ signals suggest involvement of RyR, the use of inhibitors may be mis-leading due to insufficient specificity. Therefore, in a second independent approach, microinjection and imaging experiments were conducted in RyR knock-down T cell clones (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H.

These RyR knock-down Jurkat T cell clones were obtained by stable transfection with plasmids expressing antisense RNA against RyR (15Schwarzmann N. Kunerth S. Weber K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50636-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Clone 25 expressed antisense RNA specific for the type 3 RyR, whereas clone 10 expressed an antisense RNA fragment targeting all three types of RyR. As control, a Jurkat T cell clone with stable expression of an antisense fragment directed toward a protein not expressed in T cells was chosen (clone E2; fragment directed against enhanced green fluorescent protein). Largely reduced expression of RyR on the protein level was analyzed by Western blot experiments and is documented by Langhorst et al. (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Schwarzmann et al. (15Schwarzmann N. Kunerth S. Weber K. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50636-50642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microinjection of NAADP into T cells of the control clone E2 resulted in comparable subcellular signals as described above for the Jurkat T cell clone JMP (Fig. 6A). In stark contrast, no changes in subcellular Ca2+ signaling were observed in the RyR knock-down T cells, neither in the pan knock-down clone 10 (Fig. 6B) nor in the type 3-specific knock-down clone 25 (Fig. 6C). Quantitative evaluation of individual ROI set close beneath the pm, in the cyt, or in the nuc resulted in an even clearer picture (Fig. 7) compared with the experiments described in Figs. 3 and 4. Rapidly after microinjection of NAADP, the amplitude of subcellular Ca2+ signals in all three ROIs increased in control clone E2 but remained almost unchanged in knock-down clones 10 and 25 (Fig. 7B). Quantitative evaluation of such experiments showed that NAADP induced a statistically significant increase of the signal amplitude in all three ROI in control clone E2, whereas in RyR knock-down clones 10 and 25, no significant differences to buffer injections were observed.Fig. 7Inhibition of subcellular Ca2+ signals induced by NAADP in RyR knock-down T cell clones. Jurkat T cells (subclones E2, 10, and 25) were loaded with Fura-2/AM and subjected to combined Ca2+ imaging and microinjection as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of global [Ca2+] (A) or local [Ca2+] in response to injection of NAADP (30 nm) into control clone E2 or RyR knock-down clone 10 or 25 is shown. In B, local responses were recorded in the cytosol close to the pm, in the cyt, or in the nuc and expressed as the difference between the maximal peak amplitude and the amplitude of the surrounding area. Arrows indicate time point of injection. C, peak amplitudes as in B expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n = 8–11 cells for each condition); p values obtained from the Student's t test as indicated. In the condition “NAADP- -,” cells were microinjected with intracellular buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we report that the initial subcellular Ca2+ signals induced by microinjection of NAADP depend on the functional expression of RyR in human T cells. Cancela et al. (23Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were the first to show that Ca2+ spiking evoked by NAADP could be efficiently blocked by an inhibitory concentration of ryanodine (23Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Obviously influenced by the fact that inhibition of RyR did not affect NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in the sea urchin egg system (2Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), Cancela et al. (23Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) interpreted their data not as a direct effect but rather as inhibition of CICR via RyR secondary to the “trigger Ca2+” provided by a separate and novel receptor/Ca2+ release channel sensitive to NAADP. In a recent report (13Langhorst M.F. Schwarzmann N. Guse A.H. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both RyR inhibition and the down-regulation of its expression almost completely abolished NAADP-mediated global Ca2+ signaling in T cells. These data, although pronouncing the role of RyR in NAADP-induced Ca2+ signaling in T cells, were still compatible with a separate and novel receptor/Ca2+ release channel sensitive to NAADP. Accordingly, the task of this putative channel would then be to initiate CICR via RyR by evoking local pacemaker Ca2+ signals. The alternative model is simpler and has been proposed for heart and skeletal muscle and for pancreatic acinar cells (9Mojzisova A. Krizanova O. Zacikova L. Kominkova V. Ondrias K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 331: 674-677Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Hohenegger M. Suko J. Dscheidlinger R. Drobny H. Zidar A. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). NAADP either directly or via a specific binding protein binds to RyR to induce opening of its Ca2+ channel. In the experiments described in the current report, inhibition by the antagonists of RyR, ryanodine (at high concentration) or ruthenium red, abolished any NAADP-mediated subcellular Ca2+ signals above intrinsic background. In contrast, inhibition of InsP3 receptors by heparin or inhibition of Ca2+ entry by SKF 96365 did not block but rather enhanced the subcellular signals. Such agonistic properties of heparin on RyR are well documented (21Bezprozvanny I.B. Ondrias K. Kaftan E. Stoyanovski D.A. Ehrlich B.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Likewise, already in the original publication the inventors of SKF 96365, Merrit et al. (22Merrit J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) stated that “in some conditions in either intact or permeabilized cells, SKF 96365 appeared to cause some discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores” (22Merrit J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Thus, the slight increase in the amplitudes of subcellular Ca2+ signals in heparin-injected or SKF 96365-preincubated cells is not unexpected. In the context of the experiments described here, these positive controls confirm the specificity of the antagonistic effects seen with high ryanodine concentrations and ruthenium red. Most importantly, comparable inhibitory effects on NAADP-mediated subcellular Ca2+ signals were also obtained in RyR knock-down T cell clones. Thus, the relevance of RyR for these subcellular Ca2+ signals evoked by NAADP was confirmed by a completely independent molecular approach. The NAADP-mediated subcellular Ca2+ signals analyzed were very small in diameter (starting from ∼0.5 μm) and also small in amplitude (average between 50 and 100 nm), indicating that they may represent an opening of small clusters of RyR, as proposed recently (24Lipp P. Niggli E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 31-38Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Microinjection of the established RyR agonist cADPR produced subcellular Ca2+ signals with similar spatiotemporal characteristics compared with NAADP, further indicating that both adenine nucleotides act on the same target Ca2+ channel. Taken together, our data suggest that RyR are, in addition to their central role in the global Ca2+ signals, also responsible for the very initial subcellular Ca2+ signals evoked by NAADP in human T-lymphocytes. Our data do not rule out that NAADP-sensitive RyR may be expressed in acidic lysosomal Ca2+ stores in T-lymphocytes or that a specific binding protein for NAADP mediating its effect at the RyR exists. However, evidence for a novel NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channel in T cells was not obtained using state-of-the-art Ca2+-imaging technology.

We have examined the methylation of CpG and non-CpG sites of this differentially methylated CpG island in freshly ovulated oocytes, in vitro aged oocytes, and preimplantation embryos. The CpG methylation pattern was heterogeneous in freshly ovulated oocytes, despite the fact that they all were arrested in metaphase II. After short in vitro culture, Peg1/Mest became hypermethylated, whereas prolonged in vitro culture resulted in demethylation in a fraction of oocytes. Non-CpG methylation also occurred in a stage-specific manner. On alleles that were fully methylated at CpG sites, this modification was found, and it became reduced in two-cell stage embryos and blastocysts. These observations suggest that the process of establishment of the methylation imprint at this locus is more dynamic than previously thought.

Establishment of the mature epigenetic configuration of the genome is part of the maturation process of the gametes and is essential for normal development after fertilization. DNA methylation of CpG sites is one of the epigenetic modifications that regulates gene expression (for review, see (1Shiota K. Yanagimachi R. Differentiation. 2002; 69: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). The genome undergoes widespread changes in CpG methylation during germ cell maturation. Imprinted genes are of particular interest, because they are frequently associated with CpG-rich regions that are methylated differentially on the paternal and maternal chromosomes (for a review on imprinting, see Ref. 2Paldi A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 53: 115-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) 1The abbreviations used are: DMR, differentially methylated region; MII, meiotic division II. are believed to play an important role in the parental origin-dependent regulation of individual imprinted genes and of entire genomic regions during embryonic development. The methylation profile typical for the paternal or maternal chromosome is believed to be established during maturation of the male and female germ cells, but the exact kinetics of this process is still unclear. Some observations have even suggested that some imprinted genes reach their mature methylation profile only after fertilization (3El-Maarri O. Buiting K. Peery E.G. Kroisel P.M. Balaban B. Wagner K. Urman B. Heyd J. Lich C. Brannan C.I. Walter J. Horsthemke B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Peg1/Mest is a typical imprinted gene that is predominantly expressed from the paternal allele in the mesoderm and its derivatives (4Kaneko-Ishino T. Kuroiwa Y. Miyoshi N. Kohda T. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Viville S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The methylation analysis of Peg1/Mest revealed that the CpG island in the promoter region was completely methylated on the maternal and unmethylated on the paternal chromosomes (5Lefebvre L. Viville S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the human PEG1/MEST is already unmethylated in spermatogonia (6Kerjean A. Dupont J.M. Vasseur C. Le Tessier D. Cuisset L. Paldi A. Jouannet P. Jeanpierre M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2183-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the maternal germ line, Peg1/Mest is fully methylated in ovulated oocytes that are arrested in metaphase of the second meiotic division (MII) (7Lucifero D. Mertineit C. Clarke H.J. Bestor T.H. Trasler J.M. Genomics. 2002; 79: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In a previous study (8Kerjean A. Couvert P. Heams T. Chalas C. Poirier K. Chelly J. Jouannet P. Paldi A. Poirot C. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we have detected methylation heterogeneity in growing oocytes at several imprinted loci, including Peg1/Mest. The heterogeneity was substantially increased in the oocytes matured in vitro, suggesting that the methylation imprint, at this stage, is unstable and can be influenced by the cellular environment. In the present study, we investigated whether changes in the methylation imprint occurred at the Peg1/Mest locus during the last stages of oocyte maturation. Although DNA methylation has been found predominantly on cytosines that are part of CpG dyads, it has been shown that cytosines in non-CpG sites can also be modified (9Ramsahoye B.H. Biniszkiewicz D.

Non-CpG methylation was detected in mouse oocytes and two-cell embryos on several sites of the maternal allele of the nonimprinted neurofibromatosis type 1 and the adenosine deaminase genes (10Haines T.R. Rodenhiser D.I. Ainsworth P.J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Non-CpG methylation has also been observed in mammalian cell lines (11Malone C.S. Miner M.D. Doerr J.R. Jackson J.P. Jacobsen S.E. Wall R. Teitell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10404-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Imamura T. Yamamoto S. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although its biological significance is unclear, non-CpG methylation was shown to occur in the CpG-methylated alleles of the rat Sphk1 through a noncoding RNA-dependent mechanism (12Imamura T. Yamamoto S. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an unexpected heterogeneity of both CpG and non-CpG methylation of the 5′-DMR of Peg1/Mest that is subject to dynamic changes during the aging of oocytes and the early preimplantation development of fertilized embryos. Preparation of Oocytes and Embryos—Fully grown germinal vesiclestage oocytes were obtained by scratching follicles from the ovaries of 6–8-week-old F1 female mice (C57BL/6 × CBA) 48 h after the intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (Folligon®, Intervet, Angers, France). MII oocytes were obtained from the oviducts of females superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of PMSG followed 48 h later by injection of 5 IU of hCG (Chorulon®, Intervet, Angers, France). Oocytes were recovered 14 h after the hCG injection into M2 medium (Sigma), and cumulus cells were removed with 0.03% hyaluronidase (Sigma), followed by either direct methylation analysis or culture in M16 medium (Sigma) at 37 °C under 5% CO2/air followed by methylation analysis. Fertilized embryos were obtained from superovulated F1 females mated to F1 males. For DNA methylation analysis, oocytes or embryos (two-cell stage and blastocysts) were treated with 50 mg/ml Pronase (Roche Applied Science) to remove the zona pellucida with the remaining attached cumulus cells, washed three times with 500 μl of M2 medium, and immobilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 1.5% NuSieve® GTG®-agarose droplets (FMC, Rockland, MA). Replicate agarose blocks were prepared from each cell type studied and were analyzed in parallel. DNA Methylation Analysis—The methylation profile of Peg1/Mest was determined by a slightly modified technique of genomic sequencing after bisulfite treatment (6Kerjean A. Dupont J.M. Vasseur C. Le Tessier D. Cuisset L. Paldi A. Jouannet P. Jeanpierre M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2183-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–10 oocytes or embryos, embedded in a small agarose block, were incubated overnight in 200 μl of lysis solution (0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, containing 2 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C. The agarose/cell drops were then either used immediately or stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. The DNA was denatured with 300 μl of freshly prepared 0.3 m NaOH for 30 min at 50 °C. Aliquots (900 μl) of bisulfite solution (4 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) containing 125 mm hydroquinone (Sigma), pH 5.0) were added to each reaction tube. The reaction mixture was incubated at 50 °C in the dark for 5–18 h, as previously described. The beads were then heated to 80 °C for 10 min to melt the agarose, and then modified DNA was purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Modification was completed by the addition of a 0.3 m NaOH treatment for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by neutralization with an equal volume of 6 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. The bisulfite-treated DNA was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in water (10 μl), and either used immediately for PCR or stored at –20 °C. We amplified a region encompassing 22 CpGs in the differentially methylated promoter region of Peg1/Mest (GenBank™ accession number AF017994; nucleotides 2220–2556) by semi-nested PCR: forward external primer, 5′-AATTTGGGGTTTAGGATTAGAGATTT-3′; forward internal primer, 5′-AGAGATTTATAAGGAAAGAGGGGGTAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACAACAAAAACAACAAACAACAACT-3′. The products of the PCR reaction were subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. PCR amplification is a potential source of sampling bias because of the small number of DNA molecules available for amplification in a single agarose block. Under these conditions, amplification of a given pattern is random and does not depend on the initial frequency of the pattern in the population of template DNA molecules. This makes it impossible to differentiate whether two identical patterns are derived from two different original template molecules with identical methylation patterns or whether they both result from the amplification of the same DNA fragment. Unless the amplification is done on a batch of several thousands of oocytes, the statistical validity of the data obtained from a single batch with a single amplification is uncertain. The only way to overcome the problem is to increase the number of independent amplifications on independent batches. Obviously, when different patterns are obtained in the same experiment or identical patterns are obtained in different experiments, there can be no doubt about their origin from an independent template. Therefore, we sequenced only 2–4 clones from each agarose block and performed several independent sets of DNA modification, amplification, cloning, and sequencing. The sequences obtained were classified into two categories on the basis of their methylated CpG content. The “methylated” and “unmethylated” class contained all the sequences that were fully or almost fully methylated or fully or almost fully unmethylated, respectively. The frequency of the two methylation profiles found in different cell populations was compared using a χ2 test with the correction of Yates for small samples (25Wonnacott T.H. Wonnacott R.J. Introductory Statistics. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., London1972Google Scholar). To confirm the non-CpG methylation occurring at the Peg1/Mest promoter region, we used a methylation-sensitive enzyme. Oocytes and blastocysts embedded individually in an agarose block were incubated overnight in 200 μl of lysis solution (0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, containing 2 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C. The agarose drops were then washed several times in a large volume of TE buffer (100 mm Tris-CH, pH 7.3, 5mm EDTA). Genomic DNA was digested with 10 units of PstI (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 16 h within the agarose blocks. The part of the promoter region was subsequently amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-ATCTATAAGGAAAGAGGGGGTAGCG-3′ (nucleotides 2242–2266); reverse primer, 5′-AAGCAGGCACCGACTTTTAAAGCCC-3′ (reverse complement to nucleotides 2395–2419). CpG Methylation of Peg1/Mest in MII Oocytes—To investigate the ontogeny of the methylation imprint during the last stages of female germ cell maturation, we examined the DNA methylation pattern of the Peg1/Mest DMR in the promoter region (Fig. 1). This region has been reported differentially methylated on the parental chromosomes of somatic cells with the maternal copy being fully methylated (5Lefebvre L. Viville S. Barton S.C. Ishino F. Surani M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We used the bisulfite sequencing method adapted for the study of very small samples, as previously described (6Kerjean A. Dupont J.M. Vasseur C. Le Tessier D. Cuisset L. Paldi A. Jouannet P. Jeanpierre M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2183-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). First, we examined the Peg1/Mest methylation in fully grown germinal vesicle-stage oocytes (Fig. 2A). In agreement with our previous results (8Kerjean A. Couvert P. Heams T. Chalas C. Poirier K. Chelly J. Jouannet P. Paldi A. Poirot C. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found both fully methylated and unmethylated patterns. As a next step, we studied the DNA methylation pattern of Peg1/Mest in freshly ovulated MII oocytes (14 h after hCG treatment). Because the maternal allele of this gene is methylated in somatic cells and MII oocytes represent the last cellular stage before fertilization, we expected to find the analyzed region hypermethylated. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, fully methylated, mixed, and unmethylated patterns were observed. The 38 fragments derived from bisulfite-modified DNA obtained in 16 independent experiments showed 15 different CpG and non-CpG methylation/unmethylation patterns. Some patterns were found several times in independent experiments. The possibility that somatic cell contamination could be the cause of the observed heterogeneous methylation was ruled out (see “Experimental Procedures”). Only fully methylated copies of region 2 of the Igf2r gene were found in our oocyte preparations (not shown). These unexpected results indicate a high heterogeneity of Peg1/Mest methylation in MII oocytes, suggesting that the methylation imprint of this gene is not established in all oocytes before fertilization.Fig. 2Cytosine methylation pattern of Peg1/Mest DMR in fully grown (A and E), freshly ovulated (B and F), and oocytes cultured in vitro for 22 (C and G) and 42 h (D and H). The methylation patterns of CpG sites are shown on the left side. Each row of circles represents a single cloned allele, with open circles for nonmethylated CpG site and filled circles for methylated cytosines. The CpG sites are numbered from 1 to 22 as on Fig. 1. Methylation of the non-CpG sites is shown on the right side. Each row of squares represents the same clone as on the left. Only non-CpG sites in which we observed at least once the non-conversion of cytosine to uracil are shown. The relative positions of the non-CpG sites are indicated relative to the CpG sites numbered from 1 to 22. The number of independent experiments is indicated (n =) for each stage analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the maternal CpG methylation pattern could become established between ovulation and fertilization, we cultured MII oocytes in vitro and performed methylation analysis. After culture in M16 medium for 8 h (corresponding to 22 h after hCG treatment), all 29 Peg1/Mest clones obtained from eight independent PCR reactions were found hypermethylated (Fig. 2C) with only four CpG and non-CpG methylation patterns. We did not find any unmethylated alleles. The difference in the frequency of unmethylated/hypermethylated copies in the in vitro cultured oocytes compared with the freshly ovulated MII oocytes is, statistically, highly significant (p < 0.001). This observation suggests the existence of de novo methylation activity acting in unfertilized oocytes after ovulation but before fertilization. Interestingly, unmethylated alleles were again observed in aged oocytes obtained after 28 h of in vitro culture (i.e. 42 h after hCG treatment) (Fig. 2D). Four of sixteen clones analyzed in four independent experiments were unmethylated. We also analyzed the methylation patterns in two-cell embryos, blastocysts, and somatic cells (Fig. 3), and as expected, both hypermethylated and hypomethylated alleles were seen, with similar proportions in each case. These profiles were reminiscent of the expected imprinted pattern in which the maternal allele is hypermethylated and the paternal allele is unmethylated. Detection of Non-CpG Methylation at the Peg1/Mest Locus— We frequently found clones in which some of the non-CpG cytosines were not converted to uracil by the bisulfite reaction. Such partial conversion potentially reflects non-CpG methylation. Interestingly, the incidence of non-conversion differed depending on the post-ovulatory age of oocytes. In the fully grown germinal vesicle stage, this type of non-conversion was distributed randomly over the entire sequence (Fig. 2E). In the oocytes, 14 h after hCG treatment, two preferential sites showing potential non-CpG methylation were located between CpG sites 12 and 13, although some other sites of non-conversion were also detected (Fig. 2F). In contrast, 22 h after hCG treatment, the observed patterns were less heterogeneous. For example, the two sites between CpG sites 12 and 13 were found resistant to bisulfite modification in all clones with 100% CpG methylation (Fig. 2G). In addition to these two sites, we found four other cytosines that were frequently insensitive to bisulfite modification. When compared with the CpG methylation in Peg1/Mest, the incidence of the non-conversion at non-CpG sites seemed to be well correlated with the methylation of CpG sites, whereas the vast majority of the unmethylated sequences did not have resistant non-CpG cytosines. In in vitro aged oocytes (after 28 h of culture), two-cell-, and blastocyst-stage embryos, the incidence of the non-conversion became lower and was restricted only to some non-CpG sites, even in hypermethylated sequences (Figs. 2H and 3). It is also to be noted that somatic cells did not show any sign of non-CpG methylation (Fig. 3). Recently, we found that some non-CpG cytosines on the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene displayed unusual resistance to bisulfite conversion in oocytes under the usual conditions (14Aranyi T. Kerjean A. Toth S. Mallet J. Meloni R. Paldi A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, their conversion was complete after a prolonged treatment. Contrary to the TH gene, the sites in the Peg1/Mest DMR were resistant to conversion even after prolonged bisulfite reaction (not shown). These observations strongly suggested that the non-conversion from cytosine to uracil did not result from incomplete bisulfite modification but reflects the methylation of these non-CpG sites. To verify this possibility, we applied an alternative approach based on restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent amplification. We digested the genomic DNA of oocytes and blastocysts with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, PstI (15McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A recognition site for this enzyme is present in the sequence analyzed with a bisulfite-resistant cytosine (Fig. 1, underlined). We performed PCR amplification of the region encompassing the PstI site. An amplification product is expected only if the site is methylated, thus resistant to PstI digestion. As shown in Fig. 4, an amplification product is always obtained when the oocyte or blastocyst DNA is not digested by the restriction enzyme. Two of three independent amplifications using PstI-digested genomic DNA from MII oocytes (20 h after hCG treatment) showed positive bands, indicating the existence of non-CpG methylation. In contrast, we could not see any amplification products in PstI-digested blastocyst DNA derived from hundreds of the somatic cells, indicating that the digestion was complete and that Peg1/Mest sequences were unmethylated in the context of non-CpG sites. This is in accordance with the bisulfite sequencing that did not detect non-CpG methylation at this stage. Therefore, it is likely that the results obtained by bisulfite sequencing reflect non-CpG methylation of the DNA. In the present study, we showed that the hypermethylated pattern characteristic for the maternal allele of imprinted Peg1/Mest in somatic cells is not yet established in all oocytes at the moment of ovulation. A significant subset of oocytes carries unmethylated alleles despite the fact that all of the oocytes are arrested in metaphase of the second meiotic division (Fig. 2). Reminiscent of our observations, it has been reported that the methylation imprint at the SNRPN locus is not established in ovulated human oocytes (3El-Maarri O. Buiting K. Peery E.G. Kroisel P.M. Balaban B. Wagner K. Urman B. Heyd J. Lich C. Brannan C.I. Walter J. Horsthemke B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Another study found that the methylation of this gene was already completed in the ovulated oocytes (16Geuns E. De Rycke M. Van Steirteghem A. Liebaers I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These contradictory data on SNRPN and the observations on Peg1/Mest in this study suggest that the heterogeneity and irregularity of methylation imprint establishment in morphologically and physiologically homogenous oocyte populations might reflect the inherent physiological differences between the cells. After in vitro culture for 8 h, all oocytes contained a fully methylated Peg1/Mest DMR (Fig. 2), indicating that de novo methylation occurred after ovulation to reach the mature imprinted pattern. Recently, Lucifero et al. (7Lucifero D. Mertineit C. Clarke H.J. Bestor T.H. Trasler J.M. Genomics. 2002; 79: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) have reported that the Peg1/Mest DMR was fully methylated in oocytes obtained 20 h after hCG injection, which corresponds to 6 h after ovulation. The concordance of these findings supports the notion that the mature maternal methylation imprint is established after ovulation. In oocytes cultured in vitro for 28 h after ovulation, unmethylated sequences were again detected, further emphasizing the highly dynamic nature of DNA methylation of the Peg1/Mest locus. It is known that the oocytes gradually lose the capacity to undergo normal development and the fetuses derived from the fertilization of aged oocytes frequently display developmental defects (17Tarin J.J. Perez-Albala S. Aguilar A. Minarro J. Hermenegildo C. Cano A. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reduced developmental competence can attribute to the consequence of accumulated epigenetic alterations at imprinted loci. It is unclear how the observed de novo methylation and active demethylation activities can act on condensed chromosomes. The large amounts of various methyltransferases present in oocytes may be responsible for progressive methylation of the Peg1/Mest DMR (18Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Oocytes contain an, as yet, unidentified demethylating activity that has been shown to act after fertilization, preferentially on the paternal genome (19Rougier N. Bourc'his D. Gomes D.M. Niveleau A. Plachot M. Paldi A. Viegas-Pequignot E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2108-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 20Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Our data are the first to show that this activity can demethylate DNA even before fertilization. The bisulfite sequencing method also allowed us to detect methylation of cytosines in a non-CpG context (Fig. 2). We have shown, by an independent method, that the non-CpG methylation is not an artifact resulting from incomplete bisulfite modification (Fig. 4). Earlier studies demonstrate the existence of non-CpG methylation in a wide range of organisms, from plants to mammals (for review, see Ref. 21Lorincz M.C. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10034-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In mammals, non-CpG methylation has been detected in several gene loci and repeated sequences (22Woodcock D.M. Lawler C.B. Linsenmeyer M.E. Doherty J.P. Warren W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7810-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the Peg1/Mest, non-CpG methylation found in oocytes occurred only in sequences that had all or almost all the CpG sites methylated (Fig. 2). In two-cell- and blastocyst-stage embryos, non-CpG methylation became reduced, and it was absent in somatic cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that this modification occurs transiently on the CpG-methylated allele. Similarly to our observations, maternal allele-specific non-CpG methylation of the neurofibromatosis type 1 and adenosine deaminase genes was observed in oocytes and two-cell-stage embryos simultaneously with CpG methylation but did not persist beyond the two-cell stage (10Haines T.R. Rodenhiser D.I. Ainsworth P.J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The observed decrease of the non-CpG methylation after fertilization is compatible with both the existence of an active demethylating mechanism and passive dilution that would result in 50% reduction of the non-CpG-methylated alleles, although no definitive conclusion can be drawn in the absence of compelling data. Our observations suggest that establishment of the methylation imprint in the oocyte may be a more dynamic process than previously thought. The actual methylation pattern of a given sequence may be determined by the equilibrium of methylation and demethylation activities that depend on other ongoing cellular processes. This conclusion is supported by the observation that environmental stress, such as in vitro culture, can affect the methylation of imprinted genes in preimplantation embryos (23Doherty A.S. Mann M.R.

However, the extension of these studies to identify functionally important non-active site residues is more problematic. One attractive approach is directed evolution, which has been successfully applied to the design of industrial biocatalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency, stability, and versatility and for examining the molecular basis of enzyme functions (16Cherry J.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 17Schoemaker H.E. Science. 2003; 299: 1694-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 18Schmid A.

Recent studies with the bacterial enzyme P450BM3 have illustrated the potential of directed evolution for engineering new and more efficient P450s showing enhanced hydroxylation of unnatural alkane substrates up to 100-fold. The resulting mutant has 10 of the 11 substitutions outside of the active site (22Farinas E.T. Schwaneberg U. Glieder A. Arnold F.H. Adv. Synth. Catl. 2001; 343: 601-606Crossref Google Scholar, 23Glieder A. Farinas E.T. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Joo H. Lin Z. Arnold F.H. Nature. 1999; 399: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the P450BM3 mutant with enhanced activity was selected using one specific substrate, it also showed improved activity with other substrates. Xenobiotic-metabolizing mammalian cytochromes P450, with their generally broader substrate specificity than bacterial P450s, offer the possibility of even greater applications in industrial synthesis, medicine, and bioremediation. Recently, directed evolution of mammalian P450 1A2 in two independent studies yielded mutants with 5- and 10-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency with 7-methoxyresorufin and 2-amino-3,5-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, respectively (25Kim D. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Kim D. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutations in both cases were outside of the active site. The present study tests the hypothesis that directed evolution can be used to enhance the activity of P450 2B1 while maintaining versatility. First, we established a sensitive and direct high throughput screening method for a highly expressed truncated form of P450 2B1 using H2O2-supported oxidation of the marker fluorogenic substrate 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (7-EFC) followed by optimization of random mutagenesis using error-prone PCR. Mutants with enhanced catalytic activity were then tested with 7-EFC and five other P450 2B1 substrates in a standard reconstituted system using NADPH. The results suggest several residues that may be targeted for mutagenesis to enhance activities toward compounds of medicinal and environmental interest.

Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were either obtained from The University of Texas Medical Branch, (UTMB), Molecular Biology Core Laboratory (Galveston, TX) or from Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX).

All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and were obtained from standard commercial sources. Random Mutagenesis by Error-prone PCR and Construction of Mutant Libraries—The method used is a modification of standard PCR methods, designed to alter and enhance the natural error rate of the polymerase, and was essentially performed as described previously for P450BM3 (28Cirino P.C. Mayer K.M. Umero D. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Directed Evolution Library Creation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 3-10Google Scholar). Initially, error-prone PCR, ligation, and transformation were standardized for P450 2B1dH L209A to obtain >1000 clones per PCR reaction by selecting suitable forward and reverse primers, restriction sites, ligation conditions, and transformation procedures. Subsequently, error-prone PCR was standardized to ensure a mutation rate of 1–2 bp per P450 cDNA essentially as described previously (28Cirino P.C. Mayer K.M. Umero D. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Directed Evolution Library Creation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 3-10Google Scholar). This was accomplished by varying the concentrations of nucleotides, especially dCTP and dTTP, and the concentrations of MnCl2 to give mutation frequencies from 0.11 to 2% (1–20 nucleotides per 1 kb) (28Cirino P.C. Mayer K.M. Umero D. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Directed Evolution Library Creation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 3-10Google Scholar). Finally, libraries were generated using the various conditions, and the number of mutations per kb was estimated based upon an activity screen as described previously (29Tobias A.V. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Directed Evolution Library Creation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 11-16Google Scholar) followed by sequencing of the desired mutants. In the final conditions, the forward and reverse primers were as follows: 5′-CAC AGG AAA CAG ACC ATG GCT CCC AGT ATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGG ATA TCA ATG GTG GTG ATG CCG AGC TGA GAA-3′ (reverse). The restriction sites used were PstI and EcoRV. PCR reactions using an error-prone PCR kit included 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dCTP, 10 mm dTTP, and 2 mm each of dATP and dGTP. The overnight ligation kit was used to obtain >1000 transformants per ligation reaction using ∼20% of the PCR products. The P450 2B1dH mutant F202L/L209A/S334P was generated by quick change site-directed mutagenesis using V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P as template and 5′-TGC TCC ATT GTG TTT GGA GAG-3′ and 5′-CTC TCC AAA CAC AAT GGA-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Similarly, F202L and F202L/L209A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using 2B1dH and L209A as templates, respectively, and 5′-CTG TTG GAG CTG TTG TAC CGG ACC TTT-3′ and 5′-AAA GGT CCG GTA CAA CAG CTC CAA CAG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Nucleotides presented in bold represent the site of mutation. Screening and Selection of P450 2B1dH L209A Random Mutants— Screening and selection of 2B1dH L209A random mutants were essentially done as described previously for P450BM3 with minor modifications (30Salzar O. Sun L. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Directed Enzyme Evolution. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 85-89Google Scholar). Liquid handling was performed using a multichannel robot Biomek 2000 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). In brief, transformed Escherichia coli (DH5α) was grown in a 300-μl, V-shaped 96-well microplate containing 150 μl of LB media for 18–20 h at 30 °C on a microplate shaker. Next, 20 μl of the LB-grown cells were inoculated into a 300-μl, V-shaped 96-well microplate containing 180 μl of TB medium and grown for ∼3 h until cell density reached A600 = 1–1.5. δ-Aminolevulinic acid and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were then added to the cells to final concentrations of 80 and 240 μg/ml, respectively. The cells were then grown for 72 h at 30 °C on a microplate shaker. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min using an Allegra 25R microplate centrifuge (Beckman). The supernatant was removed by decanting, and the pellet was dried. The cells were resuspended in 150 μl of 0.1 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. Next, 50 μl of the substrate mixture (300 μm 7-EFC containing 4% methanol and 20 units/well polymyxin B sulfate) was incubated with 40 μl of whole cells for 5 min at room temperature. The background intensity was recorded at λex = 405 nm and λem = 510 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader (Ascent Fluoroscan, Ramsey, MN). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μlofH2O2 (10 mm final), and the formation of product was recorded at 2.5 min. Mutants with ≥2-fold higher activity than the average wild-type activity were sequenced at the UTMB Protein Chemistry Laboratory and were further characterized as described below. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Engineered Enzymes— P450s 2B1 and 2B1dH and their mutants were expressed as His-tagged proteins in E. coli TOPP3 and purified using a Ni-affinity column as described previously (31Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The specific contents were between 8 and 15 nmol of P450 per milligram of protein. Upon purification, the yield, purity, and stability of the mutant proteins were either similar to or higher than the respective wild-type enzymes (2B1 and 2B1dH). H2O2-dependent 7-EFC O-Deethylation Assay—H2O2-supported enzyme activities were assayed as described previously with slight modifications (32Khan K.K. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Substrate mixtures were prepared in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, with 2% as the final concentration of methanol (100 μl/well of a 96-well microplate). The substrate mixture was preincubated with 50 pmol of purified P450 enzyme at room temperature for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of H2O2 to 10 mm. After 5 min of incubation, the reactions were stopped by adding 340 units (50 μl) of catalase. Subsequently, 50 μl of 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, was added prior to recording the fluorescence intensity at λex = 405 nm and λem = 510 nm using an Accent fluorescence plate reader. NADPH-dependent Enzyme Assays—7-EFC and 7-BR oxidation were assayed using a fluorescence method (4Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Benzphetamine N-demethylation was measured using a colorimetric method (9Scott E.E. Liu H. He Y.Q. Li W. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Testosterone hydroxylation was assayed by TLC using radiolabeled substrate (2Kumar S. Scott E.E. Liu H. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17178-17184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of P450 2B1 and 2B1dH with CPR and b5 in the NADPH system was carried out at ratios of 1:4:2 (31Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and included 10 μg of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine/100-μl reaction volume in the P450 2B1 sample only. The reconstitution system for assaying CPA and IFA metabolism included P450 and purified rat liver CPR in a 1:4 molar ratio (5 pmol of P450/0.1 ml of 0.1 m KPi buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA) and was devoid of lipid and b5. CPA and IFA metabolism were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography as described (10Chen C.S. Lin J.T. Goss K.A. He Y.A. Halpert J.R. Waxman D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1278-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic parameters for 7-EFC, testosterone, 7-BR, and benzphetamine were determined by regression analysis using Sigma Plot (Jandel, San Rafel, CA). The Km value was determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation, whereas the S50 and n values were determined using the Hill equation. Kinetic analysis of CPA and IFA metabolism was carried out using Enzyme Kinetics version 0.44 software (Trinity Software, Inc.). P450 2B1 Model—The 2B1 model was made essentially as described (2Kumar S. Scott E.E. Liu H. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17178-17184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, the initial molecular model was constructed using the Insight II software package (Homology, Discover_3, Biopolymer and Builder from Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). The model was constructed based on the crystal structure of a ligand-bound P450 2B4 complex (PDB entry 1SUO) (8Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The sequence of rat 2B1 was obtained from SwissProt (accession number P00176). The coordinates of the conserved residues were assigned based on the corresponding residues of the 2B4 complex by Homology/Insight II. The heme group was copied from 2B4 into the 2B1 model. Directed Evolution of P450 2B1dH—The most critical step of directed evolution is to find a simple, economical and high throughput activity screen. A facile assay method was sought to circumvent steps involving CPR and b5 by using an alternate oxygen donor such as H2O2, as reported previously for bacterial P450eryF (22Farinas E.T. Schwaneberg U. Glieder A. Arnold F.H. Adv. Synth. Catl. 2001; 343: 601-606Crossref Google Scholar). To maximize heterologous expression and subsequent purification, an N-terminally modified construct of P450 2B1 with a C-terminal His tag was used (P450 2B1dH). Several known substrates of 2B1dH (derivatives of quinoline and coumarin) were tested using H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide as oxygen donors. The combination of 7-EFC with H2O2 was found to give the highest signal-to-noise ratio and good reproducibility (data not shown). To further optimize the method, potassium phosphate, Tris-HCl, and Hepes buffer were tested in the absence and presence of MgCl2; Hepes buffer without MgCl2 gave maximal activity. H2O2-supported 7-EFC O-deethylation proceeded at ∼5% the rate of the NADPH-supported activity under optimal conditions with purified 2B1dH (data not shown) (4Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The H2O2-supported activity correlated well with the activity determined using NADPH across a panel of more than 10 active site mutants (Refs. 4Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 9Scott E.E. Liu H. He Y.Q. Li W. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and data not shown). 2B1dH L209A had 10-fold higher H2O2-supported 7-EFC deethylation activity than 2B1dH and was therefore used as the starting template for directed evolution. In adapting the assay to bacterial cells grown on microtiter plates, a number of difficulties were encountered, including high background, low activity, and variable expression. Improvements were obtained by eliminating imidazole from the TB culture medium, using whole cells in place of cell extracts, and using 300 μl of V-shaped 96-well microplates instead of 1-ml deep well microplates. A representative assay of multiple colonies of 2B1dH L209A indicated ∼80% colony-to-colony variation in activity (Fig. 1, open squares) compared with the average 2B1dH L209A colony (Fig. 1, horizontal line). These data suggested that random clones having ≥2-fold higher activity than 2B1dH L209A would correspond to mutants with enhanced catalytic activity. Identification of 2B1dH Mutant V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P with a 6-fold Increased kcat—Representative data from an initial screen of several hundred random clones derived by directed evolution of 2B1dH L209A are shown in Fig. 1, with the clones graphed in order of decreasing activity (closed squares). Two of the clones (1H3 and 1C10) showed activity of ≥2-fold higher than the average of 2B1dH L209A, and higher than any single 2B1dH L209A colony. DNA sequencing revealed a single new mutation in each case, S334P (clone 1H3) and V183L (clone 1C10). V183L/L209A and L209A/S334P were expressed in large scale culture and purified. Both showed similar expression levels as 2B1dH, as reported earlier for L209A (4Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). L209A/S334P and V183L/L209A had 50–58% higher kcat values than L209A (Table I). In an effort to enhance the activity further, the triple mutant V183L/L209A/S334P was prepared. This mutant displayed ∼2-fold higher kcat than L209A (Table I).Table ISteady-state kinetics: H2O2-dependent oxidation of 7-EFC by P450 2B1dH L209A and its mutants Results are the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. 2B1dH showed very low activity (∼0.2 min-1 at 150 μm 7-EFC), and kinetic parameters could not be determined.SamplekcatS50nmin-1μmL209A1.2 ± 0.112 ± 2.01.2 ± 0.1L209A/S334P1.8 ± 0.117 ± 3.20.9 ± 0.1V183L/L209A1.9 ± 0.114 ± 3.10.8 ± 0.1V183L/L209A/S334P2.3 ± 0.218 ± 2.01.0 ± 0.1V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P7.2 ± 0.236 ± 1.41.6 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Directed evolution using V183L/L209A/S334P as the template yielded V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P. This quadruple mutant had a 3-fold higher kcat than V183L/L209A/S334P and 6-fold higher kcat than L209A, along with an increased S50 and an n value of 1.6 (Table I). A third round of mutagenesis and screening did not yield any colonies with a further ≥2-fold increase in activity. Five of the most active clones were sequenced, which identified only one clone with an additional mutation, E322K. Purified V183L/F202L/L209A/E322K/S334P showed no further enhancement of kcat, suggesting that random mutagenesis was approaching saturation for enhanced 7-EFC O-deethylation (data not shown). We therefore sought a rational mutagenesis approach in an effort to achieve higher activity. Of several 2B1dH active site mutants (V103A, V103I, I114A, L208A, L220A, S221P, I290A, and I290F) available from earlier studies (2Kumar S. Scott E.E. Liu H. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17178-17184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Scott E.E. He Y.Q. Halpert J.R. Chem. Res.

Biophys. 2004; 423: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that showed higher NADPH-dependent activity, I290F showed 3-fold higher H2O2-dependent activity than 2B1dH (data not shown). However, V183L/F202L/L209A/I290F/S334P showed no increase in kcat beyond V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P (data not shown), again suggesting saturation of activity along this particular directed evolution pathway. F202L/L209A/S334P Demonstrates the Highest Catalytic Efficiency of NADPH-dependent 7-EFC O-Deethylation—Subsequently, the 2B1dH mutants were assayed in a standard reconstituted system using NADPH. Compared with 2B1dH L209A, L209A/S334P had 37% higher kcat/Km, whereas V183L/L209A had a ∼20% lower kcat/Km (Table II). Adding F202L to V183L/L209A/S334P increased the kcat/Km for 7-EFC ∼2-fold, whereas incorporation of E322K did not enhance the activity further (Table II, data not shown). Interestingly, V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P did not show cooperativity in the NADPH-dependent system (data not shown). In contrast to the H2O2-supported activity, incorporation of I290F into V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P decreased the kcat/Km by ∼25% in the NADPH-dependent system (data not shown). Because V183L decreased NADPH-supported activity, this mutation was removed from V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P. The resulting triple mutant F202L/L209A/S334P showed the highest kcat/Km (∼2.5-fold higher than L209A) of all samples tested (Table II). As expected, F202L/L209A/S334P showed slightly lower activity than V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P in the H2O2-supported system (data not shown).Table IISteady-state kinetics: NADPH-dependent oxidation of 7-EFC by 2B1dH L209A and its mutants Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.SamplekcatKmkcat/Kmmin-1μm2B1dHaActivity of 2B1dH follows the Hill equation with an n value of 1.7 and S50 of 23 μm12 ± 0.4L209A35 ± 0.7318 ± 2.11.9L209A/S334P44 ± 1.617 ± 1.82.6V183L/L209A23 ± 0.8615 ± 1.81.5V183L/L209A/S334P24 ± 0.6111 ± 1.52.2V183L/F202L/L209A/S334P52 ± 4.012 ± 1.64.3F202L/L209A/S334P77 ± 1.716 ± 1.34.8a Activity of 2B1dH follows the Hill equation with an n value of 1.7 and S50 of 23 μm Open table in a new tab F202L/L209A/S334P Exhibits Enhanced Oxidation of Several Other Substrates—The 2B1dH random mutants were tested with 7-BR, benzphetamine, and testosterone to investigate whether the enhanced NA"
https://openalex.org/W2169287383,"Overexpression of the EGFR is commonly caused by EGFR gene amplification and is sometimes associated with expression of a variant EGFR (de2-7 EGFR or EGFRvIII) bearing an internal deletion in its extracellular domain. mAb 806 is a novel EGFR antibody with significant antitumor activity that recognizes both the de2-7 EGFR and a subset of the wild-type (wt) EGFR when overexpressed, but does not bind the EGFR expressed in normal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated that the mAb 806 epitope is restricted to a short cysteine loop of the EGFR (amino acids 287-302) that is only available for antibody binding in a transitional form of the receptor, which occurs as the receptor changes from its inactive tethered conformation to a dimeric untethered form. The truncation associated with the de2-7 EGFR mutation renders this receptor constitutively untethered, leading to increased binding of mAb 806. We now show that mAb 806 preferentially binds the immature high-mannose wt and de2-7 EGFR precursors normally located in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that this form of the wt EGFR is also constitutively untethered. Using the unique specificity of mAb 806, we clearly demonstrated the presence of these high-mannose EGFR precursors on the cell surface. Given that the high-mannose forms of the wt EGFR must be untethered they may contribute to the spontaneous EGFR signaling reported in cells overexpressing the receptor. These precursor forms of the EGFR thus represent novel tumor targets and contribute to the exceptional selectivity of mAb 806 for EGFR when overexpressed in cancer cells. As our observations are likely to apply to other receptors overexpressed in cancer, they suggest a strategy for developing antitumor antibodies even when the target receptor is expressed in normal tissue."

Photons offer one potentially important platform for encoding and manipulating information using the rules of quantum physics.

https://openalex.org/W2098621534,"Rapid and precise control of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) activity is essential in the maintenance of beat-to-beat Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiac myocytes. Here, we show that phospholemman (PLM), a 15-kDa integral sarcolemmal phosphoprotein, is a novel endogenous protein inhibitor of cardiac NCX1. Using a heterologous expression system that is devoid of both endogenous PLM and NCX1, we first demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence studies that both exogenous PLM and NCX1 co-localized at the plasma membrane. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed specific protein-protein interaction between PLM and NCX1. The functional consequences of direct association of PLM with NCX1 was the inhibition of NCX1 activity, as demonstrated by whole-cell patch clamp studies to measure NCX1 current density and radiotracer flux assays to assess Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. Inhibition of NCX1 by PLM was specific, because a single mutation of serine 68 to alanine in PLM resulted in a complete loss of inhibition of NCX1 current, although association of the PLM mutant with NCX1 was unaltered. In native adult cardiac myocytes, PLM co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1. We conclude that PLM, a member of the FXYD family of small ion transport regulators known to modulate Na+-K+-ATPase, also regulates Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the heart.

We conclude that PLM, a member of the FXYD family of small ion transport regulators known to modulate Na+-K+-ATPase, also regulates Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the heart. Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes depends on the ability of regulatory proteins to maintain steady-state Ca2+ fluxes through each cycle of Ca2+ influx, intracellular Ca2+ transient buffering, and Ca2+ efflux (1Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3433) Google Scholar). Among the many transporters and ion channels involved in cardiac Ca2+ fluxes, the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) 1The abbreviations used are: NCX1, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BSS, balanced salt solution; [Ca2+]i, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; [Ca2+]o, extracellular Ca2+ concentration; Cm, whole-cell membrane capacitance; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Em, membrane potential; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; INaCa, Na+/Ca2+ exchange current; [Na+i]i, cytosolic Na+ concentration; [Na+]o, extracellular Na+ concentration; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PLM, phospholemman. is unique in that it participates in all three major phases of Ca2+ movement. Depending on the thermodynamic driving force as determined by the membrane potential (Em) and the concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ ions sensed by the exchanger, NCX1 can mediate both Ca2+ influx (reverse mode) and Ca2+ efflux (forward mode). The forward mode of NCX1 is the major Ca2+ efflux mechanism that extrudes the amount of extracellular Ca2+ that has entered the myocyte during a twitch, thereby restoring cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to resting levels and maintaining steady-state Ca2+ balance (1Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3433) Google Scholar). NCX1 involvement in Ca2+ efflux and its additional assigned roles in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading (2Nuss H.B. Houser S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1161-H1169PubMed Google Scholar) and release (3Leblanc N. Hume J.R. Science. 1990; 248: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) are likely to contribute alongside other proteins such as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase, calmodulin, calbindin, and parvalbumin as effective buffering mechanisms for short-term Ca2+ transients. There have been significant advances made toward understanding the intrinsic properties of NCX1 with regards to the precise stoichiometry of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange ratio (4Hinata M. Yamamura H. Li L. Watanabe Y. Watano T. Imaizumi Y. Kimura J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 453-461Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Kang T.M. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 2004; 427: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the direction of ion fluxes during an action potential in excitable cells where NCX1 function has interdependency on the activities of various Na+ and K+ channels and the ATP-driven Na+-K+-ATPase (1Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3433) Google Scholar, 6Hilgemann D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1167-C1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, there is a current focus upon identifying both synthetic and endogenous factors that regulate NCX1 function. Known activators of NCX1 in the cardiac muscle include Ca2+ ions, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phospholipase C-activating agonists, protein kinase C (PKC) activators, non-exchanged monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Li+), redox reagents, and mild proteolysis of the internal surface of NCX1. Inhibitors include high [Na+]i in the absence of ATP or at low pHi (Na+-dependent inactivation), H+, and divalent and trivalent cations (Ni2+, La3+, Cd2+). Synthetic inhibitors include a 20-amino acid exchanger inhibitor peptide based on a short sequence of the NCX1 intracellular loop, molluscan cardioexcitatory tetrapeptide (FMRFa) analogues, and an isothiourea derivative (KB-R7943) (7Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Of note is, to date, there has been no endogenous protein regulator of NCX1 described. Here we describe a newly identified endogenous protein inhibitor of NCX1 called phospholemman (PLM). To unequivocally demonstrate this, we have utilized a heterologous expression system of human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells that are devoid of PLM and NCX1 and are electrically silent (8Dong H. Dunn J. Lytton J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1934-1952Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies of transiently transfected HEK293 cells clearly showed co-localization and association of both exogenous PLM and NCX1 at the plasma membrane. The functional consequence of this association was investigated using two fundamentally different measures of NCX1 activity, Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and NCX1 current (INaCa). Co-expression of PLM with NCX1 inhibited both forward and reverse INaCa and decreased Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake rate. Inhibition of NCX1 by PLM was specific, because ablation of a dual protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC phosphorylation site (serine 68) in PLM by alanine replacement led to loss-of-function and abolished its inhibitory effect on NCX1 activity. PLM co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1 in native adult cardiac myocyte membranes. In summary, we have identified for the first time an endogenous protein inhibitor of cardiac NCX1. Construction of Rat PLM and NCX1 Clones—A portion of the left ventricle from Sprague-Dawley rat heart was frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of euthanasia and stored at -80 °C. Rat cDNA library was constructed from left ventricular poly(A)+-selected RNA (mRNA) using Superscript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). A PCR-based cloning strategy utilizing pfu polymerase was carried out in order to obtain a rat PLM clone containing the complete coding region (279 bp). The forward primer (carrying HindIII and BglII restriction sites as underlined), 5′-AAG CTT AGA TCT ATG GCA TCT CCC GGC CAC ATC CTG-3′, and reverse primer (carrying HindIII and XhoI restriction sites as underlined), 5′-AAG CTT CTC GAG TTA CCG CCT GCG GGT GGA CAG ACG-3′, were used for the PCR reaction and also separately for subsequent DNA sequence verification. Rat PLM was inserted directly into the mammalian expression vector pAdTrack-CMV (9He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3264) Google Scholar) using the restriction endonucleases BglII and XhoI. PLM serine-to-alanine substitution at amino acid position 68 on the mature protein (PLMS68A) was constructed with PLM in pAlter-1 using Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). The site-directed PLM mutant was authenticated by DNA sequencing and expression analysis. Rat cardiac NCX1 clone in pcDNA3.1(+) was a generous gift from Dr. J. Lytton and subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV as previously described (10Zhang X.Q. Song J. Rothblum L.I. Lun M. Wang X. Ding F. Dunn J. Lytton J. McDermott P.J. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2079-H2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We chose the pAdTrack shuttle vector, because it allowed us to identify successfully transfected HEK293 cells through a separate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter present on the vector backbone that drives the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium /Ham's F-12 (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. After 24 h, medium was changed and cells were transfected with 25 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and total of 3-μg plasmid DNA/dish (either pAdTrack-CMV alone (3 μg), pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1.5 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV (1.5 μg), pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1.5 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV-PLM (1.5 μg), or pAdTrack-CMV-NCX1 (1.5 μg) + pAdTrack-CMV-PLMS68A (1.5 μg)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of DNA and lipid were optimized in transfection assays to ensure minimal toxicity to cells. The lipid-DNA complex was left on cells for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Medium was then replaced with DMEM/Ham's F12 + 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before experiments. For confocal and patch clamp applications, cells were trypsinized at 24 h post-transfection using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), transferred to 35-mm dishes containing sterile glass coverslips, and incubated a further 24 h prior to experimentation. Cells for Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation applications were left in 100-mm dishes until 48 h post-transfection. Cell-seeding density, lipid, and DNA amounts were scaled down according to surface area for 24-well plate transfections that were used to measure Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. Transfections according to this protocol routinely yielded 30–50% transfection efficiency. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with either pAdTrack alone or PLM/NCX1 were plated on laminin-coated glass slide chambers (Nunc, Lab-Tek Division, Naperville, IL) and cultured for an additional 24 h. Adherent cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) containing 2 mm EGTA and then fixed for 30 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 2 mm EGTA. After two rinses with PBS, cells were permeabilized for 2 min in 0.05% Triton X-100 followed by two additional rinses with PBS and once with BLOTTO (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). Primary polyclonal PLM (1:250 dilution, C2Ab) (11Song J. Zhang X.Q. Carl L.L. Qureshi A. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H576-H583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and monoclonal NCX1 (1:250 dilution, R3F1, Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) antibodies diluted in BLOTTO were added to the cells, incubated in room temperature in the dark for 60 min, and rinsed three times with BLOTTO. Secondary antibodies diluted in BLOTTO were added to cells and incubated in the dark for 30 min followed by three PBS rinses. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 546-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for R3F1 Ab and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50, Molecular Probes) for C2Ab. The slide was then removed from the chamber, and a coverslip containing mounting solution (90% glycerol in PBS + p-phenylaminediamine) was applied. Images of HEK293 cells (green fluorescent protein, excitation 488, emission 515 nm; R3F1 Ab, excitation 546, emission 570 nm; and C2Ab, excitation 633, emission 674 nm) were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and processed with LCS software. Crude Membrane Preparation—HEK293 cells were washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and scraped into 400 μl of ice-cold Buffer I containing the following (in mm): 10 Tris (pH 7.5); 1 sodium vanadate; 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 100 NaF; 1 EGTA; and a combination of complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (catalog numbers P-2850 and P-5726, Sigma). After sonication (3 × 15 s), 400 μl of ice-cold Buffer II containing the following (in mm): 10 Tris (pH 7.5); 300 KCl; 1 Na+ vanadate; 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 100 NaF; 1 EGTA; 20% sucrose; and complete protease inhibitor mixture were added. Cell sonicates were centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The resultant pellet (crude membrane fraction) was washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and stored at -80 °C until use. Co-immunoprecipitation of PLM and NCX1—Crude membrane pellets were resuspended in a minimal volume of Buffer III (in mm: 140 NaCl; 25 imidazole; 1 EDTA; and a combination of complete protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (pH 7.4)) and then adjusted to 2 mg in 300 μl of Buffer III and combined with C12E8 detergent in 100 μl of Buffer III (at a detergent:protein ratio of 2:1) at room temperature for 10 min. After the addition of another 400 μl of Buffer III, samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 37,000 × g using a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and the protein content was determined. 400 μg of solubilized crude membrane preparation was used in both preimmune control and antibody immunoprecipitation experiments. Samples were precleared before the addition of relevant antibodies by preincubation of supernatants with 50 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were incubated with either 5 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG (polyclonal Ab control), 5 μg of polyclonal PLM antibody (C2Ab), 5 μl of polyclonal NCX1 Ab (π11-13, Swant), 4 μl of monoclonal NCX1 Ab (R3F1), or no Ab (monoclonal Ab control) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 40 μl (50% slurry) of washed suspended protein A-agarose beads were added to each sample and incubated for a further 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, washed four times with 1.5 ml of Buffer III containing 0.05% C12E8, and resuspended in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (+dithiothreitol). Beads were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and stored until further use for immunoblotting. Western Blot—Crude membrane input and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved on either 7.5 (NCX1) or 15% (PLM) SDS-PAGE in a Tris-glycine electrode buffer. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. Primary antibody incubation was performed for 3 h at room temperature (PLM) or overnight at 4 °C (NCX) in 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 containing 1:1000 R3F1, 1:5000 π11-13, or 1:5000 C2 antibodies. Secondary antibodies used were either 1:2000 donkey anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP*, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) or 1:2000 sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP* (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactivity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit, BioMax XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), and a developer. Na+/Ca2+ Exchange Current (INaCa) Measurements—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed at 30 °C as described previously (12Mirza M.A. Zhang X.Q. Ahlers B.A. Qureshi A. Carl L.L. Song J.

Pipettes were filled with a buffered Ca2+ solution containing the following (in mm): 100 Cs+ glutamate; 7.25 Na+ HEPES; 1 MgCl2; 12.75 HEPES; 2.5 Na2ATP; 10 EGTA; and 6 CaCl2 (pH 7.2). Free Ca2+ in the pipette solution was 205 nm, measured fluorimetrically with fura 2. Cells were bathed in an external solution containing the following (in mm): 130 NaCl; 5 CsCl; 1.2 MgSO4; 1.2 NaH2PO4; 5 CaCl2; 10 HEPES; 10 Na+ HEPES; and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Verapamil (1 μm), ouabain (1 mm), and niflumic acid (30 μm) were used to block Ca2+, Na+-K+-ATPase, and Cl- currents, respectively. K+ currents were minimized by Cs+ substitution for K+ in both pipette and external solutions. Only cells that fluoresced green (excitation 380 nm, emission 510 nm), indicating successful pAdTrack transfection, were selected for current measurements. For current measurements, cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated with the analog circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier. Membrane potential (Em) was held at the calculated reversal potential of INaCa (-73 mV) for 5 min before stimulation. This precaution minimized fluxes through NCX1 before the voltage ramp and thus allowed [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i to equilibrate with those present in pipette solution. A descending voltage ramp (from +100 to -120 mV; 500 mV/s) was immediately followed by an ascending voltage ramp (from -120 to +100 mV; 500 mV/s). The voltage ramp was repeated after the addition of 1 mm CdCl2 to the external solution. Currents were derived from measurements during the descending voltage ramp. INaCa was defined as the difference current measured in the absence and presence of Cd2+ (12Mirza M.A. Zhang X.Q. Ahlers B.A. Qureshi A. Carl L.L. Song J. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Moorman J.R. Rothblum L.I. Zhang T.S. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1322-H1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, and data were acquired at 2 kHz. Whole-cell capacitance (Cm) for each cell was measured by applying a small hyperpolarizing pulse (-10 mV, 16 ms) and integrating the resulting current change (digitized at 50 kHz, 0.5-kHz filter) over time. To facilitate comparison of NCX1 currents, INaCa of each cell was divided by Cm to account for variations in cell sizes. Resting Membrane Potential Determinations—Resting Em was measured in current-clamp mode as previously described (13Tadros G.M. Zhang X.Q. Song J. Carl L.L. Rothblum L.I. Tian Q. Dunn J. Lytton J.

Pipette solution consisted of the following (in mm): 125 KCl; 4 MgCl2; 0.06 CaCl2; 10 HEPES; 5 K+ EGTA; 3 Na2ATP; and 5 Na2-creatine phosphate (pH 7.2). External solution consisted of the following (in mm): 127 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1.8 CaCl2; 1.8 MgCl2; 0.6 NaH2PO4; 7.5 HEPES; 7.5 Na+ HEPES; and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). To simulate Na+ loading, 80 mm KCl in pipette solution was replaced with NaCl. Assay of Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ Uptake—Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake measurements were performed essentially as previously described (17Pan Y. Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C393-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK293 cells in 24-well plates were preloaded with Na+ at 37 °C for 20 min in a balanced salt solution (BSS) containing the following (in mm): 10 HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4); 146 NaCl; 4 KCl; 2 MgCl2; 0.1 CaCl2; 10 glucose; and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Ouabain (1 mm) and monensin (10 μm) were present during Na+ loading. 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by replacing the loading medium with 0.5 ml of either Na+-free BSS (NaCl replaced with equimolar methyl-d-glucosamine) or normal BSS, both of which contained 0.1 mm 45CaCl2 (1.5 μCi/ml), [3H]mannitol (1 μCi/ml), and 1 mm ouabain. After 30 s, 45Ca2+ uptake was terminated by washing cells four times with an ice-cold solution containing the following (in mm): 10 HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4); 120 choline chloride; and 10 LaCl3. Preliminary studies showed that 45Ca2+ uptake was linear during the first 30 s. Cells were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH and neutralized, and aliquots were taken for determination of 45Ca2+ and 3H radioactivity and protein. Extracellular contamination as determined from [3H]mannitol counts was 0.134 ± 0.002 μl (n = 96), and contamination by extracellular 45Ca2+ was routinely subtracted before calculation of 45Ca2+ uptake. Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was calculated by subtracting 45Ca2+ uptake values in the presence of extracellular Na+ from those obtained in the absence of Na+ and normalized to milligram cell protein. Co-immunoprecipitation of NCX1 and PLM in Native Cardiac Membranes—Sarcolemmal vesicles were prepared from the left ventricles of pig hearts essentially according to the method of Larry R. Jones (24Presti C.F. Jones L.R. Lindemann J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3860-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Presti C.F. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13879-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed membrane pellets (adjusted to 2 mg/ml) were resuspended in 300 μl of Buffer III, and 1.2 mg of C12E8 in 100 μl of Buffer III were added. After mixing and incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 400 μl of Buffer III were added and the mixture was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 37,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-agarose and incubated with either IgG or 2 μl of polyclonal PLM antibody, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described above for HEK293 cells. Crude membrane input and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved on 12% 1.0 mm 12-well bis-tris gels (Invitrogen). The primary antibody used to detect NCX1 was R3F1. In a second series of experiments, left ventricles were excised from adult male Sprague-Dawley rat hearts (∼300 g body weight). Crude membrane preparations were prepared with the protocol described above for HEK293 cells. Crude membrane preparations (2 mg) were used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments as described above for HEK293 cells. Statistical Analysis—All of the results are expressed as means ± S.E. For the analysis of a parameter (e.g. INaCa) as a function of group (e.g. NCX1 versus NCX1 + PLM) and voltage, two-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance. For the analysis of Cm, one-way ANOVA was used. For the analysis of Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake, Student's paired t test was used. A commercial software package (JMP, version 4.0.5, SAS Institute; Cary, NC) was used. In all of the analyses, p < 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. Plasma Membrane Co-localization of PLM and NCX1 in HEK293 Cells—Expression of PLM and of NCX1 in HEK293 was determined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. As indicated by GFP expression driven via a separate CMV promoter within both PLM and NCX1 pAdTrack expression vectors, routine transfection efficiencies were between 30 and 50% (image not shown). Using both a monoclonal antibody directed against the intracellular loop of NCX1 (R3F1; Fig. 1B) and a polyclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of PLM (C2Ab; Fig. 1C) (11Song J. Zhang X.Q. Carl L.L. Qureshi A. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H576-H583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both proteins were predominantly present at the plasma membrane in permeabilized PLM + NCX1-co-transfected cells. This pattern is in contrast to GFP expression pattern, which was cytoplasmic (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that both PLM- and NCX1-transfected cDNAs underwent similar sorting and/or processing of the translated protein as observed for endogenous PLM and NCX1 in cardiac myocytes (14Zhang X.Q. Qureshi A. Song J. Carl L.L. Tian Q. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Rothblum L.I. Cheung J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H225-H233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was a high degree of co-localization of PLM and NCX1 at the plasma membrane, as suggested by the merged image (Fig. 1D). In agreement with previous studies, neither NCX1 (8Dong H. Dunn J. Lytton J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1934-1952Google Scholar) nor PLM (19Davis C.E. Patel M.K. Miller J.R. John III, J.E. Jones L.R. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Moorman J.R. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was detected in HEK293 cells transfected with only the empty pAdTrack expression plasmid (image not shown; Western blots shown in Fig. 2).Fig. 2Exogenous expression of PLM and cardiac NCX1 in HEK293 cells. Equal amounts of total plasmid DNA were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells with pAdTrack alone (pAdT), pAdT + PLM (PLM), pAdT + NCX1 (NCX1), or PLM + NCX1 (PLM/NCX1). Crude membrane preparations (6 μg) from indicated cell cultures were subjected to immunoblot analysis at 48 h post-transfection using either monoclonal anti-NCX1 (R3F1, top panel) or polyclonal anti-PLM (C2Ab, bottom panel) antibodies. The antibodies used are indicated on the right and molecular mass markers (in kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blotting experiments on crude membrane fractions further confirmed membrane localization of PLM and NCX1 (Fig. 2). Importantly, the expression levels of NCX1 were similar in the absence or presence of co-transfected PLM. Three bands were detected after SDS-PAGE for PLM with minor bands detected at 8 and 18 kDa and a major band at 14 kDa, respectively. The major band corresponds to the size previously found in rat cardiac myocytes where PLM (with a predicted size of 7.2 kDa) is known to display aberrant migration on SDS-PAGE (11Song J. Zhang X.Q.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13879-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-expressing PLM also demonstrated the minor bands (19Davis C.E. Patel M.K. Miller J.R. John III, J.E. Jones L.R. Tucker A.L. Mounsey J.P. Moorman J.R. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The identities of these minor bands are at present unknown. Association of NCX1 with PLM in HEK293 Cells—Co-localization of NCX1 with PLM does not necessarily mean interaction of these two proteins. To determine whether PLM associated with NCX1, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments in transfected HEK293 cells. Solubilized crude membrane immunoprecipitates obtained using C2Ab to purify PLM from cells that co-expressed PLM and NCX1 (Fig. 3, bottom panel, lane 8) also contained NCX1 (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 8). Recovery of NCX1 in immunoprecipitates obtained using the PLM antibody C2Ab was dependent on PLM expression and was not observed in control experiments using cells co-transfected with empty pAdTrack expression plasmid and/or NCX1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 7, top panel). Likewise, control immunoprecipitates prepared from cells transfected with either empty pAdTrack, PLM + pAdTrack, NCX1 + pAdTrack, or PLM + NCX1 using preimmume rabbit IgG did not contain either PLM or NCX1 (Fig. 3, top and bottom panels, lanes 1–4). Equivalent levels of NCX1 and PLM protein were observed in the starting material for immunoprecipitation whether expressed either alone or in combination in these cells (Fig. 3, top and bottom panels, lanes 10–12). To provide further evidence for the specificity of this association, the reciprocal experiment was performed in cells co-expressing PLM and NCX1 in which anti-NCX1 immunoprecipitates from solubilized"
https://openalex.org/W2147904388,"The sperm acrosome is a large secretory granule that undergoes calcium-stimulated exocytosis by a mechanism analogous to neuronal secretion. In neurons the core SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex, composed of syntaxin (Stx), SNAP-25, and VAMP2, mediates vesicle fusion, whereas calcium regulation is thought to be accomplished by the synaptotagmin (Syt) family, some of which exhibit calcium-dependent binding to syntaxin and SNAP-25. Sperm express Syt VI and VIII and Stx2, which are co-localized to the acrosomal compartment where they might mediate exocytosis in response to calcium influx. Therefore, we examined the calcium dependence and isoform-specific interaction of Syt and Stx. We found that Stx2 binds to Syt I, VI, and VIII in a calcium-dependent manner with EC50 values of 175, 233, and 96 μm calcium, respectively. We also determined that the EC50 for calcium of the acrosome reaction in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm is 87 μm, which closely coincides with the calcium sensitivity of Stx2 and Syt VIII interaction. Consistent with this is the greater potency of recombinant Syt VIII, VI, and Stx2 compared with other isoforms in inhibiting the acrosome reaction in streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm. Similarly, introduction of Syt VIII-specific antibodies was equally effective in inhibiting the acrosome fusion. Taken together, our data suggest a critical role for Syt VIII and Stx2 in membrane fusion and acrosome reaction in the sperm.

In addition, the newly exposed membrane surface, the inner acrosomal membrane, contains secondary binding sites that mediate continued binding to the zona pellucida during penetration. Therefore, the AR is a prerequisite for sperm-egg plasma membrane binding and fusion (1Wassarman P.M. Jovine L. Litscher E.S. Nat.

In other cells the calcium-regulated release of secretory peptide hormones and neurotransmitters is mediated by a family of proteins commonly referred to as the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) (11Terrian D.M.

The core SNARE complex is composed of two proteins on the plasma membrane, syntaxin (Stx) (14Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and SNAP-25 (15Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J.

Formation of the SNARE complex brings the fusing membranes into close apposition and is a prerequisite for fusion. A number of isoforms of each SNARE protein have been identified, including 18 Stxs (16Teng F.Y. Wang Y. Tang B.L.

There is growing evidence that isoforms of SNARE proteins are involved in the fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane and the plasma membrane in the sperm AR, consistent with the AR being a form of Ca2+-mediated exocytosis. All three SNARE proteins, Stx, VAMP, and SNAP, were first shown to be present in sperm in the sea urchin, where they remained tightly associated with the shed acrosomal vesicles after the acrosome reaction, indicating co-localization with the fusion machinery (23Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Schulz J.R. Sasaki J.D. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24355-24359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In mammalian sperm, VAMP and SNAP-25 proteins were also found to be present, and disruption of VAMP with botulinum neurotoxin inhibited AR (25Tomes C.N. Michaut M. De Blas G. Visconti P. Matti U. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The expression and functional importance of Stx isoforms in sperm has been controversial. Stx1A, -1B, -4, and -6 have all been reported in human sperm based upon their detection with antisera (25Tomes C.N. Michaut M. De Blas G. Visconti P. Matti U. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Sutovsky P. Chan A.W. Hewitson L. Wessel G.M. Simerly C.R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, botulinum neurotoxin C, which selectively cleaves Stx1 and -2, inhibited the AR, suggesting that Stx4 and -6 in human sperm are not able to compensate for the inactivation of these isoforms (25Tomes C.N. Michaut M. De Blas G. Visconti P. Matti U. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, the identification of Stx isoforms may also suffer from non-specificity of the antisera used, since the Stx1 antiserum appears to detect a protein in sperm lysate that is smaller than predicted for Stx1 (26Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Sutovsky P. Chan A.W. Hewitson L. Wessel G.M. Simerly C.R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the mouse, mRNA for Stx2 and -4, but not Stx1 or -3, is expressed in the testis and Stx2 protein, but not Stx4 protein (27Katafuchi K. Mori T. Toshimori K. Iida H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 57: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) is present in the sperm, suggesting that it is Stx2 that plays an active role in the AR in sperm. Despite the critical role the core SNARE proteins are proposed to play in triggering vesicle fusion, Ca2+-mediated secretion requires an additional regulatory mechanism that can transduce the increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ to the SNARE fusion machinery. The established candidates for this calcium sensor are members of the synaptotagmin (Syt) family. There are at least 15 distinct mammalian Syt isoforms expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (28Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C.

In addition, Syts are capable of binding to various calcium channels (46Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, they are ideally situated to sense an increase in Ca2+i and to transmit this signal to the core SNARE complex. This has been best studied in neurons where the interactions between Syt I or II and stx1 have been extensively investigated and Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding has been well established (44Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the role of other Syt isoforms in Ca2+-mediated exocytosis is less clear. In sperm, Syt VI and VIII proteins have clearly been shown to be localized to the human and mouse acrosome, respectively, and thus, could potentially function as Ca2+ sensors to trigger the AR (51Michaut M. De Blas G. Tomes C.N. Yunes R. Fukuda M. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 52Hutt D.M. Cardullo R.A. Baltz J.M. Ngsee J.K. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A difficulty with this scenario, however, is that the binding of both of these Syt isoforms to the SNARE complex had been reported to be Ca2+-insensitive (32Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 53von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as had phospholipid binding by Syt VIII (32Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 54Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

J. 2004; 378: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, at least in nerve terminals, Syt VI is apparently not localized to exocytotic vesicles (56Butz S. Fernandez-Chacon R. Schmitz F. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18290-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no other Syt isoforms had been conclusively identified in sperm. Although Syt I was previously reported to be present in sperm (26Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Sutovsky P. Chan A.W. Hewitson L. Wessel G.M. Simerly C.R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the antiserum used has since been shown to cross-react with almost all other Syt isoforms (52Hutt D.M. Cardullo R.A. Baltz J.M. Ngsee J.K. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), invalidating this identification. In addition, mRNA for Syt I is not expressed in the testis, unlike Syt VI and VIII, and similarly, Syt I mRNA is absent from spermatogenic cells, whereas Syt VIII is present (52Hutt D.M. Cardullo R.A. Baltz J.M. Ngsee J.K. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have now re-examined whether the Syt and Stx isoforms established to be expressed at the protein level in murine sperm (57Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Wessel G.M. Chan E.K. Schatten G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 58Brahmaraju M. Shoeb M. Laloraya M. Kumar P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Darszon A. Steinhardt R.A. Florman H.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) might actually be Ca2+-sensitive and mediate the AR in sperm. Indeed, we report here that, despite the interaction of Syt VIII with Stx1 being previously identified as Ca2+-insensitive (32Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), both actually exhibit isoform-specific, Ca2+-regulated binding. We then used the streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized sperm preparation to establish that these Syt and Stx isoforms apparently function in acrosomal exocytosis in the mouse. Reagents—The pGEX-KG Syt constructs were obtained from Dr. T. Sudhof, and the pGEX-2T Stx constructs were obtained from Dr. L. Elferink. SLO was purchased from Sigma, and recombinant SLO was purchased from Dr. S. Bhakdi from the Institute of Medical Microbiology (Mainz University, Germany). Cloning of Syntaxin to pQE9 —The cytoplasmic region of Stx1 and 2 were PCR-amplified from pGEX-Stx1 or -2 using the following oligonucleotides: Stx1 (forward) 5′-TCCCTGCAGACATGAAGGACCGAACCCAGG-3′ and Stx1 (reverse) 5′-GTAAGCTTCTACTTCTTCCTGCGTGCC-3′, Stx2 (forward) 5′-ATTAGATCTATGCGGGACCGGCTGCCGGAC-3′ and Stx2 (reverse) 5′-AGAAAGCTTTCACCACTTTTTCCGTCTGGCC-3′. The fragments were cut with PstI/HindIII and BglII/HindIII, respectively, and cloned into pQE9 vector (Qiagen), which was modified to contain a hemagglutinin (HA) tag between the His6 tag and the multiple cloning site. Cloning of Synaptotagmin to pQE9 —The cytoplasmic region of Syt I, VI, and VIII, referred to as C2AB, were PCR-amplified from pGEX-KG Syt I, VI, and VIII using the following oligonucleotides: Syt I (forward) 5′-CGAGATCTGAGAAACTGGGAAAGCTCCAATATTCA-3′ and Syt I (reverse) 5′-CAGAAGCTTACTTCTTGACAGCCAGCATGGCATC-3′, Syt VI (forward) 5′-CGAGATCTGCCAAGAGCTGTGGGAAGATCA-3′ and Syt VI (reverse) 5′-CTGAAGCTTCACAACCGGCGGGTTCCCTCT-3′, Syt VIII (forward) 5′-TAGGATCCGTTCAACCAGATGTGGACTGC-3′ and Syt VIII (reverse) 5′-TTGAATTCAGGAGCGAGGCCTAAGCAG-3′. The Syt I and VI C2AB were digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into the modified pQE9 (above). The Syt VIII C2AB was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, which was blunt-ended, and the fragment was cloned into modified pQE9 (above) cut with BglII and SmaI. Purification of GST-Synaptotagmin—The purification of GST Syts was performed as described by the manufacturer for GST fusion proteins. Briefly, the bacterial cells were homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with wash buffer 1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) followed by wash buffer 2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The amount of bound GST fusion protein was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining of a polyacrylamide gel using BSA as a standard. Purification of His6/HA-tagged Proteins—The purification of His6/HA-tagged Stx for in vitro binding assay was performed as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were homogenized in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm sucrose, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was supplemented with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was added to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads preequilibrated in lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were successively washed with wash buffer 1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 500 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and wash buffer 2 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100). The fusion protein was eluted in wash buffer 2 containing 250 mm imidazole and quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of polyacrylamide gel using BSA as a standard. The purification of His6/HA fusion proteins for inhibition of acrosome reaction was performed as described by the manufacturer for His6-tagged fusion proteins. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and disrupted by a French press. After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was added to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The column was washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 25 mm imidazole) until the A280 was below 0.05 and was followed by Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB), pH 7.4, without CaCl2. The His6-tagged fusion proteins were eluted in KRB containing 250 mm imidazole and quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of polyacrylamide gel using BSA as a standard. Calcium Buffers—10× stock calcium buffers were prepared by mixing the appropriate amount of 1 m CaCl2 and 0.5 m EGTA to obtain the predicted 10× final free calcium concentration. The precise free calcium concentration of the 1× buffer for each concentration used was determined by a calcium-selective electrode (Corning) calibrated with calcium standards. In Vitro Binding Assay—Determinations of binding of Stx1 and -2 to Syt I, VI, and VIII were performed using bacterially expressed proteins in a pull-down assay. The GST-tagged cytoplasmic region of Syt was purified by glutathione-Sepharose as described above and incubated with equal amounts of His6/HA-tagged Stx1 or -2 for 4 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) with the indicated free Ca2+ concentration added from 10× stock solutions. After the incubation, the beads were washed three times with the appropriate ice-cold binding buffer, and bound proteins were subjected to Western immunoblot analysis using anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibody and Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen) to detect bound Stx. Densitometric analysis was performed using a Typhoon 8600 imager (Amersham Biosciences). The results are an average of at least three separate experiments. Ca2+ Titration of the Acrosome Reaction in Streptolysin O-permeabilized Mouse Sperm—Sperm were collected from cauda epididymides of 12–15-week-old CD-1 mice and allowed to “swim-up” for 15 min in KRB, pH 7.4, media (5.6 mm glucose, 0.55 mm sodium pyruvate, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 53 mm sodium lactate, 99.6 mm sodium chloride, 4.8 mm potassium chloride, 1.2 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 1.2 mm magnesium sulfate) containing 3 mg/ml BSA (37 °C, 5% CO2). Sperm were diluted to a concentration of 5.0 × 106 sperm/ml and permeabilized with 0.6 units/ml SLO (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and subsequently supplemented with 10× CaCl2 solutions to the indicated final concentration. Sperm were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The extent of acrosome reaction was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining as indicated below. Introduction of Recombinant Proteins and Antisera into Streptolysin O-permeabilized Mouse Sperm—Sperm were collected from cauda epididymides of 12–15-week-old CD-1 mice and allowed to swim-up for 15 min in KRB, pH 7.4, media containing 1.7 mm CaCl2 and 3 mg/ml BSA (37 °C, 5% CO2). Swim-up sperm were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspended in Ca2+-free KRB, pH 7.4. Sperm were diluted to a concentration of 5.0 × 106 sperm/ml with KRB (–Ca2+) and permeabilized with 0.6 units/ml (Sigma) or 5 μg/ml recombinant SLO for 5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and subsequently supplemented with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm. Sperm were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Recombinant proteins or antibodies were added at the permeabilization step from a concentrated stock in KRB to the indicated final concentrations and maintained throughout the subsequent incubation. Assessment of Acrosomal Status—Fixed sperm were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min and washed 2 times with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 9.0. The sperm were subsequently resuspended in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 9.0, and air-dried on glass slides. The slides were then washed with water, methanol, and water for 5 min each. The sperm were stained with 0.625% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min at room temperature (61Larson J.L. Miller D.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The slides were subsequently washed 4 times with distilled H2O and mounted with 30% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Sperm were imaged by bright-field microscopy using a Zeiss AxioPhot microscope and scored for acrosomal staining. Data Processing and Curve Fitting—Data for the SLO-treated sperm were corrected for spontaneous AR by subtracting the percentage of AR in non-permeabilized sperm from that of SLO-permeabilized sperm, and the maximal value was subsequently normalized to 100%. Two models were compared for fit to the data obtained from the Ca2+ titration of the AR in SLO-permeabilized sperm. These included a model that assumed a single binding site for Ca2+ of the form y = max/(1 + 10(logEC50 – χ) × Hill slope), where max is the maximum AR at saturating Ca2+, EC50 is the Ca2+ concentration at half-maximal binding, and Hill slope is the Hill coefficient that reflects cooperativity. The data were fit by nonlinear least squares regression (SigmaPlot) with max and EC50 as parameters of the fit. In addition, the fit to the data was compared assuming either a fixed Hill slope of 1 (no cooperativity) or a variable Hill slope fit to the data. The Hill coefficient was also calculated from a Hill plot of the data as log(AR/nAR) versus log[Ca2+], where AR is the fraction of acrosome-reacted sperm, and nAR is the fraction of acrosome intact sperm. The other model that was tested assumed two binding sites with different Ca2+ affinities (EC1 and EC2 representing the first and second EC50, respectively), which had the form y = max × (F1/(1 + 10(logEC1 – χ) × Hill slope 1) + (1 – F1)/(1 + 10(logEC2 – χ) × Hill slope 2)), where F1 is the fraction of the population assumed to react with EC1 (i.e. first EC50 component), and the remainder are assumed in this model to react with EC2, the second EC50 component. The comparison between the fits afforded by the one- and two-site models was done by an F-test of the residuals. The in vitro Syt-Stx binding was fitted to a one-site model with a fixed slope using the equation as described above with a Hill slope of 1. Calcium Dependence of the Acrosome Reaction—To estimate the calcium dependence of the AR in mouse sperm, the free calcium concentrations in the media were varied from 0 to 2 mm, and the extent of AR was assessed in sperm whose plasma membranes had been selectively permeabilized with SLO to allow equilibration of calcium at the site of fusion with external calcium. As predicted, increasing the extracellular calcium concentration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in AR in SLO-permeabilized sperm (Fig. 1), which appeared to reach saturation as calcium concentrations approached the millimolar range. Analysis of the data using a 1-site sigmoidal-dose response model as described under “Materials and Methods” yielded an EC50 of 87 μm"

Reconstitution of Tpl2–/– macrophages with wild type Tpl2 or Tpl2 T290D restored ERK activation by LPS, whereas reconstitution of the same cells with Tpl2 T290A did not, suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr290 is required for the physiological activation of Tpl2 by external signals. Both the wild type Tpl2 and the kinase-inactive mutant Tpl2 K167M undergo Thr290 phosphorylation, suggesting that Thr290 may be a site of trans-phosphorylation rather than auto-phosphorylation. Pretreatment of 293 cells and primary macrophages with the Iκ-B kinase-β (IKKβ) inhibitor PS-1145 blocked Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290, suggesting that phosphorylation depends on IKKβ, an obligatory positive regulator of Tpl2.

These finding suggested that Tpl2 plays an obligatory role in the transduction of LPS and TNF-α signals, a hypothesis that has now been amply confirmed. Studies from this laboratory have indeed shown that Tpl2 is required for the transduction of LPS and CD40L signals that activate ERK in macrophages and B cells and TNF-α signals that also activate ERK in macrophages (12Dumitru C.D.

Das, J. Cho, I. Lambertz, M. A. Kelliher, A. G. Eliopoulos, K. Du, and P. N. Tsichlis, submitted for publication. Studies based on these observations confirmed that Tpl2 is activated by both LPS (Refs. 18Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol.

Tpl2 activation by LPS or anti-CD40 antibodies depends on TRAF6. Thus, anti-CD40 antibodies promote the association of endogenous Tpl2 and TRAF6 with CD40. Moreover, overexpression of TRAF6 in Tpl2+/+ fibroblasts and keratinocytes promotes the activation of ERK, whereas overexpression of TRAF6 in Tpl2–/– cells does not (17Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). More recent studies addressed the role of RIP1 and TRAF2 on Tpl2 activation by TNF-α and the role of IKKβ on Tpl2 activation by either TNF-α or LPS. These studies revealed that the activation of Tpl2 by TNF-α depends on RIP1 and TRAF2, because treatment of RIP1–/– and TRAF2–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts with TNF-α does not activate Tpl2. 3S. Das, J. Cho, I. Lambertz, M. A. Kelliher, A. G. Eliopoulos, K. Du, and P. N. Tsichlis, submitted for publication. In addition, they showed that Tpl2 activation by LPS or TNF-α depends on the activation of IKKβ (19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because inactive Tpl2 in unstimulated cells is stoichiometrically bound to NF-κB1/p105 and Tpl2 activation by external signals depends on its dissociation from p105 (9Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), these findings were interpreted to suggest that the function of IKKβ is to promote the phosphorylation and degradation of p105 and the subsequent release of activated Tpl2 (19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that Tpl2 undergoes phosphorylation at Thr290 in vivo and that phosphorylation is required for the enzymatic activation of the Tpl2 kinase. We also show that phosphorylation is induced by LPS and TNF-α and that it is required for the physiological activation of Tpl2 by external signals. Finally, we present evidence that Thr290 is a site of trans-phosphorylation rather than auto-phosphorylation and that its modification depends on IKKβ, an obligatory positive upstream regulator of Tpl2 (19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of the 52-(p52) and the 58-kDa (p58) isoforms of Tpl2, the p58 isoform is targeted preferentially for phosphorylation at Thr290, suggesting that the two isoforms are functionally distinct. These data collectively show that phosphorylation at Thr290 is required for Tpl2 activation by external signals. In addition, they show that IKKβ is required for the activation of Tpl2, not only because it phosphorylates p105 and targets it for degradation but also because it promotes the phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290. Therefore, these data provide a novel link between IKKβ and Tpl2 activation by external signals. Cell Culture—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– mice (12Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N.

To infect primary BMDMs, 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of virus supernatants. 2 h later, they were cultured in macrophage media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 30% L929-conditioned media, non-essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin). Because Tpl2–/– cells express constitutively the G418 resistance gene, they could not be G418-selected. Therefore, to isolate cultures of large T antigen-expressing cells, we selected for cells surviving long term culture. Two months were generally sufficient to isolate fully infected immortalized lines. The immortalized macrophage cell lines were maintained in macrophage media. RAW264.7 cells, Y2 cells, 293 cells, L929 cells (12Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N.

To inhibit IKKβ, 293 cells transiently transfected with Tpl2 constructs were treated with PS-1145 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.) 1.5 h prior to harvesting and RAW264.7 cells were treated with PS-1145 (50 μm) 1.5 h prior to LPS (1 μg/ml from Salmonella enteritidis, purchased from Sigma) stimulation. Alternatively, IKKβ was knocked down by siRNA (see below). Expression Plasmids, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Retrovirus Constructs—Wild type Tpl2, C-terminally tagged with the HA epitope, was cloned by PCR in the polylinker of pCMV5 between EcoRI and BamHI. Tpl2 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of this plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Wild type Tpl2 and Thr290 mutants of Tpl2 (Thr→ Ala and Thr→ Asp) were also cloned in the EcoRI site of the pMSCV-based retrovirus vector pMigR1 (kindly provided by Warren Pear, University of Pennsylvania). Transfections, Retrovirus Infections, and Small Interfering RNA Experiments—Transfection of 293 cells was carried out in 6-well plates (1 μg of DNA/plate) or 100-mm plates (8 μg of DNA/plate). Plasmid DNA was mixed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), and following 25 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to 40% confluent 293 cell monolayers. Cells were harvested 48 h later. Cultures were serum-starved for 18 h prior to harvesting in all of the experiments in which ERK phosphorylation was the end point. Retrovirus packaging and infection were carried out as follows. pMigR1 retrovirus constructs of wild type Tpl2.HA, Tpl2 T290A.HA, and Tpl2 T290D.HA were transfected into 293-Phoenix cells in combination with pVSVG and pCL Ampho. The culture medium was changed 24 h later. Viral supernatants were collected at the 72-h time point, and they were concentrated 30-fold by ultracentrifugation (20,000 rpm in the SW 40Ti rotor for 3 h at 4 °C). Immortalized macrophages were infected with the concentrated viruses using the spinfect method (21Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficiencies of infection achieved by this method were reproducibly higher than 50%. Cells were serum-starved 48 h after infection, and they were stimulated with LPS at the 72-h time point. Three double-stranded Stealth™ IKKβ RNA oligonucleotides and one control oligonucleotide were synthesized (Invitrogen) and tested in RAW264.7 macrophages. One of them (sense 5′-GCCAAGGAGGAGAUCUCCGAAGAUA-3′) was successful in knocking down mouse IKKβ by 70%. This siRNA was used for subsequent experiments. All of the siRNAs (150 nm) were transfected into RAW264.7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Efficiencies of siRNA transfer were monitored using siGLO siRNA purchased from Dharmacon. Cell lysates were harvested 72 h after transfection. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 23Luo K.X. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5305-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). pCMV5 constructs of wild type Tpl2.HA, Tpl2-T290A.HA, and Tpl2-T290D.HA were transfected into 293 cells, and they were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled Tpl2 proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Following elution from the membranes by treatment with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-360 in 0.1 m acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, the samples were digested with 20 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 5 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were dried and, following a 2-h treatment with performic acid (1 volume of 30% H2O2, 9 volumes of formic acid), they were re-dried and resuspended in a buffer containing 2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid in H2O, pH 1.9. The resuspended peptides were spotted onto nitrocellulose plates, and they were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and in the second dimension by thin layer chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer (37.5% n-butyl alcohol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid in H2O). Antibodies, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) and phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/Ser221) antibodies as well as the corresponding antibodies that recognize “total” i.e. both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of these kinases, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-HA monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were from Covance. Anti-NF-κB1/p105 antibody was from Delta Biolabs. Anti-Tpl2 (M20) antibody and anti-Tpl2-agarose-conjugated antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phospho-Thr290-specific anti-Tpl2 antibody was raised by injecting rabbits with the peptide-CKDLRGT(PO4)EIYMSPE. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protein G-Sepharose was purchased from Invitrogen. Phosphospecific antibodies were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS (Tris-buffered saline) supplemented with 0.1% v/v Tween 20 (TBS-T), whereas all of the other antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in TBS-T. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration in the soluble fraction, isolated by centrifugation of the total lysates (12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, 50–100 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore), and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TBS-T. Following three washes with TBS-T, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, washed in TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were quantitated using a densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-800, Quantity one). For immunoprecipitation, lysates (500 μg-1.5 mg) were precleared with Sepharose G-beads and immunoprecipitated overnight using a monoclonal anti-HA (Tpl2.HA) antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and re-suspended in 50 μl of loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots of 20 μl were resolved in SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed for Thr290-phosphorylated or total Tpl2. In Vitro Kinase Assays—293 cells transiently transfected with Tpl2.HA constructs and immortalized Tpl2+/+ murine macrophages and RAW264.7 cells expressing stably near physiological levels of Tpl2.HA were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates was washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). The washed immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.5 μg of GST-MEK1 (U. S. Biological) in kinase buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. Phosphorylated GST-MEK1 was visualized by autoradiography. In some of the experiments, the kinase reaction was carried out in kinase buffer containing 200 μm cold ATP and 0.5 μg of GST-MEK1. In these experiments, phosphorylated GST-MEK1 was detected by probing Western blots of the products of the kinase reaction with the phospho-MEK1/2 antibody. The Tpl2 Kinase Is Activated by LPS and TNF-α—Our earlier studies had shown that Tpl2 transduces LPS signals that activate ERK in macrophages and that these signals are required for the induction of TNF-α, cyclooxygenase-2, and other proinflammatory molecules (12Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4831-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Tpl2 may be activated by LPS. In vitro kinase assays on Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages indeed showed that the activity of the Tpl2 kinase, which is very low prior to stimulation (0 min), increases rapidly following stimulation (Fig. 1A). More recent studies have shown that Tpl2 is also activated by TNF-α in both macrophages and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).3 Most of our earlier studies on Tpl2 had been carried out on primary peritoneal or BMDM. Recently, we established permanent lines by infecting wild type and Tpl2–/– BMDMs with an SV40 large T antigen retrovirus construct. Both the Tpl2+/+ (Tpl2(+)Mac) and the Tpl2–/– (Tpl2(–) Mac) lines express Mac-1. However, only the Tpl2(+)Mac lines undergo ERK phosphorylation and activation when treated with LPS (Fig. 1B1). Therefore, these cell lines exhibit properties similar to the properties of primary macrophages. Stimulation of one of the Tpl2(+)Mac lines with LPS induced the activation of Tpl2. The kinetics of activation were similar to those observed in LPS-treated RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1B2). Tpl2 Is Phosphorylated at Thr290 in Vivo—To address the potential role of activation loop phosphorylation in Tpl2 activation, we generated Tpl2 mutants in which phosphorylatable residues in this region were replaced one at a time with alanine or with the phosphomimetic aspartic acid (Fig. 2A). The expression constructs of these mutants, fused at their C terminus to a HA epitope tag along with expression constructs of HA-tagged wild type Tpl2, were transiently transfected into 293 cells. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml for 3 h). The labeled Tpl2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and after SDS-PAGE, they were digested with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to two-dimensional separation (electrophoresis versus thin layer chromatography), and they were detected by autoradiography. The results were interpreted to suggest that Tpl2 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites. Because the Tpl2 T290A mutant lacked phosphopeptide 8 (Fig. 2B), we conclude that Thr290 is likely to be one of the Tpl2 phosphorylation sites. Tpl2 T290A Is Inactive, whereas Tpl2 T290D Exhibits Weak Kinase Activity—Western blots of 293 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged constructs of wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 K167M (kinase-inactive), and the activation loop mutants described in the preceding paragraphs were probed with anti-HA (Tpl2.HA), anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-ERK antibodies. The results showed that substitution of Ser274 and Tyr282 with either alanine or aspartic acid gave rise to Tpl2 kinase mutants unable to activate ERK, whereas substitution of Thr278 with either residue gave rise to mutants that were as active as the wild type protein. On the other hand, substitution of Thr290 with alanine had the opposite effect than its substitution with aspartic acid. Thus, whereas a T290A mutant failed to induce phosphorylation of ERK, a T290D mutant induced ERK phosphorylation, although weakly, suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr290 may contribute to the activation of the Tpl2 kinase (Fig. 2C). To address this hypothesis, we carried out Tpl2 in vitro kinase assays using Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from 293 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged expression constructs of wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 K167M, Tpl2 T290A, and Tpl2 T290D. Kinase activity was determined by measuring the ability of the immunoprecipitated proteins to trans-phosphorylate GST-MEK1 and to undergo autophosphorylation. The results showed that, whereas Tpl2 T290A is inactive, Tpl2 T290D is active. However, its specific activity was lower than that of wild type Tpl2 (Fig. 2D). These data collectively indicate that Thr290 is Tpl2 phosphorylation site. Tpl2 T290D Transduces LPS Signals in Reconstituted Tpl2–/– Macrophages, whereas Tpl2 T290A Does Not—To confirm the biological significance of Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290, we also examined whether Tpl2 T290A and Tpl2 T290D restore ERK phosphorylation by LPS in immortalized Tpl2(–)Mac macrophages. To address this question, Tpl2(–)Mac macrophages were infected with pMigR1 retrovirus constructs expressing wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 T290A, or Tpl2 T290D. Alternatively, they were infected with the empty pMigR1 vector. Infected cells were stimulated with LPS, and they were harvested 30 min later. The results showed that wild type Tpl2 fully restores and Tpl2 T290D partially restores ERK activation by LPS, whereas Tpl2 T290A is inactive (Fig. 3). We conclude that phosphorylation at Thr290 plays an obligatory role in the physiological activation of Tpl2 by LPS in macrophages. Because in the absence of LPS stimulation Tpl2 T290D did not activate ERK, we also conclude that phosphorylation at Thr290 is required but not sufficient for the activation of Tpl2. A Thr290-specific Phospho-Tpl2 Antibody-Phosphorylation at Thr290 Targets Preferentially the p58 Isoform of Tpl2 and Does Not Depend on the Activity of Tpl2 Kinase—To further explore the biological significance of Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the phosphorylated peptide-CKDLRGT(PO4)EIYMSPE, which spans the phosphorylation site. The antibody was first used to probe Western blots of Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 293 cells transiently transfected with expression constructs of HA-tagged wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 K167M, Tpl2 T290A, Tpl2 T290D, or the empty vector. The same immunoprecipitates were probed with a polyclonal anti-HA antibody. The phosphospecific antibody found two bands (Fig. 4A, upper panel) that appeared to correspond to the 52-(p52) and 58-kDa (p58) Tpl2 isoforms detected with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Of these bands, p58 band was detected with the phosphospecific antibody in cells transfected with wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 K167M, and Tpl2 T290D but it was missing from cells transfected with the empty vector or it was very faint in cells transfected with Tpl2 T290A. In contrast, the p52-like band was detected in the lysates of all the cells, including those transfected with the vector and the Tpl2 290A construct (Fig. 4A, upper panel). To determine whether the p52-like band was indeed the p52 Tpl2 isoform, Tpl2.HA immunoprecipitated from lysates of 293 cells transfected with wild type Tpl2 or with the empty vector was probed with the phosphospecific antibody and re-probed after stripping the first antibody with a polyclonal anti-HA (Tpl2) antibody. The results (Fig. 4B) showed that the p52-like band was not p52 and that the phosphospecific antibody detects only the p58 isoform. Therefore, these data showed that, of the p58 and p52 isoforms of Tpl2, only the p58 isoform undergoes phosphorylation at Thr290. To confirm that the antibody is indeed specific for Tpl2 phosphorylated at Thr290, we used it to probe a Western blot of Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 293 cells transfected with expression constructs of wild type Tpl2, Tpl2 T290A, Tpl2 T290D, or with the empty vector. The same blot was stripped, and following treatment with alkaline phosphatase, it was reprobed with the same antibody. The results confirmed that the antibody detects only the p58 isoform and that treatment with alkaline phosphatase practically eliminates the immunoreactivity of wild type Tpl2 but not the immunoreactivity of Tpl2 T290D (Fig. 4C). We conclude that the antibody indeed detects specifically Tpl2 phosphorylated at Thr290. Tpl2 Phosphorylation at Thr290 Is Induced by LPS and Depends on the Activity of IKKβ—To determine whether phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290 is induced by LPS, RAW264.7 cells engineered to stably express Tpl2.HA were LPS-stimulated. Tpl2.HA was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates harvested at the indicated time points before and after LPS stimulation. Probing the immunoprecipitates with the anti-phospho-Thr290 antibody revealed that Tpl2 is not phosphorylated at Thr290 in unstimulated cells but becomes phosphorylated in response to LPS. Probing the same lysates with the rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody showed that the p58 isoform is rapidly degraded following treatment with LPS, as expected. Finally, probing for phosphorylated and total ERK showed that ERK phosphorylation correlates with the phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290 (Fig. 5). Similar experiments with cells stimulated with TNF-α, rather than LPS, revealed that TNF-α also induces phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290 (data not shown). Recent studies provided evidence that IKKβ is required for Tpl2 activation by LPS and TNF-α (19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether IKKβ is required for Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290, we first treated RAW264.7 Tpl2.HA cells with the potent IKKβ inhibitor PS-1145 (Fig. 6A1). Alternatively, the cells were transfected with the IKKβ siRNA oligonucleotide or with a control double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide. The siRNA-mediated down-regulation of IKKβ was monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 6A2). PS-1145-treated and non-treated cells and siRNA or control oligonucleotide-treated cells were stimulated with LPS, and they were harvested 30 min later. Tpl2.HA was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with phospho-Thr290 and anti-HA polyclonal antibodies. The results (Fig. 6A) showed that pretreatment with PS-1145 or IKKβ siRNA blocks Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290. In parallel experiments, we transiently transfected wild type Tpl2 into 293 cells and we examined the phosphorylation of the wild type protein before and after treatment with PS-1145. Control 293 cells were transfected with Tpl2 T290A.HA. The results confirmed that overexpressed Tpl2, which is constitutively active, is also constitutively phosphorylated at Thr290. In addition, they demonstrated that treatment with PS-1145 blocks the phosphorylation of overexpressed Tpl2 (Fig. 6B). Therefore, phosphorylation of Tpl2 at this site depends on the activity of IKKβ. Evidence presented in this report showed that Tpl2 undergoes phosphorylation at Thr290 in vivo and that phosphorylation at this site is required for the enzymatic activity of overexpressed Tpl2, as well as for the physiological activation of Tpl2 by external signals. In unstimulated cells expressing physiological levels of Tpl2, the Tpl2 kinase was inactive and lacked detectable phosphorylation at Thr290. However, both kinase activity and phosphorylation were induced upon stimulation with LPS or TNF-α. When overexpressed in 293 cells, wild type Tpl2 underwent phosphorylation at Thr290 and it was catalytically active in the absence of stimulation. Upon transient transfection into 293 cells, the kinase-inactive mutant Tpl2 K167M also underwent phosphorylation at Thr290, suggesting that Thr290 is a site of trans-phosphorylation rather than auto-phosphorylation. Additional studies revealed that inhibition of IKKβ, a positive upstream regulator of Tpl2, blocks the phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290, suggesting that phosphorylation depends on the activity of IKKβ. The finding that Tpl2 undergoes phosphorylation at Thr290 in vivo is in agreement with a recent report (24Luciano B.S. Hsu S. Channavajhala P.L. Lin L.L. Cuozzo J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52117-52123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that appeared while this work was being prepared for publication. However, the published report (24Luciano B.S. Hsu S. Channavajhala P.L. Lin L.L. Cuozzo J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52117-52123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) failed to show that phosphorylation is induced by LPS or TNF-α and that it is required for the physiological activation of Tpl2 by external signals. Moreover, it did not address the relationship of Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290 with upstream signaling. All of these issues are addressed in the present study. In unstimulated cells, endogenous Tpl2 is stoichiometrically bound to NF-κB1/p105 (9Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Bound Tpl2 is stable but inactive (18Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Gandara M.L. Lopez P. Hernando R. Castano J.G. Alemany S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7377-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in transiently transfected 293 cells, a fraction of Tpl2 remains unbound. Despite the fact that this applies to wild type Tpl2 as well as to the mutants Tpl2 T290D and Tpl2 T290A, only wild type Tpl2 and The T290D mutant were catalytically active upon overexpression. Given the fact that, upon overexpression, Tpl2 or perhaps the unbound fraction of Tpl2 undergoes phosphorylation at Thr290, these findings suggest that phosphorylation at Thr290 is required for the catalytic activity of the Tpl2 kinase. Expression of wild type Tpl2 and Tpl2 T290D to near physiological levels in Tpl2–/– macrophages restored ERK activation by LPS, whereas expression of Tpl2 T290A did not. These data demonstrate conclusively that phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290 is required for the physiological activation of Tpl2 by external signals. However, because the expression of Tpl2 T290D to near physiological levels in Tpl2–/– macrophages did not activate ERK in the absence of LPS stimulation, these data also suggest that phosphorylation at Thr290 is necessary but not sufficient for Tpl2 activation. Translational initiation of the Tpl2 mRNA from three consecutive ATGs gives rise to 58-(p58) and 52-kDa (p52) isoforms of the kinase. Interestingly, earlier studies had shown that p58 is preferentially released from p105 upon LPS stimulation (18Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As a result, p58 is also preferentially activated and degraded in LPS-treated cells (18Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Given the data presented in this report showing that p58 is phosphorylated at Thr290 more efficiently than p52, we hypothesized that phosphorylation at Thr290 may also promote the release of Tpl2 from p105. Data presented elsewhere (26Cho J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indeed confirmed that phosphorylation at Thr290 is not only required for the catalytic activation of the Tpl2 kinase but also promotes the release of Tpl2 from p105 and is required for the degradation of Tpl2 via the proteasome in response to LPS. When overexpressed in 293 cells, both the wild type and the kinase-inactive mutant of Tpl2 (K167M) undergo phosphorylation at Thr290. This finding suggests that phosphorylation at this site is mediated by another kinase rather than Tpl2 itself. Recent studies revealed that activation of the IKK complex is required for Tpl2 activation by upstream signals (19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 20Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the question whether IKK is required for the phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290. Data presented in Fig. 6 clearly show that both the inhibition of IKKβ with PS-1145 and the knocking down of IKKβ with the IKKβ siRNA prevent phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290. We conclude that IKKβ may phosphorylate Tpl2 at Thr290 directly or it may regulate the kinase that phosphorylates Tpl2 at this site. Given that the Thr290 site and the consensus IKKβ phosphorylation site are distinctly different (27Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we favor the latter hypothesis. IKKβ is also known to phosphorylate p105 and to promote its degradation (28Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Based on this information, it has been hypothesized that IKKβ activates Tpl2 by promoting the phosphorylation and degradation of p105, which ultimately leads to the release at Tpl2 from its inhibitor. The data in this report provide evidence that IKKβ promotes the activation of Tpl2 by promoting not only the phosphorylation of p105 but also the phosphorylation of Tpl2. Therefore, these data provide an additional link between IKKβ and Tpl2 activation in cells stimulated with LPS. Overall, the data presented in this report identify Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290 as a required step in Tpl2 activation by external signals. Based on these data, we propose the model of Tpl2 activation and signaling shown in Fig. 7. According to this model, IKKβ contributes to the activation of Tpl2 by external signals not only by promoting the phosphorylation and degradation of p105, as previously suggested, but also by promoting the phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290. Based on data in this report and the results of additional studies from this laboratory (26Cho J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), Tpl2 phosphorylation at Thr290 is required for the enzymatic activation of Tpl2, the release of Tpl2 from p105, and the subsequent degradation of Tpl2 via the proteasome in response to external signals.

This trafficking may be important in regulating neuronal signaling. Such regulation will be subject to the number of trafficking transporters and their trafficking rates. In the present study, we define an acutely recycling pool of endogenous γ-aminobutyric acid transporters (GAT1) in cortical neurons that comprises approximately one-third of total cellular GAT1. Kinetic analysis of this pool estimates exocytosis and endocytosis time constants of 1.6 and 0.9 min, respectively, and thus approximately one-third of the recycling pool is plasma membrane resident in the basal state. Recent evidence shows that GAT1 substrates, second messengers, and interacting proteins regulate GAT1 trafficking. These triggers could act by altering trafficking rates or by changing the recycling pool size. In the present study we examine three GAT1 modulators. Calcium depletion decreases GAT1 surface expression by diminishing the recycling pool size. Sucrose increases GAT1 surface expression by blocking clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, but it does not change the recycling pool size. Protein kinase C decreases surface GAT1 expression by increasing the endocytosis rate, but it does not change the exocytosis rate or the recycling pool size. Based upon estimates of GAT1 molecules in cortical boutons, the present data suggest that ∼1000 transporters comprise the acutely recycling pool, of which 300 are on the surface in the basal state, and five transporters insert into the plasma membrane every second. This insertion could represent the fusion of one transporter-containing vesicle. Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters rapidly traffic to and from the cell surface in neurons.

Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters, localized near neurotransmitter release sites, remove transmitter from the synaptic cleft and its vicinity (1Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Impaired transporter function, and thus abnormal transmitter levels, is implicated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (2Masliah E. Alford M. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Moechars D. Van Leuven F. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), epilepsy (3Hoogland G. Spierenburg H.A. van Veelen C.W. van Rijen P.C. van Huffelen A.C. de Graan P.N. J.

Several plasma membrane transporters are also targets of psychoactive stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. Due to their multiple physiological roles, plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters are of extensive therapeutic interest. The plasma membrane GABA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; TfR, transferrin receptor. transporter GAT1 is predominantly localized at the presynaptic terminal of GABAergic neurons and plays a major role in GABA uptake in the central nervous system. Data suggest that GAT1 can impact both tonic and phasic GABAergic transmission. For example, pharmacological blockade of GABA uptake through GAT1 prolongs the decay time of evoked GABA transmission (7Engel D. Schmitz D. Gloveli T. Frahm C. Heinemann U. Draguhn A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 643-649Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also, in GAT1-deficient mice generated by homologous recombinant gene targeting, the extracellular GABA concentration is chronically elevated due to the lack of uptake; such elevation increases tonic GABA receptor conductance and decreases phasic GABA inhibition (8Jensen K. Chiu C.S. Sokolova I. Lester H.A. Mody I. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GAT1 regulates the time course of GABAergic transmission. However, the uptake process of the transporter takes ∼100 ms, which is much longer than the time course of GABAergic transmission, suggesting that, at least in part, transporter action on neurotransmission is accomplished through binding and sequestration of released transmitter away from receptor sites (9Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to know the number of binding sites that transporters provide during neurotransmission and how that number might be regulated. Previous studies show that GAT1 rapidly traffics between the plasma membrane and intracellular locations in neurons (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular GAT1 resides on small synaptic-like vesicles that bear multiple intracellular trafficking molecules (10Deken S.L. Wang D.

However, the number of acutely recycling endogenous transporters and the kinetics of this trafficking have yet to be determined. The redistribution of transporters is subject to regulation.

Syntaxin 1A, a t-SNARE protein that interacts with GAT1, increases its plasma membrane expression (22Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibiting tyrosine kinases pharmacologically or mutating tyrosine residues on GAT1 down-regulates GAT1 function by inducing an intracellular accumulation of the transporter that is correlated with an increased internalization rate (13Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous data show more GAT1 intracellularly in the presence of PKC activators. However, it is not known whether such regulation occurs by changing the number of recycling transporter molecules and/or rates of exocytosis or endocytosis. In the present experiments, modified biotinylation assays are applied to in vitro cortical neuron cultures to directly measure the basal trafficking rates of endogenous GAT1, to estimate the number of endogenous GAT1 molecules involved in acute trafficking, and to determine how three regulators of GAT1 trafficking exert their modulatory effects. Reagents—Immunoblotting reagents and [3H]GABA were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Biotinylation reagents were obtained from Pierce. GAT1 antibody 342J was obtained from Dr. Nicholas Brecha (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Neurobasal medium and B27 supplement were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from E18 rat embryos. Briefly, the embryos were rapidly decapitated in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California. Cortices were dissected out and placed in ice-cold Earle's balanced salt solution (amount in g/liter double distilled H2O: CaCl2·2H2O, (0.294), MgCl2·6H2O (0.1), KCl (0.373), and NaCl (9.35), pH 7.4). Cortices were cut into 2-mm pieces after careful removal of meninges. The small pieces were transferred to 5 ml of warmed Earle's balanced salt solution with 100 units of papain and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Tissue was triturated using warm culture medium (Neurobasal medium, B27 supplement, 0.5 mm l-glutamine). Neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated plates to a concentration of 106 cells/60-mm dish. Approximately 1 h after plating, neurons were observed to attach to the bottom of the plate, and then the medium was changed to warm fresh medium. Neurons were fed every 3–4 days by replacing half the medium with fresh medium. CHO cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were fed every 3 days. [3H]GABA Uptake Assays—Cultured neurons were washed three times in HBSS and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in the final wash. Inhibitors or activators were then applied to the incubation HBSS buffer for 10–30 min and removed before [3H]GABA was applied. The concentration of [3H]GABA was 30 nm, which was added to unlabeled GABA to obtain the desired final GABA concentration. The 15-min reaction was terminated by quickly washing the cells three times with HBSS. Cells were lysed in 0.005% SDS and divided in half. One half was used for measuring protein concentration, and the other half was used to determine amounts of [3H]GABA uptake. Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously (13Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To assess the surface expression level of GAT1, neurons were incubated in HBSS containing 1 mg/ml biotin on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. Excess biotin was removed by rapid washing twice in HBSS. The reaction was quenched for 15 min on ice with 100 mm glycine dissoved in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+. The cells were lysed with 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 10 ml) on ice for 60 min, shaking vigorously. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris; 50 μl of supernatant was saved as the total GAT1 fraction (T), whereas the rest of the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of avidin-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min on a rotating platform. The remainder of the procedure followed standard Western blotting protocols. To ensure that biotin was only labeling surface proteins, the integrity of the cell membrane during biotinylation was tested in each experiment by immunoblotting with an anti-actin antibody. In all experiments, actin immunoreactivity was not detected in the biotinylated sample, even though abundant actin immunoreactivity was detected in the whole cell lysate. To label GAT1 that was continuously inserted into the plasma membrane, neurons were incubated in HBSS containing 1 mg/ml biotin at 37 °C. The remaining steps of the procedure were as described above. To calculate the kinetic parameters of GAT1 trafficking, total biotinylated transporter levels were measured (Tt). At each time point, the amount of transporter inserted into the plasma membrane, Exo(t), was calculated as ΔTt –0 = Tt–T0, of which both Tt and T0 were measured directly. The time course of GAT1 exocytosis was well described by a single exponential, Tt = T0 + A (1–e (–t/τ)). In reversible biotinylation assays, a cleavable form of biotin (NHS-SS-biotin) was used. First, neurons were surface biotinylated at 4 °C for 30 min. Excess biotin molecules were removed, and the neurons were immediately warmed to 37 °C in the presence of biotin for various time periods before the cells were chilled again in ice-cold HBSS. Biotin cleavage was performed using glutathione (50 mm glutathione in 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA containing 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), which was applied to the cells for 15 min and then replaced with fresh glutathione and incubated for an additional 15 min. Reducing reagent was quenched by two 5-min incubations with iodoacetamide. The cleavage efficiency (>95% in all experiments) and binding specificity were determined for each batch of NHS-SS-biotin, avidin-agarose beads, and glutathione using a sample that was subject to glutathione treatment without allowing internalization (i.e. the sample was kept on ice throughout the experiment). To prevent the degradation of internalized GAT1, all cultures were pretreated with 100 μg/ml leupeptin for 1 h and throughout the assay. The intracellular accumulation rate was obtained with the same equation used to estimate exocytosis. However, the intracellular accumulation rate represents the sum of the endocytosis and the exocytosis rate at any given time to take into account that some internalized transporters are re-inserted into the plasma membrane during the time course of the assay; that is, 1/τendo = 1/τintra accumulation + 1/τexo. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. Two-sample comparisons were made using t tests; multiple comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test. The Acutely Recycling Pool of GAT1—Neurotransmitter-releasing vesicles can be categorized into readily releasable pools and reserve pools, based on their distinct trafficking kinetics. It is known that intracellular GAT1 molecules also reside on small synaptic-like vesicles. However, whether GAT1 trafficking has such heterogeneity or what might be the proportion of transporters involved in acute recycling is unknown. To estimate the acutely recycling pool size, we used modified biotinylation assays. First, to ensure that we could accurately assess the trafficking of GAT1, we verified the approach using the transferrin receptor (TfR). The subcellular trafficking of TfR has been extensively characterized using radioactive ligand binding (30van Renswoude J. Bridges K.R. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), radioactive substrate accumulation (30van Renswoude J. Bridges K.R. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibody binding (31Jefferies W.A. Brandon M.R. Williams A.F. Hunt S.V. Immunology. 1985; 54: 333-341PubMed Google Scholar). In these prior studies, 17–25% of total TfR was inserted into the surface of isolated fat cells during a 40-min incubation at 22 °C. We applied extracellular biotin to dissociated cortical neuron cultures under comparable conditions. The biotin would thus label all proteins present on the plasma membrane at the beginning of the assay, as well as those that had trafficked to the plasma membrane during the assay. Subsequently, biotinylated and unbiotinylated fractions were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-TfR antibody. Approximately 20% of total cellular TfR was found in the biotinylated (surface) fraction, comparable with previous estimates (Fig. 1A). This result suggested that biotinylation assays were providing an accurate assessment of the amount of protein resident upon and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Using this biotinylation approach, we then estimated the size of the acutely recycling pool for GAT1 when the neurons were in the basal state, compared with the total amount of cellular GAT1 (Fig. 1A). Extracellular biotin was incubated with cortical neurons at 37 °C for 30 min. To compare biotinylated GAT1 to total GAT1, 0.1 volume of whole cell lysate (T) and 0.5 volume of biotinylated fraction (B) were immunoblotted with anti-GAT1 antibody and quantified. Based upon 19 separate experiments, in the basal state, 31 ± 3% of total cellular GAT1 was found to visit the cell surface within a 30-min period. To confirm that we had reached a plateau in the time course of GAT1 recycling, we performed several experiments for 60 min. Extending the recycling time did not reveal further increases in biotinylated GAT1, indicating that all the transporters that could be labeled in 60 min were already labeled within the first 30 min (Fig. 1B). These data show that, in the basal state, approximately two-thirds of total cellular GAT1 does not acutely traffic to the plasma membrane. However, it was possible that the biotin had reached its labeling capacity and thus failed to label all the recycling transporters. Three lines of evidence suggested that the result was not due to the saturation of biotin: first, higher concentrations of biotin (2 mg/ml) did not result in additional biotinylation (data not shown); second, all the transporters were able to be labeled when biotin was applied to permeabilized neurons; and third, parallel samples showed additional biotinylation of TfRs after 30 min (Fig. 1B). Thus we conclude that only one-third of total cellular GAT1 acutely traffics to the plasma membrane. We refer to this one-third as the “GAT1 acutely recycling pool.” Exocytosis Rate of the Acutely Recycling Pool—The next question we addressed was how fast the GAT1 recycling pool traffics to the plasma membrane in the basal state. Because GAT1 accumulation on the plasma membrane saturated within 30 min, five points within that time frame (0, 2, 5, 15, and 30 min) were chosen to assess the GAT1 exocytosis rate (Fig. 2). The biotinylated fraction at each time point represented the amount of GAT1 resident on the plasma membrane at the start of the assay and the amount that visited the plasma membrane during the assay time. A significant increase in biotinylated GAT1 was observed within 2 min. Within 15 min, the amount of biotinylated GAT1 reached a plateau. Using the equation described under “Materials and Methods,” the time constant τ was estimated to be 1.6 ± 0.4 min, thus yielding an exocytosis rate, rexo, of 0.7 ± 0.2 min–1. These data suggest that on average, in the basal state, 22% of acutely recycling GAT1 molecules are inserted into the plasma membrane every minute. Endocytosis Rate of the Acutely Recycling Pool—Direct estimation of endocytosis by biotinylation is problematic because some internalized protein is returning to the plasma membrane during the assay, and thus the endocytosis rate will be underestimated. To avoid such technical complications, we indirectly estimated endocytosis by measuring the combined effect of endocytosis and exocytosis, followed by subtraction of exocytosis. To do this, surface transporters were labeled by biotin and permitted to internalize for a given time (0, 2, 5, 15, and 30 min). The surface biotin was removed at the end of the time course by introducing a reducing agent extracellularly. The biotinylated GAT1 was then measured, which represents an intracellular accumulation of biotin-labeled GAT1 molecules. However, this measurement underestimates the true amount of endocytosis because a portion of the internalized biotin-GAT1 molecules subsequently returned to the plasma membrane and was subjected to the reducing agent. Thus, the amount of biotinylated GAT1 is the sum of true GAT1 endocytosis and subsequent GAT1 exocytosis. By measuring the rate of accumulation of biotinylated GAT1 and knowing the rate of GAT1 exocytosis, we solved for the rate of GAT1 endocytosis. The same approach has been used to estimate the endocytosis rate of synaptic vesicles (32Fernandez-Alfonso T. Ryan T.A. Neuron. 2004; 41: 943-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, a significant accumulation was observed 5 min after the internalization assay commenced. A plateau was reached within 15 min, in which ∼70% of surface GAT1 accumulated intracellularly; 30% of surface-labeled GAT1 thus represented transporters that did not internalize or were degraded or stripped of biotin after re-appearing on the plasma membrane. The data were fit by a single exponential function in which the rate constant rendo-exo was calculated as 0.25 ± 0.1 min–1. We then calculated the endocytosis rate (rendo = rendo-exo + rexo) and time constant as τendo = 1/rendo. This yielded an endocytosis rate (rendo) of 1.1 ± 0.2 min–1 and a time constant (τendo) of 0.9 ± 0.2 min. Thus, the endocytosis rate exceeded that of exocytosis by ∼1.8-fold (1.6 min for exocytosis versus 0.9 min for endocytosis). We found that about one-third of acutely recycling GAT1 was found on the cell surface in the basal state (see Fig. 1); therefore, [GAT1intra]/[GAT1surface] = 2, which should be equivalent to rendo/rexo in the basal state. This ratio is in reasonable agreement with what we measured (1.6/0.9 = 1.8-fold). The Acutely Recycling Pool Size Is Regulated by Extracellular Ca2+, but Not by PKC Activators or Hypertonic Media—Multiple modulators regulate surface GAT1 expression. This could be due to either changing the size of the acutely recycling pool or altering the rates of exocytosis or endocytosis. We tested three known GAT1 trafficking modulators for their effect on the acutely recycling pool size: (i) PKC, a serine/threonine phosphorylation enzyme that decreases surface GAT1 expression (27Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) sucrose, which in part causes abnormal polymerization of clathrin and results in accumulation of GAT1 on the plasma membrane when applied to dissociated neuron cultures (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) extracellular Ca2+, depletion of which results in reduced GAT1 surface expression (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of PKC on the recycling pool size, 1 μm PMA was applied to dissociated cortical neurons for 10 min before and during biotin incubation (30 min at 37 °C). PMA decreased GAT1 surface expression by 2-fold as indicated by surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 4A); this replicated our previous findings (27Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the pool size was not significantly changed compared with neurons without PMA treatment or compared with neurons treated with an inactive analogue of PMA, 4α-phorbol didecanoate (34 ± 4%, 35 ± 6%, and 35 ± 5%, respectively) (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that PMA decreases GAT1 surface expression without changing the recycling pool size. We have shown previously that hypertonic medium containing sucrose inhibits internalization of GAT1 in a concentration-dependent manner (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We applied sucrose to dissociated neuron cultures at a saturating concentration (0.45 m) 5 min before and during biotin incubation (30 min at 37 °C). The treatment significantly increased [3H]GABA uptake measured in parallel control cultures by 1.5-fold (Fig. 4C), which is consistent with our previous findings (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with PKC, the pool size measurement did not show significant differences between control neurons and neurons treated with 0.45 m sucrose (31 ± 5% and 32 ± 6%, respectively) (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that sucrose treatment can increase surface expression of GAT1 without changing the size of the GAT1 acutely recycling pool. We and others previously reported that the recycling of internalized neurotransmitter transporters is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ (10Deken S.L. Wang D. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism underlying this effect is not yet clear. [3H]GABA uptake in Ca2+-free HBSS indicated a decrease in uptake to ∼60% (Fig. 4E). To test whether Ca2+ depletion had an effect on the recycling pool size, neurons were incubated in Ca2+-free HBSS during the 30-min assay. As shown in Fig. 4F, biotinylated GAT1 was decreased by approximately one-half in Ca2+-free HBSS when compared with the neurons in regular HBSS (1.2 mm Ca2+). That is, the recycling pool size was decreased to 14 ± 3% of total cellular GAT1. No further biotinylated GAT1 was detected by extending the incubation time up to 60 min (data not shown). To ensure that these calcium-dependent results were not due to nonspecific effects (e.g. on cell viability), we repeated these experiments using the transferrin receptor. TfR trafficking was unaffected by the absence of calcium (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that calcium exerts its effects on GAT1 trafficking at least in part by changing the recycling pool size. PKC-mediated Decreases in GAT1 Surface Expression Are due to an Increased Endocytosis Rate—In dissociated cortical neuron cultures, PKC activation by PMA decreased GABA uptake, which was correlated to a decrease in GAT1 surface expression levels; however, PMA did not alter the GAT1 recycling pool size (see Fig. 4B). Thus, we examined GAT1 exocytosis and endocytosis rates in cultures treated with PMA. No significant effect of PKC activation was detected on the exocytosis kinetics of GAT"

Conversely, hypertrophic agents induce expression of these genes. The goal of this study was to employ genomic approaches to identify classes of genes differentially regulated by PDGF and hypertrophic stimuli. Changes in gene expression were determined using Affymetrix RAE-230 GeneChips in rat aortic VSMC stimulated with PDGF. For comparison with a model hypertrophic stimulus, a microarray was performed with VSMC stably expressing constitutively active Gα16, which strongly induces smooth muscle marker expression. We identified 75 genes whose expression was increased by exposure to PDGF and decreased by expression of Gα16 and 97 genes whose expression was decreased by PDGF and increased by Gα16. These genes included many smooth muscle-specific proteins; several extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, and chemotaxis-related proteins; cell signaling molecules; and transcription factors. Changes in gene expression for many of these were confirmed by PCR or immunoblotting. The contribution of signaling pathways activated by PDGF to the gene expression profile was examined in VSMC stably expressing gain-of-function H-Ras or myristoylated Akt. Among the genes that were confirmed to be differentially regulated were CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ, versican, and nexilin. All of these genes also had altered expression in injured aortas, consistent with a role for PDGF in the response of injured VSMC.

Cary N.R. Shanahan C.M. Blood Press Suppl. 1995; 2: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to skeletal and cardiac myocytes, VSMC do not terminally differentiate, and they undergo phenotypic modulation in vivo and in vitro in response to environmental signals (2Chamley-Champbell J. Campbell G.R. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 40: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This process involves changes in gene expression, which convert these cells from a nonproliferative contractile phenotype to a proliferating synthetic one (2Chamley-Champbell J. Campbell G.R. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 40: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 3Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Sobue K.

Indeed, a well defined characteristic of vascular occlusive disease, arterial interventions in response to disease, and in vitro subculturing of SMC is the phenotypic modulation of SMC from a normally quiescent, contractile state to one of increased growth, migration, and matrix synthesis. Formation of neointima after vascular injury is largely a consequence of dedifferentiation, proliferation, and migration of medial SMC (6Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4567) Google Scholar, 7Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). During injury to the blood vessels, PDGF assists this process by triggering phenotypic changes in VSMC, which are presumably mediated through changes in patterns of gene expression (8Raines E.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In cultured VSMC, PDGF increases cell proliferation (9Owens G.K. Wise G. Agents Actions Suppl. 1997; 48: 3-24PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin (AVP) and angiotensin II promote increased contractility and induce hypertrophy (10Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ.

Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that these two classes of agents have opposing effects on expression of smooth muscle markers (SM markers), specifically contractile proteins such as smooth muscle α-actin and SM22α (13Van Putten V.

The effects on SMC gene expression are mediated through distinct postreceptor signaling pathways. PDGF-induced suppression is mediated through activation of Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A.

However, the phenotypic changes mediated by these agents are probably not exclusively mediated through changes in expression of contractile proteins but will instead be a consequence of more global changes in gene expression. Dedifferentiated VSMC have increased production of matrix proteins and metalloproteinases, which are critical for their proliferative and migratory properties (17Evanko S.P. Wight T.N. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Hou G. Vogel W.F. Bendeck M.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally, changes in the local environment of the cells or cell-matrix interactions can affect the phenotypic state of VSMC (19Franco C.D. Hou G. Bendeck M.P. Trends Cardiovasc.

With the advent of microarray technology, it is feasible to assess global changes in gene expression to begin to define the repertoire of proteins regulating SMC phenotype. For example, gene array analysis has been used to identify changes in gene expression in angiotensin II-stimulated SMC in the presence and absence of inhibitors of signaling pathways (21Campos A.H. Zhao Y. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), between the aorta and vena cava (22Adams L.D. Geary R.L. McManus B. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in mechanically stimulated SMC (23Lee R.T. Yamamoto C. Feng Y. Potter-Perigo S. Briggs W.H. Landschulz K.T. Turi T.G. Thompson J.F.

Schwartz S.M. Adams L.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 2010-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a comprehensive analysis of changes in gene expression induced by hypertrophic stimuli compared with PDGF has yet to be investigated. The goal of this study, therefore, was to use microarray analysis to define subsets of genes that are regulated in opposing directions by PDGF compared with hypertrophic stimuli. By using cell lines stably expressing constitutively active forms of either H-Ras or Akt, downstream effectors of PDGF signaling, we were able to dissect out the contributions of these individual pathways to the regulation of specific genes. We report here a novel set of genes, which are involved in modulation of SMC phenotype during balloon injury. Materials—Trypsin/EDTA and Eagle's minimal essential medium were from Invitrogen. Antibodies to C/EBPδ, GKLF, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled IgGs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody to heme oxygenase-1 was from StressGen Biotech, antibody to nexilin was from BD Biosciences, antibody to Ezrin was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Cell Culture and Stable Transfections—Rat aortic VSMC were isolated and cultured as previously described in detail (25Caramelo C. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells (passages 4–12) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1 mm l-glutamine, 2 g/liter NaHCO3, 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere.

Cells expressing myristoylated Akt, H-Ras, or Gα16 were selected by culturing them in medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). Individual clones were screened by immunoblotting with corresponding antibodies. Affymetrix Microarray Analysis—VSMC stimulated with AVP or PDGF for 6 or 24 h and VSMC stably expressing H-Ras (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A.

Labeling of the probes for microarray was performed as described previously (27Han S.Y. Kim S.H. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47167-47174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized by using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. In vitro transcription of labeled cRNA was performed from purified cDNA using a Bioarray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics) in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP. Labeled cRNA was purified and then fragmented using fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 10 mm KOAc, 30 mm MgOAc). Hybridization of the probes to the Affymetrix RAE-230 rat Genechip was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Microarray Core Facility. DNA chips were scanned (6-μm resolution) with an HP Gene Array scanner, and results were analyzed with GeneChip Suite 4.0 analysis software from Affymetrix and Genespring software from Silicon Genetics. Transient Transfection—For transient transfections measuring promoter activity, plasmid encoding 765 bp of the rat SM-α-actin promoter ligated into a promoterless luciferase vector (PA3-Luc) (13Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used. VSMC were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) in 35-mm dishes using 1 μg of the SM-α-actin promoter-luciferase construct together with 1 μg of a plasmid encoding cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector (Clontech) for normalization of transfection efficiency. The transfections also included 0.5 μg of other plasmids (C/EBPδ, or empty vector). The plasmid encoding C/EBPδ is a generous gift of Steven L. McKnight from University of Texas South Western Medical Center (Dallas, TX). Cells were incubated for 16 h in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum and then placed in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 0.2% fetal calf serum with or without agonists for 72 h. The transiently transfected VSMC were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as previously described (16Garat C. Van Putten V. Refaat Z.A. Dessev C. Han S.Y.

Immunoblotting—VSMC were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA 200 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 10 min. Supernatants were separated using 7.5, 10, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 5% milk and then incubating with 5% milk in TTBS solution containing primary antibodies 12–16 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in TTBS, and bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and Lumi-Phos WB™ (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from control VSMC or cells stimulated with AVP or PDGF-BB for 24 or 6 h and VSMC stably expressing H-Ras (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F.

First strand cDNA was made by using the Omniscript RT™ kit (Qiagen). Sequence-specific primers for the gene of interest were selected by using Beacon Designer 2.0 software (Bio-Rad) and purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Primers were as follows: for COL10α1, sense (5′-tactgcgttgctgacataagag) and antisense (5′-ggcaggaagtccacgtacc); for GRO, sense (5′-tgtcaaccactgtgctagaagg) and antisense (5′-tagcctctcacacattcctcac); for versican, sense (5′-ttacggctggctgtcggatg) and antisense (5′-atcagggagagggaagcatgtc). Quantitative real time PCR was performed by using the QuantiTect SYBER Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and an iCycler apparatus (Bio-Rad). Tagman Ribosomal RNA with a VIC probe (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) kit was used for normalization of the cDNA for the PCRs. Immunofluorescense—Adult thoracic aortas from sham-injured or 7-day and 4-week post-balloon catheter injured animals were collected and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned as described previously (28Mourani P.M. Garl P.J. Wenzlau J.M. Carpenter T.C. Stenmark K.R. Weiser-Evans M.C. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and were immunostained with specific antibodies per the manufacturers' recommendations. Prior to labeling with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, tissue sections were deparrafinized and then heated for 20 min at 105 °C in a decloaking chamber (Biocare) for antigen retrieval and then blocked with 5% goat serum for 45 min. Following incubations with primary antibodies for C/EBPδ (1:50), versican (1:10), and nexilin (1:10), antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using rhodamine (Alexa Fluor-568)-coupled or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Alexa Fluor-488)-coupled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Some sections were double-labeled with anti-SM α-actin. Coverslips were mounted with VectaShield medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and cells were visualized using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with Metamorf software. Changes in Gene Expression Induced by PDGF in Rat VSMC—The goals of this study were to compare the effects of PDGF and hypertrophic stimuli on patterns of gene expression in VSMC. Microarray analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the Affymetrix Rat RAE-230 GeneChip. The RAE-230 GeneChip contains 31099 genes and expressed sequence tags; the first of the two chips were used for the experiments presented here. Each experiment was done in duplicate and compared with its control. Our criteria for changes in gene expression were either a p value of 0.0001 or a 2-fold change in value, and concordance of 4 of 4 comparisons. VSMC were stimulated with PDGF-BB for 6 or 24 h, and gene expression was compared with control cells incubated for the same length of time in media containing 0.2% fetal calf serum. Stimulation with PDGF increased 215 (p < 0.0001) or 81 (2-fold) genes at 6 h and 56 (p < 0.0001) or 48 (2-fold) genes at 24 h compared with the appropriate control. Among these genes, only four were increased at both time points, whereas 17 (p < 0.0001) or 2 (2-fold) of the genes increased at 6 h, were down-regulated at 24 h of PDGF stimulation. In contrast, PDGF stimulation decreased 284 (p < 0.0001) or 106 (2-fold) genes at 6 h and 143 (p < 0.0001) or 44 genes (2-fold) genes after 24-h stimulation. 27 (p < 0.0001) or 10 (2-fold) of these were common to both time points, whereas only 7 (p < 0.0001) or 2 (2-fold) of the genes decreased at 6 h were up-regulated after 24 h stimulation with PDGF (see Supplementary Tables A and B). Our laboratory previously showed that PDGF-BB-mediated suppression of SM-specific gene expression is partly mediated by activation of both the H-Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Kaplan-Albuquerque N. Garat C. Desseva C. Jones P.L. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39830-39838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of these pathways to the changes in the global gene expression profile induced by PDGF, we compared the increases and decreases induced by PDGF stimulation to the changes seen in VSMC stably expressing H-Ras (14Li X. Van Putten V. Zarinetchi F. Nicks M.E. Thaler S. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or constitutively active Myr-Akt (15Kaplan-Albuquerque N. Garat C. Desseva C. Jones P.L. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39830-39838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (see Supplementary Tables A and B). In general, VSMC constitutively expressing H-Ras had similar changes as the ones stimulated with PDGF for 6 h. On the other hand, VSMC constitutively expressing Myr-Akt had the gene expression profile similar to the cells expressing PDGF for 24 h. Changes in Gene Expression Induced by Hypertrophic Stimuli—We have previously demonstrated that AVP signaling in VSMC is mediated through coupling of the V1 receptor to Gq, a member of the family of trimeric G proteins. This was assessed by transfection of constitutively active G-proteins, in which the intrinsic GTPase activity has been abolished by a point mutation. Since the constitutively active form of Gαq (αqQ209L) was cytotoxic in VSMC, expression of another member of the Gq family, Gα16 (α16Q212L) was used instead (12Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V. Yamamura Y. Zarinetchi F. Heasley L. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25845-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Stable expression of Gα16 in VSMC gives a stronger, more consistent hypertrophic response compared with VSMC exposed to vasoconstrictors such as AVP (12Higashita R. Li L. Van Putten V. Yamamura Y. Zarinetchi F. Heasley L. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25845-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of PDGF and its downstream signaling pathways with changes in gene expression induced by hypertrophic stimuli, we examined VSMC stimulated with AVP for 6 or 24 h, and VSMC stably expressing constitutively active Gα16 (Gα16Q212L). Similar to the study by Campos et al. (21Campos A.H. Zhao Y. Pollman M.J. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with angiotensin II, VSMC stimulated with AVP for either 6 or 24 h induced minimal changes in gene expression. AVP stimulation increased 11 (p < 0.0001; 3 of 4) or 3 (2-fold; 3 of 4) of the genes that were decreased by 24-h PDGF stimulation. However, of the genes increased by PDGF, only two (p < 0.0001; 3 of 4) were decreased by AVP. Whereas expression of Gα16 caused large scale changes in gene expression, we sought to focus on genes that were differentially regulated by Gα16 compared with PDGF. Tables I and II are lists of genes, regulated in opposing directions by PDGF at either time point compared with Gα16. We identified 75 genes whose expression was increased by PDGF at either time point and decreased by expression of Gα16 (Table I) as well as 97 genes whose expression was decreased by PDGF at either time point and increased by expression of Gα16 (Table II).Table IGenes differentially regulated by exposure to PDGF and expression of G16Q212L: Genes that are increased with PDGF and decreased with Gα16 (75 genes)GenBank™NameDescriptionAA892254Superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2)AA894279Add3Adducin 3, γAB000199Cca2CCA2 proteinAF053312Scya20Small inducible cytokine subfamily A20AF072892Cspg2Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2 (versican)AF202115CpCeruloplasminAF245172GdaGuanine deaminaseAF321837Rgs2AY043246Regulator of G-protein signaling protein 2AF411318Mt1aMetallothioneinAI011713ESTs, moderately similar to I60307 β-galactosidase, α peptideAI171788ESTsAI176126ESTs, weakly similar to S23094 β-amyloid protein precursor, similar to mouse procollagen type VI, α 3AI235503ESTsAI411366ESTs, weakly similar to mouse inward rectifier potassium channel 16AI548856Tage4Tumor-associated glycoprotein pE4AJ243974BM1partial mRNA for BM1k MHC class Ib antigen, strain SHRAW531909ESTs, weakly similar to human fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 2AY082609Pgy1P-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance 1BE113700Prx2ESTs, highly similar to PRX-2, weakly similar to PMX1_MOUSE paired mesoderm homeobox protein 1 (PRX-1)BE120953LOC368009ESTs, weakly similar to T46612 multi-PDZ domain protein 1-ratBF281299Odc1Ornitine decarboxylaseBF285344ESTs, highly similar to cardiac abnormality/abnormal facies (CATCH22), microdeletion syndromeBF289368LbpLipopolysaccharide-binding proteinBF400209ESTs, highly similar to hypothetical protein MGC13017BF417784ESTsBF419200CebpdC/EBPδBG374178ESTs, similar to mouse mast cell growth factor scf mRNA for stem cell factor KL-2BG375352ESTs, weakly similar to CAH5_RAT carbonic anhydrase VA (carbonate dehydratase VA)BG378265SdnsfStem cell-derived neuronal survival protein precursorBI275294Glu1Glutamine synthetase (glutamate-ammonia ligase)BI279680ESTs, weakly similar to PCO1_RAT procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein precursor (type I procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase enhancer) (type 1 procollagen C-proteinase enhancer protein)BI284599ESTs, Highly similar to 0812252A tubulin αBI285902ESTs, similar to hypothetical protein DIIErtd497eBI290559Mgst2ESTs, similar to mouse glutathione S-transferase 2, weakly similar to leukotriene C4 synthaseBI292028GdaESTs, similar to mouse guanine deaminaseBI292558ESTs, highly similar to A57501 uridine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.3) IBI296385ESTs, similar to CDK104BI303340ESTs, weakly similar to mouse lysyl oxidase-like 4BI303596ESTs, similar to mouse elastin microfibril interfacer-1; weakly similar to 1917150A collagen:SUBUNIT = α1: ISOTYPE = VIIIBM383531Mt2ESTs, highly similar to MT2_RAT METALLOTHIONEIN-II (MT-II)BM389254ESTs, similar to mouse annexin A8BM390600ESTs, similar to ATPase, vacuolar proton pumpNM_012580Hmox1Heme oxygenaseNM_012733Rbp1retinol-binding protein 1NM_012792Fmo1Flavin-containing monooxygenase 1NM_012935CryabCrystallin, α polypeptide 2NM_012953Fosl1Fos-like antigen 1NM_013034Slc6a4Solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin), member 4NM_013151PlatPlasminogen activator, tissueNM_016994C3Complement component 3NM_017074CthCTL target antigenNM_017154XdhXanthine dehydrogenaseNM_017172Zfp36l1Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1NM_021909Fxyd5FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 5NM_022182Fgf7Fibroblast growth factor 7NM_024127Gadd45aGrowth ar"

Although accumulation of polyols such as xylitol and sorbitol is associated with MI depletion in diabetic complications, no causal relationship has been established. Therefore we are examining the role of MIOX in diabetic nephropathy. Here we present evidence that the basis for the depletion of MI in diabetes is likely to be mediated by the increased expression of MIOX, which is induced by sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol in a porcine renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1. To understand the molecular mechanism of regulation of MIOX expression by polyols, we have cloned the human MIOX gene locus of 10 kb containing 5.6 kb of the 5′ upstream sequence. Analysis of the 5′ upstream sequence led to the identification of an osmotic response element (ORE) in the promoter region, which is present ∼2 kb upstream of the translation start site. Based on luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, polyols increased the ORE-dependent expression of MIOX. In addition, we demonstrate that the activity of the promoter is dependent on the binding of the transcription factor, tonicity element-binding protein, or osmotic response element-binding protein, to the ORE site. These results suggest that the expression of MIOX is up-regulated by a positive feedback mechanism where xylitol, one of the products of MI catabolism via the glucuronate-xylulose pathway, induces an overexpression of MIOX. myo-Inositol oxygenase (MIOX) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of myo-inositol (MI) to give d-glucuronic acid, a committed step in MI catabolism. d-Glucuronic acid is further metabolized to xylitol via the glucuronate-xylulose pathway.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1986; 6: 563-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first committed step in MI metabolism is catalyzed by the monooxygenase, myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX; EC 1.13.99.1), which occurs predominantly in the proximal tubular epithelial cells of the kidney cortex (2Arner R.J. Prabhu K.S. Thompson J.T. Hildenbrandt G.R. Liken A.D. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction involves the oxidative cleavage of the ring in MI between C-6 and C-1 to give d-glucuronic acid. These d-glucuronate formed in animals by this mechanism is successively converted in subsequent steps to l-gluonate, 3-keto-l-gulonate, l-xylulose, xylitol, d-xylulose, and d-xylulose 5-phosphate, which then enters the pentose phosphate cycle (Fig. 1). Studies in human pentosuric patients confirmed that this is the only pathway of MI catabolism (3Hankes L.V. Politzer W.M. Touster O. Anderson L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 165: 564-576PubMed Google Scholar).

In diabetic complications, increased glucose levels are associated with high sorbitol accumulation in the kidney, retina, nerve, and lens, which is then followed by depletion of MI (5Raccah D.

Aldose reductase (ALR2) has been proposed to participate in the polyol pathway by catalyzing the reduction of glucose to sorbitol in a NADPH-dependent manner (10Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Most of the effort to treat diabetic complications has been centered on the correction of increased polyol sugars with the use of ALR2 inhibitors, like Sorbinil®, as potential drugs for the treatment of diabetics. Whereas the correction of MI depletion also presents a promising approach to amelioration of diabetic complications, the mechanisms of depletion remains unidentified. Little is known about the regulation of MIOX levels in tissues during diabetic conditions, which might be in part because of the paucity of any genomic information as well as the lack of availability of cDNA and antibody probes for MIOX. myo-Inositol treatment has been shown to have a beneficial effect in restoring the impaired motor nerve conduction velocity and disruption of structural elements in the nerve as a result of increased nerve cluster density (6Cohen A.M.

Supplementation of MI is also known to restore the reduction in the turnover of phosphate groups in phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (12Berti-Mattera L. Day N. Peterson R.G.

To our knowledge, there is no report in the literature that links MIOX with diabetes-associated metabolic derangements.Depletion of tissue MI and accumulation of sorbitol and xylitol seems to be a common feature observed in most of the pathologies associated with diabetes; however, the mechanism of depletion of MI in diabetes remains largely unknown. Our studies reported here are based on the hypothesis that in the kidney cortex, osmotic gradients of metabolites, including polyols, lead to the activation of MIOX expression. It is well established that the expression of several renal-specific genes is under the influence of osmotic stress, via a plethora of cellular signaling events, including the protein kinase pathways and transcription factors (13Ko B.C.

The signaling cascade activated by hyperosmolar stress leads to the activation of osmotic response element-binding protein (OREBP), which shares significant homology with the tonicity-responsive element-binding protein (TonEBP), a transcription factor that belongs to the Rel family, which also includes nuclear factor-κB and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) (15Irarrazabal C.E.

We present evidence that the human MIOX promoter constructs are activated in tubular epithelial cells and that the region of activation maps to an ORE-like sequence in the distal promoter. This is the binding site for OREBP/TonEBP, a key regulator of gene expression that has been shown to directly regulate such genes as ALR2 (16Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Ohtaka A. Garcia-Perez A. Am.

Also, we demonstrate that deletion of this sequence renders MIOX promoter constructs non-responsive to physiologically relevant polyols. Thus, the induction of MIOX by hyperosmolar stress could represent an important regulatory mechanism during hyperglycemia.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of hMIOX Gene—The PAC clone (RPCI 579N16) from chromosome 22q13.33, purchased from the BACPAC Resource Center, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA, was used to clone the 10-kb hMIOX locus. The miniprep method for isolating the PAC DNA was used as described by the supplier and scaled up for preparative restriction digestions. The PAC clone was digested with NotI and a 30-kb fragment was separated using pulse-field gel electrophoresis for 14 h at 8 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer. The 30-kb DNA fragment was electroeluted from the gel, dialyzed against 0.5 × TE buffer, and digested with SnaBI and HpaI. The 10-kb fragment released from the 30-kb double digest was rescued into a pGL3 Basic vector (Promega) blunted with SmaI. Clones were screened by PCR analysis and confirmed by restriction digestion with KpnI and BglII that dropped the entire 10-kb insert followed by Southern blot analysis.Southern Blot Analysis—The DNA digests were run on a 1% agarose gel and blotted to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences) by vacuum transfer. Where required, we used pulse-field gel electrophoresis to resolve the DNA bands as mentioned earlier. The membrane was cross-linked in an UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was subjected to overnight hybridization at 55 °C using a hMIOX open reading frame cDNA probe. The cDNA was labeled using a biotin random prime labeling kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemical Co). The blot was developed using the North-2-South kit (Pierce) and was visualized using chemiluminescence.Plasmids—The 10-kb hMIOXpGL3 construct was used as a template to amplify a 2.6-kb 5′ upstream region from +52 (exon 1) of hMIOX. Restriction sites, KpnI and NcoI, were appended to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, by PCR using pfx polymerase and the amplimer was cloned into pGL3 basic vector (termed 2.6hMIOXLuc). A deletion mutant lacking the putative ORE, situated at –2017, was prepared by forced amplification using the primer that contained a KpnI restriction site as described above (termed 1.9hMIOXLuc). The positive clones were confirmed by sequencing analysis. The pSV-Gal plasmid (Promega), used as a transfection control, contains the GAL gene directed by the early promoter and enhancer of simian virus 40 (SV40).Cell Culture—Porcine renal proximal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes in a final volume of 5 ml of medium 199 (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin (20 units/ml), streptomycin (20 μg/ml), 50 μm MI, and 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Confluent cultures (∼90%) were treated with the indicated concentrations of polyols for 24 h following transient transfection with different MIOX/Luc constructs.Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Transfection of MIOX/Luc constructs into LLC-PK1 cells was performed by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six micrograms of MIOX/Luc plasmids and 2 μg of pSV-GAL control vector were transfected when cells were ∼90% confluent in 100-mm plastic dishes (Falcon). The medium containing the liposome-DNA complex was removed 12 h post-transfection and replaced with medium containing one of the following polyols: mannitol (75 mm), xylitol (5 mm), and sorbitol (50 mm) and sugars: glucose (27 mm) and xylose (5 mm). Cells were harvested 24 h later and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and Galacto-star chemiluminescent kit from Applied Biosystems, respectively, as per the instructions of the suppliers. A Turner/Veritas plate luminometer was used to measure the luminescence. All values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and total protein as determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Immunoflourescence Localization—The LLC-PK1 cells were cultured on 4-chamber glass slides for 24 h with 50 mm sorbitol or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fixed using ice-cold methanol and washed in PBS with 0.3% Tween 20 (PBST). Blocking was performed with goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h on a slow end-to-end rocker and incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-NFAT5 antibody (1:500, Affinity Bioreagents) at 4 °C. The slides were washed with PBST three times and incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (1:1000). The slides were covered with VectaShield® (Vector Labs) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole followed by imaging analysis.Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts for Western Blot Analysis—The cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared from LLC-PK1 cells subjected to different treatments using lysis buffer that contained 10 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.075% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine. The cells were treated with lysis buffer for 15 min and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 4 min to separate the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. The pellet was washed with the lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, salt concentration of the nuclear extraction buffer was adjusted to 400 mm, and nuclear proteins were extracted. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for BCA protein estimation, Western immunoblot, and electrophoretic gel shift analysis. For Western immunoblot analysis, cell lysates were denatured and run on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel (T = 12.5%). The bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in an electroblotter (at 3 mA/cm2). The membrane was incubated with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% milk for 1 h following incubation with the primary antibody for 2 h (anti-MIOX; 1:50,000) or overnight (anti-NFAT5; 1:1000; 4 °C). The blot was washed with TBST and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing with TBST, the blot was developed with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate solution (Pierce) and subjected to autoradiography. In the case of Western immunoblot with cytoplasmic extracts, monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies were used (1:10,000; RDI, Inc.) to normalize protein loading.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear fractions were isolated from LLC-PK1 cells cultured in the absence or presence of additives as described (21Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total nuclear protein were incubated with the hMIOX-ORE double stranded probe (5′-CCTCCTCCAGGAAAGCCTTTACCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGTAAAGGCTTTCCTGGAGGACG-3′) that was 3′ OH end-labeled with Biotin-N4-CTP by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction using LightShift® chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Unlabeled double stranded oligonucleotide was used as a competitor in the sorbitol-treated cell extracts. The binding buffer contained 12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mm dithiothreitol. For supershift assays, anti-NFAT5 (2 μg; Affinity Bioreagents) was incubated with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of biotinylated oligonucleotide for 30 min on ice. Following the addition of oligonucleotide and incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (79:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris borate, 45 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The separated oligonucleotide-protein complexes and free oligonucleotide probe were transferred onto a nylon membrane using an electroblotter in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer. The bands were visualized using chemiluminescence as described earlier.Statistical Analysis—Results are given as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of differences between treatment groups in these studies was determined by Student's t test. The minimal level of significance chosen was p < 0.05.RESULTSInduction of MIOX Expression by Hyperosmolarity—Hyperosmolarity has been shown to activate the transcription of a large number of genes, including ALR2 and SMIT in different renal cell lines (16Ferraris J.D. Williams C.K. Ohtaka A. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C667-C673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rim J.S. Atta M.G. Dahl S.C. Berry G.T. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20615-20621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have employed the porcine renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1) that expresses MIOX to test the inducibility of MIOX by hyperosmolar stress. Fig. 2 shows the changes in MIOX protein expression in LLC-PK1 cells upon exposure to medium supplemented with polyols, in this case, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. The induction of MIOX expression was compared with the control cells that only received PBS. The LLC-PK1 cells treated with mannitol, sorbitol, or xylitol exhibited a 5–6-fold increase in MIOX expression compared with the iso-osmotic control (Fig. 2; compare lane 1 and lanes 5–7). Addition of glucose (27 mm) and xylose (5 mm) also resulted in a 5-fold increase in the expression of MIOX (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). There was an increase in the expression of MIOX in cells maintained in hyperosmotic medium containing NaCl by ∼3-fold. These results suggest that, in the LLC-PK1 cells, the expression of the MIOX gene is regulated by hyperosmotic stress in the form of salt, polyols, and/or sugars in the medium. Furthermore, these results also validate the use of LLC-PK1 cell line as an in vitro culture system to identify the cis-acting element in the MIOX gene that is involved in osmotic regulation of transcription by polyols.Fig. 2Induction of MIOX gene by polyols and sugars. Lanes 1–7 represent LLC-PK1 cells treated with PBS (isosmotic control), NaCl (100 mm), glucose (27 mm), xylose (5 mm), mannitol (75 mm), sorbitol (50 mm), and xylitol (5 mm) for 24 h. At the end of incubation, cells were harvested and total protein was extracted using the lysis buffer and used in the Western immunoblot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The blot was washed with stripping buffer (TBS containing 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies to normalize for uniform loading. Densitometry data of the MIOX and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase bands is shown in the lower panel. The ratio of MIOX to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to calculate -fold increase with respect to the PBS-treated control. n = 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cloning and Characterization of Human MIOX 5′-Flanking Region—A human PAC clone (RPCI 574N16) digested with NotI, was used to isolate a 30-kb DNA fragment by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Southern blot analysis clearly indicated that the 30-kb fragment contained the human MIOX gene (Fig. 3A). Further digestion of the 30-kb fragment by SnaBI and HpaI produced an expected 10-kb fragment that was rescued into pGL3 Basic vector, blunt ended with SmaI (Fig. 3B). Instead of using pBeloBacII, which is commonly employed for cloning larger (>8 kb) fragments, we have chosen the pGL3 Basic vector as a cloning vector because of its high copy number and relative ease of blunt-ended cloning. The human gene for MIOX spans ∼10 kb and, based on human chromosome 22q13.33 sequence available online, MIOX consists of 10 exons and 9 introns. The 10-kb MIOX genomic DNA clone contained a sequence up to 5.6 kb upstream of the translation start (+1) site. The 5′ upstream sequence also contained a possible TATA box (TATAAT) 71 bases upstream as indicated by the examination of the sequence. Preliminary analysis of the sequence of the 5.6-kb region indicated that a putative consensus ORE was present at 2.1 kb upstream of the start site. Three clones were isolated by primary PCR screening, out of which, only one clone was confirmed to contain the MIOX gene when we used hMIOX cDNA as a probe in Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3C). The clone, 10hMIOX1, which was found to span –5.6 to +4 kb relative to the translation start site, was used to derive another clone that contained –2.6 to +52 fused in-frame to the luciferase reporter coding region in the pGL3 Basic vector (2.6hMIOXLuc). This clone was used for the functional analysis of the MIOX promoter, particularly with respect to the hyperosmotic regulation by polyols.Fig. 3Southern blot hybridization with the hMIOX probe.

A corresponding ethidium bromide (EtBr) stained gel used for the Southern blot is also shown (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To locate the ORE of the human MIOX gene, the 2.6hMIOX-Luc was transfected into porcine renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were switched to either iso-osmotic or hyperosmotic medium. After 24 h of incubation in this media, cells were harvested for luciferase, β-galactosidase, and protein assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4, transfected cells incubated in hyperosmotic medium exhibited a marked increase in luciferase activities than those incubated in iso-osmotic medium, suggesting that the 2.6-kb fragment contained an ORE. Some of the most common polyols tested to activate the transcription included mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. All three polyols led to an increase in luciferase activity by ∼3–4-fold over the iso-osmotic controls (Fig. 4, top panel). In addition, a 3–4-fold increase in luciferase activities was seen with glucose and xylose treatments (Fig. 4, top panel). Consistent with the sequence analysis for the presence of ORE in the 5′ upstream sequence, inclusion of the 5.6-kb upstream fragment did not affect the osmotically induced transcription activity (data not shown). Therefore, we only used the 2.6-kb 5′ upstream sequence for further analysis.Fig. 4Localization of ORE in the human MIOX gene 5′ upstream sequence. Top panel, the LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with the 2.6-kb hMIOX-Luc for 12 h followed by an additional incubation for 24 h in the medium containing sugars, and polyols at the following concentrations: glucose (27 mm), mannitol (75 mm), sorbitol (50 mm), xylitol (5 mm), and xylose (5 mm). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to the activity of β-galactosidase and total protein. The -fold increases in luciferase activity were calculated with respect to the empty pGL3 basic vector. Transfection assays were performed by lipofection with 6 μg of 2.6 hMIOXLuc DNA, 2 μg of pSVGal vector. Lower panel, luciferase assay results with 1.9hMIOXLuc DNA, which lacks the ORE site. Experimental conditions were identical to that mentioned earlier. All values represent the mean ± S.D. of at least four independent experiments. *, significantly higher than control (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the role of the ORE in the 2.6-kb 5′ upstream region of hMIOX gene, we prepared a deletion mutant (1.9hMI-OXLuc) that lacked the ORE. Transient transfection analysis in LLC-PK1 cells, identical to the conditions with the 2.6hMI-OXLuc, totally obliterated the osmotic response in the presence of mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results indicate that the ORE is located between –1900 and –2600 that is required for a robust osmotic response. Compared with the human gene, where only one ORE was present, the mouse gene for Miox showed that the promoter had at least 4 putative OREs with close homology to the consensus ORE at –2032, –1749, –1429, and –854 (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Comparison of ORE in human and mouse Miox in the 5′ upstream regions.

As shown in Fig. 6A, two prominent bands were observed when the probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from LLC-PK1 cells exposed to hyperosmotic media irrespective of the type of osmolyte used.

An intermediate compound from the coupled-reaction of WbjB-WbjC with the initial substrate UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucose or UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) was purified, and the structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy to be UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-l-talose (UDP-l-PneNAc). WbjD could then convert this intermediate into a new product with the same mass, consistent with a C-2 epimerization reaction. Those results led us to propose a pathway for the biosynthesis of UDP-l-FucNAc; however, the exact enzymatic activity of each of these proteins has not been defined.

Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1983; 33: 256-264Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Liu P.V. Wang S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 922-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa LPS is involved in protecting the bacterium from phagocytosis (5Engels W. Endert J. Kamps M.A. van Boven C.P. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 182-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as serum-mediated killing (6Dasgupta T. de Kievit T.R. Masoud H. Altman E. Richards J.C. Sadovskaya I. Speert D.P. Lam J.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 809-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS mutants lacking the O antigen are 1000 times less virulent than a wild-type bacteria in an animal model study (7Cryz Jr., S.J. Pitt T.L. Furer E. Germanier R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B-band O antigen of P. aeruginosa serotype O11 is a trisaccharide repeating unit composed of l-FucNAc, d-FucNAc, and d-glucose (8Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar). l-FucNAc is exclusively a component of bacterial polysaccharides and has not been found elsewhere in nature. It is a constituent of the LPS of P. aeruginosa serotype O4, O11, and O12 as well as Escherichia coli O26 (8Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar, 9Manca M.C. Weintraub A. Widmalm G. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 281: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is also a component of the capsule of Staphylococcus aureus type 5 and 8 and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4 (10Moreau M. Richards J.C. Fournier J.M. Byrd R.A. Karakawa W.W. Vann W.F. Carbohydr.

Importantly, P. aeruginosa O4 and O11 and S. aureus type 5 and 8 are among the most commonly isolated bacteria from clinical sources (13Pitt T.L. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1988; 7: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Sompolinsky D. Samra Z. Karakawa W.W. Vann W.F. Schneerson R. Malik Z. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar nucleotide precursor, UDP-l-FucNAc, would be an important step toward the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Recently, our group demonstrated the involvement of three enzymes (namely, WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD in P. aeruginosa O11 and homologous proteins Cap5E, Cap5F, and Cap5G in S. aureus type 5) in the biosynthesis of UDP-l-FucNAc (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A knock-out mutation in the gene encoding the first enzyme of the pathway (WbjB) caused the bacterium to produce LPS that was completely devoid of B band. Subsequent biochemical characterization led us to propose the involvement of WbjB in catalyzing the first three reactions from UDP-d-GlcNAc, which are C-4, C-6 dehydration; C-5 epimerization; and C-3 epimerization. Accordingly, this enzyme would produce three intermediates; however, only two product peaks were observed when the WbjB reactions with the substrate (UDP-α-d-GlcNAc) were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Using CE coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS, CE-tandem MS) and NMR, the first two keto-intermediates were determined to be 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-4-hexuloses (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The possibility of WbjB catalyzing the first and second reactions only and WbjC catalyzing the third and fourth reactions was suggested but not explored in the previous work. CE analysis of the coupled WbjBC reaction with UDP-d-GlcNAc, NADP+, and NADPH showed a reduction in the two intermediate peaks as well as the formation of a new peak that migrated at the same position as UDP-d-GlcNAc (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This new peak was identified as UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-talose (UDP-β-l-PneNAc) (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Coupling the reactions of all three enzymes (WbjBCD) yielded a new, unidentified peak shown by CE. CE-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that the product of this reaction had a mass identical to that of UDP-β-l-PneNAc; however, attempts to determine the structure of this new product by NMR were unsuccessful due to its inherent instability (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study we have optimized conditions for the production and purification of the final product of this pathway and conclusively showed the structure to be UDP-l-FucNAc. Moreover, we have refined the CE-based analysis of the enzyme-substrate reactions of WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD, respectively, and elucidated the role of these three enzymes in the pathway. WbjC acts on the second intermediate and most likely retains this intermediate in the active site until it can be reduced to UDP-β-l-PneNAc. These results demonstrate a novel pathway in which separate C-5 and C-3 epimerase enzymes act on nucleotide-activated carbohydrates. Materials—All reagents and antibiotics were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) unless otherwise stated. Difco Bacto™ Tryptone and Difco Bacto™ Yeast Extract were obtained from Fisher Scientific Ltd. (Nepean, Ontario, Canada). All aqueous solutions were prepared using ultrapure water obtained from a Super-Q™ water system (Millipore, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Econo-Pac High Q columns were used in anion-exchange chromatography for the purification of nucleotide-activated sugars (Bio-Rad). Overexpression of WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD—pFuc11, pFuc12, and pFuc13 encoding the N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD, respectively, from P. aeruginosa serotype O11 were used to produce these proteins as described previously (15Kneidinger B.

These constructs were transformed into E. coli Rosetta™(DE3) (Novagen-EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) using 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and either 50 μg/ml kanamycin (WbjB and WbjC) or 100 μg/ml ampicillin (WbjD) for selection. For expression, 250 ml of Terrific broth (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), containing the appropriate antibiotics, was inoculated with 5 ml of overnight culture and grown at 37 °C. When A600 reached 0.6, expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Expression was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g, and the pellets were stored at -20 °C. Purification of WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD—Following induction of protein expression, cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm sodium chloride) and disrupted on ice by ultrasonication. Cell debris and membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation at 175,000 × g for 1 h. Purifications were carried out using either HiTrap Chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the method of Kneidinger et al. (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or His·Bind® Quick 900 Cartridges (Novagen-EMD Biosciences) according to the following procedure: after equilibration with 10 ml of binding buffer, soluble cell extracts were loaded onto the cartridge. The cartridge was rinsed with 20 ml of binding buffer followed by a wash with 20 ml of binding buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using 10 ml of binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Purified protein was stored for up to 2 weeks at -20 °C in elution buffer containing 40% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purity of the enzymes was verified by SDS-PAGE performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) on a 12.5% running gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Analysis of UDP-l-FucNAc Biosynthesis by CE—Standard reactions were performed and analyzed by CE as described previously (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with some modifications. For determination of the pH optima of the coupled reaction, the following buffers were used at a final concentration of 20 mm: sodium citrate (pH 5.0), MES (pH 6.0), HEPES (pH 7.0), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and Bis-Tris-propane (pH 9.0 and 10.0). To determine the function of WbjB and WbjC, reactions containing only the first enzyme (WbjB) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration through a Microcon YM-10 cartridge with a molecular weight cut off of 10,000 (Millipore, Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Either ∼1 μg of WbjC or ∼1 μg each of WbjC and WbjD plus an excess of the hydride donor, 0.75 mm NADPH, was added to 60 μl of the filtrate. The reaction was incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C, and the reaction products were analyzed by CE. For structure elucidation, reactions were performed containing 1.5 mm of the substrate UDP-d-GlcNAc. Purification of the WbjBCD Reaction Products—Nine milliliters of the reaction mix, prepared by combining 15-600 μl of standard reactions, was purified by anion-exchange FPLC using an Econo-Pac High Q column with a bed volume of 5 ml. For separation of the epimers, the purification was performed according to the method described by Miller et al. (19Miller W.L. Wenzel C.Q. Daniels C. Larocque S. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The column was first equilibrated with 240 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) for 5 column volumes immediately prior to elution with a linear gradient of 240-400 mm over 25 column volumes using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed by CE. For structural studies of the reaction intermediates and products, the purification of these compounds was performed with a linear gradient of 0-250 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.7). Fractions containing sugar nucleotides were pooled and lyophilized to dryness for analysis by NMR spectroscopy. At present, quantitative analysis of the sugar nucleotides that were purified in this study could not be achieved due to a lack of available standards for comparison. Sample Preparation and NMR Analysis of the WbjBCD Reaction Products—The lyophilized sample containing UDP-l-PneNAc and UDP-l-FucNAc was resuspended in 150 μl of 98% D2O buffered with NH4HCO3 (54 mm, pD 8.6) and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Proton, 13C HSQC, HMBC, and selective one-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY NMR experiments were performed at 600 MHz (1H) using a 5 mm Z gradient triple resonance cryogenically cooled probe (Varian). The methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference at δH 2.225 ppm and δC 31.07 ppm. The 31P HMQC experiment was performed using a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Z-gradient 3 mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, and 31P) probe. The 31P spectrum was acquired on a 200 MHz (1H) spectrometer. External 85% phosphoric acid was used a reference (δP 0 ppm). Experiments were performed at 25 °C. Proton detected experiments were acquired with suppression of the deuterated H2O resonance at 4.78 ppm. Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional pulse sequences from Varian, correlation spectroscopy, HSQC, HMBC, and 31P HMQC were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional TOCSY experiments with a Z-filter and one-dimensional NOESY experiments were performed for complete residue assignment and for the determination of J(H-H) coupling constants obtained by spin simulation of the spectra. Mixing times of 50-80 ms were used for one-dimensional TOCSY and TOCSY-TOCSY experiments, and a mixing time of 800 ms was used for the one-dimensional NOESY experiments (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K.

Expression and Purification of WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD— Following overexpression, the majority of the protein was found in the soluble fraction. The proteins were purified to near homogeneity, and the yield was ∼5 mg of each protein from 250 ml of bacterial culture. pH Optima for the WbjBCD-coupled Reaction—To maximize the yield of the final product (UDP-β-l-FucNAc) and facilitate NMR analysis, it was necessary to determine the optimum pH for the coupled reactions involving all three proteins, WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD. When coupled reactions were performed, less degradation of the keto-intermediates was observed than in the sequential reactions, as evidenced by the amount of UDP present in the reaction visualized by CE (data not shown). At pH 9.0, the C-2 epimerization reaction catalyzed by WbjD favored the production of UDP-l-FucNAc over UDP-l-PneNAc as observed in the electropherogram (data not shown). Analysis of the Enzymatic Activities of WbjB and WbjC— WbjB-catalyzed reactions were incubated for 1 h, and the enzyme was then removed by centrifugation through a Microcon YM-10 filter cartridge. The two keto-intermediates present in the filtrate were then used as the substrate for the WbjC reaction (in both the presence and absence of NADPH) and the WbjCD-catalyzed reactions, respectively (Fig. 1). When WbjC was incubated with the WbjB reaction filtrate without addition of NADPH (Fig. 1A), the peak corresponding to intermediate 2 (UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose) was completely utilized, and only a small amount of UDP-β-l-PneNAc was produced (Fig. 1B). Upon addition of WbjC and NADPH to the keto-intermediates, an increase in the peak corresponding to UDP-l-PneNAc, which migrates at the same position as UDP-d-GlcNAc, could be discerned (Fig. 1C). When both WbjC and WbjD were added to the filtrate plus NADPH, a new peak appeared that migrated at the same location as the previously reported UDP-l-FucNAc peak (Fig. 1D). To ascertain that the enzyme was effectively removed in our procedures, control reactions were performed involving all the components of the WbjB reaction mixture without the substrate, UDP-d-GlcNAc. The enzyme was then removed by the method mentioned above, and UDP-d-GlcNAc was added to the filtrate. The conversion of UDP-d-GlcNAc to intermediates or to products in the presence of UDP-d-GlcNAc alone (Fig. 1E) or UDP-d-GlcNAc, WbjC, WbjD, and NADPH (Fig. 1F) was not observed. Based on these results, the method for removal of the enzyme was deemed effective; therefore, conversion of intermediate 2 was clearly attributed to WbjC and was not due to the presence of residual WbjB in the filtrate. Purification of UDP-l-PneNAc and UDP-l-FucNAc by Anion-exchange Chromatography—Separation of the epimers was achieved by anion-exchange chromatography to yield two major peaks (Fig. 2A). The peak that eluted first contained a shoulder region and was determined to be the sugar nucleotide mixture by subsequent analysis of the individual fractions by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). The last two fractions of the shoulder region contained only UDP-β-l-FucNAc. Therefore, the two peaks were successfully resolved. The second major peak, which eluted later, was determined to be NADP+ by comparison with a NADP+ standard using CE (data not shown). Identification of Reaction Product by NMR—One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments provided unequivocal evidence of the identity of the intermediate and reaction product. 1HNMR analysis confirmed the presence of UDP-l-PneNAc (15Kneidinger B.

Despite the labile nature of sugar nucleotides, 1H-13C HSQC and HMBC experiments permitted the assignment of 13C resonances, and TOCSY, correlation spectroscopy, and selective one-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments were used to assign proton resonances and accurately determine J(H-H) coupling constants for UDP-l-PneNAc and UDP-l-FucNAc that were later confirmed by spin simulations of the spectra (Table I).Fig. 4NMR spectra of a sample containing UDP-l-PneNAc and UDP-l-FucNAc.

O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A scalar coupling J1,2 of 1.5 Hz indicated that H-1 was gauche to H-2 and was consistent with previously reported data for UDP-l-PneNAc (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One-dimensional NOESY analysis of the UDP-l-PneNAc H-1 proton at 5.26 ppm revealed nuclear Overhauser effects for resonances at 4.41, 3.97, and 3.79 ppm belonging to UDP-l-PneNAc H-2, H-3, and H-5, respectively (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and confirmed that this sugar had a β-configuration (Fig. 4C). Of importance, the strong nuclear Overhauser effect between H-1 and H-2 for UDP-l-PneNAc indicated that these protons exhibit a cis relationship. One-dimensional TOCSY analysis of UDP-l-FucNAc H-1 proton at 5.01 ppm permitted the assignment of H-2, H-3, and H-4 for this reaction product at 3.94, 3.77, and 3.79 ppm, respectively (Fig. 4D). A J1,2 of 8.6 Hz indicated that H-1 was anti to H-2 and pivotal in distinguishing the final reaction product, UDP-l-FucNAc, from its precursor UDP-l-PneNAc. One-dimensional NOESY analysis of UDP-l-FucNAc H-1 at 5.01 ppm demonstrated enhancements for UDP-l-FucNAc H-3 and H-5 protons at 3.77 and 3.84 ppm, respectively, and confirmed that this sugar had a β-configuration. Of particular importance, in contrast to UDP-l-PneNAc, the absence of a nuclear Overhauser effect between H-1 and H-2 for UDP-l-FucNAc confirmed that these protons were in fact axial. 31P HMQC analysis showed phosphorus correlations at δP(β) -12.8 ppm for UDP-l-PneNAc and δP(β) -12.4 ppm for UDP-l-Fuc-NAc, with their respective anomeric resonances at 5.26 and 5.01 ppm (Fig. 4F). Multiple correlations in the 31P HMQC spectrum at δP(α) -10.7 (UDP-l-PneNAc) and -10.6 ppm (UDP-l-FucNAc) with the H-5 resonances of ribose at 4.22 ppm (data not shown) were also observed (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 31P chemical shifts and JP(α),P(β) of 18 Hz were characteristic of a pyrophosphate linkage. Clear carbon-proton correlations observed using a 1H-13C HSQC experiment permitted complete carbon assignments for both for UDP-l-PneNAc and UDP-l-FucNAc (Fig. 4G). Two- and three-bond proton-carbon correlations observed using an HMBC experiment permitted carbon assignments for the quaternary carbonyl NAc resonances of both compounds (data not shown). In this report, we successfully elucidated the role of three enzymes, WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD, in the biosynthesis of the sugar nucleotide UDP-l-FucNAc and developed optimized conditions for the production and identification of this product. Both WbjB and WbjC are members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (22Jornvall H. Hoog J.O. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that contain either a Ser, Met, Lys (SMK in the case of WbjB) or Ser, Tyr, Lys (SYK in the case of WbjC) catalytic triad (15Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The difference in enzyme activity conferred by the SMK catalytic triad compared with the SYK triad has been examined previously for other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. WbpM from P. aeruginosa and FlaA1 from Helicobacter pylori for example, are both UDP-d-GlcNAc C-6 dehydratases/C-4 reductases; however, WbpM contains a SMK catalytic triad, whereas FlaA1 contains a SYK triad (23Creuzenet C. Urbanic R.V. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26769-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was found that the methionine residue in the catalytic triad of WbpM allowed the enzyme to have an optimum pH in the 9-10 range (23Creuzenet C. Urbanic R.V. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26769-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The optimal pH of FlaA1 was shown to be in the 7-8 range when the wild-type triad (SYK) was present, but it was significantly higher (pH 9-10) when the triad was changed to SMK by site-directed mutagenesis (23Creuzenet C. Urbanic R.V. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26769-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is possible then that the first two steps of this pathway, catalyzed by WbjB, control the optimal pH of the overall reaction because"
https://openalex.org/W2127623580,"In Drosophila S2 cells, the apical caspase DRONC undergoes a low level of spontaneous autoprocessing. Unintended apoptosis is prevented by the inhibitor of apoptosis DIAP1, which targets the processed form of DRONC for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity. Recent reports have demonstrated that shortly after the initiation of apoptosis in S2 cells, DIAP1 is cleaved following aspartate residue Asp-20 by the effector caspase DrICE. Here we report a novel caspase-mediated cleavage of DIAP1 in S2 cells. In both living and dying S2 cells, DIAP1 is cleaved by DRONC after glutamate residue Glu-205, located between the first and second BIR domains. The mutation of Glu-205 prevented the interaction of DIAP1 and processed DRONC but had no effect on the interaction with full-length DRONC. The mutation of Glu-205 also had a negative effect on the ability of overexpressed DIAP1 to prevent apoptosis stimulated by the proapoptotic protein Reaper or by UV light. These results expand our knowledge of the events that occur in the Drosophila apoptosome prior to and after receiving an apoptotic signal. In Drosophila S2 cells, the apical caspase DRONC undergoes a low level of spontaneous autoprocessing. Unintended apoptosis is prevented by the inhibitor of apoptosis DIAP1, which targets the processed form of DRONC for degradation through its E3 ubiquitin protein ligase activity. Recent reports have demonstrated that shortly after the initiation of apoptosis in S2 cells, DIAP1 is cleaved following aspartate residue Asp-20 by the effector caspase DrICE. Here we report a novel caspase-mediated cleavage of DIAP1 in S2 cells. In both living and dying S2 cells, DIAP1 is cleaved by DRONC after glutamate residue Glu-205, located between the first and second BIR domains. The mutation of Glu-205 prevented the interaction of DIAP1 and processed DRONC but had no effect on the interaction with full-length DRONC. The mutation of Glu-205 also had a negative effect on the ability of overexpressed DIAP1 to prevent apoptosis stimulated by the proapoptotic protein Reaper or by UV light. These results expand our knowledge of the events that occur in the Drosophila apoptosome prior to and after receiving an apoptotic signal.

Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). IAPs are identified by the presence of at least one baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), a roughly 70-amino acid domain shown to be important for protein-protein interactions. Many IAPs also contain a C-terminal RING finger domain, and several of these have been shown to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (2Green M.C. Monser K.P. Clem R.J.

Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although all IAP proteins contain a BIR domain, not all BIR-containing proteins can inhibit apoptosis, and some BIR-containing proteins have been implicated in cell signaling and cell cycle regulation (9Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Several IAPs have been shown to directly bind and inhibit the activity of a family of proapoptotic proteins known as caspases (10Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 11Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases and are synthesized as zymogens, which must usually be proteolytically cleaved to become activated (12Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). They are divided into two types depending on the size of an N-terminal prodomain found on all caspases. Initiator caspases are identified by a long prodomain, whereas a short prodomain is indicative of an effector caspase. Upon reception of a death signal, upstream initiator caspases are first activated and in turn cleave and activate downstream effector caspases leading to apoptosis. In mammalian cells, caspase-9 functions as the initiator caspase for the intrinsic death pathway and upon induction of apoptosis associates with APAF-1, the mammalian CED-4 homolog. Caspase-9 and APAF-1 binding occur through their mutual CARD domains and along with the cofactors cytochrome c and dATP form the apoptosome. The apoptosome is a large complex that induces dimerization and activation of caspase-9 (13Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-9 then activates effector caspases including caspase-3 and caspase-7, which bring about the morphological and biochemical events associated with apoptosis. In mammalian cells, apoptosome formation is thought to occur only after the cell has received an apoptotic signal. In Drosophila, DREDD and DRONC have been identified as initiator caspases and have been shown to interact with DARK, the Drosophila APAF-1/CED-4 ortholog (14Quinn L.M. Dorstyn L. Mills K.

Zou H. Chen P. Wang X. Abrams J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that in unstimulated Drosophila BG2 cells DRONC is found in a large molecular weight complex (16Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and in normal living Drosophila S2 cells, DRONC undergoes continuous autoprocessing via a DARK-dependent mechanism (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other cofactors such as cytochrome c do not seem to be necessary for apoptosome formation in Drosophila (16Dorstyn L.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although the details of this process are not well understood. The Drosophila DIAP1 protein is required for cell viability in the developing embryo, as demonstrated by extensive apoptosis early in development and embryonic lethality in a DIAP1 mutant fly (22Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition silencing of DIAP1 by RNAi in S2 cells causes spontaneous apoptosis, as does silencing of an iap gene in Sf21 cells, a lepidopteran insect cell line (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.-E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23103-23106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This result differs from mammalian cells in which a knock-out mouse of a mammalian IAP, XIAP, was shown to be essentially normal, although the levels of cIAP1 and cIAP2 were elevated suggesting that they may have compensated for the absence of XIAP (24Harlin H. Birkey Reffey S. Duckett C.S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, insect cells appear to differ from mammalian cells in that apoptosome formation and apical caspase activation are always occurring, and continuous IAP expression is required for cell viability. Certain IAPs have been determined to themselves be caspase substrates, and during apoptosis XIAP and cIAP1 are cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner. XIAP cleavage was observed in Jurkat cells during Fas-induced apoptosis and resulted in reduced levels of XIAP protein and progression of apoptosis (25Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Cleavage of cIAP1 also reduced protein levels and in addition resulted in the production of a proapoptotic C-terminal fragment suggesting that in mammals caspase cleavage reduces IAP levels and may also have other effects on IAP function (26Clem R.J. Sheu T.-T. Richter B. W.M. He W.-W. Thornberry N.A. Duckett C.S. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In Drosophila S2 cells, DIAP1 is also a caspase substrate and is cleaved by the Drosophila effector caspase DrICE. Using purified proteins Meier and co-workers (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) determined that DIAP1 was cleaved by DrICE at position Asp-20. DrICE cleavage at amino acid Asp-20 of DIAP1 produces a processed form that possesses an asparagine at the N terminus and is recognized by the N-end rule degradation pathway. In agreement with this hypothesis it was determined that mutations at amino acid Asp-20 inhibited the degradation of DIAP1 when expressed in cells. The mutation of Asp-20 also reduced the ability of DIAP1 to inhibit apoptosis stimulated by overexpression of Reaper; however, effects on other death stimuli were not reported (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that DrICE binds BIR1 of DIAP1 and that cleavage of DIAP1 by DrICE at Asp-20 is required for DrICE binding and inhibition (28Yan S.J. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, a more recent report concluded that DrICE cleavage of DIAP1 at position Asp-20 was not important for the ability of DIAP1 to inhibit apoptosis stimulated by overexpression of Reaper or Hid (29Yokokura T. Dresnek D. Huseinovic N. Simonetta L. Abdelwahid E. Bangs P. White K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52603-52612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we observed a cleavage product of Drosophila DIAP1 in Drosophila S2 cells that differed in size from the DrICE-mediated cleavage product reported previously. This cleavage product was unstable, because it was only seen in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. However, it was evident in both normal and dying cells. Accumulation of the DIAP1 cleavage product was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK or by silencing of DRONC or DARK by RNAi. Using recombinant proteins, we found that DRONC readily cleaved DIAP1 in vitro, resulting in a digestion product similar in size to that seen in cells. The DRONC cleavage site in DIAP1 was mapped to amino acid Glu-205 in the spacer region separating BIR1 from BIR2 and the C-terminal RING domain. In vitro co-immunoprecipitations revealed that mutations at amino acid Glu-205 inhibited binding of DIAP1 to processed DRONC but not to full-length DRONC. In addition, when the Glu-205 mutant was overexpressed in S2 cells, its ability to protect cells against apoptosis induced by Reaper overexpression was reduced, suggesting that cleavage of DIAP1 by DRONC is involved in apoptosis regulation. Protein Purification—The vector expressing GST-DIAP1 was provided by Bruce Hay (Wang et al., Ref. 22Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The mutant versions of DIAP1 were generated using polymerase chain reaction and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DRONC coding region was introduced into pET23(a) (Novagen) to produce pDronc-His6 (C-terminally tagged). All DIAP1 and DRONC constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). For protein purification bacteria were grown at room temperature to OD600 of 0.4 and were induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 1 h at room temperature. After induction bacteria were frozen overnight at –80 °C and then thawed in lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m ammonia sulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol + proteasome inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Bacteria were then sonicated on ice at 50% pulse for 3 min in 15-s intervals. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The DIAP1 soluble fractions were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma), and DRONC soluble fractions were purified using cobalt Talon resin (Clontech) per manufacture's instructions. Protein concentrations were then determined by comparing purified proteins to known concentrations of bovine serum albumin on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. DIAP1 Cleavage—For DRONC cleavage of DIAP1, 200 ng of wild type GST-DIAP1 or the single and double mutants were mixed with increasing concentrations (10–500 ng) of wild type DRONC-His in 30 μl of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation the DIAP1 the reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were then run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. DIAP1 protein was then detected by Western blot using an anti-DIAP1 monoclonal antibody (obtained from Bruce Hay) at 1:3,500, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody at 1:6,500, and Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). S2 Cell Viability—S2 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the Drosophila heat shock promoter and either wild type DIAP1, N-DIAP1 (Δ205–438 DIAP1), C-DIAP1 (Δ1–205 DIAP1), or the single and double point mutants under the control of the constitutively active baculovirus IE1 promoter. The complete sequences of all of the mutant constructs were verified to ensure there were not any inadvertent mutations introduced during their construction. For Reaper viability, cells were also transfected with a plasmid expressing Reaper, and 48 h after transfection the number of viable green fluorescent cells was determined by counting three fields of view under 400× magnification. Control cells not receiving Reaper were set at 100%. For UV light viability, 20 h after transfection cells were UV light-irradiated by placing the plates on a transilluminator for 10 min. At 24 h after UV light treatment the number of viable green fluorescent cells was counted, and the percentage of viable cells remaining was determined by setting the number of green fluorescent cells at 100% 1 h after UV light treatment. To detect the expressed proteins, transfected cells were subjected to Western blotting using anti-DIAP1 antibody as described above, except that less lysate was used to better illustrate the difference in levels between endogenous DIAP1 and the exogenously expressed DIAP1 proteins. Co-immunoprecipitations—Using recombinant GST-DIAP1 and recombinant DRONC-His, 200 ng of each DIAP1 construct was added to 500 ng of wild type or catalytically inactive DRONC in 30 μl of buffer A. The reactions were added to protein G beads (Sigma), bound to anti-DRONC antibody (obtained from Bruce Hay), and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, and bound protein was eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted protein was run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and DIAP1 protein was detected by Western blot using anti-DIAP1 antibody at 1:1,000 and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody at 1:10,000. For the co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous protein, 6 million S2 cells were plated overnight and then UV light-treated for 10 min. Cells were harvested at various times post UV light and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The incubation with anti-DRONC bound protein G beads (Sigma) was performed as for recombinant protein. DIAP1 protein was then detected by Western blot using anti-DIAP1 antibody at 1:4,000 and anti-DRONC antibody at 1:7,000. Conditions for RNAi in Drosophila Cell Culture—RNAi methods were essentially as described (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). In brief, S2 cells were plated overnight at 6 million cells/well in 6-well plates in TC100 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were then placed in TC100 medium without serum and dronc or dark dsRNA was added directly to the medium to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml followed by vigorous shaking. The cells were incubated for 5.5 h at 25 °C at which time serum was added to a final concentration of 10% serum. To allow time for protein turnover the cells were incubated for 24 h before proceeding with the rest of the experiment. We have previously shown this amount of time to be sufficient to significantly reduce DRONC and DARK protein levels (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DIAP1 Protein Levels Are Regulated by Both the Proteasome and Caspase Cleavage—Recent studies have found that the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein, DIAP1, is short lived and upon induction of apoptosis is rapidly removed (7Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 31Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M.R. Clem R.J. Müller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Using Drosophila S2 cells we confirmed that endogenous DIAP1 protein levels were undetectable 3 h after UV light treatment (Fig. 1A). Several IAPs, including DIAP1, have recently been shown to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and induce the degradation of themselves and other apoptotic proteins (5Olson M.R. Holley C.L. Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4028-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M.R. Clem R.J. Müller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We therefore were interested in investigating the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the rate of DIAP1 degradation. MG132 treatment of UV light-irradiated cells delayed, but did not completely prevent, the degradation of DIAP1 and also resulted in the appearance and accumulation of a 27-kDa immunoreactive band (Fig. 1B). In addition, MG132 treatment somewhat delayed the progression of apoptosis, which may have been because of the slower degradation of full-length DIAP1 (data not shown). Because some mammalian IAP proteins are cleaved by caspases (25Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 26Clem R.J. Sheu T.-T. Richter B. W.M. He W.-W. Thornberry N.A. Duckett C.S. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we suspected that the 27-kDa protein was the result of caspase cleavage. To examine this, S2 cells were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK with or without MG132 prior to inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, the 27-kDa band was not present when cells were treated with z-VAD-FMK alone (Fig. 1C) or with both z-VAD-FMK and MG132 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, z-VAD-FMK treatment also caused a delay in the decrease in full-length DIAP1 (Fig. 1C) indicating that the amount of full-length DIAP1 is regulated by both proteasomal degradation and caspase cleavage in apoptotic S2 cells. DRONC Continuously Cleaves DIAP1—In normal, living Drosophila S2 cells, DIAP1 is required to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.-E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Igaki T. Yamamoto-Goto Y. Tokushige N. Kanda H. Miura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23103-23106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore monitored DIAP1 protein levels in non-apoptotic cells treated with MG132. DIAP1 Western blots showed no over-accumulation of full-length DIAP1 following proteasome inhibition but rather showed an accumulation of the 27-kDa fragment of DIAP1, which at times also appeared to be modified in a manner consistent with ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). MG132 treatment itself had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). These results suggested that DIAP1 is continuously cleaved in non-apoptotic S2 cells, possibly by one or more caspases. The initiator caspase DRONC was a good candidate for the caspase that cleaves DIAP1, because DIAP1 is known to bind and ubiquitinate DRONC (7Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), DRONC has previously been shown to also be continuously processed and degraded in normal S2 cells, and DIAP1 RNAi results in the accumulation of processed DRONC (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate whether DRONC is required for cleavage of DIAP1 we used RNAi to silence either DRONC or DARK, the APAF-1/CED-4 homolog that is required for DRONC activation. Twenty-four hours after the addition of either dronc or dark dsRNA, S2 cells were treated with MG132. Immunoblot analysis indicated that silencing of either DRONC or DARK greatly reduced the accumulation of the DIAP1 27-kDa fragment (Fig. 2B). To determine whether endogenous DRONC and DIAP1 interact in S2 cells, cells were UV light-irradiated, and at various times lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-DRONC antiserum. Anti-DIAP1 Western blots of the immunoprecipitated samples showed that in non-apoptotic cells, DRONC interacted with both full-length DIAP1 and the 27-kDa cleavage fragment of DIAP1, although the interaction with cleaved DIAP1 appeared much stronger (Fig. 2C, lane 1). These results indicate that in non-apoptotic cells, activated DRONC is necessary for DIAP1 cleavage and support our previous finding that a portion of the DRONC protein in non-apoptotic cells is activated but is inhibited prior to activating effector caspases (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). DRONC Cleaves DIAP1 in the Spacer Region between BIR1 and BIR2—To further verify that DRONC was directly responsible for DIAP1 cleavage, we examined the ability of DRONC to cleave DIAP1 in reactions using recombinant, purified proteins. When recombinant DIAP1 was incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant DRONC, DIAP1 was readily cleaved, resulting in cleavage products of ∼50 and 27 kDa (Fig. 3A). The recombinant DIAP1 protein used in this experiment was fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus, and an anti-GST immunoblot showed that the 50-kDa cleavage product included the N terminus of DIAP1 (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the 27-kDa fragment, which was similar to the cleavage product seen in S2 cells, represented the C-terminal portion of DIAP1. To determine the DRONC cleavage site, we examined the amino acid sequence of DIAP1 for potential cleavage sites that would result in a C-terminal cleavage product of ∼27 kDa. DRONC is unusual among caspases in that it has been shown to cleave after both glutamate and aspartate residues (32Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues Asp-201 and Glu-205 are both in the spacer region of DIAP1 between the first and second BIRs and, if cleaved, would result in a C-terminal fragment of approximately the correct size. We therefore mutated DIAP1 at these residues by changing these residues to alanines (E205A and D201A) and expressed them in bacteria to generate recombinant proteins. After incubation with increasing concentrations of active DRONC, samples were immunoblotted using anti-DIAP1 antibody, and it was observed that both wild type DIAP1 and the D201A mutant were cleaved by DRONC into two fragments of 50 and 27 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast DRONC cleavage of the E205A mutant was greatly inhibited (Fig. 3C) and was only observed when incubated with high concentrations of DRONC. In addition, the E205A/D201A double mutant showed little to no cleavage even when incubated with high concentrations of DRONC (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the cleavage products observed with the E205A mutant may have been because of DRONC cleavage at amino acid Asp-201 and/or cleavage at other less efficient sites. These results indicate that DRONC cleaves DIAP1 after amino acid Glu-205 and support a recent publication that reported the same DRONC cleavage site in vitro (28Yan S.J. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Glu-205 Mutations Inhibit DRONC Binding in Vitro and Have Reduced Ability to Inhibit Apoptosis—Recent reports have shown that DIAP1 is also cleaved by the effector caspase DrICE at amino acid Asp-20 (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Yan S.J. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These reports found that DrICE cleavage of DIAP1 was required for DrICE binding to DIAP1 and was important for DIAP1 activity. We therefore hypothesized that DRONC cleavage of DIAP1 may also play a role in DRONC binding to DIAP1 and be important for DIAP1 activity. To examine the effects of DIAP1 cleavage on DRONC binding, various purified DIAP1 mutant proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed DRONC that was either fully processed (active) or a catalytically inactive DRONC mutant (C318S) that was full-length. Immunoprecipitation of these samples indicated that wild type DIAP1, and the D201A mutant bound both processed and full-length DRONC (Fig. 4). DIAP1 was cleaved by active DRONC and both the N- and C-terminal fragments of DIAP1 were immunoprecipitated, indicating that the both fragments remained bound to DRONC following cleavage, at least stably enough to be immunoprecipitated. However the E205A mutant bound only full-length DRONC and was unable to bind active DRONC (Fig. 4), indicating that presence of an intact cleavage site in DIAP1 is important for this processed form of DRONC to bind DIAP1. To investigate the role of DRONC cleavage on the antiapoptotic activity of DIAP1, untagged wild type DIAP1, N-DIAP1 (amino acids 1–205 of DIAP1), C-DIAP1 (amino acids 205–438 of DIAP1 with an initiating methionine), or the single, double, and triple combinations of the point mutants D20A, D201A, and E205A were transiently expressed in S2 cells, and the cells were co-transfected with a construct expressing Reaper to induce apoptosis (Fig. 5A). As previously reported (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), mutation of Asp-20 reduced the ability of DIAP1 to protect against Reaper-induced death by ∼50%. In addition, mutation of residue Glu-205 also reduced the anti-apoptotic function of DIAP1 against Reaper-induced death (Fig. 5A), although not to the same degree as mutation of Asp-20. Mutation of Asp-201 had no effect on Reaper-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, although the D20A/D201A mutant behaved similarly to the D20A mutant, the ability of the D20A/E205A double mutant to inhibit Reaper-induced death was similar to the E205A mutant. This would fit with an interaction between DIAP1 and DRONC being epistatic to the interaction between DIAP1 and DrICE. Expression of C-DIAP1 also had a reduced ability to inhibit Reaper-induced death, whereas expression of N-DIAP1 had no anti-apoptotic activity, and expression of both C- and N-DIAP1 together was similar to expression of C-DIAP1 alone. When a different death stimulus, UV light irradiation, was used, mutation of Asp-20 and/or Glu-205 had less of an inhibitory effect on anti-apoptotic function than against Reaper. However both mutants still had slightly reduced anti-apoptotic function compared with wild type or the Asp-201 mutant (Fig. 5B). As seen with Reaper overexpression, C-DIAP1 protected less well than any of the point mutants, whereas expression of N-DIAP1 did not protect at all. All of the mutant proteins were expressed at levels equal to or higher than the wild type DIAP1 construct, with the exception of C-DIAP1 (Fig. 5C). Expression of C-DIAP1 did, however, provide some protection compared with the negative control, indicating that it was expressed, but the protein was probably highly unstable because of the presence of the RING domain. This is consistent with the observation that the 27-kDa DIAP1 cleavage product, which is essentially the same as C-DIAP1, was not observed unless cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (Figs. 1 and 2). In previous studies we have shown that addition of MG132 to normal living S2 cells caused the over-accumulation of a processed form of DRONC, whereas full-length DRONC levels remained unaffected (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This suggested that DRONC was being continuously processed and once processed, targeted for degradation by the proteasome. In this report we found that MG132 treatment of normal living S2 cells also caused the over-accumulation and modification of a C-terminal cleavage fragment of DIAP1. We also observed that similar to full-length DRONC, full-length DIAP1 protein levels were unaffected by MG132 treatment. We were able to conclude that DRONC directly cleaves DIAP1 in S2 cells based on several pieces of evidence. 1) Reducing the levels of either DRONC or DARK by RNAi inhibited the production of the 27-kDa fragment of DIAP1; 2) endogenous DRONC interacted with both full-length DIAP1 and the C-terminal DIAP1 cleavage fragment; and 3) experiments using recombinant, purified proteins revealed that DRONC cleaved DIAP1 and produced a cleavage product similar in size to that seen in S2 cells. It is unclear why this 27-kDa cleavage product has not been reported by other groups who have examined DIAP1 cleavage in S2 cells (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 29Yokokura T. Dresnek D. Huseinovic N. Simonetta L. Abdelwahid E. Bangs P. White K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52603-52612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it may be because of the antibody we used to detect DIAP1, which was different from that used by the other groups. Our data, including that presented here and in previous publications (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), point to a model wherein DRONC, DARK, DIAP1, and DrICE exist in an apoptosome-like complex and autoactivation of DRONC occurs spontaneously in a DARK-dependent fashion, resulting in cleavage at residue Glu-352 of DRONC, separating the large and small subunits (18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this model, activated DRONC then cleaves DIAP1 at Glu-205 and is subsequently ubiquitinated by DIAP1 and degraded. The C-terminal cleavage product of DIAP1, containing the RING domain, is also ubiquitinated and degraded. These events appear to occur continuously in unstimulated S2 cells. Interruption of the DIAP1-DRONC interaction, whether by Reaper, Hid, or Grim binding or by a decrease in DIAP1 levels, results in the accumulation of activated DRONC and subsequent cleavage and activation of DrICE. Cleavage of DIAP1 by DrICE at position Asp-20 then occurs (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and this cleavage event has been reported to be required for inhibition of DrICE by DIAP1 (28Yan S.J. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The observation that the D20A/E205A double mutant protected at a level similar to the E205A mutant (Fig. 5A) supports the conclusion that cleavage at Glu-205 occurs prior to that at Asp-20, as does the observation that DRONC activation occurs prior to DrICE activation following a death signal (17Muro I. Hay B.A. Clem R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49644-49650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The interaction between DIAP1 and either full-length DRONC or Pr1 DRONC, the predominant active form of DRONC in apoptotic cells (DRONC cleaved only at position Glu-352 between the large and small subunits) (18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), appears to be different from the interaction of DIAP1 with fully active DRONC that is expressed in bacteria, which is cleaved at Glu-352 and also at an unidentified residue lying between the prodomain and the large subunit (18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The interaction between DIAP1 and full-length DRONC has been shown to involve BIR2 of DIAP1 and amino acids 114–125 of DRONC (33Chai J. Yan N. Huh J.R. Wu J.-W. Li W. Hay B.A. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but this sequence is probably not present in bacterially expressed active DRONC due to cleavage during processing (18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The interaction between bacterially expressed active DRONC and DIAP1 appears instead to involve the active site of DRONC and Glu-205 of DIAP1, because fully processed DRONC requires an intact cleavage site at position Glu-205 for interaction with DIAP1, whereas full-length DRONC does not (Fig. 4). Mutation of either of the caspase cleavage sites in DIAP1 (Asp-20 or Glu-205) had a negative effect on the ability of DIAP1 to protect cells against Reaper-induced apoptosis; however, in both cases the mutant proteins still retained significant anti-apoptotic function. Similar results were previously reported for the D20A mutant against Reaper (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that although caspase cleavage of DIAP1 may normally be important for its anti-apoptotic function, it is not absolutely essential. It is likely that the effect of mutating the cleavage site is being masked by overexpression of the mutant proteins in these experiments. The levels of overexpressed DIAP1 were much higher than the levels of endogenous DIAP1 in this system, which was not even detected with the amount of lysate used for analysis (Fig. 5C, compare the first two lanes). The effect of mutating Asp-20 or Glu-205 was even less on UV light-induced apoptosis. This could be because Reaper-induced apoptosis and UV light-induced apoptosis involve different pathways, or because Reaper-induced apoptosis may be a stronger death stimulus than the dose of UV light used in these experiments. It was recently reported that BIR1 of DIAP1 is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of DrICE enzyme activity in vitro (28Yan S.J. Wu J.W. Chai J. Li W. Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However in our experiments expression of N-DIAP1, containing amino acids 1–205 and including all of BIR1, had no ability to protect S2 cells against apoptosis stimulated by either Reaper or UV light, even though the truncated protein was expressed at high levels (Fig. 5). Because RNAi of DrICE is highly effective at inhibiting apoptosis in S2 cells (18Muro I. Monser K. Clem R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5035-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this result indicates that merely inhibiting the catalytic activity of DrICE is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis and points to the importance of the RING domain in the anti-death function of DIAP1, as reported previously (27Ditzel M. Wilson R. Tenev T. Zachariou A. Paul A. Deas E. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). DIAP1 has a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis in Drosophila, and it is a critical determinant for whether cells die or live. Although mutating the DRONC cleavage site in DIAP1 did not completely eliminate DIAP1 function when DIAP1 was overexpressed, the interactions between DIAP1 and DRONC are clearly important for regulating apoptosis, and this study has reported and characterized a novel feature of that interaction. Future studies may reveal a more significant role for this cleavage event when the proteins are expressed at physiologically relevant levels.

We now show that UL84 has a high degree of homology to the DExD/H (where x can be any amino acid) box family of helicases, displays UTPase activity, and is phosphorylated at serine residues. Affinity column-purified UL84-FLAG fusion protein was used in an in vitro nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay to show that UL84 has NTPase activity, preferring UTP. This UTPase activity was linear with respect to enzyme concentration and slightly enhanced by the addition of nucleic acid substrates. UL84 UTPase was the highest at low salt concentrations, a pH of 7.5, and a temperature of 45 °C. The enzyme preferred Mg2+ as the divalent cation but was also able to catalyze the UTPase reaction in the presence of Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ albeit at lower levels. The evidence presented here suggests that the UL84 UTPase activity may be part of an energy-generating system for helicase activity associated with the initiation of HCMV DNA replication.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; OBP, origin-binding protein; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AC, agarose-conjugated; CIP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; T-ag, T-antigen. lytic DNA replication involves the core replication proteins: UL54 (polymerase), UL44 (polymerase accessory protein), UL57 (single-stranded DNA binding protein), UL70 (primase), UL102 (primase-associated factor), and UL105 (helicase). In addition to these proteins, the gene product of UL84 was shown to be required in transient origin-dependent replication assays as well as in the context of the virus genome (1Xu Y. Cei S.A. Huete A.R. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10360-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because UL84 is the only non-core protein required for origin-dependent DNA replication, the current hypothesis is that it acts as an initiator protein for viral DNA synthesis at the origin of HCMV DNA replication (ori- Lyt). Initiator or origin-binding proteins (OBP) appear to be ubiquitous among the DNA viruses. These proteins interact with a region within the lytic origin and apparently unwind DNA through the binding and hydrolysis of NTPs such that the remaining DNA replication machinery can assemble and subsequently carry out DNA synthesis. In other herpesvirus systems, initiator proteins were shown to have properties associated with DNA metabolism. For example, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL9 exhibits ATPase and helicase activity (2Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

The enzyme is phosphorylated by cellular kinases and exists as a dimer in its active form (5Isler J.A. Schaffer P.A. J.

UL9 interacts with OriS and OriL with the assistance of ssDNA binding protein (ICP8) in a two-step cooperative binding process to initiate DNA replication (8Macao B. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29211-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). UL9 also interacts with other components of the DNA replication machinery and may lead to the recruitment of these factors to the site of DNA synthesis (9Trego K.S. Parris D.S. J.

For Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Zta was shown to interact with the helicase-primase proteins and is directed to the nucleus via the interaction with the helicase component (12Liao G. Wu F.Y.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8559-8567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Zta is also a multifunctional phosphoprotein, having transcriptional activation properties with respect to up-regulating the expression of viral genes, as well as having a role in initiation of DNA synthesis (14Fixman E.D.

Other DNA virus systems that use a method similar to that of HSV-1 of initiation of DNA replication include polyoma and papillomaviruses. The large T-antigen of SV40 virus has both RNA and DNA helicase activities that are in turn associated with both a non-ATP NTPase activity and ATPase activity, respectively (18Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The papillomavirus protein E1 also exhibits ATPase and helicase activity in vitro (19Sheikh S. Van Horn G. Naqvi A. Sheahan L. Khan S.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Both of these initiator proteins require a double hexamer phosphoprotein structure, which surround the DNA substrate to unwind the DNA or RNA strands (20Joo W.S. Kim H.Y. Purviance J.D.

UL84 is a nuclear protein that interacts with the immediateearly protein IE2 of HCMV and regulates the transactivation activity of IE2 by possibly interfering with IE2 binding to its DNA substrates (25Gebert S. Schmolke S. Sorg G. Floss S. Plachter B. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7048-7060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Xu Y. Colletti K.S. Pari G.S. J.

UL84 is an oligomer in vivo, and the point of this self-interaction is located in a highly charged region of the protein, which is distinct from the leucine zipper that is required for IE2-UL84 interaction (27Colletti K.S. Xu Y. Cei S.A. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9203-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IE2 also has a role in DNA replication, since it was demonstrated that UL84 and IE2 cooperate to activate a strong promoter within HCMV oriLyt (28Xu Y. Cei S.A. Rodriguez Huete A. Colletti K.S. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11664-11677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This oriLyt promoter region can be replaced with the SV40 promoter, alleviating the need for IE2 in the transient assay (28Xu Y. Cei S.A. Rodriguez Huete A. Colletti K.S. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11664-11677Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite being implicated in DNA replication, to date no enzymatic function has been reported for UL84. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that UL84 has a high degree of identity to the family of proteins called DExD/H box proteins. These proteins were identified as enzymes that utilize the energy of NTPs to promote RNA metabolism including an RNA-RNA helicase, RNA-DNA unwindase, and other RNA-protein interactions (29Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 30Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). DExD/H box proteins characteristically contain seven to eight conserved motifs including the Walker A and B motifs that are thought to be the sites responsible for binding and hydrolysis of NTPs (29Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 30Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We now show for the first time that UL84 is a phosphoprotein that has UTPase activity displaying characteristics that are similar to other OBPs as well as members of the DExD/H box family of proteins. The UTPase activity of UL84 may be part of an energy-generating system for helicase activity involved in the initiation of HCMV DNA replication. Cells, Viruses, and Plasmids—Vero cells were propagated and infected with Ad84 or transfected with pFLAG-control (Stratagene) as described previously (27Colletti K.S. Xu Y. Cei S.A. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9203-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Vero cells were seeded at 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were infected 24 h after seeding with Ad84 using a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cells were washed 48 h post-infection with PBS (pH 7.5) and incubated in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in a total volume of 3 ml of phosphate-free DMEM at 37 °C for a period of 5 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. The cell lysate was collected, and the sample was passed through a 22-gauge needle. The preparation was centrifuged at 3,200 × g using a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min to clear the lysate of cell debris. The lysate was precleared using agarose-conjugated (AC) normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C with mixing. The normal mouse IgG-AC was removed from solution by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. One ml of precleared lysate was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 50 μl of FLAG affinity beads as per the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Before elution some samples were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography or alternatively immunoblotted and probed with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Phosphoamino Acid Mapping—UL84 was in vivo labeled, harvested, and immunoprecipitated using the herein described method. Phosphoamino acid mapping was performed essentially as described previously (32Zhi Y. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the small difference that the gel was blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and visualized using India ink stain prior to hydrolysis of the excised band. UL84 Protein Purification—UL84 protein was purified as described previously (27Colletti K.S. Xu Y. Cei S.A. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9203-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) via FLAG affinity chromatography. Alternatively, a reduced salt preparation of UL84 was purified from recombinant adenovirus (Ad84)-infected Vero cells 72 h post infection by scraping cells into ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors (Sigma) and lysing the cells using a nitrogen bomb (Kontes) under a pressure of 500 p.s.i. for 30 min. The lysate was subsequently treated as previously described (27Colletti K.S. Xu Y. Cei S.A. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9203-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All protein samples were tested by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. As a control we used mock adenovirus or AdTrack-infected (recombinant adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein) Vero cell lysate for FLAG affinity purification. Only proteins that were >95% purity were used in NTPase assays. NTPase Assays—NTPase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of product in the form of free phosphate (Pi) (ATP and GTP) or NDP (CTP and UTP) by quantifying the separation of radioactive products from the NTP substrate. The typical total reaction of 120 μl contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm NTP (United States Biochemical), 0.125 μCi (41.6 nm) each of [32P]NTP ([γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences), and 5-10 pmol of UL84; this mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to prewarm the enzyme before adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mm to start the reaction. 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were removed and mixed with 10 μl of 0.25 m EDTA at the appropriate times to stop the reaction (see the legends for Figs. 3 and 4). 2 μl of this mixture was spotted in 1-μl aliquots onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (EMD Chemicals Inc.) and after drying developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.4 m LiCl. The separated reaction products were visualized and quantified using the Personal Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad).Fig. 4UL84 UTPase characteristics. In all experiments each point represents three individual reactions. A, UL84 pH profile was determined using the standard reaction mixture with the exception that various pH values were used. B, the activity of UL84 UTPase was measured at 25, 37, and 45 °C using the standard reaction conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, NaCl and KCl were tested at indicated concentrations for effects on UTP hydrolysis by UL84 using the standard reaction described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, four different divalent cations were tested for their ability to catalyze the UL84 UTPase reaction, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+. Each cation was used in at the same concentration in the standard reaction described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UL84 Is Phosphorylated at Serine Residues—All known herpesvirus OBPs are phosphorylated by cellular kinases. To determine whether UL84 was phosphorylated by cellular kinases and assess the similarities between UL84 and other OBPs, we obtained purifed UL84 from Vero cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing UL84-FLAG fusion protein. Alternatively, Vero cells were transfected with a FLAG control plasmid that expressed the luciferase protein fused with FLAG as an unphosphorylated control protein. The proteins were in vivo labeled, harvested, and immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One sample of each protein was treated with CIP as a control to ensure that the phosphates could be removed from the proteins. Protein samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. No band was detected in samples that contained control FLAG protein, whereas a radioactive band was detected that corresponded to UL84 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Samples were also treated with CIP to remove radiolabeled phosphates. The UL84 radioactive band was no longer detected in the sample treated with CIP (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Western blot analysis was performed using the same protein sample to show that CIP treatment did not appreciably affect protein concentrations (Fig. 1B). To determine which amino acids were phosphorylated we performed phosphoamino acid mapping. UL84 protein was again in vivo labeled and immunoprecipitated. The resulting protein band was transferred to a PDVF membrane and hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid. The released phosphoamino acids were seperated by two dimentional Hunter thin layer electrophoresis along with unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards. The resulting TLC plate was visualized by autoradiography. The autoradiograph showed that UL84 is primarily phosphorylated at serine residues when compared with the phosphoamino acid standards (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D is a depiction of all of the serine residues that are possible candidates for phosphorylation in the UL84 sequence as predicted by NetPhos 2.0. Fig. 1 displays strong evidence that UL84 is phosphorylated by cellular kinases at serine residues. UL84 Is a Putative Member of the DExD/H Family of Helicases—UL84 exhibits only very limited homology to any functional group of proteins when examined by classical BLAST searches; however, the current data gathered concerning UL84 indicates that the protein is a functional homologue to UL9 and other herpesvirus OBPs. We choose to compare UL84 to DExD/H box family of protein, since many other viral intiation proteins fall into this category. Upon careful comparison to the DExD/H helicase motifs, it became clear that UL84 protein contained many of these motifs. Fig. 2 shows the alignment of UL84 with several DExD/H protein families including DEAH, DEAD, DExH, SNF2, Rad3, and UL9. UL84 contains motifs homologous to a combination of the different DExD/H families. The Walker A motif of UL84 is slightly divergent from the other families shown in Fig. 2; however, it contains significant homology to Walker A motifs from bacteriophage proteins with the conserved arginine in the third position (33Mitchell M.S. Rao V.B. Virology. 2004; 321: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The UL84 motif Ia is homologous to the DEAH family of RNA helicases and exhibits a high degree of identity with this family. The Walker B motif of UL84 is highly homologous to the UL9 Walker B motif as is displayed in the inset panel of Fig. 1 and also shares amino acids with the Walker B motifs of SV40 large T-antigen and papillomavirus E1-11. UL84 again exhibits homology to the DEAH family of helicases based on the auxiliary sequence LxxY that precedes the Walker B motif. UL84 also contains a motif IV homologous to the DExH and Rad3 families of helicases that is flanked by auxiliary sequences and a motif V that are found in the DEAH family. UL84 does not appear to contain an identifiable motif VI in its amino acid sequence. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that UL84 is a member of the DExD/H box family of proteins and may exhibit any number of functions associated with this family of enzymes. UL84 Displays UTPase Activity—Since we hypothesized that UL84 had enzymatic activity based on the motifs found in the sequence, we developed an in vitro assay to determine whether purified UL84 can hydrolyze NTPs (27Colletti K.S. Xu Y. Cei S.A. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9203-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Many of the procedures used for UL84, including buffers and salt concentrations, were adapted from the well characterized HSV-1 UL9 protein, and this served as a starting point for the initial characterization the NTPase activity of UL84. Based on assays developed for the UL9 enzyme, we initially used ATP as a substrate for hydrolysis in our assay involving UL84. However, this nucleotide was poorly hydrolyzed in comparison with UTP. Consequently, we incubated purified UL84 with UTP and assayed for hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Our first step in the kinetic characterization of UL84 UTPase activity was the determination of the reaction order, which served to authenticate our kinetic data. When increasing concentrations of UL84 were added to the reaction mixture a linear rate of hydrolysis occurred indicating that the enzyme concentration was proportional to increased velocity of the reaction (Fig. 3A). This result strongly suggested that UL84 displayed kinetics consistent with a first order reaction and that kinetic data using this method was valid. UL84 Nucleic Acid Stimulation and Enzymatic Stability—Since UL84 was shown to display first order kinetics, the next step was to investigate the properties of UL84 UTP hydrolysis with respect to the ability to retain enzymatic function over time. DExD/H family members often display nucleic acid dependence with respect to their NTPase activity. To evaluate UL84 nucleic acid dependence we performed our UTPase assay with the addition of ssRNA (poly(A)), dsDNA (activated calf thymus DNA), or ssDNA (poly(dT)). The addition of these nucleic acid substrates resulted in a slight enhancement of UTPase activity (Fig. 3B). This result indicated that perhaps the enzymatic activity was only slightly affected by the addition of nucleic acid using the present reaction buffer. Other explanations for only a modest increase in enzymatic activity from the addition of nucleic acids to the reaction mixture include the possibility that UL84 requires a sequence-specific substrate or that the proper substrate or reaction conditions have not yet been determined. Also, additional viral and/or cellular proteins may be required for an optimal nucleic acid interaction and subsequent UTP hydrolysis by UL84. To show that UL84 was responsible for the hydrolysis reaction, we performed several control reactions. We heat-treated UL84 at 95 °C for 2 min prior to adding the protein to the reaction mixture. As a result, only minimal hydrolysis was observed, indicating that the denatured protein-cation-nucleotide complex was not sufficient to hydrolyze UTP (Fig. 3B). In addition, the omission of MgCl2 or UL84 itself from the reaction mixture resulted in no measurable increase in UTP hydrolysis (Fig. 3B). Mock Vero cell lysate FLAG affinity column purification also exhibited a minimal amount of hydrolysis, which indicated that the UL84 protein was responsible for the UTPase activity (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the UTPase activity of UL84 was stimulated by nucleic acid and indicated that activity was dependent upon the presence of the divalent cation Mg2+ and was heat-sensitive. Also, the failure of mock-infected cell lysates to show any UTPase activity added a high degree of confidence that no contamination with cellular UTPases accounted for the observed activity. Incubation of UL84 with UTP resulted in a linear increase in hydrolyzed product for up to a reaction time of 30 min (Fig. 3C). This indicated that there was no apparent lag time with respect to enzyme activity and no observed product inhibition at initial stages of the reaction. The velocity of the reaction slowed beyond 30 min, which may indicate that the enzyme was losing catalytic sites due to product inhibition or loss of protein conformational stability. Also shown is a TLC plate for a representative time course experiment displaying both substrate and hydrolysis product (UDP) (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). UL84 NTPase Kinetics—Although our initial results indicated that UTP was efficiently hydrolyzed by UL84, we sought to further define the ability of the enzyme to utilize alternative NTPs as well as characterize UL84 enzyme kinetics. NTP hydrolysis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the Vmax and Km values were calculated based on hyperbolic fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression (Prism 4.3). Although UL84 was able to utilize all NTPs, the enzyme was able to hydrolyze UTP to the highest degree (Fig. 3D). Reactions were performed using activated calf thymus DNA and CTP, UTP, GTP, or ATP as substrates in the reaction mixture. The Vmax value for UTP was ∼6-fold higher than that observed for CTP (Fig. 3D). Vmax values for ATP and GTP were significantly lower (5.454 and 3.768 pmol/min, respectively) than that measured for UTP (Fig. 2D). The calculated Km values for UTP and CTP were similar (3.8 and 3.7 mm, respectively), as were the Km values for ATP and GTP (1.1 and 1.9 mm, respectively). These data indicate that although UL84 can utilize all NTPs, UL84 displayed a preference for UTP as determined by the Vmax to Km ratio that is 6-fold higher for UTP than CTP (Fig. 3D). UL84 Enzymatic Characteristics—We next investigated the buffer constituents and reaction conditions that contributed to the activity of UL84. First, we wanted to determine the optimal pH at which UL84 is most active. UTPase assays were preformed using the standard buffer except various pH values were used. The UTPase activity of UL84 was determined at pH values ranging from 6 to 8.5 (Fig. 4A). Optimal activity was observed at a pH value of 7.5, and the optimal range was determined to be between pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 4A). We also investigated the affect of lowered or increased temperature on UL84 UTPase activity. We found that UL84 activity increased with respect to temperatures up to 45 °C (Fig. 4B). The UTPase activity of UL84 using various concentrations of either NaCl or KCl was also examined. Independent of the salt used, we observed a decrease in activity at concentrations above 20 mm (Fig. 4C). This decrease continued and became more severe at NaCl concentrations of 250 mm (Fig. 4C). KCl has less of an effect on enzyme activity, in that UTP hydrolysis decreased only slightly even at KCl concentrations of 200 mm (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that higher concentrations of NaCl may disrupt some essential tertiary order structure of UL84. UL84 was also found to prefer Mg2+ as the divalent cation required for the reaction. Mn2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ were also able to catalyze the reaction to a lesser degree, respectively (Fig. 4D). Mg2+ is commonly the divalent cation of choice for DExD/H box proteins and most helicases. Herpesvirus lytic DNA replication involves a cis-acting origin and a set of transacting factors. Lytic origins are quite diverse among the herpesviruses. For the prototypical alphaherpesvirus, HSV-1, the minimal lytic origin contains A+T rich regions and DNA elements that interact with the OBP UL9 (34Weir H.M. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Olivo P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The HSV-1 lytic origin and the mechanism of initiation are the best characterized of the herpesviruses. The lytic origins for the gammaherpesviruses, EBV and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), appear to be more complex than the HSV-1 lytic origin. These origins contain strong promoters/enhancers and initiate DNA synthesis possibly through a step that involves transcription or the formation of RNA primers (39Hammerschmidt W. Sugden B. Cell. 1988; 55: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 40Schepers A. Pich D. Mankertz J. Hammerschmidt W. J.

Colletti K.S. Cei S.A. Papouskova I. Tarrant M. Pari G.S. Virology. 2004; 318: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to the presence of these strong promoters, HHV8 and EBV lytic origins contain distinct DNA elements that also interact with initiator proteins. These initiator proteins, Zta for EBV and ORF50 and K-bZIP for HHV8, interact with response elements that exist within the oriLyt regions (42AuCoin D.P. Colletti K.S. Cei S.A. Papouskova I.

Virol. 2004; 78: 8615-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The HCMV mechanism of oriLyt recognition and initiation appears to have similarities to both the alphaherpesviruses, and the gammaherpesviruses, however, is distinct from both groups. The most notable feature of the HCMV oriLyt is a region that contains an RNA-DNA hybrid structure (47Prichard M.N. Jairath S. Penfold M.E. St. Jeor S. Bohlman M.C. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6997-7004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region is adjacent to a stretch of DNA that contains a strong UL84/IE2-responsive promoter. Although the function of this RNA-DNA structure is unknown, it could act as a specific substrate for a UL84 putative helicase activity. The first evidence that UL84 has an enzymatic function was presented here by our data. We propose that UL84 is a helicase based on a high degree of amino acid homology to RNA or DNA helicases/unwindases belonging to the DExD/H box family. Although helicases in this family are a diverse group, UL84 appears to have close identity to the DExD/H motifs of other DNA virus initiators proteins from HSV-1, polyoma, and papillomaviruses as is demonstrated by the homology of the Walker B motifs of UL84 to UL9, E1-11, and SV40 large T-antigen. Walker A and B sites are involved in NTP binding and hydrolysis (31Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and are present in the majority of RNA helicases as well as many DNA synthesis initiator proteins. For UL84, amino acid analysis clearly indicates the presence of the consensus motifs for Walker A and B sites in addition to Ia, IV, and V. Interestingly, although UL84 has a high degree of homology to motifs Ia, II (Walker B), IV, and V, which are all found at the C-terminal portion of the protein, motif I (Walker A) of UL84 is less conserved and is found at the N terminus of the protein. UL84 does not contain motif VI, which was also implicated in NTP hydrolysis (48Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1849-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These deviations may have implications for UL84 efficiency of catalysis or may indicate the need for a binding partner to supply additional sites of NTP hydrolysis for the enzyme to function efficiently. Currently, there is no direct evidence that UL84 binds nucleic acid or exhibits strong nucleic acid dependence for enzymatic function; however, the protein does contain both the helicase motifs and an RGG box suggesting a preference for RNA or an RNA-DNA hybrid structure. UL9 exhibits strong stimulation with poly(dT)6000, yet shows no stimulation with poly(dA)4000 (2Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic of UL9 indicates not only a preference for ssDNA but also for a specific ssDNA structure. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that UL84 interacts with regions within oriLyt 2K. S. Colletti, Y. Xu, I. Yamboliev, and G. S. Pari, unpublished results. suggesting that other proteins (viral or cellular) may be involved. SV40 large T-antigen (T-ag) was shown to have RNA un-winding activity, and this activity was powered by hydrolysis of non-ATP nucleosides such as UTP, which is also a characteristic of UL84 (18Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 49Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). SV40 large T-antigen also shares epitopes with cellular RNA helicases and other DExD/H-box proteins again similar to UL84 (49Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of SV40 T-antigen, this protein is active as a double hexamer. For papillomavirus E1 the double hexamer conformation is stabilized by E2 and these two proteins display helicase and NTPase activity (24Abbate E.A. Berger J.M. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1981-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). UL84 is also present as an oligomer in infected cells suggesting that the formation of a hexamer structure is possible. DNA replication is a tightly regulated process and phosphorylation of OBPs is a mechanism by which DNA viruses control the initiation of DNA synthesis. In this respect, UL9, Zta, Orf50, K-bZip, T-ag, and E1 proteins are all phosphoproteins. Phosphorylation is directly related to regulation of molecular interactions of Zta, T-ag, and E1 OBPs with their substrates (5Isler J.A. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16El-Guindy A.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7634-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Reese D.K. Sreekumar K.R.

Virol. 2002; 76: 11785-11792Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that UL9 ATPase activity is increased 5-8-fold upon phosphorylation by PKA (6Bronstein J.C. Weber P.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). T-ag and E1 require the phosphorylation of specific amino acids to bind DNA, whereas Zta phosphorylation by CKII inhibits its interaction with DNA (16El-Guindy A.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7634-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation site required for DNA binding of E1 is in close proximity to a highly charged region of the protein. UL84 contains a highly charged region that is quite similar to this structure and contains potentially phosphorylated serine residues adjacent to this region. Although, at present we do not know if phosporylation of UL84 contributes to activity, it is clear that the fact that UL84 is phosphorylated suggests that it may be a key factor in the regulation of viral DNA synthesis. The mechanism and biological affects of UL84 phosphorylation will be a subject of future study. The Km of UL84 for hydrolysis of UTP is well within the established range for DExD/H helicases (50Kim J. Parker J.S. Murray K.E. Nibert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4394-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), especially dsRNA helicases; although, in comparison to UL9, the Km of UL84 is consistent with the unstimulated ATPase Km for UL9 (0.64 mm) (37Marintcheva B. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6605-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This may indicate that UL84 is more analogous to the RNA helicases. Other explanations for a minimal increase in activity upon the addition of nucleic acids include the possibility that we have not found the correct nucleic acid cofactor or that the protein is highly regulated by phosphorylation. Most helicases, including DExD/H proteins, are sensitive to high salt concentrations as was demonstrated with UL84. They also tend to function most efficiently at a pH between 7 and 8 or at a physiological pH, increase NTPase activity with respect to temperatures that are higher than physiological temperatures but do not denature proteins, and prefer Mg2+ as the divalent cation required for the reaction. UL84 was found to have all of these characteristics and may indicate a novel replication mechanism for herpesviruses. We thank Dr. Debbie Parris for her guidance with the NTPase assays and Dr. William Welch for helpful discussions on protein biochemistry. We are also grateful to Yali Zhu for help with technical issues regarding UTPase activity of UL84."

In this paper, we have identified the 32P-labeled 85-kDa protein as mtGAT. We have also investigated whether the phosphorylation of mtGAT is because of CK2. Mitochondria were treated with CK2 and [γ-32P]GTP as the phosphate donor. Autoradiography, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation results showed mtGAT was phosphorylated by CK2. Next, we incubated mitochondria with CK2 and either ATP or GTP, in the presence of heparin, a known inhibitor of CK2. Heparin inhibited CK2-induced stimulation of mtGAT activity; this inhibition resulted in decreased 32P-labeling of mtGAT. Additionally, mitochondria were treated with CK2 and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of staurosporine (a serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor), genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, a CK2 inhibitor). Only DRB, the CK2 inhibitor, greatly reduced the amount of 32P-incorporation into mtGAT by CK2. Finally, isolated mitochondrial outer membrane was incubated with cytosol in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP; 32P-labeled mtGAT was detected.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).One enzyme that resides in the MOM is glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (mtGAT), which catalyzes the first step in de novo glycerolipid biosynthesis via the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate at the sn-1 position to produce lysophosphatidic acid. Lysophosphatidic acid, synthesized at the outer surface of the MOM, can be exported to the endoplasmic reticulum and used for the synthesis of complex phospholipids and triacylglycerol (7Haldar D. Lipfert L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11014-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Igal R.A. Wang S. Gonzalez-Baro M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

The phosphatidic acid is transported to the mitochondrial inner membrane for cardiolipin synthesis (9Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the microsomal isoform, which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, mtGAT is insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, such as N-ethylmaleimide, and exhibits substrate specificity for saturated acyl-CoA as the acyl donor (10Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has been purified (11Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27209-27215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cDNA has been cloned (12Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D. Pandalai S.G.

Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The location of mtGAT makes it a key factor in diverting fatty acids from undergoing β-oxidation inside the mitochondria to fatty acid utilization for biosynthetic processes (14Haldar D. Kelker H.C. Pullman M.E. Trans. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 41: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Linden D. William-Olsson L. Rhedin M. Asztely A.K. Clapham J.C. Schreyer S. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1279-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its substrate specificity contributes to the asymmetric distribution of fatty acids in phospholipids and can control the quality of phospholipids necessary for the formation of biomembranes (16Onorato T.M. Chakraborty S. Balija V.S. Haldar D. Das S.K. LIPIDS: Glycerolipid Metabolizing Enzymes. Research Signpost, Trivandrum2002Google Scholar, 17Agarwal A.K. Garg A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 214-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Indirect evidence has been compiled for the posttranslational regulation of this MOM enzyme, mtGAT. First, discordancy exists between mtGAT mRNA levels, protein levels, and enzymatic activity. For example, liver and adipose tissue express high mRNA levels and low protein levels yet have high mtGAT activity; whereas heart and adrenal glands have low mRNA levels and high protein levels but low mtGAT activity (18Lewin T.M. Granger D.A. Kim J.H. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Secondly, 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits mtGAT activity. The treatment of cultured rat hepatocytes with 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside, an activator of AMPK, inhibited mtGAT activity (29-43%). Recombinant AMPK1 and AMPK2 inhibited mtGAT activity 30-50% in isolated rat liver mitochondria (19Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thirdly, we have previously found, by ProSite analysis, that the mtGAT amino acid sequence contains several putative consensus sequences for casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation. We have shown that CK2 stimulates mtGAT activity (40-68%), this stimulation is reversed by protein phosphatase-λ treatment, and that an ∼85-kDa protein, the molecular mass of purified rat liver mtGAT, is 32P-labeled in CK2-treated mitochondria (20Onorato T.M. Haldar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Most recently, West et al. (21West L. Kannan L. Onorato T.M. Knudsen J. Haldar D. Jolly C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that CK2 increased GAT activity in mitochondria isolated from unstimulated Jurkat cells and further increased GAT activity in mitochondria isolated from stimulated Jurkat cells.Presently, we have investigated whether the stimulation of mtGAT by CK2 was because of the phosphorylation of the acyltransferase itself or the phosphorylation of another protein such as a stimulant protein associated with the MOM (11Vancura A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27209-27215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also wanted to determine whether this phosphorylation is result of CK2. Here we have identified the 32P-labeled 85-kDa protein as mtGAT by Western blot and immunoprecipitation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). sn-[2-3H]Glycerol-3-phosphate, purchased from American Radiobiochemicals, Inc.

Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was maintained at 18 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213426) Google Scholar). The purity of the mitochondria was assessed by performing the GAT assay in the presence of 4 mm N-ethylmaleimide; microsomal contamination was always less then 5%.Preparation of ATP and GTP—Mg2+-ATP and Mg2+-GTP stocks were prepared according to Ref. 23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar, with a slight modification allowing for the addition of magnesium. ATP or GTP (20 mm) was prepared and diluted 1:1 with 20 mm MgCl2 to obtain 10 mm Mg2+-ATP or 10 mm Mg2+-GTP stocks which were stored at -20 °C.Preparation of Heparin Stock—A heparin stock was prepared by dissolving heparin in deionized water to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (24Trembley J.H. Hu D. Slaughter C.A. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2265-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Before experiments, the heparin stock was further diluted with deionized water to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, which was added to the reaction mixtures to obtain the indicated heparin concentrations.Isolation of MOM—Rat liver MOM was isolated by the osmotic swelling method according to Ref. 25Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1966; 137: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar. The crude MOM pellet was resuspended in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient consisting of 3.6 ml each of 25.2, 37.7, and 51.3% sucrose in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h in a SW-41Ti rotor. The 25.2/37.7% interface was collected using a 3-ml syringe fitted with a 22.5-gauge needle, diluted 4 times with deionized water, centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 60 min in a JA25.50 rotor, suspended in S.E. (0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and stored at -80 °C. The cytochrome c oxidase assay was performed on the isolated MOM, mitochondrial inner membrane, mitoplasts, and whole mitochondria to determine the purity of the mitochondrial outer membrane preparation. Cytochrome c oxidase activity, as determined using kit purchased from Sigma Chemicals, indicated less than 15% contamination of MOM with inner membrane (data not shown).The GAT Assay—The GAT assay was performed as described previously by measuring the amount of sn-[2-3H]-glycerol-3-phosphate incorporated into 1-butanol-extractable phospholipids, lysophosphatidic acid, and phosphatidic acid (26Haldar D. Tso W.W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asolectin was omitted from the incubation medium. Each assay was initiated by the addition of mitochondria (160 μg).Incubation of Mitochondria with CK2—Mitochondria were incubated with ATP and CK2 as described previously (20Onorato T.M. Haldar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For CK2 inhibition assays, mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 0, 2, 10, 15, 25, and 50 μg/ml heparin (27Tuteja N. Reddy M.K. Mudgil Y. Yadav B.S. Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K.

Alternatively, mitochondria were incubated with rat liver cytosol (53 or 106 μg) instead of CK2. The same conditions were followed for assays in which GTP was substituted for ATP.Phosphorylation of mtGAT with [γ-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]GTP, and CK2— Mitochondria (200 μg) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (5μCi, 200 μm) and CK2 as described previously (20Onorato T.M. Haldar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The samples were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min (Eppendorf 5410). The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min; 150 μg was loaded onto a 1.5-mm mini SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%), run at a constant current of 30 mA for 1 h at 4°C, transferred to Sequiblot PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted as described below. Another gel was stained with Simply Blue according to the manufacturer's protocol and dried for 2 h in a Bio-Rad gel dryer (model 583). After immunoblotting, the membrane was rinsed 2 times with deionized water and exposed at -80 °C to Kodak BioMax MS film in a cassette with an intensifying screen for 48 h. Kodak GBX developer and fixer solutions were used for developing both immunoblot and autoradiography films. The same conditions were used when [γ-32P]GTP was substituted for [γ-32P]ATP.Immunodetection of mtGAT Using IM1GAT Antibody—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a Sequiblot PVDF membrane at a constant voltage of 80 V for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunodetection was performed using the protein detector Western blot kit LumiGLO system, according to manufacturer's protocol, with the following modifications: the PVDF membrane was rocked overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) and a 1:2000 dilution of secondary anti-rabbit antibody was used. The primary antibody used was IM1GAT, an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody synthesized against N-terminal amino acid sequence CGHYNGEQLGKPKKNES by GeneMed Synthesis, Inc. The membrane was placed in a cassette with intensifying screens and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film.Immunoprecipitation of 32P-Labeled mtGAT with IM1GAT Antibody—Whole mitochondria (700 μg) or MOM (200 μg) were treated with CK2 and [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The mitochondria were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at top speed for 5 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria and MOM were solubilized in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2), incubated on ice for 15 min, rotated overnight at 4 °C with IM1GAT antibody (10 μg). Protein A/G plus-agarose (20 μl) was added, and the mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 60 min. The agarose pellet was washed 2 times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 ml), suspended in 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1.5-mm thick SDS-PAGE (7.5%) minigel. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described above. For heparin experiments, mitochondria were treated as above in the presence of 0, 2, 15, or 50 μg/ml heparin. The above experiments were repeated with [γ-32P]GTP as well. For the experiment involving various protein kinase inhibitors, Me2SO (control for solvent), DRB (200 μm), staurosporine (200 nm), or genistein (500 μm) was present in the reaction, and only [γ-32P]ATP was used.Phosphorylation of MOM Proteins with [γ-32P]GTP, CK2, and Rat Liver Cytosol—MOM (200 μg) was incubated for 60 min on ice with [γ-32P]GTP (5 μCi, 200 μm) and CK2 buffer, [γ-32P]GTP (5 μCi, 200 μm), CK2 buffer, and 0.15 μm CK2, or [γ-32P]GTP (5μCi, 200 μm), CK2 buffer, and cytosol (53 μg) in a 50-μl reaction volume. In addition, cytosol (150 μg) was incubated on ice for 60 min with [γ-32P]GTP (5 μCi, 200 μm) and CK2 buffer in a 50-μl reaction volume. The reaction mixture was transferred to a Microcon-10 microconcentrator and centrifuged at 12,500 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added to the Microcon-10 column and centrifuged for an additional 2 h. The Microcon-10 column was inverted and pulse-centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 s to collect the retentate. The MOM pellets were suspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and the cytosol was suspended in 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer (1:2), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 1.5-mm thick mini SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%).NetPhos 2.0 Analysis—NetPhos (version 2.0) is an artificial neural network that predicts sites for serine, threonine, or tyrosine phosphorylation in eukaryotic proteins (30Blom N.

The amino acid sequence deduced from rat liver mtGAT cDNA was analyzed for potential phosphorylation sites containing serine or threonine residues irrespective of consensus sequences for kinase phosphorylation sites. Results are returned indicating the position of the serine or threonine, the +4 and -4 flanking amino acids, the score (0.000-1.000), and the predicted serines or threonines for phosphorylation.

Haldar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We further tested, by using another bioinformatics program, NetPhos 2.0 (30Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), these consensus sequences with respect to all potential S/T residues that can be phosphorylated within the mtGAT amino acid sequence. Eleven of the 14 putative CK2 consensus sequences found previously were within the NetPhos 2.0-predicted S/T phosphorylation sites (Table I). Each of the NetPhos 2.0-predicted S/T phosphorylation sites was subjected to a protein BLAST search for short exact matches. Only one site showed homology with a protein kinase C and CK2 substrate protein 3 in Mus musculus (accession number Q99JB8) and a similar protein in Rattus norvegicus (accession number XP_230279). The result of the BLAST search suggests that the NetPhos 2.0-predicted site (ITHTSRKDE), within rat mtGAT, is a likely target for CK2 phosphorylation, because it shares homology to another CK2 substrate, CK2 substrate protein 3.Table IComparison of ProSite-predicted and NetPhos 2.0-predicted phosphorylation sites within the mtGAT amino acid sequence Only NetPhos 2.0 phosphorylation sites above the threshold value (0.500) are represented.

The IM1GAT antibody was raised against an oligopeptide corresponding to amino acids 362-377 of the N-terminal region of mtGAT. IM1GAT IgG was shown previously (32Balija V.S. Chakraborty T.R. Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31668-31673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to immunoreact with GAT in mitochondria isolated from rat liver and COS-1 cells expressing the recombinant protein. We wanted to determine the suitability of IM1GAT for Western analysis. Rat liver mitochondria (150 μg), MOM (150 μg), and cytosol (150 μg) fractions were analyzed for the presence of mtGAT by Western blot with the IM1GAT antibody. An immunoreactive band of ∼85 kDa was detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1, lane 4). A band of ∼10 times greater intensity appeared in the MOM fraction (Fig. 1, lane 5), and, as expected, no band was detected in the cytosolic fraction (lane 6). Lanes 1-3 of Fig. 1 represent the Simply Blue-stained gel for the mitochondrial, MOM, and cytosolic sample, respectively. When Yet et al. (33Yet S.F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) immunoblotted mouse liver mitochondria with an antibody raised against a trpE-p90 fusion protein, two bands close in molecular weight were detected. They attributed the lower band to a proteolytic degradation product resulting from storage of the mitochondria. Also, the lower bands seen in isolated MOM fractions could arise from the isolation procedure. Isolation of MOM involves osmotic swelling and rupture. During this process proteases inside the mitochondria, not normally in contact with cleavage sites of mtGAT, may interact with mtGAT resulting in its cleavage. For example, an ATP-dependent, vanadate-sensitive endoprotease is present in rat liver mitochondria and localized primarily to the matrix followed by the intermembrane space (34Desautels M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11673-11679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Smac/DIABLO, a protein redundant to mammalian serine protease Omi/HtrA2, is located in the intermembrane space and abundantly expressed in the heart, liver, kidney, and testes (35van Gurp M. Festjens N. van Loo G. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Another possibility for the lower molecular weight bands in the MOM is that the IM1GAT antibody nonspecifically recognizes AGPAT, the acyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of phosphatidic acid from lysophosphatidic acid. GAT and AGPAT isoforms share a high degree of amino acid similarity; however, AGPAT isoforms have low molecular masses (30-40 kDa) (36Lewin T.M. Schwerbrock N.M. Lee D.P. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13488-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The IM1GAT antibody is polyclonal and may recognize AGPAT with less affinity and irreproducibility. This would explain why in some circumstances a lower molecular mass band around 40 kDa is present. As with GAT, AGPAT is present in low abundance in the MOM; therefore, the likelihood that AGPAT would be detected in isolated MOM versus whole mitochondria is enhanced. However, these results indicate that the IM1GAT antibody recognizes mtGAT with relatively high specificity and is suitable for Western analysis.Fig. 1Immunodetection of GAT from isolated rat liver mitochondria with IM1GAT antibody. Rat liver mitochondria (∼150 μg), MOM (∼150 μg), and cytosol (∼150 μg) were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with IM1GAT antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Although the 32P-labeled 85-kDa band appeared only in the CK2-treated mitochondria (Fig. 2A, left panel), immunoreactive bands of equivalent intensities were present in both untreated and CK2-treated mitochondria (Fig. 2A, right panel). We correlated Western blot data with immunoprecipitation to determine whether the 32P-labeled 85-kDa protein is mtGAT.

https://openalex.org/W2084078491,"Collagen type II is an extracellular matrix protein important for cartilage and bone formation, and its expression is controlled by multiple cis- and trans-acting elements, including the zinc finger transcription factor αA-crystallin-binding protein 1 (CRYBP1). Here we show that MSX2-interacting nuclear target protein (MINT), a conserved transcriptional repressor, associates with CRYBP1 and negatively regulates the transactivation of the collagen type II gene (Col2a1) enhancer. We identified CRYBP1 as a binding partner of MINT by screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. We demonstrated that the C terminus of MINT interacts with the C terminus of CRYBP1 using the mammalian cell two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Furthermore, MINT and CRYBP1 form a complex on the Col2a1 enhancer, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays. In the presence of CRYBP1, overexpression of MINT or its C-terminal fragment in cells repressed a reporter construct driven by the Col2a1 enhancer elements. This transcription repression is dependent on histone deacetylase, the main co-repressor recruited by MINT. The present study shows that MINT is involved in CRYBP1-mediated Col2a1 gene repression and may play a role in regulation of cartilage development. Collagen type II is an extracellular matrix protein important for cartilage and bone formation, and its expression is controlled by multiple cis- and trans-acting elements, including the zinc finger transcription factor αA-crystallin-binding protein 1 (CRYBP1). Here we show that MSX2-interacting nuclear target protein (MINT), a conserved transcriptional repressor, associates with CRYBP1 and negatively regulates the transactivation of the collagen type II gene (Col2a1) enhancer. We identified CRYBP1 as a binding partner of MINT by screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. We demonstrated that the C terminus of MINT interacts with the C terminus of CRYBP1 using the mammalian cell two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Furthermore, MINT and CRYBP1 form a complex on the Col2a1 enhancer, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays. In the presence of CRYBP1, overexpression of MINT or its C-terminal fragment in cells repressed a reporter construct driven by the Col2a1 enhancer elements. This transcription repression is dependent on histone deacetylase, the main co-repressor recruited by MINT. The present study shows that MINT is involved in CRYBP1-mediated Col2a1 gene repression and may play a role in regulation of cartilage development. Cartilage is a translucent dense connective tissue functioning in both adult body and embryos where it acts as a model for endochondral ossification. There are essentially three types of cartilages, namely, the hyaline cartilage, the white fibrocartilage, and the yellow or elastic cartilage. Collagen type II is the predominant extracellular matrix component in the hyaline cartilage. The collagen type II gene (Col2a1) is expressed primarily by proliferating chondrocytes but not by hypertrophic chondrocytes (1Cheah K.S. Lau E.T. Au P.K. Tam P.P. Development. 1991; 111: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the human Col2a1 causes skeletal abnormalities characterized by changes in extracellular matrix structure and morphology of cartilage and the growth plate, demonstrating the importance of proper expression of Col2a1 for the formation and integrity of these structures (2Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of Col2a1 is mediated by cis-acting tissue-specific regulatory elements located within the promoter and the first intron enhancer, and trans-acting factors recruited to the promoter and the enhancer (3de Crombrugghe B.

Metab. 2002; 20: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using transgenic mice as well as cultured cells, it has been demonstrated that, within the first intron of the Col2α1 gene, a 48-bp segment containing three repeats of a consensus sequence recognized by high mobility group-domain proteins is the minimal sequence sufficient for high level and cell type-specific expression of Col2a1 in chondrocytes (5Krebsbach P.H.

Several transcription factors, including SOX9 (Sry-type high mobility group box) have been shown to bind to these high mobility group-like motifs and transactivate Col2a1 expression (10Huang W.

SOX9 is a high mobility group domain transcription factor that is expressed in all cartilage primordia and cartilages during embryonic development, coincident with the expression of Col2a1 (12Wright E.

In chondrocytes as well as non-chondrocytic cells such as fibroblasts, SOX9 binds to and transactivates the Col2a1 enhancer and a number of other chondrocyte-specific enhancers, supporting that SOX9 may work as a master gene for chondrogenesis (11Lefebvre V.

Moreover, targeted disruption of SOX9 in mouse lead to severe abnormalities in cartilage and skeleton development (21Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat.

In addition to SOX9, two other high mobility group domain transcription factors, SOX5L and SOX6L, are also implicated in regulation of Col2a1 expression and chondrogenesis (23Smits P. Li P. Mandel J.

CRYBP1 has two sets of C2-H2 type zinc finger domains located in the N and C termini, respectively, and was initially identified by its ability to interact with a functionally important sequence in the mouse αA-crystallin gene promoter (24Brady J.P.

Homologs of the mouse CRYBP1 have been identified in Drosophila (Schnurri) (27Arora K. Dai H. Kazuko S.G. Jamal J. O'Connor M.B. Letsou A. Warrior R.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14591-14593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a conserved role of CRYBP1 through development. The full-length CRYBP1 gene encodes a 300-kDa protein. However, alternatively spliced mRNA also generates truncated molecules, including a 200-kDa N-terminal fragment, and 68-, 50-, and 90-kDa fragments containing the C-terminal zinc finger (32Muchardt C. Seeler J.-S. Nirula A. Shurland D.-L. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 244-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kantorow M. Becker K. Sax C.M. Ozato K. Piatigorsky J. Gene. 1993; 131: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The function of these molecules are elusive, but Tanaka et al. (25Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 4428-4435Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that expression of a C-terminal fragment (2023–2688) of CRYBP1 in NIH3T3 or a rat chondrosarcoma cell line inhibits Col2a1 enhancer, which is transactivated by SOX9. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that CRYBP1 binds to a specific sequence within the Col2a1 enhancer and inhibits the binding of SOX9 to the enhancer. Recently, Yamagiwa et al. (34Yamagiwa H. Yamada Y. Bolander M.E. Sarkar G. Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 28: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided further evidence to support that CRYBP1 binds to the Col2a1 enhancer and represses its transactivation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CRYBP1-mediated repression of Col2a1 has not yet been elucidated. MINT (MSX2-interacting nuclear target protein) is a nuclear matrix protein originally cloned as an interacting protein of MSX2, a homeodomain transcription repressor functioning in the craniofacial skeletal and neural development (35Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MINT belongs to the Spen (split end) protein family, which plays an essential role in multiple developmental events (36Wiellette E.L. Harding K.W. Mace K.A. Ronshaugen M.R. Wang F.Y. McGinnis W. Development. 1999; 126: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chen F. Rebay I. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 943-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Kuang B. Wu S.C. Shin Y. Luo L. Kolodziej P. Development. 2000; 127: 1517-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spen proteins vary in a wide range in size (90–600 kDa), but are nevertheless characterized by a conserved domain structure, including three repeated RNA recognition motifs near the N terminus and a conserved SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal domain) domain at the C terminus, which mediates interaction with the SMRT/NcoR co-repressors (39Ariyoshi M. Schwabe J.W.R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The human homolog of MINT, SHARP, has been identified as a component in transcriptional repression complexes recruited by nuclear receptors (40Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The MINT/SHARP-mediated repression was sensitive to the HDAC inhibitor TSA, and SHARP is a novel component of the HDAC co-repressor complex, suggesting that MINT/SHARP represses transcription in an HDAC-dependent fashion (40Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, Kuroda et al. (41Oswald F. Kostezka U. Astrahantseff K. Bourteele S. Dillinger K. Zechner U. Ludwig L. Wilda M. Hameister H. Knochel W. Liptay S. Schmid R.M.

Honjo T. Immunity. 2003; 18: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MINT also interacts with RBP-J, a key transcription factor downstream of Notch receptor, and represses the RBP-J-mediated transactivation by competing for the binding site and by recruiting co-repressors, including SMRT/N-CoR and HDAC, and may thus regulate the Notch signaling pathway. Kuroda et al. (42Kuroda K. Han H. Tani S. Tanigaki K. Tun T. Furukawa T. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Hamada Y. Toyokuni S. Honjo T. Immunity. 2003; 18: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) also showed that targeted disruption of MINT lead to embryonic lethality, with a developmental retardation of multiple organs. However, as a widely expressed protein, possible functions of MINT in other systems remain to be revealed. In the present study, we identify CRYBP1 as a MINT-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. We show that MINT physically interacts with CRYBP1 in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and EMSA showed that MINT and CRYBP1 forms a complex with a specific sequence within the Col2a1 enhancer. In co-transfection experiments, MINT or its C-terminal fragment represses the transactivation of Col2a1 enhancer through association with the C terminus of CRYBP1 in an HDAC-dependent fashion. Our data suggest that MINT take part in CRYBP1-mediated transcription repression of Col2a1 by recruiting HDAC, and may therefore regulate cartilage development. Plasmids—Bait plasmids for the yeast two-hybrid assay were constructed by inserting different fragments of the full-length MINT cDNA (generously provided by T. Honjo) into pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (pGBK-MINTF1-F6, amino acids 1–364, 365–1016, 1017–1663, 1664–2225, 2226–2959, and 2960–3576, respectively). MINTF6 was further truncated into two segments and inserted into pGBKT7 (pGBK-MINTF6-N, amino acids 2960–3214, and pGBK-MINTF6-C, amino acids 3215–3576). Prey plasmids containing the C terminus of CRYBP1 (CRYBP1-C, amino acid 2018–2688, see “Results”) were generated by cloning CRYBP1-C into pGADT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (pGADT7-CRYBP1-C). This fragment was further divided into two fragments and inserted into pGADT7 (pGADT7-CRYBP1-C1, amino acids 2018–2469, and pGADT7-CRYBP1-C2, amino acids 2470–2688). Plasmids for the mammalian two-hybrid assay were generated by subcloning MINTF6 and MINTF6-C fragments into pCMX-GAL4DBD (pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6 and pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6-C, respectively). CRYBP1-C was inserted into pCMX-VP16(NLS) to construct pCMX-VP16-CRYBP1-C. Expression vectors pCMV-Myc-MINTF6, pCMV-FLAG-CRYBP1-C, and pCMV-HA-CRYBP1-C expressing the Myc-tagged MINTF6, FLAG-tagged CRYBP1-C, and HA-tagged CRYBP1, respectively, were generated by subcloning MINTF6 and CRYBP1-C into pCMV-Myc, pCMV-FLAG2, and pCMV-HA vectors separately. pCMV-Myc-Luc construct was described previously (43Qin H. Wang J. Liang Y. Taniguchi Y. Tanigaki K. Han H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic vectors expressing His-Trx-tagged MINTF6-C (His-Trx-MINTF6-C) and GST-tagged CRYBP1-C (GST-CRYBP1-C) fusion proteins were constructed by inserting MINTF6-C and CRYBP1-C into pET32a (pET-MINTF6-C) and pGEX4T-2 (pGEX-CRYBP1-C), respectively. The mouse SOX9 was cloned by PCR with a mouse embryonic cDNA library as a template, using primers 5′-tcagggtctggtgagctgtgtgtagac-3′ and 5′-atgaatctcctggaccccttcatgaag-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned by T-cloning using pMD-18T (Takara, Dalian, China) and sequenced, and inserted into pCMV-FLAG2 to construct the expression vector pCMV-FLAG-SOX9. The reporter construct for the Col2a1 enhancer (pGL3-Col2α1) was generated according to Tanaka et al. (25Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 4428-4435Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Three repeats of the core sequence of the Col2a1 enhancer (5′-tgtatgcgcttgagaaaagccccattcatgaga-3′) was synthesized and inserted into pGL3-promoter (Pro-mega). TK MH100×4 Luc used in the mammalian two-hybrid assay was described previously (44Sierra O.L. Cheng S.-L. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32913-32923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All the newly constructed plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To screen a cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system, the bait plasmid (pGBK-MINTF6) was used to co-transform the yeast strain AH109 with a mouse embryonic cDNA library constructed in pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene) using the LiAc method. The resulting yeast clones were plated on SD/-Trp-Leu plates, and then selected on SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade plates. Single colonies were subjected to membrane β-galactosidase assay. Plasmid DNA was recovered from positive clones and sequenced after amplification in Escherichia coli. To test protein-protein interaction in yeast, bait and prey plasmids were co-transformed into yeast AH109 and plated on SD/-Trp-Leu plates. Grown colonies were tested for nutritional phenotypes. Positive clones were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and lysed by repeated freeze and thaw in liquid nitrogen. The membrane was incubated at 37 °C with X-gal to test the activity of β-galactosidase. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, 293T, NIH3T3, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was allowed to proceed for 6 h, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum was added. Cells were collected for further experiments later. GST Pull-down Assay—His-Trx-MINTF6-C and GST-CRYBP1-C fusion proteins were produced in E. coli using pET-MINTF6-C and pGEX-CRYBP1-C, respectively. Fusion proteins as well as control proteins (His-Trx and GST) were purified by the Ni2+-chelating resin (Invitrogen) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, following the supplier's protocols. An GST-pull-down assay was performed as described previously (43Qin H. Wang J. Liang Y. Taniguchi Y. Tanigaki K. Han H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells (293T) cultured in 6-cm dishes were co-transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-Myc-MINTF6 and pCMV-FLAG-CRYBP1-C, with pCMV-Luc-Myc expressing a Myc-tagged luciferase as a negative control. Cell lysates were prepared 60 h after the transfection, and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (43Qin H. Wang J. Liang Y. Taniguchi Y. Tanigaki K. Han H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids for 48 h, and fixed by addition of formaldehyde to 1%. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and then collected by centrifugation after scraping. Cells were resuspended in an SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and disrupted by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and diluted in a ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors as above. Chromatin was pre-cleared with the salmon sperm DNA-coated protein A-agarose, followed by immunoprecipitation using 5 μg of anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Antibody complexes were collected with the salmon sperm DNA-coated protein A-agarose, followed by extensive washing with the ChIP dilution buffer. Precipitated ChIP complexes were reverse cross-linked by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h. The samples were then treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 42 °C, and the precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-agagctctgtatgcgcttgaga-3′ and 5′-aagatctcatgaatggggcttt-3′). Preimmune serum was used as a negative control. EMSA—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-CRYBP1-C and/or pEF-BOS-MINT, and collected 48 h after transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending cells (1 × 107) in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, incubating on ice for 10 min, and homogenizing. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatants with nuclear proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The Col2a1 enhancer probe was generated by PCR using primers 5′-aagatctcatgaatggggcttt-3′ and 5′-cagatctcacagaatggaggaa-3′, and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear proteins (3 μg) were incubated with 35 fmol of the labeled probe, and DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm disodium EDTA·2H2O) with 2.5% glycerol. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For competition and antibody supershift, unlabeled probes or 2 μg of the anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 1 h at room temperature before addition of the labeled probe. Reporter Assays—For the mammalian two-hybrid assay, cells were co-transfected with baits (pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6 and pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6-C) and the prey (pCMX-VP16-CRYBP1-C) plasmids, together with the reporter construct (TK MH100 × 4luc). Cells were collected 48 h after the transfection, and the luciferase activity was examined as described (43Qin H. Wang J. Liang Y. Taniguchi Y. Tanigaki K. Han H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1492-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency was calibrated by including pSV-β-galactosidase in transfections, followed by examining the β-galactosidase activity in cell lysates. Each experiment was repeated three times and data were analyzed with the Student's t test. To test transactivation of pGL3-Col2α1, cells were transfected with expression construct pCMV-FLAG-CRYBP1-C, pEFBOS-Myc-MINT, or pCMV-Myc-MINTF6, together with pGL3-Col2α1 and pSV-β-gal. Transfected cells were cultured for 40 h, followed by treatment with or without trichostatin A (TSA) for 6 h. Cells were collected and luciferase activity was examined. Identification of CRYBP1 as a Binding Protein of MINT Using the Yeast Two Hybrid Assay—MINT is a conserved and ubiquitously expressed transcription repressor that has been implicated in regulation of transcription mediated by nuclear receptors (40Shi Y.

To look at other functions of MINT, we tried to isolate other possible interacting proteins of MINT using the yeast two-hybrid system. With the C-terminal fragment of MINT (MINTF6, amino acids 2960–3576) as a bait, we picked up several potential MINT-interacting molecules. Upon DNA sequencing, one of them turned out to be the C-terminal fragment of CRYBP1 (CRYBP1-C, amino acids 2018–2688). Another clone was the C terminus of the SMRT/NcoR (data not shown), consistent with previous findings (39Ariyoshi M. Schwabe J.W.R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The isolated CRYBP1-C fragment was tested for interaction with other regions of MINT in yeast. The result showed that CRYBP1-C only interacted with MINTF6 (Fig. 1). To further specify regions mediating the interaction between MINT and CRYBP1, we truncated MINTF6 into MINTF6-N-(2906–3214) and MINTF6-C-(3215–3576) and tested their interaction with CRYBP1-C in yeast. The result showed that, although MINTF6-C retained the binding ability with CRYBP1-C, MINTF6-N did not. Moreover, CRYBP1-C was truncated into CRYBP1-C1-(2018–2469) and CRYBP1-C2-(2470–2688) and tested for interaction with MINTF-6 and its derivatives. The result showed that CRYBP1-C1 interacted with MINTF6-C (Fig. 1). Based on these observations, we concluded that the MINTF6-C-(3215–3576) fragment of MINT and the CRYBP1-C1-(2018–2469) fragment of CRYBP1 might be responsible for the interaction between the two molecules in yeast. Interaction between MINT and CRYBP1—To examine the interaction between MINTF6 and CRYBP1-C in mammalian cells, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assay by co-transfecting pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6 and pCMX-VP16-CRYBP1-C into COS-7 or HEK293 cells, together with a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a promoter containing multiple GAL4-binding sites (TK MH100 × 4 luc). Luciferase activity was examined in cell lysates 48 h after transfection. As show in Fig. 2 (A and B), although pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6 or pCMX-VP16-CRYBP1-C alone did not induce reporter gene expression in cells, co-transfection with the two plasmids stimulated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in both HEK 293 (Fig. 2A) and COS-7 (Fig. 2B) cells. Similarly, consistent with the results in yeast, pCMX-GAL4DBD-MINTF6-C and pCMX-VP16-CRYBP1-C showed positive interaction in HEK293 and COS-7 cells after co-transfection (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). The physical interaction between MINTF6 and CRYBP1-C was further tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Cells (293T) were co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-MINTF6 and pCMV-FLAG-CRYBP1-C, which express Myc-tagged MINTF6 and FLAG-tagged CRYBP1-C proteins, respectively. Whole cell extracts were prepared 60 h after transfection, and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, followed by immunoblotting wit"
https://openalex.org/W1984803247,"A variety of biochemical and structural studies indicate that two regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) polypurine tract (PPT)-containing RNA/DNA hybrid deviate from standard Watson-Crick geometry. However, it is unclear whether and how these regions cooperate to ensure PPT primer selection by reverse transcriptase-associated ribonuclease H and subsequent removal from nascent (+)-DNA. To address these issues, we synthesized oligonucleotides containing abasic lesions in either the PPT (+)-RNA primer or (–)-DNA template to locally remove nucleobases, although retaining the sugar-phosphate backbone. KMnO4 footprinting indicates such lesions locally alter duplex structure, whereas thermal melting studies show significantly reduced stability when lesions are positioned around the scissile bond. Substituting the (–)-DNA template between positions –15 and –13 altered cleavage specificity, whereas equivalent substitutions of the (+)-RNA had almost no effect. The unpaired base of the DNA template observed crystallographically (–11C) could also be removed without significant loss of cleavage specificity. With respect to the scissile –1/+1 phosphodiester bond, template nucleobases could be removed without loss of cleavage specificity, whereas equivalent lesions in the RNA primer were inhibitory. Our data suggest an interaction between the p66 thumb subdomain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the DNA template in the “unzipped” portion of the RNA/DNA hybrid could aid in positioning the ribonuclease H catalytic center at the PPT/U3 junction and also provides insights into nucleic acid geometry around the scissile bond required for hydrolysis.

Early NMR studies, using a short fragment of this hybrid, identified a 15° bend at the HIV-1 PPT/U3 junction (7Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the accuracy of cleavage. Subsequent crystallographic studies with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) bound to a PPT-containing hybrid indicated a pattern of weakened base pairing centered ∼13 bp upstream of the PPT/U3 junction (8Sarafianos S.G.

Interestingly, the distance between the PPT/U3 junction and the upstream region of weakened base pairing is close to the spatial separation between the p66 thumb subdomain and RNase H catalytic center of HIV-1 RT (8Sarafianos S.G.

These combined observations suggested that an induced fit between the HIV-1 RT thumb subdomain and the upstream portion of the PPT might position the RNase H catalytic center over the PPT/U3 junction. As a consequence, this would render intervening regions inaccessible and RNase H-resistant. Implicating regions upstream of the PPT/U3 junction in enzyme positioning (9Kvaratskhelia M. Budihas S.R.

Although the Ty3 PPT lacks the hallmark rA·dT and rC·dG homopolymeric stretches characteristic of retroviral (+)-strand primers (13Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), altering nucleic acid geometry 10–12 bp upstream of the PPT/U3 junction also affects the precision of PPT cleavage (14Lener D.

One approach to studying PPT cleavage specificity is by introducing structural changes in a manner preserving sequence and spatial context. As an example, we substituted the thymine analog 2,4-difluoro-5-methylbenzene and cytosine analog 2-fluoro-4-methylbenzene throughout the HIV-1 PPT (–)-DNA template to remove hydrogen bonding and locally increase flexibility (12Rausch J.W.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This approach indicated that the RNase H catalytic center could be relocated ∼4bp3′ of the site of analog insertion, indirectly implicating the “RNase H primer grip” of the p66 subunit (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) in positioning the scissile bond in the RNase H-active center. A similar approach with the Ty3 PPT relocated its RNase H catalytic center ∼12 bp downstream of the site of analog insertion (14Lener D. Kvaratskhelia M. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26526-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative structural elements of the retrotransposon enzyme may participate in PPT recognition. The converse strategy, i.e. decreasing local flexibility, was evaluated by introducing locked nucleic acid analogs (16Petersen M. Nielsen C.B. Nielsen K.E. Jensen G.A. Bondensgaard K. Singh S.K.

(19Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting two PPT cleavage modes, namely the PPT/U3 junction and ∼5 bp into the U3 region, the latter of which might contribute to efficient (+)-strand synthesis. Related studies evaluating the interaction of protein subdomains with nucleic acid exiting the DNA polymerase catalytic center (20Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

The “unzipped” portion of the HIV-1 PPT reported by Sarafianos et al. (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was of particular interest to us, because template base –11 and primer base –13 (defining position –1 as the base pair 5′ to the PPT/U3 junction, Fig. 1B) are unpaired, thereby enhancing the flexibility of this region. At the same time, we and others have noted that template base +1 of the HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus PPT is surprisingly tolerant to substitution, accepting substitution with non-hydrogen-bonding pyrimidine isosteres and base mismatches with minimal effect on the accuracy and overall rate of hydrolysis (2Pullen K.A.

Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The latter observations might indicate that, as the RNA/DNA hybrid enters the RNase H catalytic center, the DNA strand is displaced, allowing “docking” of the scissile phosphodiester bond in the active site, a model consistent with the role proposed for the p66 RNase H primer grip (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of how duplex geometry influences the accuracy of PPT cleavage is important in understanding this critical step in the reverse transcription cycle. In this communication, we examined the effect of introducing abasic lesions (23Lhomme J. Constant J.F. Demeunynck M. Biopolymers. 1999; 52: 65-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) into the unzipped region of both the HIV-1 (–)-DNA template and (+)-RNA primer between positions –15 and –11, as well as around the PPT/U3 cleavage junction. Although there is little information on abasic lesions within RNA/DNA hybrids, structural studies with duplex DNA suggest that local elimination of the base does not affect the sugar-phosphate backbone (24Goljer I. Kumar S. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22980-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Coppel Y. Berthet N. Coulombeau C. Garcia J. Lhomme J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4817-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but, in general, increases flexibility (25Coppel Y. Berthet N. Coulombeau C. Garcia J. Lhomme J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4817-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An abasic site can also affect whether its unpaired complement assumes an intraor extrahelical configuration. Collectively, our data suggest positions –15, –14, and –13 of the HIV-1 PPT (–)-DNA template are important modulators of cleavage specificity, either through directly contacting the thumb subdomain or imparting local flexibility to nucleic acid in its vicinity. The previously reported (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) unpaired template base (–11C) could also be removed without affecting PPT processing. In contrast, abasic lesions in the (+)-RNA primer between positions –15 and –11 are tolerated with very little alteration in cleavage specificity. With respect to structural requirements at the PPT/U3 junction, we show here that, although eliminating primer bases 5′ and 3′ of the scissile bond destroys cleavage, removing their complement on the (–)-DNA template is only partially inhibitory, indicating that, consistent with studies on human RNase H1 (26Lima W.F. Nichols J.G. Wu H. Prakash T.P. Migawa M.T. Wyrzykiewicz T.K. Bhat B. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36317-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a DNA base at the scissile bond is not essential for hydrolysis. Oligonucleotide and Enzyme Preparation—Substituted 40-nt oligodeoxynucleotides and 30-nt oligoribonucleotides were synthesized at a 1 μmol scale on a PE Biosystems Expedite 8909 oligonucleotide synthesizer by standard phosphoramidite chemistry and deprotected according to the manufacturer's specifications. r-Spacer (abasic RNA lesions) and d-Spacer (abasic DNA lesions) phosphoramidites were purchased from Glen Research, Sterling, VA. Stepwise coupling yields for incorporation of each analog was >98%, determined by trityl cation monitoring. Oligonucleotides were purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified spectrophotometrically (260 nm), assuming a molar extinction coefficient equal to the sum of the constituent bases. A wild type 30-nt RNA containing the HIV-1 3′ PPT and flanking sequences at its 5′ and 3′ termini was purchased from Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO). DNA/RNA hybrids were prepared by heating equimolar amounts of RNA and DNA to 95 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm NaCl for 5 mins, followed by slow cooling to 4 °C. The samples were stored at –20 °C. p66/p51 HIV-1 RT was purified according to published procedures (27Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thermal Melting Profiles—Equimolar amounts of 30-nt RNA primer and 40-nt, (–)-DNA templates were annealed by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling in degassed 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaCl. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was used to determine that complete hybridization had been achieved. For measurement of melting temperatures (Tm), 10 μg/ml solutions of each substrate were analyzed in a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. E260 was measured at 0.2 °C intervals from 30 to 85 °C. The Tm of each hybrid was calculated by the “first derivative” method described by the manufacturer. KMnO4 Footprinting of PPT Variants—RNA/DNA hybrids containing abasic lesions in the template or primer were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm MgCl2. The total reaction volume was 20 μl. Reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of freshly prepared 25 mm KMnO4 solution and terminated after 30 s with 2 μlof14 m β-mercaptoethanol. After ethanol precipitation and dessication, the samples were treated with 100 μl of 1 m piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. Piperidine was removed by vacuum desiccation. Nucleic acids were washed three times with 50 μl of water and vacuum-dried after each resuspension. Samples were finally resuspended in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, and 95% formamide containing 0.1% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol and analyzed by electrophoresis through 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. RNase H-mediated PPT Processing—Specific hydrolysis at the PPT 3′ terminus was evaluated as previously described (6Dash C. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37095-37102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using p66/p51 HIV-1 RT and 30-nt RNA/40-nt DNA hybrids containing abasic lesions. 5′ end labeling of the PPT-containing RNA was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. PPT cleavage was initiated by adding HIV-1 RT to RNA/DNA hybrids in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C, with enzyme and RNA/DNA hybrid present at final concentrations of 50 and 200 nm, respectively. Hydrolysis was terminated at the times indicated in the Fig. 3 legend by adding an equal volume of 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol, and the products fractionated by high voltage electrophoresis through denaturing 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified following phosphorimaging. Thermal Stability of Abasic PPT Duplexes—A portion of the HIV-1 PPT-containing hybrid used in our studies is illustrated in Fig. 1B, highlighting anomalous base pairing observed in the RT-RNA/DNA co-crystal between positions –15 and –9 (defining –1 as the first base pair 5′ to the scissile phosphate) (8Sarafianos S.G.

For the present study, abasic lesions were introduced into the (–)-DNA template and (+)-RNA primer between positions –15 and –11. The second region selected for analysis was the –1/+1 scissile bond corresponding to the PPT/U3 junction, where lesions were introduced on either side of the junction and downstream at position +2. To determine how these substitutions affected duplex stability, the melting temperature (Tm) of each hybrid was determined, the results of which are presented in Table I.Table IMelting temperatures of PPT substrates containing abasic lesions(-)-DNATm(+)-RNATm°C°CWT67.1 ± 0.96WT67.1 ± 0.96-15DAb68.0 ± 1.62-15RAb68.2 ± 0.76-14DAb68.1 ± 0.74-14RAb66.8 ± 1.25-13DAb (mp)69.0 ± 0.12-13RAb (up)65.0 ± 0.95-12DAb (mp)65.9 ± 0.95-12RAb (mp)66.1 ± 1.39-11DAb (up)65.6 ± 0.49-11RAb (mp)65.3 ± 1.04-1DAb56.9 ± 0.95-1RAb54.8 ± 0.99+1DAb58.9 ± 1.67+1RAb57.6 ± 0.59+2DAb56.3 ± 0.64+2RAb57.9 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab For PPT variants containing substitutions between positions –15 and –11, most melted at temperatures similar to that of the wild type hybrid (67.1 °C), regardless of whether the nucleobase was eliminated from the (–)-DNA template or (+)-RNA primer. The maximum decrease in Tm was observed with duplexes containing the unpaired bases defined by Sarafianos et al. (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L.

From these results, we concluded that the stability of the unzipped portion of the HIV-1 PPT was not seriously affected by base elimination. In contrast, removing nucleobases around the PPT/U3 cleavage junction was significantly more destabilizing, depressing the Tm by as much as 12.3 °C (–1RAb). The destabilizing effect was evident as far as position +2, suggesting that abasic lesions inserted at the PPT/U3 junction influenced neighboring base pairs, possibly through the alteration of stacking interactions. For a duplex of the length used in our studies (30 bp), a 10 °C reduction in Tm can be likened to introducing three base mismatches. Thus, if duplex geometry at the unsubstituted PPT/U3 junction is altered, as suggested by NMR (7Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and chemical footprinting studies (9Kvaratskhelia M. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16689-16696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this appears to be further destabilized as a consequence of nucleobase elimination. Susceptibility of Template Thymines to KMnO4 Oxidation—To assess how targeted nucleobase elimination altered PPT structure, susceptibility of template thymines between positions –15 and +1 to KMnO4 oxidation was investigated (see Fig. 1B). This strategy can determine whether thymines are unpaired (28Farah J.A. Smith G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or are structurally distorted but exhibit weak hydrogen bonding (30Reddy Y.V. Rao D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Template thymine reactivity in response to abasic insertions in both strands of the RNA/DNA hybrid was determined. Fig. 2A presents thymine sensitivity when template nucleobases between positions –15 and –12 were removed. Clearly, removing any thymine will eliminate that particular hydrolysis product. Eliminating nucleobases –15, –14, and –13 slightly increased reactivity of adjacent thymines (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3), which in conjunction with the Tm data of Table I, suggests local alteration in base stacking rather than extensive disruption of the duplex. Eliminating template base –12T had little effect on thymine reactivity at positions –13, –14, and –15 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). In contrast, –12T was highly susceptible to oxidation following removal of the unpaired nucleobase, –11C (Fig. 2A, lane 5), suggesting disruption of the original –12T/–11rG mispair suggested by Sarafianos et al. (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) when the stacking environment of the template is altered. The notion that eliminating base –11C is more destabilizing is supported by the observation that this substitution also affects –10T reactivity. With this exception, template substitutions between position –15 and –12 did not alter KMnO4 sensitivity within the adjacent r(A)4·d(T)4 tract between –10T and –7T. Reactivity of template nucleobase +1T in response to introducing abasic lesions at positions –1, +1, and +2 is shown in Fig. 2B. As expected, no product is evident for substrate +1DAb (Fig. 2B, lane 8). Also, altered migration of the +1 hydrolysis product on substrate +2DAb (Fig. 2B, lane 9) is accounted for by the fact that the DNA template was 5′ end-labeled, thus the cleavage product lacks one base. Substitutions –1DAb and +2DAb resulted in enhanced +1T reactivity (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 9, respectively). Table I indicates that the Tm for substrates containing lesions at these positions was reduced by ∼10 °C, which is equivalent to loss of hydrogen bonding over three base pairs. The data of Fig. 2B and Table I thus indicate that abasic template lesions are more destabilizing when positioned at the PPT/U3 junction. Fig. 2, C and D, indicate template thymine reactivity in response to removing nucleobases from the (+)-RNA primer. In general, substitutions –15RAb to –11RAb increased KMnO4 sensitivity between bases –15T and –12T, the effect being more pronounced at thymines opposite the site of nucleobase removal (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–5). In an analogous manner to its template counterpart, primer substitution –11RAb increased –12T and –10T reactivity (Fig. 2C, lane 5), suggesting local disruption of the RNA/DNA hybrid. As might be expected, removing primer nucleobase +1 enhanced KMnO4 sensitivity of template thymine +1 (Fig. 2D, lane 8). Enhanced +1T reactivity was also evident following removal of primer nucleobase –1 (Fig. 2D, lane 7). Finally, +1T reactivity of substrate +2RAb was similar to that of the unsubstituted duplex (Fig. 2D, lanes 9 and 6, respectively), suggesting that stacking of template nucleobases at the scissile bond was unaffected by removing primer nucleobase +2. Removing Template Nucleobases between Positions –15 and –11 Affects PPT Cleavage—Cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction in response to eliminating template nucleobases between positions –15 and –11 is shown qualitatively in Fig. 3A and quantitatively in Fig. 3B (for the former, lane d of each hydrolysis profile was selected). Using a 5′ end-labeled RNA primer, the wild type RNA/DNA hybrid (Fig. 3, A and B, panels i) was hydrolyzed predominantly at the –1/+1 junction and, to a lesser extent, between positions –2 and +6. No template substitution gave rise to aberrant cleavage within the PPT itself (data not shown). Removing template nucleobase –15 induced relaxed cleavage specificity, with the consequence that specific cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction was reduced (Fig. 3, A and B, panels ii). This effect was even more pronounced with substrate –14DAb, where the PPT/U3 junction was the least-preferred cleavage site (Fig. 3, A and B, panels iii). Although substrate –13DAb was hydrolyzed with improved specificity at the –1/+1 junction, positions +5 and +6 were still the favored sites (Fig. 3, A and B, panels iv). The data of Fig. 3, A and B, panels ii–iv, suggest alternative scenarios, namely that (a) specific contacts between the DNA strand between positions –15 and –13 and a structural motif of HIV-1 RT have been disturbed or (b) enhanced duplex flexibility upon nucleobase removal is incompatible with its trajectory between the catalytic centers of HIV-1 RT. Each of these possibilities will be discussed later. In contrast, we observed enhanced specificity for cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction with substrates –12DAb and –11DAb (Fig. 3, A and B, panels v and vi, respectively), which are mispaired and unpaired, respectively, in the HIV-1 RT/PPT structure described by Sarafianos et al. (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a –11DAb substitution increased reactivity of template nucleobase –12T to KMnO4 oxidation (Fig. 2A, lane 5) to a level equal to or exceeding that of any template thymine rendered unpaired by removal of its primer counterpart, suggesting that –12T is selectively unpaired when template nucleobase –11 is removed. In all structures of HIV-1 RT containing nucleic acid (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Locating the RNase H catalytic center over the PPT/U3 junction, as depicted in the model of Fig. 1B, would center this bend around position –11. Thus, local weakening of duplex architecture via targeted nucleobase removal (i.e. substrates –12DAb and –11DAb"
