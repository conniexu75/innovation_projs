https://openalex.org/W1963894734,"Camissonia claviformis, a winter annual of Death Valley, California, that fixes carbon dioxide by the C3 mechanism, has an in situ photosynthetic rate at midday in spring of nearly 6 nanomoles of carbon dioxide per square centimeter per second—an exceptionally high rate. Camissonia fixes absorbed noon sunlight in the 400- to 700-nanometer region into chemical energy with an efficiency of 8.5 percent, which is 80 percent of that theoretically possible for intact leaves. This performance is primarily due to an unusual capacity to utilize high irradiances. Factors associated with this include a high stomatal conductance to carbon dioxide and high levels of soluble protein and ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase."

The two Voyager radio occultation soundings, made at low latitudes, probably occurred over land, since they imply a relative humidity ≲ 70 percent near the surface. Oceans might exist at other low-latitude locations if the zonal wind velocities in the lowest 3 kilometers are ≤ 4 centimeters per second."

(2) These mixtures have maintained their potency at room, incubator and refrigerator temperatures for 30 to 62 days and show no signs of deterioration to date. (3) Eleven of twelve patients with gonorrhoea have been cured by a single injection of penicillin beeswaxpeanut oil mixture."

Analyses of the photographs show the presence of rock formations undergoing geomorphic degradation. The formations display ripple marks, thin layering, differential erosion, and curvilinear fracturings. Some of them are interpreted as lithified clastic sediments. The lithification could have taken place at depth or at the surface, resulting in a type of duricrust. The origin of the sediments is unknown but could be aeolian, volcanic, or related to impacts or to turbidity currents."

Ascorbic acid administration prevents the lycorine effect. Because KCN-insensitive respiration, which takes place during the aerobic incubation of potato tuber slices, specifically depends on the synthesis of new proteins, we suggest that ascorbic acid could be required to carry out a synthetic process."
https://openalex.org/W2061710975,"Titan's dense and cold nitrogen atmosphere contains a small amount of methane under conditions at least approaching those at which one or both constituents would condense. The possibility of methane and nitrogen rain clouds and global methane oceans has been discussed widely. From specific features of radio occultation and other Voyager results, however, it is concluded that nitrogen does not condense on Titan and that Titan has neither global methane oceans nor a global cloud of liquid methane droplets. Certain results indirectly support the conjecture that methane does not condense at any location. However, other considerations favor a methane ice haze high in the troposphere, and liquid and solid methane might exist on the surface and as low clouds at polar latitudes."

The discovery of (210)Po halos derived from uranium daughters, some elliptical in shape, further suggests that uranium-daughter infiltration occurred prior to coalification when the radionuclide transport rate was relatively high and the matrix still plastically deformable."

It is suggested that the streptococcal fibrinolysin is a protease and that it may be related to trypsin. The author wishes to acknowledge gratefully the cooperation of Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. King, Lieutenant Colonel E. D. Embree and Captain Edward Freis."

https://openalex.org/W1980572554,"Crushed and etched lanthanum lead manganite (La0.7Pb0.3MnO3) crystals containing as little as 0.005 atomic percent platinum have significantly higher catalytic activity than free platinum crystals. This higher activity is due to an almost 100-fold segregation of platinum on the surface. The surface platinum concentration found, 0.5 atomic percent, is sufficient to account for the enhanced activity provided that the platinum has the same activity as platinum supported on alumina."

Also, since less acetylcholine was synthesized in the presence of spinal fluid from patients with myasthenia gravis than spinal fluid of control subjects, it is probable that at least some of the factors responsible for the decrease and increase of the synthesis of acetylcholine pass into the spinal fluid."
