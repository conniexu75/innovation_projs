https://openalex.org/W2084538447,The phase of the molt cycle affects dominance status and the performance of agonistic acts in individual juvenile lobsters (Homarus americanus). Lobsters in the midphase of proecdysis are more aggressive than those in intermolt; the latter are more aggressive than lobsters in early or late proecdysis and those in postecdysis.

At room temperature the mean free path of the carrier is 3.3 to 8.2 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W1965006842,A system of coupled tunnel diode relaxation oscillators shows a variety of complex periodic states as the external voltage is varied. The existence of chaotic or nonperiodic states is more dependent on the nature of the coupling than on the number of degrees of freedom. A simple but accurate numerical model shows many of the phenomena observed experimentally.

The early stages float to the top of the enlarged atrium from which they cannot escape. Ammonium ions replace other more dense substances in the cell sap of the float cells surrounding the embryo. Energy derived from glycolysis but not mitochondrial processes supports this process."

The Jl fraction induced the acrosome reaction and J2 induced sperm agglutination. Chemical analysis and chromatography revealed that sperm agglutinin is similar to asterosaponin A."
https://openalex.org/W2000424465,An experiment designed to test whether embryos capable of developing from isolated somatic carrot cells could do so under conditions of weightlessness in space was performed aboard the unmanned Soviet biosatellite Kosmos 782 under the auspices of the joint United States-Soviet Biological Satellite Mission. Space flight and weightlessness seem to have had no adverse effects on the induction of embryoids or on the development of their organs. A portion of the crop of carrot plantlets originated in space and grown to maturity were not morphologically different from controls.
https://openalex.org/W2032155857,Pongid remains are rarely recovered from tropical rain forests. Observations of a Bornean bearded pig (Sus barbatus) scavenging an orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) carcass and the recovery of an orangutan skull fragment corroborates evidence from Africa and suggests that the scavenging of wild pigs may play an important role in the destruction of pongid remains.
https://openalex.org/W2084212043,"More debate has begun over questions related to the safety of high-level waste disposal at the Yucca Mountain site in the Nevada desert. An engineering geologists, Jerry Szymanski, one of the Department of Energy`s (DOE) own staffers in Las Vegas, has proposed that the $15-billion repository would sit on top of an intensely active structure that, if altered by an earthquake, would send a slug of ground water up from deep within the mountain into the waste storage area. This theory has already been slammed in two formal reviews and has virtually no support among geologists. However, enough doubt has been raised that much more geological testing will be necessary to prove or disprove Szymanski`s theory. Nevada state officials are also using all methods to thwart or block the project. The question of the origin of a series of calcium carbonate and opal veins exposed in an exploratory pit, trench 14, near the top of the mountain is also far from answered. The DOE and US Geological Survey may have to collect much more information on the quantity, size, and location of carbonate sites in the area at a high financial outlay to the US government before a complete casemore » on the origin of the material in trench 14 can be made.« less"

However, the commitment of the US to reduce the release of CO{sub 2} emission was very disappointing. The US attitude toward CO{sub 2} emission is totally unchanged, and US policy includes no provision other than those already in place to reduce the greenhouse gases. The plan of the administration to take action now to reduce climate changes really includes only the administrations already announced intentions to stabilize the greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. The administration is not yet fully convinced that there is substantial scientific evidence supporting greenhouse warming, and there is general concern that the economic costs of moderating the greenhouse effect might be excessive. There is a good measure of free market ideology involved in the US policy of opposition to reduction of CO{sub 2} emissions. In fact, CO{sub 2} emissions in the US are predicted to rise by 15% by the year 2000."

https://openalex.org/W2050613477,"Fried et al. have reported some very interesting laboratory work on the retention of plutonium and americium by rock. They experimentally model a fissure, in view of the possibility that, in the event of a release of radioactive waste underground, the bulk of the waste isotopes might travel through fissures. However, the sweeping conclusions drawn by Fried et al. concerning the hazards associated with the release of transuranic elements from geological depositories are based on rather limited laboratory-scale experiments with the transuranic elements in ionic form and with rock types not including rock salt, granite, and shale, which are the rock types currently being considered as geologic media for the disposal of radioactive wastes. Conclusions about hazards will require a much broader base of data and analysis. In particular, the problem of the mobility of transuranic elements in organic complexes that are soluble in water will have to be confronted since the migration of these elements in those chemical forms would be essentially at groundwater velocities rather than at the slower rates, 10/sup 3/ to 10/sup 4/ times slower, that were measured by Fried et al. for ionic migration."
