https://openalex.org/W2091757239,"We develop a murine retrovirus shuttle vector system for the efficient introduction of selectable and nonselectable DNA sequences into mammalian cells and recovery of the inserted sequences as molecular clones. Three protocols allow rapid recovery of vector DNA sequences from mammalian cells. Two of the methods rely on SV40 T-antigen-mediated replication of the vector sequences and yield thousands of bacterial transformants per 5 X 10(6) mammalian cells. The majority of plasmids recovered by all three protocols exhibited the proper structure and were as active as the parental vector in the generation of transmissible retrovirus genomes upon transfection of mammalian cells. One of the rescue methods, which relies on ""onion skin"" replication and excision of an integrated provirus from the host chromosome, enables facile recovery of the chromosomal site of proviral integration. The system was also used to generate, and then efficiently recover, a cDNA version of a genomic insert from the adenovirus E1A region."
https://openalex.org/W2065716796,The transcription initiation signals for retroviruses lie within the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences that flank the integrated provirus. Two subtypes of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) are associated with different disease phenotypes. In this article it is shown that marked differences exist in the ability of LTR sequences of these subtypes to function as transcriptional elements in differentiated cell types. It is also shown that trans-acting regulatory factors present in HTLV-infected cells stimulate gene expression directed by these LTR sequences in a type-specific manner. These results have implications for understanding the diverse biological effects of HTLV infection.

https://openalex.org/W2070849668,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin which produces permanent parkinsonism in human and nonhuman primates. Treatment of squirrel monkeys with pargyline, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, prevents both clinical and neuropathological evidence of the neurotoxic effects of MPTP. Pargyline also inhibits conversion of MPTP to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), a metabolic step that occurs rapidly after administration of MPTP in animals not treated with pargyline. It is proposed that the conversion of MPTP to MPP+, possibly involving MAO, may be important for the neurotoxic effects of MPTP to take place, and MPTP itself may not be the neurotoxic agent."

https://openalex.org/W1827824646,"Purified ciguatoxin at 0.1 to 10 ng/ml inhibits the net accumulation of neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine) by brain synaptosomes. This action is due to a stimulation of neurotransmitter release. The half-maximum effect of the toxin is observed at 0.62 ng/ml. The effect of ciguatoxin is completely inhibited by tetrodotoxin (K0.5 = 4 nM). Electrophysiological studies on neuroblastoma cells indicate that ciguatoxin induces a membrane depolarization which is prevented by tetrodotoxin and which is due to an action that increases Na+ permeability. Under appropriate conditions ciguatoxin creates spontaneous oscillations in the membrane polarization level and repeated action potentials. Ciguatoxin stimulates 22Na+ entry through the voltage-dependent Na+ channels of neuroblastoma cells and rat skeletal myoblasts when it is used in synergy with veratridine, batrachotoxin, pyrethroids, sea anemone, or scorpion toxins. The half-maximum effect of ciguatoxin on 22Na+ flux in the presence of veratridine occurs at a concentration of 0.5 ng/ml. Stimulation of 22Na+ flux by ciguatoxin is abolished by tetrodotoxin. These results taken together indicate that ciguatoxin belongs to a new class of toxins acting on Na+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2037694669,"A monoclonal antibody, KJ16-133, which binds to antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex-restricted (Ag/MHC) receptors on about 20% of BALB/c peripheral T cells has been used to examine the expression of these receptors on thymocytes and different subpopulations of peripheral T cells. Although KJ16-133-reactive receptors were found on mature thymocytes at similar frequencies and levels as on peripheral T cells, these molecules were absent from the first cells to enter the thymus, and in less mature thymocyte populations KJ16-133-reactive cells were less frequent than in the periphery and bore lower quantities of receptor. These results showed that Ag/MHC receptors are present on the surfaces of immature thymocytes, albeit at variable levels, during the time that the repertoire of these cells for Ag/MHC is thought to be selected. Additional experiments showed that KJ16-133 could not be used to distinguish T-cell receptors with different restriction specificities, i.e., for Class I or Class II products of the MHC."
https://openalex.org/W2161402720,"Homologous clones that encode the beta chain of the T cell antigen receptor have been isolated recently from both murine and human cDNA libraries. These cDNA clones have been used in connection with interspecies hybrid cell lines to determine that the murine T cell receptor gene is located on chromosome 6 and the human gene on chromosome 7. In situ hybridization confirms these data and further localizes these genes to band B of chromosome 6 in the mouse and bands 7p13-21 in the human genome. The organization of the T cell antigen receptor J beta gene segments and C beta genes appears to be conserved, since very few intraspecies polymorphisms of restriction fragment length have been detected in either mouse or human DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1559169404,A 471-base pair HindIII DNA fragment of Bacillus subtilis contains two overlapping promoters which are recognized in vitro by sigma 55- and sigma 37-containing RNA polymerase holoenzymes from B. subtilis. In vitro transcript analyses and S1 nuclease mapping experiments with in vivo RNA indicate that both enzymes initiate transcription from the same putative +1 site. Physiological studies with the promoter-containing DNA fragment inserted into the expression probe plasmid pCED6 and quantitative S1 nuclease mapping experiments with RNA isolated from various stages of growth indicate that expression from these overlapping promoters is greater during the early stationary phase than during growth. We propose that the cryptic gene controlled by these promoters is transcribed by the sigma 55 enzyme during growth and by the sigma 37 enzyme during early stationary phase.
https://openalex.org/W1506674838,"4 beta-Phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) markedly inhibited the binding of low concentrations (less than 10(-9 m) of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) to A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. However, very little change in the binding of 125-I-EGF at high concentrations (greater than 10(-8) M) was observed in response to PMA. Affinity labeling of the 170,000-dalton EGF receptor with 125I-EGF and disuccinimidyl suberate was also decreased by the tumor promoter at low, but not high, concentrations of 125I-EGF. In order to examine this action of PMA on the EGF receptor, the receptor phosphorylation state was evaluated in A431 cells that had been incubated with [32P]phosphate for 3 h prior to the addition of PMA. The 32P content of the EGF receptor purified with EGF-Sepharose was increased by 38% compared with the same amount of receptor isolated from control cells. The increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect between 0.1 and 1 nM PMA and was specific for tumor promoting analogues of phorbol diesters. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the increase in the 32P content of the EGF receptor was mainly due to phosphoserine. These results demonstrate that the EGF receptor is a target for PMA action and suggest that the mechanism of PMA action on the response of cells to epidermal growth factor may be mediated in part by phosphorylation of the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2078512742,"The responses of cells to external stimuli are mediated by a variety of messenger molecules. Three such molecules produced as a result of phosphoinositide metabolism are diglyceride, inositol triphosphate, and arachidonic acid. The first two of these substances have properties common to second messengers such as CAMP. Their production is initiated by specific agonists, they are potent activators of other cellular reactions, and they are rapidly degraded to inactive compounds. Arachidonate is the polyunsaturated fatty acid that is oxygenated to produce a family of compounds including prostaglandins, thromboxane, and leukotrienes that are collectively called icosanoids (Samuelsson, Harvey Lect. 7.5, l-40, 1981). Many icosanoids have the same properties as second messengers listed above, although the icosanoids tend to act upon neighboring cells rather than intracellularly. Phosphoinositide Metabolism Phosphoinositides are ubiquitous components of eucaryotic membranes. In mammals phosphatidylinositol (PI) comprises about 5%-7% of phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI-4P) I%, and phosphotidylinositol45 diphosphate (PI-4,5P2) 0.4%. The phosphoinositides are in equilibrium with each other through a “futile cycle” of kinases and phosphatases, as shown in the figure. Phosphoinositides break down rapidly in response to receptor-mediated cell activation (Downes and Michell, Cell Calcium 3, 467-502, 1982). Originally only PI was shown to be hydrolyzed; more recently it was discovered that all three phosphoinositides are degraded by a phospholipase C to form diglyceride and one of the inositol phosphates. The inositol phosphates are rapidly degraded to inositol, which is utilized for resynthesis of phosphoinositides. Diglyceride either is hydrolyzed by lipases to monoglyceride (MG) and then to free arachidonate and glycerol or is phosphorylated by diglyceride kinase to form phosphatidic acid (PA). PA is then converted to PI, thus completing the “PI cycle.” Inositol-7,4,5 Triphosphate Formation and Calcium Mobilization Polyphosphoinositides undergo agonist-induced hydrolysis as evidenced by the transient appearance in stimulated cells of inositol-I ,4,5 triphosphate (IPs) and inositol-I ,4 diphosphate (IP& which are products of phospholipase C action on polyphosphoinositides. In blowfly salivary glands (Berridge, Biochem. J. 272, 849-858, 1983) platelets (Agranoff et al., JBC 258, 2076-2078, 1983), and parotid cells (Downes et al., Biochem. J., in press, 1984) IPs and IPn accumulate within a few seconds of stimulation, before changes are seen in IP or inositol. These investigators propose that the majority of PI breakdown occurs by conversion of PI to polyphosphoinositides prior to hydrolysis by phospholipase C. A role for IP3 in calcium mobilization is suggested by a study of permeabilized pancreatic cells (Streb et al., Nature 306,67-69,1983). These workers added IP3 to the medium and showed a rise in extracellular Ca*+, indicating liberation from some intracellular site. IP:! and IP were ineffective in stimulating Ca” mobilization in this assay. These results have been confirmed in a study of saponin-permeabilized liver cells (Joseph et al., JBC 259, 3077-3081, 1984). IPs also specifically promotes Ca’+ release from isolated microsomes of rat liver (Dawson and Irvine, BBRC 120, 858-864, 1984) and rat insulinoma cells (Perentki et al., Nature 309, 562-564, 1984). Hydrolysis of PI by phospholipase C in vitro requires Ca*‘. If IPs is the messenger for Ca’+ mobilization, then hydrolysis of PI-4,5P2 should be calcium-independent (Billah and Lapetina, BBRC 109, 217-222, 1982). Our recent experiments with pure phospholipase C suggest that this may be the case. We have isolated two distinct PI-specific phospholipase C enzymes from seminal vesicles (Hofmann et al., JBC 257, 6461-6469, 1982) and have shown that both enzymes are able to hydrolyze all three phosphoinositides nearly equally. However, in the presence of EGTA these enzymes cleave only PI-4P and PI-4,5P2, indicating that hydrolysis of these substances may occur prior to Ca” flux, as suggested by the physiological experiments. Once intracellular Ca2’ rises, PI breakdown may predominate since it is quantitatively the major potential substrate for phospholipase C. The fraction of each phosphoinositide that is hydrolyzed directly by phospholipase C versus that which undergoes interconversion followed by hydrolysis is unknown and can only be answered by detailed kinetic study of all of the intermediates shown in the figure. The mechanism of initiation of phosphoinositide breakdown remains to be elucidated. Phospholipase C appears to be equally active in extracts from stimulated and unstimulated cells. Studies with small unilamellar vesicles of defined phospholipid composition as substrates indicate that the composition and distribution of lipids in a membrane have enormous effects on enzyme activity. It is possible that activation of phosphoinositide breakdown is initiated by a redistribution or segregation of these lipids in the membrane. The intracellular site of phosphoinositide breakdown is unknown. Most of the biosynthetic enzymes are in the endoplasmic reticulum. If breakdown also takes place in endoplasmic reticulum and the process is initiated by"
https://openalex.org/W1630525523,"In purified preparations of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, the alpha subunit is selectively phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Costa, M. R. C., Casnellie, J. E., and Catterall, W. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem., 7918-7921). We have developed methods to measure sodium channel phosphorylation in both lysed synaptosomal membranes and intact synaptosomes. Incubation of lysed synaptosomal membranes with exogenously added catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in rapid phosphorylation of the alpha subunit as detected by specific immuno-precipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides revealed five major sites of reaction. The level of phosphorylation of these sites on the sodium channel in intact synaptosomes was monitored using a rephosphorylation method in which those sites not phosphorylated in situ were labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP and exogenously added protein kinase after lysis of the synaptosomes. Incubation of synaptosomes with 8-Br-cAMP completely blocked labeling of the alpha subunit in rephosphorylation indicating marked stimulation of phosphorylation of the sites on the sodium channel in situ. Phosphorylation was complete in 15 s and all four of the tryptic phosphopeptides detected under these conditions could be phosphorylated in situ. These results show that the sodium channel can be rapidly phosphorylated by endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase in intact synaptosomes. In addition, since ATP and protein kinase are only available inside the synaptosomes, they also show that the alpha subunit is a transmembrane polypeptide exposed on both sides of the synaptosomal membrane. The functional consequences of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation were examined using ion flux and neurotoxin-binding methods. Binding of saxitoxin and scorpion toxin were unaffected, but neurotoxin-activated 22Na+ influx mediated by the sodium channel was reduced 16 to 26% (P less than 0.01) under various experimental conditions. The potential physiological significance of this action is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1591748431,"Previous studies have proposed that insulin increases the binding of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in isolated rat adipose cells at 24 degrees C by increasing receptor affinity (Ka). This study re-examines these observations under conditions in which receptor-ligand internalization is blocked by 1 mM KCN. In the absence of KCN, adipose cells bind 0.71 amol of IGF-II/cell with low apparent affinity (0.030 nM-1), of which greater than 75% is not accessible to trypsin. In contrast, in the presence of KCN, IGF-II binding is decreased by 95% and its apparent affinity increased to 0.21 nM-1. Moreover, greater than 60% of the bound IGF-II now is sensitive to trypsin. In either the absence or presence of KCN, approximately 20% of the cell's total IGF-II receptors are present in the plasma membranes and approximately 80% in the low density microsomes. Insulin induces a 5-fold increase in cell surface IGF-II receptors without a change in affinity when IGF-II binding is measured in the presence of KCN. Similarly, insulin increases IGF-II receptor concentration in the plasma membranes and concomitantly decreases that in the low density microsomes. Receptor affinity in these two subcellular membrane fractions is not affected by incubation of intact cells with either insulin or KCN and is similar to that observed in intact cells in the presence of KCN. Addition of KCN prior to insulin abolishes all of these effects of insulin. These data suggest that (a) the effects of KCN reflect a selective blockade of endocytosis; (b) in the absence of KCN, IGF-II binds to receptors of constant affinity that cycle between the plasma membrane and an intracellular pool resulting in an accumulation of intracellular IGF-II; (c) insulin induces an increase in IGF-II binding by causing a steady state redistribution of receptors from this intracellular pool to the plasma membrane; and (d) this redistribution in the intact cell can only be detected using Scatchard analysis when recycling of the receptors is prevented by KCN."
https://openalex.org/W2052050039,"The sequence of the 3' terminus of the human T lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) was determined and compared to the corresponding sequence of HTLV-I. The 1557-nucleotide-long sequence can be divided into a 5' region that is not conserved between the two viruses, and a 3', 1011-nucleotide-long region that is highly conserved and that corresponds precisely with a long open reading frame for both HTLV-I and -II. The proteins that could be encoded by these open reading frames have a molecular weight of about 38,000 and are closely related in primary amino acid sequence. The genomic structure in the 3' region of HTLV was found to be similar to that of bovine leukemia virus."
https://openalex.org/W1544560081,"It has been known that enzyme activity associated with the yeast LEU1 and LEU2 gene product (beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase) drops sharply when yeast is grown in the presence of leucine. RNA blot hybridizations with LEU2-specific probes establish that this is accompanied by a 5-fold repression in LEU2 mRNA levels. A similar repression was noted recently for LEU1 mRNA levels (Hsu, Y.-P., and Schimmel, P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3714-3719). Nuclease mapping of the 5'-end of the LEU2 mRNA shows a major start at approximately 16 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiation codon. This initiation site in the gene is retained in an extensive LEU2 5'-noncoding region deletion which still expresses the LEU2 gene product (Erhart, E., and Hollenberg, C. P. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 156, 625-635). The primary structure of the LEU2 gene product was established from the nucleotide sequence of the gene-coding region and from fitting amino acid sequences of scattered internal peptides to the nucleotide sequence. The 364-amino acid protein has a 13-amino acid stretch which is highly homologous to the partially sequenced yeast LEU1 gene product (isopropylmalate isomerase). The homology occurs about 290 amino acids from the respective NH2 termini of the two proteins. The homology may represent residues which interact with beta-isopropylmalate, a common ligand for the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2082685909,"Mung bean nuclease was found to cut the genomic DNA of the malaria parasite Plasmodium at positions before and after genes but not within gene-coding regions. This cleavage, which had nearly the preciseness of a restriction nuclease, required controlled conditions in the presence of formamide. Southern blot analysis showed that the coding areas for Plasmodium actin, circumsporozoite protein, histidine-rich protein, ribosomal RNA's, and tubulin are each cleaved from genomic DNA to yield a single major band on an agarose gel. DNA sequence data on several clones of mung bean nuclease cleavage products containing the gene for the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum confirmed that cleavage sites are before and after genes. Recognition and cleavage of DNA did not seem to be related to any primary sequence but may be related to structural features of the DNA duplex that demarcate genes. Mung bean nuclease-cleaved DNA could be inserted directly into a lambda expression vector, yielding a representative but small gene bank of intact gene fragments."

A sensitive and specific radioimmunoprecipitation test was developed for the detection of antibodies to the major core protein of LAV , p25 (molecular weight 25,000). Antibody to LAV p25 was found in the serum of 51 of 125 AIDS patients, 81 of 113 patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome, 0 of 70 workers at the Centers for Disease Control (some of whom had handled specimens from AIDS patients), and 0 of 189 random blood donors. Of a group of 100 homosexual men from San Francisco whose serum was obtained in 1978, only one had antibody to LAV p25; in contrast, of a group of 50 homosexual men in the same community whose serum was obtained in 1984, 12 had antibodies to LAV p25."
https://openalex.org/W1603768470,"Mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor binding peptides can be visualized by covalently labeling them with the photoaffinity reagent p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The receptor peptides migrate as broad bands of Mr approximately equal to 62,000. In the present study, we examined the carbohydrate composition of the mammalian beta receptor through the use of specific exo- and endoglycosidases and lectin affinity chromatography. Treatment of p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol-labeled beta2-adrenergic receptors from hamster lung or rat erythrocyte with the exoglycosidases neuraminidase and alpha-mannosidase provided evidence for the existence of both high mannose and complex type carbohydrate chains on beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The nonadditivity of the effect of sequential treatments with these enzymes suggested discrete populations of beta-adrenergic receptors containing either complex or high mannose type chains. Deglycosylation of receptor with endoglycosidase F results in a single labeled polypeptide at Mr = 49,000 for both systems. The same two populations of the beta receptors (high mannose or complex type chain) could also be fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography of solubilized p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol-labeled receptors. The high mannose-containing receptors could be absorbed to and specifically eluted from concanavalin A-agarose. Those containing complex type carbohydrates could be adsorbed to and eluted from wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. Taken together, these data suggest that mammalian beta-adrenergic receptors contain both complex and high mannose type carbohydrate chains and that microheterogeneity of these chains likely explains the broad band pattern typically obtained on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1966339574,"The poliovirus polyprotein is proteolytically processed predominantly by a virus-encoded proteinase (P3-7c) that cleaves glutamine-glycine amino acid pairs. The biosynthesis of the viral proteinase, itself a product of glutamine-glycine cleavages, was studied by constructing a bacterial expression plasmid that contained a cloned segment of the poliovirus genome slightly larger than the coding region for P3-7c. The induction of expression of this plasmid in E. coli produced several poliovirus-specific polypeptides. One polypeptide, an unstable protein called 3i, was the product of fortuitous in-phase initiation of translation within the coding region of P3–7c. Three other induced polypeptides were products of proteolytic cleavages, the smallest (polypeptide 3) having the properties (amino-terminal amino acids, carboxy-terminal amino acids, size, antigenicity) of P3-7c. Insertion of a DNA linker into the P3–7c coding region results in the loss of P3-7c-specific glutamine-glycine cleavage activity. We conclude that P3-7c was produced by autocatalytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1532091638,"Abstract The ability of the Rp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Rp cAMPS) to inhibit glucagon-induced glycogenolysis was studied in hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Preincubation of the cells for 20 min with progressively higher concentrations of Rp cAMPS followed by a 1 X 10(-9) M glucagon challenge resulted in a 50% inhibition of glucose production over a 30-min period at 2-3 X 10(-6) M Rp cAMPS. A maximal inhibition of 50-74% was achieved, the actual value depending upon the length of preincubation with Rp cAMPS. The inhibitory effect did not increase when the concentration of Rp cAMPS was increased from 3 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-4) M. Addition of 1 X 10(-5) M Rp cAMPS to the cells followed by 10(-11) to 10(-6) M glucagon shifted the glucagon concentration required for half-maximal glucose production measured at 10 min to 6-fold higher glucagon concentrations and the concentration of glucagon required for apparent maximal glucose production measured at 10 min to greater than 10-fold higher glucagon concentrations. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation curve was similarly shifted to higher concentrations of glucagon. These data show that Rp cAMPS acts as a cAMP antagonist capable of opposing the glucagon-induced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the concomitant activation of the glycogenolytic cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1543955271,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (ACTH/endorphin prohormone) is processed within the secretory vesicles of pituitary intermediate lobe cells to alpha-melanotropin and beta-endorphin. In order to learn more about the microenvironment in which processing occurs, a method was developed to purify large quantities of bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicles (ILSV) using isoosmolar metrizamide-sucrose gradients. Analysis of alpha-melanotropin and marker enzymes revealed that the gradients provided a 94-fold purification of secretory vesicles with respect to lysosomes and a 15-fold purification with respect to mitochondria. Pro-opiomelanocortin-converting enzyme activity in the ILSVs was assayed and found to be maximally active around pH 5. From measuring the delta pH across the intact ILSV membrane using 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching, the internal pH of ILSVs was determined to be less than 5.6, consistent with the operating pH range of the converting enzyme activity. The pH gradient of the ILSVs collapsed in the presence of ammonium sulfate or by using a combination of nigericin and K+, when the external medium pH was 7. Using the voltage-sensitive dye, oxanol VI, Mg2+ ATP was shown to cause a marked change in the ILSV membrane potential with the inside being positive which was reversed by the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Thus, the ILSVs appear to have a Mg2+ ATP-dependent electrogenic proton-translocating system."
https://openalex.org/W1557149681,"Since several aspects of the effects of vitamin A and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) on bone metabolism are quite similar, we examined the possibility that vitamin A effects on bone were mediated through the regulation of cytosolic 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors. A clonal osteoblast-like cell line derived from rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2) was used as a model system. Vitamin A acid (retinoic acid) in concentrations ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M was found to elicit a dose-dependent increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding in these cells. This effect was maximal after 24 h, was independent of cell density, and was inhibited by actinomycin D (0.05-0.5 microgram/ml). The 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding macromolecule in cytosol preparations from both vehicle- and retinoic acid-treated cells had a sedimentation coefficient of 3.2 S and binding specificities for vitamin D3 metabolites in the order: 1,25-(OH)2D3 greater than 25-(OH)-D3 greater than 24,25-(OH)2D3. Sucrose density gradient analysis, vitamin D3 metabolite displacement studies, and saturation and Scatchard analyses all indicated that the specific increase in 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 binding in these cells was the result of a selective increase in the number of specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors."

When the reconstituted cytochrome-containing vesicles were preloaded with ascorbic acid and cytochrome c was added to the external medium, the internal ascorbic acid was able to reduce the external cytochrome c. This reduction of cytochrome c was dependent on the presence of cytochrome b561 in the membrane and was not due to leakage of ascorbate from the vesicles. These results demonstrate that cytochrome b561 catalyzes a transmembrane electron transfer."

EPA was assayed by its ability to stimulate the growth of large erythroid colonies (bursts) from normal human peripheral blood. The purified EPA has a molecular weight of 28,000 and appears as a single band when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Purified EPA stimulates the growth of both early and late erythroid precursors from human bone marrow, as well as colony formation by the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line. Purified EPA has no colony-stimulating factor activity nor does it appear to be a structural protein of the human T-cell leukemia virus subtype II which infects the Mo cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513184907,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 4.0-kilobase DNA fragment containing the genes of the PstI restriction-modification system. Two large open reading frames were identified within the sequence and were ascribed to the restriction enzyme and methylase by the analysis of a series of deletion mutants. The two genes are encoded on opposite DNA strands, and hence must be transcribed from separate promoters rather than as a polycistronic message. The sequence of the first 10 amino acids of the restriction endonuclease was determined by sequential Edman degradation of the purified protein, permitting the alignment of the polypeptide with the DNA sequence. The NH2 terminus of the modification enzyme was established by sequential Edman degradation of the protein synthesized in bacterial minicells with different radiolabeled amino acids. The initiation codons of the two genes are separated by 130 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the restriction endonuclease contains 326 amino acids with a calculated Mr = 37,370; the modification enzyme is composed of 507 amino acids with a calculated Mr = 56,830. There is no significant homology between the two proteins at the level of the primary structure. Antibody raised against the purified restriction endonuclease did not immunoprecipitate the modification enzyme. The transcription initiation sites were mapped using mung bean nuclease. Both of the transcripts begin with adenosine. The initiation sites are separated by only 70 base pairs. This close proximity suggests that the promoters for the two divergent genes overlap. DNase I protection experiments show that Escherichia coli RNA polymerase has a higher affinity for the methylase promoter than for the restriction enzyme promoter."

https://openalex.org/W82710548,"Abstract The effect of pertussis toxin treatment on the guanine nucleotide-induced modulation of the affinity of renal alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was investigated. Pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin did not induce any change in the number of or affinity for antagonists of alpha 1- or alpha 2-receptors studied using [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine, respectively. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate induced an in the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors; this up-shift was not observed for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Pertussis toxin treatment decreased the affinity of epinephrine for the [3H]yohimbine-binding sites and reduced the ability of guanine nucleotides to modulate alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist affinity. The regulation by guanine nucleotides of alpha 1-adrenoceptor affinity for agonists was not altered. These results suggest that the modulation of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors by guanine nucleotides is probably exerted through different molecular entities."
https://openalex.org/W1496775241,"Anaerobic Tritrichomonas foetus hydrogenosomes supplemented with pyruvate and CoA effectively reduce nitrofurans and metronidazole to their respective anion free radicals. Addition of purified ferredoxins from Clostridium pasteurianum or Spinacia oleracea to these preparations causes a great stimulation of metronidazole reduction, but does not affect nitrofuran reduction. A similar stimulatory effect of ferredoxin on metronidazole reduction, but not on nitrofuran reduction, is observed in incubations containing purified NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from S. oleracea. NADH is less effective than pyruvate as a reducing cofactor for metronidazole and nitrofuran reduction by the hydrogenosomes, and these activities are not modified by the addition of ferredoxins. In contrast to the results observed with hydrogenosomes, the T. foetus soluble fraction supplemented with NADH or NADPH is able to reduce nitrofurans, but not metronidazole. Under aerobic conditions, the anion free radical metabolites generated from metronidazole and nitrofurans are oxidized, resulting in catalytic superoxide anion formation as detected by spin-trapping experiments. Oxygen consumption and H2O2 formation by T. foetus hydrogenosomes and NADPH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase are also stimulated by nitrofurans and high concentrations of metronidazole. Addition of ferredoxin enhances metronidazole-stimulated, but not nitrofuran-stimulated, oxygen consumption and H2O2 formation in both systems. These results support the role of air oxidation as a detoxification reaction of the metronidazole anion radical and the involvement of ferredoxin in its formation. On the other hand, redox cycling of nitrofurans with formation of high steady state concentrations of oxygen-derived radicals might be of toxicological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1548207656,"High affinity receptors for angiotensin II have been identified on purified cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. Equilibrium binding studies were performed with 125I-labeled angiotensin II and purified sarcolemmal vesicles from calf ventricle. The curvilinear Scatchard plots were evaluated by nonlinear regression analysis using a two-site model which identified a high affinity site Kd1 = 1.08 +/- 0.3 nM and N1 = 52 +/- 10 fmol/mg of protein and a low affinity site Kd2 = 52 +/- 16 nM and N2 = 988 +/- 170 fmol/mg of protein. Monovalent and divalent cations inhibited the binding of 125I-angiotensin II by 50%. The affinity of angiotensin II analogs for the receptor was determined using competitive binding assays; sarcosine, leucine-angiotensin II (Sar,Leu-angiotensin II), Kd = 0.53 nM; angiotensin II, Kd = 2.5 nM; des-aspartic acid-angiotensin II, Kd = 4.81 nM; angiotensin I, Kd = 77.6 nM. There is a positive correlation between potency in inducing positive inotropic response in myocardial preparations reported by others and potency for the hormone receptor observed in the binding assays. Pseudo-Hill plots of the binding data showed that agonists display biphasic binding with Hill numbers around 0.65 while antagonists recognized a single class of high affinity receptors with Hill numbers close to unity. These data were confirmed using 125I-Sar,Leu-angiotensin II in equilibrium binding studies which showed that this antagonist bound to a single class of receptor sites; Kd = 0.42 +/- 0.04 nM and N = 1050 +/- 110 fmol/mg of protein. Competition-binding experiments with this 125I-peptide yielded monophasic curves with Hill numbers close to unity for both agonists and antagonists. Membrane-bound 125I-angiotensin II was covalently linked to its receptor by the use of bifunctional cross-linking reagents such as dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone. Analysis of the membranes showed the labeling of a component with an apparent Mr = 116,000. The affinity labeled species showed characteristics expected of a functional component of the high affinity receptor. The affinity labeling of this membrane component was inhibited by nanomolar angiotensin II or Sar,Leu-angiotensin II. Together these data indicate that high affinity receptors exist for angiotensin II that most likely mediate the positive inotropic effects of this hormone on myocardial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Both channels were much more permeable to divalent than univalent cations, and one of them discriminated significantly among the divalent cations. The selectivity and voltage dependence of the latter channel are comparable to those of voltage-dependent calcium channels found in a variety of cells. A combined biochemical, biophysical, and genetic study of calcium channels is now possible."

The frequencies, widths, and intensities of these modes show that the Fe-C-O grouping in carbon monoxide-cytochrome a3 is linear but tilted from the normal to the heme plane; that the iron-histidine bond in both five- and six-coordinate cytochrome a3 is strained; and that the carbon monoxide and the proximal histidine each have characteristic, well-defined orientations in all molecules. These data can account for the binding affinities of carbon monoxide and dioxygen under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2022383162,"Inactivation of calcium channels has been attributed to a direct reaction of calcium ions entering the cell with the calcium channel. For a single channel this hypothesis predicts a correlation between the amount of calcium entering during an opening or a burst of openings and the subsequent closed times. No such correlation was found, and the possibility that, upon entry, calcium ions produce inactivation is excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1571129442,"Mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocation was measured in the presence of creatine or creatine phosphate to test the proposed functional couple between the nucleotide translocase and creatine kinase. Rat heart mitochondria were preloaded with the corresponding nucleotide which reacts with creatine kinase only after it is transported across the mitochondrial membrane; namely, radioactive ATP-preloaded mitochondria were assayed in the presence of 10 mM creatine plus ADP, and radioactive ADP-preloaded mitochondria in the presence of 10 mM creatine phosphate plus ATP. Results showed that forward creatine kinase reaction (in the direction of creatine phosphate synthesis) inhibits translocation of external ADP into mitochondrial matrix and backward reaction (cleavage of creatine phosphate to creatine) likewise inhibits translocation of ATP across the mitochondrial membrane. Control experiments showed that without the kinase activity when Mg2+ was omitted from the assay medium, the presence of creatine or creatine phosphate had no effect on ADP or ATP transport, respectively. Therefore, the observed inhibition of nucleotide exchange by these compounds is due to creatine kinase activity which upon reacting with the newly exported nucleotide can effectively compete for transport back into the mitochondrial matrix over nucleotides added in the assay medium. Kinetic analysis also indicated that the forward creatine kinase reaction inhibits external ADP uptake competitively. These results are interpreted to support the proposal that a functional interaction exists between the mitochondrial bound creatine kinase and the adenine nucleotide translocase."
https://openalex.org/W1500740071,"The human neuroblastoma cell line T98G is sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of both alpha- and gamma-interferons (IFNs). Specific binding of a homogeneous 125I-IFN-alpha 2 probe to high-affinity membrane receptors (apparent Kd = 6.2 X 10(-10) M) can be decreased by pretreatment of these cells with human IFN-gamma (HuIFN-gamma, derived by recombinant DNA techniques). The regulation of HuIFN-alpha 2 binding by such pretreatment is reflected by subsequent inhibition of both the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of HuIFN-alpha 2 on T98G cells. Thus, binding of HuIFN-gamma to its distinct cell-surface receptor can modify expression of the separate IFN-alpha receptor, presumably through an indirect effect on the apparent Kd of the IFN-alpha 2 receptor-ligand interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1653226101,"High affinity (KD approximately 1 X 10(-9) M) monoclonal antibodies (ROS-1 and ROS-2) were prepared to bovine photoreceptor outer segment cGMP phosphodiesterase. ROS-1 immunoadsorbed greater than 95% of the cGMP phosphodiesterase activity from a detergent-solubilized bovine retina extract while ROS-2 immunoadsorbed only a subfraction of the same activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analysis of these immunoadsorbates demonstrated that ROS-1 and ROS-2 specifically adsorbed only peptides that comigrated with purified rod outer segment phosphodiesterase. Limited trypsin digestion of purified rod outer segment phosphodiesterase greatly reduced its affinity for ROS-1 but not ROS-2. When a crude heat-stable inhibitor fraction was added back to the activated enzyme, the affinity for ROS-1 was restored, suggesting that the inhibitor was necessary for ROS-1 binding. ROS-1 but not ROS-2 was found to inhibit cGMP phosphodiesterase which had been activated either by dilution or guanyl nucleotide. The inhibitory property of ROS-1 may provide a useful probe for directly studying the effects of this phosphodiesterase on the phototransduction response in the retina. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel analysis demonstrated that the ROS-1 immunoadsorbates from mammals, fish, and amphibia contained peptides of similar mobility. Immunocytochemistry performed with ROS-1 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG localized the antigenic determinant to both rod and cone outer segments suggesting the presence of an antigenically similar phosphodiesterase in both types of photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1499247113,"Abstract We have studied the specificity and kinetics of release of nascent RNA from ternary transcription complexes by Escherichia coli transcription termination factor rho in vitro. Stable ternary complexes, initiated at the lambda PR promoter, were prepared either by quenching the elongation reaction with EDTA or by preventing further elongation by incorporating 3'-O-methyl nucleotides at the 3' end of the nascent RNA chains. We find that rho protein can only release lambda PR-initiated transcripts from ternary complexes in which transcription has proceeded beyond 288 base pairs from PR; shorter chains are not released. Substitution of inosine for guanosine in the nascent RNA permits the rho-dependent release process to operate on complexes located as close as 108-116 base pairs downstream from PR. The regions of the template from which rho can release transcripts correspond, for both guanosine- and inosine-containing RNA, to those within which rho-dependent termination has also been shown to occur (Morgan, W. D., Bear, D. G., and von Hippel, P. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9553-9564, 9565-9574). The half-time for the major part of the release process is less than 10 s. These results are in good accord with the hypothesis that the specificity of rho-dependent termination is jointly determined by two separable processes: (i) the specificity of rho binding to the nascent RNA chain and (ii) the location and strength of RNA polymerase-pausing sites."
https://openalex.org/W126866782,"Membrane-derived oligosaccharides are periplasmic constituents of Escherchia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Oligosaccharides in this family may be variously substituted with O-succinyl ester residues, and with sn-1-phosphoglycerol and phosphoethanolamine residues derived from membrane phospholipids. Membrane-derived oligosaccharides appear to be important in osmoregulation, because their synthesis is under strict control (Kennedy, E.P. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 1092-1095). Maximum rate of synthesis is at very low osmolarity of the medium. Phosphoglycerol residues are transferred from phosphatidylglycerol to membrane-derived oligosaccharides, or to certain beta-glucoside acceptors, in a reaction catalyzed by phosphoglycerol transferase I, an enzyme of the inner membrane (Jackson, B. J., and Kennedy, E.P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2394-2398). We now report that this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of phosphoglycerol residues to arbutin (p-hydroxyphenyl-beta-D-glucoside) added to the medium with Km similar to that observed with the cell-free enzyme. The active site of the enzyme must therefore be on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane. We assayed phosphoglycerol transferase I in vivo and found that it is present and completely active even in cells growing in medium of very high osmolarity, in which the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides is severely reduced. We conclude that osmotic regulation must occur at the stage of the synthesis of oligosaccharide chains. A study of the kinetics of transfer of phosphoglycerol residues to membrane-derived oligosaccharides in vivo revealed that synthesis of the polyglucose chains must stop abruptly upon transfer of cells from medium of low to high osmolarity, inconsistent with a model postulating simple dilution of some rate-limiting enzyme during growth at the higher osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W1501390905,"Crude soluble enzyme fractions that initiate bidirectional replication from the unique Escherichia coli chromosomal origin (oriC) have been fractionated further to identify the components and mechanisms of this complex system. Among the necessary factors is a class of specificity proteins that suppress initiations on plasmids which lack the oriC sequence and which do not depend on dnaA protein. One such specificity factor has been identified as RNase H (Ogawa, T., Pickett, G. G., Kogoma, T., and Kornberg, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 1040-1044). Another, described here, has proved to be topoisomerase I. A protein was purified to near homogeneity based on assays of (i) inhibition of the replication of plasmids (and other supercoiled DNA) lacking oriC and (ii) conferral of dnaA protein dependence on the replication of an oriC plasmid. This specificity protein is indistinguishable from authentic E. coli topoisomerase I by several criteria: (i) molecular weight under denaturing conditions, (ii) relaxation activity on negatively supercoiled DNA, (iii) cleavage pattern of single-stranded DNA, (iv) specificity factor activity, and (v) neutralization of activity by antibody against topoisomerase I. One possible mechanism of the specificity action of topoisomerase I is destabilization of primers for replication except when they are preserved at an oriC sequence bound by dnaA protein and other replication proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1489482850,"The simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen was immunoprecipitated from extracts of infected monkey cells and cleaved with trypsin under conditions of mild proteolysis. The digestion generated fragments from the NH2-terminal region of T antigen which were released from the immunoprecipitates. Pulse-chase experiments showed that most of the newly made T antigen (form A) generated an NH2-terminal fragment of 17 kDa in size, whereas most of the T antigen that had aged in the cell (form C) generated a fragment of 20 kDa. An intermediate form of T antigen (form B), which generated an 18.5- kDa NH2-terminal fragment, was produced in part from form A and was converted to form C during the chase. Phosphate-labeling experiments showed that form C was the species of T antigen that incorporated the most 32P radioactivity at the NH2-terminal region, although some label was also incorporated into forms A and B. In vitro dephosphorylation of gel-purified 18.5- and 20-kDa fragments labeled with [35S]methionine increased the electrophoretic mobility of the fragments to that of 17 kDa. This signified that phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal fragments was directly responsible for their aberrant behavior in acrylamide gels. Although peptide maps of the methionine-labeled tryptic peptides of the 17-, 18.5-, and 20-kDa fragments were very similar to one another, maps of the 32P-labeled tryptic Pronase E peptides of these fragments contained qualitative and quantitative differences. Analysis of the labeled phosphoamino acids of various peptides from these fragments indicated that the 20-kDa fragment was highly phosphorylated at Ser 123 and Thr 124, whereas the 17- and 18.5-kDa fragments were mostly unphosphorylated at these sites. These experiments indicated that T antigen is phosphorylated at the NH2-terminal region in a specific stepwise process and, therefore, that this post-translational modification of T antigen is tightly regulated."

https://openalex.org/W1516876967,"Abstract Limited proteolysis and photoaffinity labeling of fructose-6-P,2-kinase and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase were studied. Proteolysis by trypsin proceeds in two stages in which the first cleavage yields a product, Mr about 53,000, which has lost 90% of fructose-6-P,2-kinase, but retains nearly 80% of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Further digestion of this product yields a second cleavage product, Mr about 50,000, which is completely devoid of the kinase and most of the phosphatase activities. These results indicate that fructose-6-P,2-kinase resides only in the original (native) enzyme (Mr = 55,000), but fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity is present in both the native enzyme and the cleavage product(s). All three activities of fructose-6-P,2-kinase including the forward, the reverse, and ATP-ADP exchange activities are lost to the same degree by the mild proteolysis. Ki of fructose-6-P for fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase is not altered by the proteolysis. Partial protection against the proteolysis is provided by ATP, fructose-6-P, and fructose-2,6-P2. When the tryptic digestion of fructose-6-P,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase was performed before and after phosphorylation of the enzyme by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, both the first and the second cleavage products contained the phosphorylation site. 8-Azido-ATP serves as a substrate for fructose-6-P,2-kinase with a Km of about 1 mM. Exposure of the enzyme-8-azido-ATP complex results in covalent incorporation (0.7 mol/mol of subunit) and 90% inactivation of fructose-6-P,2-kinase without loss of fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. When the native and the first cleavage product of tryptic digestion were photoaffinity labeled with [alpha-32P]8-azido-ATP, the radiolabel occurred only in the native enzyme. These results provide evidence in support of, although not conclusive, the idea that the active sites of this bifunctional enzyme are different and located in two distinct sites."
https://openalex.org/W1528662830,"The ascorbate reduction of horse heart ferricytochrome c in 0.05 M phosphate + 0.25 M sodium sulfate, at pH 7.3, as a function of temperature, 12-36 degrees C, and at alkaline pH 8.4 using stopped flow technique has been examined. The data have been analyzed in terms of a two-step mechanism, binding followed by reduction (Myer, Y.P., Thallam, K.K., and Pande, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9666-9673). At neutral pH and up to about 26 degrees C, the first order reduction constant is independent of temperature, i.e. with zero or near-zero activation energy. At higher temperatures, it becomes temperature-dependent, increasing with increasing temperature with an activation energy of about 35 kcal/mol. The stability of the cytochrome c-ascorbate complex is enhanced in the range 12-26 degrees C, with an enthalpy and an entropy change of about 3 kcal/mol and 32 e.u., respectively. Above 26 degrees C, the stability of the complex decreases. At pH 8.4, the reduction reaction is biphasic, and the behavior of the rapid, ascorbate-dependent component is consistent with the proposed two-step mechanism. A pH change of 1.1 units increases the first order reduction constant by a factor of 6, while the stability constant of the complex decreases to about one-fourth its value. The slow component at pH 8.4 is ascorbate-independent, with a rate constant of 0.043 +/- 0.006 s-1. The zero or near-zero activation energy for the reduction reaction below 26 degrees C and the development of temperature dependence at higher temperatures constitute the bases for concluding that the reduction reaction occurs via tunneling at temperatures below 26 degrees C. The observed reduction constant is consistent with tunneling from a distance of about 16 A, with an energy barrier of about 35 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W1518877204,"We have determined whether two 46-base pair (bp) GC-rich clusters present in the coding region of the yeast mitochondrial var 1 gene are transcribed and retained in the putative mRNA for the var 1 protein. One GC cluster is found in all var 1 alleles, while the other is optional; both are identical in sequence and, when present together in var 1, are arranged in opposite orientation 158 bp apart. Because of their dyad symmetry, these GC clusters would form stem and loop structures if present in RNA. We have exploited this potential for secondary structure to show that these GC clusters are transcribed. Using a 46-bp RsaI-MboI var 1 restriction fragment as primer and 16 S RNA (the putative var 1 mRNA (Farrelly, F., Zassenhaus, H. P., and Butow, R. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6581-6587) purified from strains whose var 1 allele contains one or both of these GC clusters as template for AMV reverse transcriptase, we find the accumulation of a major class of cDNAs whose size is consistent with an impediment of reverse transcription at the predicted positions of the GC clusters in the RNA template. Moreover, depending upon the RNA template, we find that the small fraction of full length cDNA molecules made in the reaction contain one or two SstII sites. Because of fold-back, these sites are predicted to be present in the otherwise single-stranded cDNAs if the GC clusters are transcribed."
