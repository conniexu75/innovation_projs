https://openalex.org/W2014659315,"The liquid-to-solid transition of a simple model liquid confined between two surfaces was studied as a function of surface separation. From large surface separations (more than 1000 angstroms) down to a separation corresponding to seven molecular layers, the confined films displayed a liquid-like shear viscosity. When the surface separation was further decreased by a single molecular spacing, the films underwent an abrupt, reversible transition to a solid. At the transition, the rigidity of the confined films (quantified in terms of an ""effective viscosity"") increased reversibly by at least seven orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2059146878,Long-term analyses of the structure and function of a northern hardwood ecosystem have resulted in measurement of the salient features of the nitrogen cycle. These data allow an evaluation of the importance of the various components and provide a framework for more efficient forest management.
https://openalex.org/W2006739903,"Calculations with data for asteroidal cores indicate that Earth's outer core may have a rhenium/osmium ratio at least 20 percent greater than that of the chondritic upper mantle, potentially leading to an outer core with an osmium-187/osmium-188 ratio at least 8 percent greater than that of chondrites. Because of the much greater abundance of osmium in the outer core relative to the mantle, even a small addition of metal to a plume ascending from the D"" layer would transfer the enriched isotopic signature to the mixture. Sources of certain plume-derived systems seem to have osmium-187/osmium-l88 ratios 5 to 20 percent greater than that for chondrites, consistent with the ascent of a plume from the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2008131259,"An olivine nephelinite from the lower part of a thick alkalic ultrabasic and mafic sequence of volcanic rocks of the northeastern part of the Siberian flood basalt province (SFBP) yielded a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 253.3 Â± 2.6 million years, distinctly older than the main tholeiitic pulse of the SFBP at 250.0 million years. Olivine phenocrysts of this rock showed 3He/4He ratios up to 12.7 times the atmospheric ratio; these values suggest a lower mantle plume origin. The neodymium and strontium isotopes, rare earth element concentration patterns, and cerium/lead ratios of the associated rocks were also consistent with their derivation from a near-chondritic, primitive plume. Geochemical data from the 250-million-year-old volcanic rocks higher up in the sequence indicate interaction of this high-3He SFBP plume with a suboceanic-type upper mantle beneath Siberia."
https://openalex.org/W2011033560,"The Bergman cyclization has been the subject of renewed interest with the discovery of naturally occurring enediyne-based antitumor agents that cleave DNA by means of an aromatic diradical. These natural substrates have a means to trigger this cycloaromatization process. Control of this reaction by substrate modification would allow aromatic diradicals to be generated selectively. In the studies presented here it is disclosed that the Bergman cyclization of 1,2-bis(diphenyl phosphinoethynyl) benzene was accelerated by a factor of >30,000 by the addition of palladium(II) chloride or platinum(II) chloride and was inhibited by the addition of mercury(II) chloride."
https://openalex.org/W2013176118,A theory is proposed for the formation and growth of particle dendrites on a collector placed in an aerosol or hydrosol stream. It is based on the interplay of two intrinsic properties of suspended particles: (i) their finite size and (ii) the randomness of the location of individual particles in the fluid stream. The results of simulations based on this theory resemble those obtained from experiments.
https://openalex.org/W2089088878,fat Nodulation (Nod) factors are lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) secreted by rhizobia to trigger the early steps of nodule organogenesis in leguminous plants. A method to synthesize LCOs in vitro was developed. Synthetic LCOs alleviated the requirement for auxin and cytokinin to sustain growth of cultured tobacco protoplasts. LCOs containing C(18:1) trans-fatty acyl substituents were more effective than those containing cis-fatty acids in promoting cell division as well as in activating an auxin-responsive promoter and the expression of a gene implicated in auxin action. These data indicate that LCOs redirect plant growth also in nonlegumes by activating developmental pathways also targeted by phytohormones.
https://openalex.org/W1999635458,"Photoelectrolytic decomposition of water with visible irradiation is demonstrated in a cell made of p-type gallium phosphide as the cathode and platinum as the anode. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 0.1 percent is achieved with an external bias of 1.3 volts. The stability of the electrode is demonstrated, and the results are discussed in terms of a composite energy diagram."
https://openalex.org/W1974251293,"A new nondestructive method for dating or authenticating man-made glass is proposed, and the initial results of an exploration of the potential of this method are presented. The method is based on a relation between the age of a glass object and the thickness of the layer of hydrated glass on its surface, with the thickness of this hydrated surface layer being measured by means of the (15)N nuclear resonance depth profiling technique. A qualitative age scale is established for some common 19th- and 20th-century American glass."
https://openalex.org/W1991256844,"Observed features of moonquakes are combined with theoretical calculations of the tidal stresses to interpret the moonquake mechanisms. Tidal stresses, together with a postulated ambient tectonic stress, are sufficient to explain the depth, periodicity, and polarity reversal of moonquakes. Both of these stresses are small (on the order of 1 bar) and consistent with the small magnitudes of moonquakes."
https://openalex.org/W2006443762,"Recent radar images of the surface of Venus reveal a complex and varied terrain. By applying a set of simplifying assumptions about the nature of the surfaces returning the radar signal, it is possible to make a number of plausible interpretations. In one region on Venus, several circular features have the gross morphology of degraded impact craters. If they are indeed of impact origin, these features suggest that there exist on Venus areas which are ancient and where erosion or resurfacing has not been as intense or as pervasive as on the earth. In other regions there are intriguing features that may evidence active internal processes. One is a large trough-like depression (0 degrees , 76 degrees W; measuring 1400 by 150 by 2 kilometers) planimetrically suggestive of both the Valles Marineris on Mars and the East African Rift on the earth. Another feature, about 250 kilometers in diameter and of positive relief, includes an 80-kilometer-diameter circular depression at its summit, suggestive of a large volcanic construct. A third region, near 0 degrees , 10 degrees E, contains roughly parallel ranges of mountains separated by valley-like features, with relief varying from small isolated hills several hundred meters high to low ranges on the order of 1000 meters to large mountains approaching 2 kilometers in height. If Venus has a mobile crust similar to the earth's, these mountains may have been produced by compressional tectonics. These interpretations of the radar data indicate that Venus has been a geologically active planet which has developed diverse landforms and therefore is an exciting candidate for future exploration."

The protective isolation provided by the large buffer zone around the Hanford facilities of the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration is the important factor in maintenance of suitable habitat for elk."
https://openalex.org/W2026396599,"""Bubbia"" perrieri, a primitive angiosperm collected once in 1909 in northwestern Madagascar, differs from all other members of its genus and family (Winteraceae) in its bicarpellate, unilocular ovary. Moreover, its inflorescences are terminal, and its development is partially sympodial. It therefore represents the survivor of a previously undetected evolutionary line that should be accorded at least subfamilial status. If so, Winteraceae might, more likely than previously, be considered as allied to Canellaceae, a group of primitive angiosperms that has an ovary of ""Bubbia"" perrieri type and is specialized in some other respects."
https://openalex.org/W1968648838,"Quantitative pyroelectric measurements were made on the leaves of the palmlike plant Encephalartos. A pyroelectric response almost 50 times higher than the normal one could be induced by a small bias electric field, offering a means for highly increasing the efficiency of conversion of thermal to electrical energy. No evidence of ferroelectricity was found."
https://openalex.org/W2006261868,"Rhyolitic volcanic rock in the northern Black Hills has a potassium-argon isotopic age of 10.5 +/- 1.5 million years. This is considerably younger than any previously reported igneous activity in this or adjacent areas and indicates that the renewed uplift of the Black Hills, which occurred after the Oligocene epoch, was also accompanied by some volcanism."
