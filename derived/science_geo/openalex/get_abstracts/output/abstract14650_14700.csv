https://openalex.org/W1676884362,"The amino acid sequence of neurotensin, a hypotensive peptide isolated from acid-acetone extracts of bovine hypothalami, has been established as less than Glu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-Oh. (The nomenclature and symbols follow the suggestions of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 977). This was accomplished by sequence analyses performed on the intact peptide as well as its isolated tryptic, chymotryptic, and papain-generated fragments. The results of enzymic hydrolyses were consistent with the specificities of the enzymes used and indicated that all of the amino acids are unsubstituted and in the L configuration. The absence of non-amino acid constituents was further supported by analyses of electrophoretic mobility-molecular weight relationships of neurotensin and its fragments."

The melatonin content of samples collected between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. was, in each case, several times higher than that of samples collected between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. or between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m."

The calcium current is greatest when first measured at 6 hours after fertilization and decreases as the time of final commitment to growth in a particular direction approaches.

Eivence that mannosyl phosphoryl polyisoprenol serves as a mannosyl donor for synthesis of both oligosaccharide-lipid and glycoproteins was previously reported (Waechter, C.J., Lucas, J.J., and Lennarz, W.J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7570-7579). In this study the oligosaccharide-lipid has been isolated, and the oligosaccharide has been partially characterized. Based on paper chromatography the oligosaccharide chain contains 7 to 9 glycose units. The glycose at the reducing terminus is N-acetylglucosamine, whereas mannose is found at the nonreducing end. When UDP-N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine is incubated with oviduct membranes in the absence of GDP-mannose, a 14C-labeled chitobiosyl lipid, but little oligosaccharide-lipid is synthesized. When GDP-mannose is also present in the incubation mixture an oligosaccharide-lipid is formed containing N-acetyl[14C]glucosaminyl residues. This oligosaccharide-lipid is chromatographically identical with the [14C]mannose-containing oligosaccharide-lipid isolated in the earlier study cited above. When the N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine-oligosaccharide released from the oligosaccharide-lipid by mild acid is treated with partially purified alpha-mannosidase the major radioactive product is [14C]chitobiose. Evidence that the [14C]mannose-containing oligosaccharide-lipid serves as an oligosaccharide donor for glycoprotein synthesis was obtained by incubation of partially purified oligosaccharide-lipid with the membranes. The products of this incubation were shown to be glycoproteins on the basis of their sensitivity to pronase, as determined by both gel filtration and paper electrophoresis. Similar experiments, using oligosaccharide-lipid doubly labeled with [14C]mannose and N-acetyl[3H]glucosamine, provided evidence that the oligosaccharide chain of the oligosaccharide-lipid is transferred en bloc to glycoprotein s."
https://openalex.org/W1907944131,"The adenylate cyclase of turkey erythrocytes is inhibited by low concentrations of calcium. Calcium binds to the enzyme system so tightly that the enzyme can compete with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N1-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) for the metal. The calcium binding site is shown to be distinct from the magnesium binding sites required for activity. Thus Ca2+ functions as a negative allosteric effector. Calcium decreases dramatically the V max of the catecholamine-stimulated activity without affecting the affinity for the hormone or for the substrate ATP. The cooperativity in the response toward Mg2+ dependence (Hill coefficient, nH equals 3) is also unaffected by Ca2+ where as the S0.5 (concentration yielding one-half V max) for Mg2+ is affected only slightly. The Ca2+ effect is cooperative (nH equals 2) and therefore brought about by a cluster of Ca2+ binding sites. Mn2+ can substitute for Mg2+ as the enzyme activator but the Mn2+-activated enzyme is no longer inhibited by Ca2+. The possible physiological significance of the Ca2+ effect is discussed."

When taken together with the earlier demonstration that mouse L2 CELLS AND 3T3 cells also produce an NGF-like protein, these findings suggest that secretion of this factor may be a general property of fibroblast."
https://openalex.org/W2039609353,"Various doses of d- and l-amphetamine affect the temporal pattern of rat behavior in the following ways: First, the patterns of activity produced by d- and l-amphetamine are similar but out of phase; that is, the response to d-amphetamine has a relatively shorter latency whereas the effects of l-amphetamine persist for longer periods of time. Second, d-amphetamine is approximately five times as potent as l-amphetamine in its effects on both the total amount of locomotor activity and the duration of stereotypy. Both amphetamine-induced locomotion and stereotypy may be mediated by the same neurochemical mechanisms."

Endogenous levels of brain dopamine were unchanged, whereas norepinephrine was increased, suggesting a possible relationship between lead exposure during earliest developmental periods, increased motor activity, and brain norepinephrine, and not brain dopamine as previously postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2052201833,"Male rats were implanted subcutaneously with a pellet containg 75 milligrams of morphine base or placebo, and naloxone hydrochloride (4 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) was administered 72 hours later. Treatment with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (2, 5, or 10 milligrams per kilogram) 1 hour before maloxone administration significantly reduced the intensity of abstinence; the two higher doses blocked the appearance of wet shakes and escapes, diarrhea, and increased defecation. delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol did not induce abstinence itself, and prior treatment with cannabidiol was ineffective in reducing naloxoneprecipitated abstinence in animals with morphine pellets. These data suggest that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol may be of value in facilitating narcotic detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W2030020962,"Psychiatric patients studied early during treatment with chlorpromazine and thioridazine demonstrated elevated probenecid-induced accumulations of homovanillic acid, a major dopamine metabolite, in cerebrospinal fluid. In those studied after longer periods of treatment with phenothiazines, homovanillic acid values were not elevated. This suggests that there are time-dependent effects of phenothiazines on dopamine turn-over that may be relevant to the time course of antipsychotic efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W1495694651,"The substitution of trivalent lanthanide ions for Ca(II) in the Ca(II)-DEPENDENT ACTIVATION OF BOVINE Factor X by the coagulant protein of Russell's viper venom was studied at pH 6.8. Factor X contains two high affinity metal binding sites which bind Gd(III), Sm(III), and Yb(III) with a Kd of about 4 X 10-7 M and four to six lower affinity metal binding sites which bind Gd(III), Sm(III) with a Kd of about 1.5 X 10-5M. In comparison, 1 mol of Factor X binds 2 mol of Ca(II) with a Kd of 3 X 10-4M and weakly binds many additional Ca(II) ions. No binding of Gd(III) to the venom protein was observed. Dy(III), Yb(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), Eu(III), La(III), AND Nd(III) cannot substitute for Ca(II) in the Ca(II)-dependent activation of Factor X by the venom protein at pH 6.8. Kinetic data consistent with the models of competitive inhibition of Ca(II) by Nd(III) yielded a Ki of 1 to 4 X 10-6M. The substitution of lanthanide ions for Ca(II) to promote protein complex formation of Factor X-metal-venom protein without the activation of Factor X facilitated the purification of the coagulant protein from crude venom by affinity chromatography. Using a column containing Factor X covalently bound to agarose which was equilibrated in 10 mM Nd(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), or La(III), the coagulant protein was purified 10-fold in 40% yield from crude venom and migrated as a single band on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. These data suggest that lanthanide ions complete with Ca(II) for the metal binding sites of Factor X and facilitate the formation of a nonproductive ternary complex of venom protein-Factor X-metal. Tb(III) fluorescence, with emission maxima at 490 and 545 nm, is enhanced 10,000-fold in the presence of Factor X. The study of the participation of an energy donor intrinsic to Factor X in energy transfer to Tb(III) may be useful in the characterization of the metal binding sites of Factor X."
https://openalex.org/W1568565336,"Crystals of cytochrome b5 reduced by sodium dithionite are isomorphous with the oxidized form. An electron density difference map between the two forms was calculated at 2.8 A resolution. There are no changes in main chain conformation or internal side chain orientation upon reduction. However, an ion becomes attached at the entrance of the heme crevice causing displacement of a surface lysine side chain on an adjacent molecule. The ion, identified as a cation by the nature of its coordinating ligands, appears to neutralize one of the heme propionate groups which is partially buried. It is proposed that the negatively charged propionate serves to neutralize the net formal positive charge on the heme iron in the oxidized cytochrome and that the neutralization of the heme iron upon reduction then leads to binding of a cation to the propionate."
https://openalex.org/W1492781998,"Activation of the acetylcholine receptors of cultured muscle cells by carbamylcholine increases the rate of passive 22-Na+ uptake into the muscle cells up to 20-fold. The Na+ transport activity of the receptor desensitizes during exposure to carbamylcholine. The rate and extent of desensitization is reduced by lowering the assay temperature from 36 degrees to 2 degrees, allowing accurate measurements of initial rates of Na+ transport by the receptor. Activation of the receptor by carbamylcholine and acetylcholine is significantly cooperative (Hill coefficients of 1.4 to 2.0). Inhibition by D-tubocurarine is not cooperative. The carbamylcholine-induced Na+ transport activity of the receptor is inhibited 50% by 4 muM D-tubocurarine, 100 muM atropine, or 1.6 nM diiodo-alpha-bungarotoxin but is not affected by tetrodotoxin. The initial rate of Na+ transport by the receptor is temperature-independent between 2 degrees and 36 degrees. Receptor Na+ transport is saturable by Na+ at 2 degrees with an apparent Km of 150 plus and minus 20 mM. Saturation by Na+ not observed at 36 degrees at the concentrations tested. Saturation by Na+ is observed at 2 degrees both under conditions of net Na+ influx and under conditions of isotopic exchange at equilibrium. The receptor does not catalyze obligatory exchange diffusion at a detectable rate. Comparison of binding of [125-I]diiodo-alpha-bungarotoxin with rates of Na+ transport indicates a turnover number of 2 times 10-7 ions per min per receptor. These results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of Na+ transport by the receptor."

Studies with tritiated water as a tracer for native water showed that roughly one-third of the water secreted as milk was returned to the mother. The results are cogent to studies of water balance of lactation and to current methods used for estimating milk production."
https://openalex.org/W1556972298,"The irreversible thermal denaturation of the association complexes of bovine beta-trypsin with soybean trypsin inhibitor or ovomucoid was observed with a differential scanning calorimeter. Association of trypsin with either inhibitor results in increased heat stability. The largest effect is observed with beta-trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor. At pH 6.7, first order rate constants (s-1) for denaturation at 72 degrees, determined at a heating rate of 10 degrees per min, are: beta-trypsin, 30 times 10-3; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 9 times 10-3; trypsin-soybean trypsin inhibitor complex, 0.4 times 10-3. Under equivalent conditions, rate constants for ovomucoid and trypsin-ovomucoid complex are 4 times 10-3 and 1 times 10-3 s-1, respectively. These changes in rate correspond to heat stabilization of trypsin equivalent to an increase of 16 and 9 degrees, respectively, in its observed denaturation temperature. Rate constants determined for beta-trypsin and trypsin-soybean trypsin inhibitor complex are independent of heating rate; those for soybean trypsin inhibitor and ovomucoid are a function of heating rate. This suggests that predenaturational conformational alterations may be important steps in the denaturation of the inhibitors. Activation energies for denaturation of the complexes and their components are all similar, averaging 70 kcal per mol. The large activation energies observed suggest that denaturation of the complexes is not rate-limited by their dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2071596717,"Procollagen peptidase was recovered from the medium of human and mouse fibroblast cultures by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The test substrate for the in vitro enzymatic reaction was radioactively-labeled, disulfide-linked procollagen prepared from the medium of human fibroblast cultures. The enzymatic digests were analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gets containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The human and mouse enzymes reacted with the substrate to generate the same intermediates and final products. Procollagen peptidase acts as an endopeptidase which cleaves each of the three procollagen chains in turn. The final products of the reaction are collagen and a three-chain, disulfide-linked fragment derived from the nonhelical aminoterminal residues of procollagen."

https://openalex.org/W1573070021,"The adenylate energy charge in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells increases when cells are cultivated in serum-limiting medium and decreases when they are incubated in glucose- or amino acid-limited media. Protein synthetic rates decrease in cells deprived of serum, glucose, or amino acids. Supplementation of deprived cells with respective nutrients restores normal protein synthetic rates and adenylate energy charge values. Serum-deprived cells incubated in depleted serum media do not increase their rates of protein synthesis and their adenylate energy charge remains elevated. These results suggest that serum factors regulate protein synthetic rates by mechanisms other than those regulating the availability in cells of glucose or of amino acids. The increased rates of utilization of glucose and of amino acids following the addition of serum are probably due to increased biosynthetic requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1519935661,"Proton-decoupled Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of natural abundance 13C was used to obtain spectra of cyanoferrimyoglobin of sperm whale (Physeter catadon) at 14.1 and 23.5 kG. Comparison of the spin lattice relaxation times at these two field strengths allowed the unambiguous assignment of a rotational correlation time of 22 plus or minus 5 ns for the alpha carbon resonances. The spin lattice relaxation time value for a major band attributable to aromatic carbon atoms also corresponded to a single correlation time, attributable to over-all tumbling of the molecule. Certain narrower resonances reflect other modes of rotational motion in addition to the over-all tumbling. Observations of nuclear Overhauser enhancement and line widths accord with these conslusions."
https://openalex.org/W1591138941,"The role of cytochrome P-450 in the side chain cleavage of 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol was investigated by examining the effect of carbon monoxide on the conversion of this substance to pregnenolone by cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria; the effect of carbon monoxide on the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the same enzyme also was examined. Fifty per cent inhibition of side chain cleavage was produced by gas mixtures with the following ratios: CO:O2,1.5 for cholesterol and 1.2 for 20S, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Photochemical action spectra revealed that light of wavelength 451 nm decreased the inhibition of side chain cleavage of both substrates to a greater extent than light of other wavelenghts. It is concluded that the heme moiety of P-450 is involved in the cleavage of 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1586836404,"Cell-free, dialyzed extracts from Azotobacter vinelandii rapidly dephosphorylate [U-14C]ATP to labeled ADP and AMP, which is then degraded to hypoxanthine, the end product of AMP catabolism under the experimental conditions which were used. The intermediates of the pathway from ATP to hypoxanthine have been identified by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by the 14-C content. The concentrations of intermediates present during the production of hypoxanthine are consistent with AMP nucleosidase being responsible for AMP degradation in these extracts. This result was confirmed in experiments which utilized rabbit antibody prepared against purified AMP nucleosidase. The antibody inhibited AMP nucleosidase activity in cell-free extracts but did not inhibit adenine demanase or adenosine deaminase from the same extracts. In the presence of antibody prepared against purified AMP nucleosidase, the dialyzed extracts showed a marked reduction in the production of hypoxanthine from ATP. Other enzymes which could be responsible theoretically for the conversion of AMP to hypoxanthine were not detected by standard assay procedures. These results are consistent with AMP degradation proceeding by way of AMP nucleosidase to yield adenine and ribose 5-phosphate. The adenine is then converted to hypoxanthine by adenine deaminase. Both of these enzymes were present in sufficient quantities to account for the observed rates of hypoxanthine formation. The rate of hypoxanthine formation decreases during the time course of the [U-14-C]ATP degradation experiments, even though the concentration of AMP remains high. This decrease in the rate of hypoxanthine formation as a function of time is attributed to the decreasing ATP and increasing P0-4 concentrations, since ATP is an activator of AMP nucleosidase and P0-4 is an inhibitor. These observations suggest that the in vivo activity of AMP nucleosidase could also be regulated by changes in the relative ratios of ATP:AMP:P0-4."

Infusion of 1 unit of 25-HCC per hour for 6 hours induced an antiphosphaturia only when administered with 0.2 units of PTH per hour, while neither agent alone changed phosphate excretion. A dose of 2.0 units of PTH per hour did not cause phosphaturia unless given with 1 unit of 25-HCC per hour. In pharmacologic dosage (5 units per hour), PTH produced phosphaturia in the absence of the metabolite."

https://openalex.org/W1602950596,"Abstract The photoinactivation of the δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase of Pseudomonas testosteroni in the presence of 3-oxo-4-estren-17β-yl acetate and air is accompanied by destruction of histidine and aspartate (or asparagine). The first order rate constant of photoinactivation of the enzyme is. equal, within experimental error, to the first order rate constant for the destruction of a single aspartate (or asparagine) residue and is considerably greater than the first order rate constant for the destruction of a single residue of histidine. When thephotolysis is carried out under anaerobic conditions, only aspartic acid (or asparagine) is destroyed as enzyme is inactivated. Both inactivation and aspartate (or asparagine) destruction occur to a greater extent in the absence of oxygen than in its presence. The destruction of histidine, on the other hand, is found to be strictly oxygen-dependent. These results suggest that photochemical modification of a single residue of aspartate (or asparagine) is largely, if not entirely, responsible for photoinactivation of the enzyme under these conditions. When irradiated in the presence of 3-oxo-4-extren-17β-yl acetate, performic acid-oxidized bovine pancreatic ribonuclease does not suffer any detectable destruction of its aspartic or asparaginyl residues but does undergo significant destruction of its histidine residues. These observations suggest that the aspartate (or asparagine) residue modification found with isomerase is an active site-directed photochemical reaction, whereas the modification of histidine may not be."

https://openalex.org/W1541922629,"Antibodies against embryonic chick bone collagen were prepared in rabbits and were purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography until collagen-specific and RNase-free. 125I-anti-collagen antibodies were used to locate the collagen-synthesizing polysomes of 8-day chick embryo wings and legs on sucrose gradients by measuring the polysome associated radioactivity. The 125I-anti-collagen antibodies bound predominantly to polysomes in the heavy region of sucrose gradients. These binding sites could only be saturated with homologous anti-collagen antibodies. Further evidence for the specificity of this reaction was provided by a correlation of the amount of anti-collagen antibodies bound in the heavy regions of sucrose gradients with the amount of collagen being synthesized by a particular tissue. The validity of this immunochemical method was confirmed by localizing collagen-synthesizing polysomes by an independent method which utilizes their ability to incorporate [3H]proline into collagen peptides in a cell-free system. The collagen-synthesizing polysomes are found in a single, rather broad peak in these gradients. The results of shortening the centrifugation time indicate that larger species of collagen-synthesizing polysomes are not present in these tissues. Partial purification of the collagen-synthesizing polysomes may be achieved by specifically sedimenting them after treatment with anti-collagen antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit antibodies."

Whereas splenocytes from normal noninfected animals showed the expected morphologic classes of lymphocytes, including those with smooth surfaces and with numerous villous projections, an alteration of cell type was evident within a few days after infection. Friend leukemia virus caused a rapid decrease in the number of villous cells, with a concomitant increase in the number of cells with smoother surfaces. By the end of the first 1 to 12 weeks after infection the majority of cells were smooth, many showing distinct morphologic changes, including ""holes"" and a spongy appearance. Nearly all of the splenocytes were abnormal in appearance by days 17 to 30 after infection, with most showing a spongy topography. These changes paralleled the marked immunosuppression induced by Friend leukemia virus infection, as well as the appearance of virus-associated surface antigen on individual splenocytes. Topographic changes evident by examination with scanning electron microscopy were not readily apparent by either standard histology or transmission electron microscopy."
