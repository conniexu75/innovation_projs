https://openalex.org/W1651215666,"The most common human cancers are malignant neoplasms of the skin. Incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising especially steeply, with minimal progress in non-surgical treatment of advanced disease. Despite significant effort to identify independent predictors of melanoma outcome, no accepted histopathological, molecular or immunohistochemical marker defines subsets of this neoplasm. Accordingly, though melanoma is thought to present with different 'taxonomic' forms, these are considered part of a continuous spectrum rather than discrete entities. Here we report the discovery of a subset of melanomas identified by mathematical analysis of gene expression in a series of samples. Remarkably, many genes underlying the classification of this subset are differentially regulated in invasive melanomas that form primitive tubular networks in vitro, a feature of some highly aggressive metastatic melanomas. Global transcript analysis can identify unrecognized subtypes of cutaneous melanoma and predict experimentally verifiable phenotypic characteristics that may be of importance to disease progression."

The genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,961,146 bp and 1,072,314 bp that together encode 3,885 open reading frames. The vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions (such as DNA replication, transcription, translation and cell-wall biosynthesis) and pathogenicity (for example, toxins, surface antigens and adhesins) are located on the large chromosome. In contrast, the small chromosome contains a larger fraction (59%) of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome (42%), and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the γ-Proteobacteria. The small chromosome also carries a gene capture system (the integron island) and host ‘addiction’ genes that are typically found on plasmids; thus, the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral Vibrio species. The V. cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living, environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen."

A variety of observations suggest the protein partitions between membrane and cytosol, a behavior apparently conferred by a conserved structural similarity to the exchangeable apolipoproteins. Here we show that the capacity to bind lipids is broadly distributed across exons 3, 4, and 5 (encoding residues 1–102). Binding to phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles requires the presence of all three exons, while binding to phosphatidic acid can be mediated by any one of the three. Consistent with a “class A2” helical binding mechanism, lipid association is disrupted by introduction of charged residues along the hydrophobic face of the predicted α-helix and also by biotinylation of conserved lysines (which line the interfacial region). Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals a general correlation between the amount of lipid-induced α-helix content and the degree of binding to PS-containing vesicles. Two point mutations associated with Parkinson's disease have little (A30P) or no (A53T) effect on lipid binding or α-helicity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that α-synuclein's normal functions depend on an ability to undergo a large conformational change in the presence of specific phospholipids. α-Synuclein has been centrally implicated in neurodegenerative disease, and a normal function in developmental synaptic plasticity has been suggested by studies in songbirds.

In its molecular sequence, AS is very closely related to three other neural proteins, β and γ-synuclein (1Clayton D.F. George J.M.

Additionally, two different alleles of AS are linked genetically to a rare form of autosomal dominant, early onset Parkinson's disease (11Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehijia A.

Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar).The normal function of AS is not yet understood. We have noted, however, a striking relationship to the family of apolipoproteins, apparent at the level of secondary structure (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Both protein families are organized around a repeating 11-residue periodicity. In the apolipoproteins, these repeats give rise to amphipathic α-helical domains, which have been extensively studied and assigned to subclasses according to their unique structural and functional properties. AS shares the defining properties of the class A2 lipid-binding helix, distinguished by clustered basic residues at the polar-apolar interface, positioned ± 100° from the center of the apolar face; a preponderance of lysine relative to arginine among these basic residues; and several glutamate residues localized to the polar face (14Segrest J. De Loof H. Dohlman J. Brouillette C. Anantharamaiah G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 15Segrest J. Jones M. De Loof H. Brouillette C. Venkatachalapathi Y. Anantharamaiah G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these structural features, AS binds to synthetic vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, and this binding is accompanied by a shift to a largely α-helical conformation (13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe experiments to characterize the structural interaction of AS with acidic phospholipid vesicles. First, we used site-directed mutagenesis to map the domains that participate in lipid binding. Next, we tested several structural predictions of the class A2 helical model of lipid binding, by manipulating specific residues in the hydrophobic and interfacial domains of the predicted helix. Finally, we examined two Parkinson's disease-associated point mutations, which (based on our structural model) are predicted to have different effects on lipid binding. The results reveal that lipid binding is a robust and broadly distributed property of the molecule that is nonetheless dependent upon specific conserved structural features shared with apolipoproteins.DISCUSSIONThis study provides a basis for understanding the observed tendency of AS to interact with a subset of cellular membranes. The evidence here supports a prediction made earlier on structural grounds that reversible membrane binding would arise intrinsically from an extended apolipoprotein-like domain apparent at the level of secondary structure (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). This domain comprises two-thirds of the protein's sequence and has been very specifically conserved among the related synuclein genes and across the range of vertebrate species for which synuclein sequences have been defined (1Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems likely that this property is central to the cellular functions of the synuclein family. Our deletion analysis suggests that essentially all of this domain is required for binding to PS-containing vesicles, and even a single amino acid substitution (A30P) can cause a detectable reduction in PS binding.We obtained further confirmation of the class A2 helical model for lipid binding by selectively manipulating the residues along the predicted hydrophobic face. We generated two mutants, one of which shows diminished lipid-induced helicity while retaining some capacity to bind lipids and another in which lipid binding is completely abolished. These mutants may be useful in future studies of the molecular and cellular functions of AS.The experiments here used vesicles containing relatively high proportions of PA or PS (50%). Although these high concentrations are useful for experimental purposes, AS will bind to vesicles containing lower percentages of these lipids.2 In nervous tissue, PA comprises approximately 1–3% of total phospholipid, whereas PS is more abundant (12–22% of total phospholipids) (23Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to relate these values directly to the local composition of specific membranes inside the cell, since these lipids are not distributed evenly in the cell and are generated and metabolized rapidly. PA, for example, is generated by the highly localized action of phospholipase D on specific membrane domains (24Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that the strength of the interaction between AS and different phospholipids varies, even among different acidic phospholipids. As few as 14 residues (exon 4) are sufficient to confer partial binding to PA, whereas all three lipid binding exons (i.e. exons 3–5) are required for binding to PS. PA binding is also more resistant to the effects of the TsixK mutations. In other work, we have found that AS also binds to phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. 2R. J. Perrin, J. M. George, and D. F. Clayton, unpublished observation. All four of these lipid binding partners (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PS, and PA) are involved in cellular signaling pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 24Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 25Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Int. 1993; 22: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In neurons, AS is a very abundant protein, with estimated concentrations in the micromolar range. 3J. Payton, unpublished observation. In cultured cells, its distribution tends to be rather ubiquitous (27Withers G. George J. Banker G. Clayton D.F. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but in the intact brain it is highly localized to presynaptic terminals (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 28Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. Rohan de Silva H. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The mechanism of localization is unknown, but a differential affinity for specific phospholipids could be a factor. PS, for example, is known to be enriched in synaptosomal fractions (29Salem Jr., N. Niebylski C.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The consequences of AS-membrane interactions for cell function remain to be defined. Intercalation of AS into the lipid bilayer may functionally alter the biophysical properties of the membrane, specifically its packing density or surface pressure, to influence fusion or budding events. Alternatively, the pronounced conformational change of AS upon binding membranes may facilitate or inhibit its specific interactions with other proteins. AS molecules might thereby serve to recruit other cytosolic or membrane proteins to membrane regions of high acidic phospholipid content.One specific functional hypothesis arises from AS's potent inhibition of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) (30Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This enzyme activity has been associated with movement of membranes from intracellular stores to the cell surface and with cytoskeletal reorganization (31Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which may influence vesicle docking at the presynaptic terminal. For activity, PLD2 requires two lipids: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for activation and phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. Upon activation, PLD2 cleaves phosphatidylcholine, producing free choline and PA, which may be processed further into additional signaling lipids (e.g. diacylglycerol and arachidonic acid). Consequently, AS may function in a local negative feedback loop wherein PA, the product of PLD2, selectively recruits AS to sites of PLD2 activity.Selective membrane binding could also be relevant to the phenotypic effects reported for AS knockout mice (32Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). These mice are viable and superficially normal, but significant alterations are detected in the dynamic properties of dopamine release from electrically stimulated terminals in slices of striatum. Specifically, dopamine release recovers more quickly in the AS-deficient mice, in a stimulation paradigm referred to as “poststimulus depression.” From this and other evidence, the authors infer that AS may function to regulate the rate at which the “readily releasable pool” of vesicles (33Stevens C.F. Wesseling J.F. Neuron. 1999; 24: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Dittman J.S. Regehr W.G. J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) is regenerated following particular patterns of synaptic excitation. Consistent with such a role, AS is especially enriched in a vesicle-containing presynaptic compartment displaced from the active zone (37Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 38Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antisense disruption of AS synthesis in cultured hippocampal neurons causes an apparent reduction in this “distal pool” of synaptic vesicles (38Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Apart from its undefined role in normal brain function, AS has a direct involvement in neurodegenerative disease, since it is the major protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. In the great majority of cases, Lewy body formation is not linked to genetic mutations in AS, so pathological aggregation of AS must depend most commonly on its interactions with other entities in the cell. Growing evidence suggests that Lewy body formation may involve oxidative cross-linking of AS (39Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar,40Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sisk A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Membranes are major sites of lipid peroxidation (41Refsgaard H.H. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), hence recruitment of AS to membrane environments could be an early step in the generation of pathological AS aggregates. The ability of AS to interact selectively and reversibly with specific phospholipids may thus be of central relevance not only to its normal function but also to neurodegenerative disease. α-Synuclein (AS)1 is an abundant and highly conserved neuronal protein in vertebrates, implicated in both normal synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative disease. In its molecular sequence, AS is very closely related to three other neural proteins, β and γ-synuclein (1Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and synoretin (2Surguchov A. Surgucheva I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), all of unknown function. In songbirds, expression of the protein coincides with a major synaptic reorganization in the circuit controlling learned song (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Although these high concentrations are useful for experimental purposes, AS will bind to vesicles containing lower percentages of these lipids.2 In nervous tissue, PA comprises approximately 1–3% of total phospholipid, whereas PS is more abundant (12–22% of total phospholipids) (23Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to relate these values directly to the local composition of specific membranes inside the cell, since these lipids are not distributed evenly in the cell and are generated and metabolized rapidly. PA, for example, is generated by the highly localized action of phospholipase D on specific membrane domains (24Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that the strength of the interaction between AS and different phospholipids varies, even among different acidic phospholipids. As few as 14 residues (exon 4) are sufficient to confer partial binding to PA, whereas all three lipid binding exons (i.e. exons 3–5) are required for binding to PS. PA binding is also more resistant to the effects of the TsixK mutations. In other work, we have found that AS also binds to phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. 2R. J. Perrin, J. M. George, and D. F. Clayton, unpublished observation. All four of these lipid binding partners (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PS, and PA) are involved in cellular signaling pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 24Liscovitch M.

Payton, unpublished observation. In cultured cells, its distribution tends to be rather ubiquitous (27Withers G. George J. Banker G. Clayton D.F. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but in the intact brain it is highly localized to presynaptic terminals (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 28Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. Rohan de Silva H. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The mechanism of localization is unknown, but a differential affinity for specific phospholipids could be a factor. PS, for example, is known to be enriched in synaptosomal fractions (29Salem Jr., N. Niebylski C.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The consequences of AS-membrane interactions for cell function remain to be defined. Intercalation of AS into the lipid bilayer may functionally alter the biophysical properties of the membrane, specifically its packing density or surface pressure, to influence fusion or budding events. Alternatively, the pronounced conformational change of AS upon binding membranes may facilitate or inhibit its specific interactions with other proteins. AS molecules might thereby serve to recruit other cytosolic or membrane proteins to membrane regions of high acidic phospholipid content.One specific functional hypothesis arises from AS's potent inhibition of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) (30Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This enzyme activity has been associated with movement of membranes from intracellular stores to the cell surface and with cytoskeletal reorganization (31Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which may influence vesicle docking at the presynaptic terminal. For activity, PLD2 requires two lipids: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for activation and phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. Upon activation, PLD2 cleaves phosphatidylcholine, producing free choline and PA, which may be processed further into additional signaling lipids (e.g. diacylglycerol and arachidonic acid). Consequently, AS may function in a local negative feedback loop wherein PA, the product of PLD2, selectively recruits AS to sites of PLD2 activity.Selective membrane binding could also be relevant to the phenotypic effects reported for AS knockout mice (32Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A.

These mice are viable and superficially normal, but significant alterations are detected in the dynamic properties of dopamine release from electrically stimulated terminals in slices of striatum. Specifically, dopamine release recovers more quickly in the AS-deficient mice, in a stimulation paradigm referred to as “poststimulus depression.” From this and other evidence, the authors infer that AS may function to regulate the rate at which the “readily releasable pool” of vesicles (33Stevens C.F.

Nature. 1998; 394: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) is regenerated following particular patterns of synaptic excitation. Consistent with such a role, AS is especially enriched in a vesicle-containing presynaptic compartment displaced from the active zone (37Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 38Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antisense disruption of AS synthesis in cultured hippocampal neurons causes an apparent reduction in this “distal pool” of synaptic vesicles (38Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Apart from its undefined role in normal brain function, AS has a direct involvement in neurodegenerative disease, since it is the major protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. In the great majority of cases, Lewy body formation is not linked to genetic mutations in AS, so pathological aggregation of AS must depend most commonly on its interactions with other entities in the cell. Growing evidence suggests that Lewy body formation may involve oxidative cross-linking of AS (39Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar,40Hashimoto M. Hsu L.J. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sisk A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Membranes are major sites of lipid peroxidation (41Refsgaard H.H. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), hence recruitment of AS to membrane environments could be an early step in the generation of pathological AS aggregates. The ability of AS to interact selectively and reversibly with specific phospholipids may thus be of central relevance not only to its normal function but also to neurodegenerative disease. This study provides a basis for understanding the observed tendency of AS to interact with a subset of cellular membranes. The evidence here supports a prediction made earlier on structural grounds that reversible membrane binding would arise intrinsically from an extended apolipoprotein-like domain apparent at the level of secondary structure (3George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). This domain comprises two-thirds of the protein's sequence and has been very specifically conserved among the related synuclein genes and across the range of vertebrate species for which synuclein sequences have been defined (1Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems likely that this property is central to the cellular functions of the synuclein family. Our deletion analysis suggests that essentially all of this domain is required for binding to PS-containing vesicles, and even a single amino acid substitution (A30P) can cause a detectable reduction in PS binding. We obtained further confirmation of the class A2 helical model for lipid binding by selectively manipulating the residues along the predicted hydrophobic face. We generated two mutants, one of which shows diminished lipid-induced helicity while retaining some capacity to bind lipids and another in which lipid binding is completely abolished. These mutants may be useful in future studies of the molecular and cellular functions of AS. The experiments here used vesicles containing relatively high proportions of PA or PS (50%).

We have characterized eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against the 175-kDa HA receptor partially purified from rat LECs. These mAbs also cross-react with the 300-kDa HA receptor. The 175-kDa HA receptor is a single protein, whereas the 300-kDa species contains three subunits, α, β, and γ at 260, 230, and 97 kDa, respectively (Zhou, B., Oka, J. A., and Weigel, P. H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33831–33834). The 97-kDa subunit was not recognized by any of the mAbs in Western blots. Based on their cross-reactivity with these mAbs, the 175-, 230-, and 260-kDa proteins appear to be related. Two of the mAbs inhibit 125I-HA binding and endocytosis by LECs at 37 °C. All of these results confirm that the mAbs recognize thebone fide LEC HA receptor. Indirect immunofluoresence shows high protein expression in liver sinusoids, the venous sinuses of the red pulp in spleen, and the medullary sinuses of lymph nodes. Because the tissue distribution for this endocytic HA receptor is not unique to liver, we propose the name HARE (HAreceptor for endocytosis).

HA plays a key role in development, morphogenesis, and differentiation, in cell adhesion and proliferation, and in inflammation and wound healing (2Toole B.P. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In humans the total body turnover of HA is several grams per day (1). Although local turnover of HA occurs in avascular tissues, particularly cartilage (5Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Aguiar D.J. Knudson W. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), two major clearance systems are responsible for HA degradation and removal in the body (4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). The first is the lymphatic system, which accounts for ∼85% of the HA turnover, and the second is in the liver, which accounts for the other ∼15% of the total body HA turnover. Throughout the body, HA is continuously synthesized and degraded in almost all tissues. At the same time, chondroitin sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans are also released from the cleavage of proteoglycans, especially aggregating proteoglycans associated with HA. Large native HA molecules (∼107 Da) are partially degraded to large fragments (∼106 Da) that are released from the matrix and enter the lymphatic system, flowing to lymph nodes. The lymph nodes completely degrade the majority of HA (∼85%) by unknown mechanisms. Neither the responsible cell type, the receptor involved, nor the location in lymph nodes at which HA uptake and degradation occurs has been determined. The remaining HA (∼15%) that escapes degradation in the lymph nodes ultimately flows into the blood at the thoracic duct. Since HA is an exceptionally viscous polysaccharide in solution, it would be deleterious for the blood concentration of HA, even at relatively low molecular weight, to increase. Clearance of this circulating HA and the other glycosaminoglycan degradation fragments is presumably important for normal health (1, 4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Elevated serum HA levels are associated with a variety of diseases and pathological conditions such as liver cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, fibromyalgia, and some cancers (7Yamada M.

These workers attempted to purify the HA receptor without the use of an assay to measure HA binding activity. The claim that the HA receptor had been purified was subsequently acknowledged to be an artifact due to the nonspecific binding of ICAM-1 to the HA affinity resin (17McCourt P.A.G. Gustafson S. Int.

Based on SDS-PAGE, after reduction of disulfide bonds, the 175-kDa HA receptor is a single protein, whereas the 300-kDa species contains three subunits, α, β, and γ at 260, 230, and 97 kDa, respectively.

Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).125I-HA was prepared using IODOGEN (Pierce) and a unique hexylamine derivative of HA, modified only at the reducing end to contain an iodinatable hydroxyphenyl group as described previously (22Raja R.H. LeBoeuf R. Stone G. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 139: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Typical specific activities of the radiolabeled HA were 2 × 108 dpm/nmol of oligosaccharide (∼3 × 106 dpm/μg). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Acrylamide and urea were from U.S. Biochemical Corp. p-Nitrophenylphosphate was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. N-Glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52) and all other chemicals, which were reagent grade, were from Sigma. TBS contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). LECs were isolated by a modified collagenase perfusion procedure (23Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Yannariello-Brown J. Frost S.J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by differential centrifugation and then discontinuous Percoll gradient fractionation. The final LECs were collected from the 25/50% interface and washed three times with PBS at 4 °C, and are >95% pure. For preparation of membranes (24Yannariello-Brown J. Frost S.J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cells were hypotonically swollen, homogenized, and centrifuged at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the total membrane fraction, which was stored frozen at −80 °C with no loss in HARE activity. The LECs were collected from the first PBS wash after Percoll gradient fractionation. They were washed twice with RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin/streptomycin (100 units each) and 2 mm glutamine and plated at 1.5–2 × 106cells/ml on fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) 24-well tissue culture plates for endocytosis experiments or on glass coverslips for microscopy. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells were washed three times with PBS, washed once with RPMI 1640, and put back in RPMI 1640 without serum if they were to be used immediately or with 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated bovine serum if they were to be cultured overnight before use. Endocytosis assays were performed as described previously using125I-HA (12McGary C.T. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cultured LECs were washed and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 125I-HA (2 μg/ml) in minimal essential medium containing 5 μg/ml affinity-purified antibody, isolated from ascites fluid using Protein G-Sepharose or immobilized mannan-binding protein (Pierce) in the case of mAb-159. The plates were then chilled on ice, the media were aspirated, the wells were washed three times, and the cells were solubilized in 0.3 n NaOH. Radioactivity and protein content were determined for each of the samples. Specific uptake, the fraction of endocytosed ligand that is competed with excess unlabeled HA, is at least 90% in this assay. The starting antigen for mAb production was a highly purified fraction of the 175HARE. The preparation of membrane extracts and RCA-1 lectin chromatography to partially purify the 175HARE and 300HARE activities has been described recently (21Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After testing a battery of nine lectin resins for their ability to bind HARE, RCA-I lectin was chosen because HARE binding was quantitative and easily displaced with lactose, and a significant purification from other membrane proteins was obtained. A further advantage of lectin chromatography as a purification step is the ability to elute the LEC HARE in a relatively small volume. The eluted HARE was then subjected to nonreducing continuous elution SDS-PAGE using a Bio-Rad model 491 Prep Cell at 22 °C and a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to separate individual proteins (Fig. 1). The running and elution buffers were 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, pH 6.8. The fractions were screened using the125I-HA ligand blot assay, and the nitrocellulose membrane was stained with copper phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt after the ligand blot assay to compare protein content and concentration in various fractions. The eluted 175-kDa fractions were pooled, concentrated, and used to immunize 4 mice. Two mice were each immunized with 20 μg of purified nonreduced protein and two each with 20 μg of purified protein that was first reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol and then alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide. The mice were boosted twice at 2-week intervals, and blood was drawn from tail veins 6 weeks after the first immunization. The sera were tested for specific antibody by ELISA. Standard procedures (25) were followed for cell fusion and limited dilution cloning. Briefly, 108 immunized mouse spleen cells were mixed with 2 × 107 SP 2/0-Ag 14 myeloma cells and fused in the presence of 50% polyethylene glycol (M r = 1500). The hybrid cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates in HAT selection medium. The hybridoma supernatants were screened using an ELISA assay with the 175-kDa antigen. Consistently positive hybridoma clones were used to produce ascites fluid as described by Harlow and Lane (25). Antibody isotypes (idiotypes) were determined using the ISO Strip kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The 96-well ELISA plates were coated using a 100 μl of 10 μg/ml purified 175-kDa protein at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Pre-immune or immune serum or hybridoma supernatant (100 μl) was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed six times with 0.05% Tween 20-TBS, and the secondary reagent, a mixture of goat anti-mouse IgG, IgM, and IgA alkaline phosphatase conjugates (100 μl, ∼2 μg/ml each) was added. The plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed five times for 5 min each with 0.05% Tween 20-TBS and 100 μl of freshly preparedp-nitrophenylphosphate substrate solution (as prepared using the phosphatase substrate system kit from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added to each well. After incubation for 30–60 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of 5% EDTA solution was added to the wells to stop the reaction. The plate was then read at 405 nm using a Spectra Max 340 (Molecular Devices). For analysis of rat tissues, pieces of liver, spleen, brain, heart, kidney, muscle, lung, intestine, and lymph node were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature. Tissue sections (5 μm) were prepared by the Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Sections were then dewaxed five times for 5 min each with xylene, followed by five washes for 5 min each with alcohol at room temperature. The tissue was treated with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature, washed with TBS, and then blocked with 10% goat serum in TBS at 4 °C overnight. A 1:250 dilution of individual ascites fluid or mixtures of ascites (100 μl) was added, and the tissue slide was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The slide was washed five times for 5 min each with TBS at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine red conjugate (10 μg/ml) was then added and the incubation continued for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue slide was washed five times for 5 min each with TBS and a solution of SlowFade from Molecular Probes was added. A coverslip was overlaid, the edge sealed with fingernail polish, and the slides were viewed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Diaphot 300 or by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS NT. For analysis of cultured LECs, the cells were cultured overnight on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 23 °C, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was minimized by incubating the cells for 1–2 h in TBS containing 10% goat serum and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed, incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with 5 μg/ml ascites from the indicated mAbs or normal mouse serum, washed, stained, and processed as above with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine red. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) without reducing agent). Cell or membrane samples were sonicated on ice for 10–20 s. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was electrotransferred to a 0.1-μm nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 24 V at 4 °C using 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. The nitrocellulose was treated with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2 h and then incubated with 2 μg/ml 125I-HA in TBS without or with a 150-fold excess of HA (as competitor) to assess total or nonspecific binding, respectively. The membrane was washed five times (5 min each) with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS and dried, and the125I-HA bound to protein was detected by autoradiography with Kodak BioMax film. Nonspecific binding in this assay is typically <5% (20Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 218: 314-319Google Scholar). Purified HARE (1.17 μg) was heated with 0.5% SDS at 90 °C for 3 min. Samples (22 μl) were chilled on ice for 4 min, and then 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. One-half unit of N-glycopeptidase F (28Tarentino A.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and distilled water were added to give a final volume of 25 μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight, 9 μl of 4-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer was added, and they were heated for 3 min at 90 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Receptor protein content was assessed after precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove detergent. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blotting procedures were performed essentially as described by Burnette (30Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar).125I radioactivity was measured using a Packard Auto-Gamma counting system. Digital images from confocal microscopy were processed in Excel. Other digital images obtained by scanning 35-mm film, blots, or autoradiograms with a Hewlett Packard Photosmart S20 or Scanjet 4C were processed using OmniPage Pro (Caere) followed by importing .jpg files into Corel Paint and then Corel Draw, version 8.0. We previously found that two very active and specific HA-binding proteins can be detected in LECs by ligand blotting using125I-HA (20Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 175HARE and 300HARE are readily detected after renaturation with Tween 20. These two HARE species show the same specificity, with a panel of polyanionic competitors, as observed for intact LECs (11Raja R.H. McGary C.T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16661-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HA binding activity at 175 and 300 kDa in the ligand blot corresponds perfectly to the previous identification of the HARE on intact LECs by the use of an HA photoaffinity derivative. This HA probe specifically photo-labeled proteins of 175 and 300 kDa (19Yannariello-Brown J. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One utility of the ligand blot assay is that one can use any detergent to solubilize the membranes, since the HARE activity can be renatured after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer. Because we previously identified an HA-binding protein of 85 kDa in hepatocytes (31Frost S.J. Raja R.H. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10425-10432Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and because histones avidly bind HA as well (27Yannariello-Brown J. Zhou B. Ritchie D. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 218: 314-319Google Scholar), our purification scheme for the 175HARE began with LECs prepared by collagenase perfusion of rat liver, rather than with whole liver. The final partial purification step for preparing the 175HARE antigen for mAb production was preparative one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, which separated the 175HARE and 300HARE and gave fractions of discrete masses that still retained HA binding activity (Fig. 1). The eluted 175-kDa fractions were pooled, concentrated, and used to immunize mice as the nonreduced protein or after being reduced and alkylated. We isolated multiple clones of 11 different hybridomas that were consistently positive in ELISA screens with the nonreduced or reduced 175-kDa antigen. mAbs were prepared from ascites fluid produced by the hybridomas and tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate the active 175HARE (Fig. 2) and for their reactivity with a 175-kDa species in Western blots (Figs.3 and 4). The former ability shows that a mAb recognizes the correct protein, thebone fide 175HARE. Three of the original 11 mAbs isolated (numbers 117, 141, and 497) were not against the 175HARE, since they have a different Western pattern (Fig. 3, lanes 9–11) and do not immunoprecipitate HARE (Fig. 2,lanes 2, 7, and 11). This result was expected, since the starting antigen was not pure. These negative clones were useful as negative controls. Except for mAb-159 (IgM) and mAb-30 (IgG2b), all of the HARE-specific mAbs are IgG1.Figure 3Reactivity of a panel of 175HARE-mAbs in Western analysis after nonreducing SDS-PAGE of LEC extracts.Ascites from 11 hybidoma clones, which were positive in ELISA screens with the 175HARE antigen, were screened (at a 1:1,000 dilution) for reactivity with lysates of rat LECs. Seven of these clones showed strong reactivity with proteins at both 175 and 300 kDa (lanes 1, 2, and 4–8). Clone 54 only recognizes the reduced protein (Fig. 4). Three clones gave very different patterns (lanes 9–11) and do not recognize the 175HARE antigen. R and N show mouse antisera raised against reduced (R) or nonreduced (N) 175HARE antigen. The solid andopen arrows indicate the positions of the 300HARE and 175HARE, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Reactivity of a panel of anti-175HARE mAbs in Western analysis after reducing SDS-PAGE of LEC extracts. Only mAbs 54 (lane 3) and 159 (lane 5) show strong reactivity, which is identical with the reduced 175HARE and 300HARE proteins. The solid andopen arrows indicate the positions of the nonreduced 300HARE and 175HARE, respectively. mAb-174, which also blocks HA binding (Fig. 6), shows weaker reactivity with the reduced 175HARE and the 260-kDa subunit of the 300HARE (lane 6). The other mAbs, including those positive for the nonreduced proteins, are not reactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Eight mAbs were obtained that recognize both the rat LEC 175HARE and 300HARE in Western blots after either nonreducing (Fig. 3) or reducing (Fig. 4) SDS-PAGE. Three mAbs, (numbers 54, 159, and 174) recognize both reduced HAREs in Western blots. Most of the mAbs raised against the nonreduced 175HARE no longer react with either HARE species after reduction (Figs. 3 and 4). The exceptions are mAb-159 and mAb-174, which recognize both the 175HARE and 300HARE proteins in Western blots, whether they are reduced (Fig. 4) or nonreduced (Fig. 3). mAb-54 recognizes only the reduced HAREs (Figs. 3 and 4, lanes 3). Four of the mAbs also immunoprecipitate both proteins from LEC extracts (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, all mAbs that bind to the 175HARE species, the original antigen, also recognize the 300HARE species. However, as described below, the 300-kDa species is not a dimer of the 175-kDa protein and does not contain a 175-kDa subunit. The fact that eight of eight mAbs raised against the 175HARE cross-react with the 300HARE suggests that the two proteins share one or more common epitopes. Ongoing studies support this preliminary conclusion. 2B. Zhou, C. T. McGary, J. A. Weigel, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. Initial studies also suggest that the 175HARE may be derived from the 300HARE by proteolytic processing. Using lectin and mAb-30 affinity chromatography, the two LEC HAREs have recently been purified to homogeneity and partially characterized (21Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that these two proteins comprise >99% of the final purified HARE. In addition, the 175HARE and 300HARE that are affinity-purified by mAb-30 are recognized by the other seven mAbs. The liver 175HARE and 300HARE are purified in an apparent mole ratio of 2:1. To determine if either protein contains disulfide-bonded subunits that are recognized by the mAbs, the 175HARE and 300HARE were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with or without reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5). The reduced 175HARE yields no other protein species (21Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the apparent size of the protein increases to ∼185 kDa (Fig. 5 A,lane 3). After reduction, the 300HARE gives rise to three protein species with masses of 97, 230, and 260 kDa (Fig.5 A, lane 4). Based on Coomassie and silver staining, and apparent size, the molar ratio of the three protein components of the 300HARE is 1:1:1. The reduced 175HARE protein (at ∼185 kDa) and the two large subunits of the 300HARE complex at 260 and 230 kDa are all recognized by the three mAbs that bind the reduced proteins (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and4). Interestingly, the ∼97-kDa subunit of the 300HARE is the only HARE protein not recognized by any of the mAbs raised against the reduced or nonreduced 175HARE. During digestion with endo-F, the 175HARE is converted to a single ∼150-kDa species, suggesting that up to 10 typical N-linked oligosaccharides may be present. The 300HARE was also reduced in apparent size after enzyme treatment. De-N-glycosylated 175HARE and 300HARE are still able to react with the individual mAbs (data not shown) or a mixture of all the mAbs (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 4). Both de-N-glycosylated HAREs are also still capable of specific125I-HA binding (21Zhou B. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33831-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, N-linked oligosaccharides do not appear necessary for HA binding and do not comprise a part of the epitopes recognized by the mAbs developed here. Endocytosis and accumulation of 125I-HA at 37 °C by cultured LECs was completely inhibited by mAb-174 (Fig.6). Only one other mAb (235) had any appreciable affect on HA endocytosis, consistently causing partial (∼50%) inhibition of 125I-HA endocytosis. None of the other anti-175HARE mAbs or the three negative control mAbs affected HA uptake. These results confirm unequivocally that our eight anti-175HARE mAbs are specific for the bone fide HARE present in LECs. Interestingly, mAb-174 also blocked HA binding to both the 175HARE and 300HARE in the ligand blot assay (Fig.7 A). At 5 μg/ml, mAb-174 blocked 70% and 50% of the specific 125I-HA binding to the 175HARE and 300HARE bands, respectively (Fig. 7 B). The same concentration of mouse IgG or the other mAbs (data not shown) showed no inhibition. Since mAb-174 completely blocks HA uptake by LECs and also recognizes both proteins in Western blots, then both the 175- and 300-kDa proteins could be independent HAREs capable of mediating HA binding and endocytosis. It is important to note that, although mAb-174 inhibits 125I-HA binding and endocytosis by LECs at 37 °C,"

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a novel fibroblast mitogen and also promotes extracellular matrix protein production. It is selectively induced by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and is thought to be the autocrine agent responsible for mediating its pro-fibrotic effects. CTGF is up-regulated during tissue repair and in fibrotic conditions associated with activation of the coagulation cascade. We therefore hypothesized that coagulation proteases promote the production of CTGF by cells at sites of tissue injury. To begin to address this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of coagulation proteases on fibroblast CTGF expression in vitro, and we show that thrombin, at physiological concentrations, up-regulated CTGF mRNA levels 5-fold relative to base line (p < 0.01) in fetal fibroblasts and 7-fold in primary adult fibroblasts (p < 0.01). These effects were cycloheximide-insensitive and were not blocked with a pan-specific TGF-β-neutralizing antibody. They were further paralleled by a concomitant increase in CTGF protein production and could be mimicked with selective PAR-1 agonists. In addition, fibroblasts derived from PAR-1 knockout mice were unresponsive to thrombin but responded normally to TGF-β1. Finally, factor Xa, which is responsible for activating prothrombin during blood coagulation, exerted similar stimulatory effects. We propose that coagulation proteases and PAR-1 may play a role in promoting connective tissue formation during normal tissue repair and the development of fibrosis by up-regulating fibroblast CTGF expression.

In addition to these procoagulant effects, thrombin also influences a number of cellular responses that play important roles in subsequent inflammatory and tissue repair processes. Thrombin influences the recruitment and trafficking of inflammatory cells and is a potent mitogen for a number of cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Dery O.

Most of the cellular effects elicited by thrombin are mediated via a family of widely expressed G-protein-coupled receptors, termed protease-activated receptors (PARs)1 that are activated by limited proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal extracellular domain. The newly generated N terminus acts as a tethered ligand and interacts intramolecularly with the body of the receptor to initiate subsequent cell signaling events (11Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). To date, four PARs have been described, of which three (PAR-1, -3, and -4) are activated by thrombin. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand of PAR-1 and PAR-4 act as agonists for these receptors and have been useful tools for invoking the involvement of these receptors in mediating the cellular effects of thrombin. Studies with these agonists, as well as with PAR-1-deficient mice, have led to the conclusion that PAR-1 is the major receptor responsible for mediating most of the pro-inflammatory (10Cunningham M.A. Rondeau E.

Once thrombin has interacted with its receptor, it exerts its cellular effects either directly or via the induction and release of secondary mediators, including classical growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and vasoactive peptides and amines (reviewed in Ref. 1Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a novel potent cysteine-rich heparin-binding growth factor, originally isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (15Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), that is also highly expressed by fibroblasts (16Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It belongs to an emerging family of conserved and modular proteins (known as the CCN family) with diverse biological functions involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Six members have been described to date and include the gene products of the serum-induced immediate-early genes Cyr 61 (a homolog of CTGF), Fisp12 (the mouse ortholog of human CTGF), Cef10 (the chicken ortholog ofCyr 61), a putative avian oncogene protein Novand Elm1, a mouse gene expressed in low metastatic mouse melanoma cells (17O'Brien T.P.

Recent studies have provided evidence that CTGF may play an important role in promoting connective tissue formation after tissue injury. As well as being a potent fibroblast mitogen and chemoattractant, CTGF stimulates fibroblast procollagen and fibronectin protein production and influences α5 integrin mRNA levelsin vitro (22Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). CTGF mRNA levels are strongly up-regulated in skin wound healing models in vivo (16Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and subcutaneous injection of CTGF into newborn mice results in increased connective tissue deposition (22Frazier K. Williams S.

CTGF is also thought to be involved in the development of tissue fibrosis, based on the observation that CTGF expression is increased in skin and internal organ fibrosis (23Igarashi A. Nashiro K.

There is also growing evidence that CTGF may be the downstream autocrine mediator responsible for mediating some of the cellular effects of TGF-β1, the most fibrogenic mediator characterized to date. CTGF expression by cultured fibroblasts is exclusively induced by TGF-β1, whereas other fibrotic mediators such as PDGF, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 have no effect (16Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 27Ricupero D.A. Rishikof D.C. Kuang P.P. Poliks C.F. Goldstein R.H. Am. J.

Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CTGF antisense constructs or neutralizing antibodies have been shown to block the effects of TGF-β on fibroblast proliferation and procollagen production (27Ricupero D.A. Rishikof D.C.

Invest. 1999; 79: 1655-1667PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesized that coagulation proteases promote the production of CTGF by cells at sites of tissue injury and repair. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of thrombin on fibroblast CTGF expression in vitro and show for the first time that thrombin, at physiological concentrations, increases both CTGF mRNA levels and protein production via proteolytic activation of the major thrombin receptor, PAR-1. We further show that the coagulation protease factor Xa, responsible for the activation of prothrombin during blood coagulation, exerts similar stimulatory effects. These in vitro findings support a role for coagulation proteases and PAR-1 in promoting early wound healing responses and connective tissue formation by up-regulating the production of CTGF. Our results may further be relevant to a number of fibroproliferative and fibrotic disorders where both thrombin levels and CTGF expression are increased. Human thrombin (catalog number T4393) and recombinant hirudin (catalog number H0393) and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Purified Russell's viper venom-activated human factor Xa was from Calbiochem. Recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP) was a kind gift from Dr. Mike Scully (Thrombosis Research Institute, London, UK), originally prepared by Dr. G. Vlasuk (Corvas International, San Diego, CA). Selective PAR-1 agonists, corresponding to the sequence TFLLR, were obtained from by Dr. Robert P. Mecham (University of Washington Medical School, St. Louis, MO). Activated porcine pancreatic TGF-β1 and pan-specific TGF-β neutralizing antibodies were from R & D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), tissue culture supplements, and tissue culture plates were from Life Technologies, Inc. The cDNA probe for human CTGF, encoding the entire open reading frame, was kindly provided inserted into the EcoRI andNotI sites of pBluescript by Dr. Raj Beri (AstraZeneca R & D Charnwood, Loughborough, UK). The cDNA probe for FISP12, encompassing nucleotides 1663–2930, was generated from a plasmid (pBluescript fisp12del) kindly provided by Dr. Joseph A. Lasky (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA). The pBluescript fisp12del plasmid was subcloned from a plasmid (A12/pmexNeo I) originally obtained from Dr. Rolf-Peter Ryseck (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) (18Ryseck R.P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-CTGF antibody was a previously described protein G-purified goat anti-human CTGF IgG (30Duncan M.R. Frazier K.S. Abramson S. Williams S. Klapper H. Huang X. Grotendorst G.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1774-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Gary R. Grotendorst (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Human lung fibroblasts (HFL1) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and primary human adult lung fibroblasts grown from explant cultures of normal lung tissue were kindly provided by Dr. Robin J. McAnulty in our laboratory. Mouse lung fibroblasts from PAR-1 knockout and corresponding wild type mice were a kind gift from Professor Shaun R. Coughlin (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and have been described previously (13Trejo J. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 5% (v/v) NCS (DMEM, 5% NCS), in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Cells were routinely passaged every 6–7 days and tested for mycoplasma infection. There were no noticeable effects on the parameters measured for cells used between passages 14 and 25. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 6-cm diameter dishes in DMEM, 5% NCS. Upon reaching visual confluence, cells were quiesced in serum-free DMEM for 16 h and incubated in fresh serum-free DMEM containing thrombin, factor Xa, or the highly selective PAR-1 agonist TFLLR (32Hollenberg M.D. Saifeddine M. Al Ani B. Kawabata A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For cycloheximide experiments, cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to addition to serum-free control media or thrombin. For thrombin and factor Xa proteolytic inhibition experiments, thrombin or factor Xa was incubated with either hirudin (in 2-fold molar excess) or rTAP (in 4-fold molar excess), respectively, and protease-inhibitor complex formation was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking, prior to addition to cell cultures. At the end of the incubation, the media were removed, and total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of total RNA were mixed with RNA loading buffer containing ethidium bromide (Sigma), heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and electrophoresed on a formaldehyde 1% (w/v) agarose gel. RNA loading and integrity was visualized and quantitated by fluorescent scanning of the gel (Fuji, FLA 3000) prior to transfer to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by Northern transfer and fixation by UV cross-linking. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C in a rotating hybridization oven in standard Denhardt's containing hybridization solution in the presence of the [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for either CTGF or FISP12, generated by random priming using an oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At the end of the hybridization, filters were rinsed at low stringency (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature, followed by 15 min at 65 °C), once at medium stringency (0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 25 min at 65 °C), and once at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 65 °C). Membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager storage screen (Fuji) for 2–4 h, and CTGF/FISP12 mRNA levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Fuji FLA 3000). Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml in 2.4-cm diameter dishes in DMEM, 5% NCS. Upon reaching visual confluence, cells were quiesced in serum-free DMEM for 16 h and incubated with fresh serum-free incubation media with and without thrombin (25 nm) or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). After 6 h, the medium was removed, and the monolayer was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed by adding 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer directly to the monolayer followed by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cell lysate was mixed several times to shear DNA, and 25 μl of each were heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 7% stacking gel for 3 h at 125 V. Separated proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 25 V. The membrane was blocked with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk for 1 h, and the anti-CTGF antibody was added at a 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was added at a 1:2000 dilution for 1 h followed by three washes in TBST for 15 min. The CTGF band was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were also stripped and reprobed with a rabbit anti-human actin antibody (Sigma) at a 1:2000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature, followed by the same secondary antibody used above. Active TGF-β in conditioned media from HFL1 cells exposed to control media, thrombin (25 nm), or TGF-β1 (0.25–1 ng/ml) in identical serum-free conditions for 90 min, as described above, was assessed using a highly quantitative bioassay, based on the ability of TGF-β to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene expression in mink lung epithelial cells (MLEC) stably transfected with an expression construct containing a truncated TGF-β-responsive PAI-1 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene. These cells were a kind gift from Dr. D. B. Rifkin (New York University Medical Center, New York), and the assay was performed as described previously (33Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 75% confluence and incubated with fibroblast conditioned media, naive media, or conditioned media spiked with thrombin and TGF-β1 for 16 h. At the end of the incubation, the media were removed, and the cell layer was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase activity in cell lysates (passive buffer) was assayed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a luminometer (Turner Designs- 20/20). The data are expressed in relative light units per well. All numerical data are presented as means ± S.E. from four replicate cultures, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical evaluation was performed using an unpaired Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance using the Neuman-Keuls procedure for multiple group comparisons. The mean values of various parameters were said to be significantly different when the probability of the differences of that magnitude, assuming the null hypothesis to be correct, fell below 5% (i.e. p < 0.05). To determine the potential effect of thrombin on fibroblast CTGF expression, human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL1) and primary human adult lung fibroblasts were exposed to a single concentration of thrombin (25 nm), and CTGF mRNA levels were assessed by Northern analysis of total cellular RNA at 1.5 h. In both cell lines, thrombin caused a dramatic increase in CTGF mRNA levels, with values increased 5-fold relative to base line for fetal lung fibroblasts and 7-fold for primary adult lung fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A). For comparison, at the same time point, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) only induced a small non-significant increase in CTGF mRNA levels in both cell types examined. We next performed detailed thrombin concentration-response experiments in human fetal lung fibroblasts at a range of physiological concentrations, from 10 pm to 500 nm. Fig.1 B shows the results obtained up to 10 nmthrombin after 1.5 h of exposure. Thrombin increased CTGF mRNA levels at concentrations as low as 10 pm with values increased 2.6- fold relative to base line. At 1 nm, the response was maximal with CTGF mRNA levels increased 4-fold. There was no further up-regulation with increasing concentrations of thrombin up to 500 nm, the highest concentration tested. The effect of thrombin on CTGF protein levels was assessed by Western blotting of cell layer extracts after 6 h of exposure to control media, thrombin (25 nm), or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) (Fig. 1 C). The anti-CTGF antibody recognized a faint immunoreactive 38-kDa protein in unstimulated fetal and adult fibroblasts as has been previously reported (22Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The intensity of this band was dramatically increased in cells exposed to thrombin or TGF-β1 for both fetal and adult fibroblasts, with the greatest intensity observed for thrombin-stimulated cells. In order to determine the time course by which thrombin stimulates CTGF mRNA levels, detailed time course experiments were performed with fetal fibroblasts exposed to a single dose of thrombin (25 nm) or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) up to 48 h. Combined data for four separate time course experiments are shown in Fig.2 A. Thrombin stimulated CTGF mRNA levels 2-fold relative to media control levels at the earliest time point examined (0.5 h). CTGF mRNA levels were maximally increased by at least 3-fold at 3 and 6 h and then gradually returned to base-line values by 30 h. For comparison, the stimulatory effects obtained with TGF-β1 were not apparent until after 1.5 h. At 3 and 6 h, CTGF mRNA levels were maximally increased and gradually returned to base-line values by 48 h.Figure 2The stimulatory effects of thrombin on CTGF mRNA levels are rapid and occur independently of de novoprotein synthesis and the secretion of active TGF-β. A, time course for the stimulatory effects of thrombin on CTGF mRNA levels. Confluent cultures of HFL1 fibroblasts were quiesced in serum-free conditions and exposed to serum-free control media (DMEM), thrombin (25 nm), or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for incubation times from 0.5 to 48 h. CTGF mRNA levels at each time point were assessed by Northern analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 1. The figure shows combined data as means and S.E. for four separate time course experiments performed.B, thrombin stimulates CTGF mRNA levels in a cycloheximide-independent manner. Confluent cultures of HFL-1 fibroblasts were quiesced in serum-free conditions and pre-exposed to cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to addition of thrombin (10 nm) or control media. CTGF mRNA levels at 1.5 h were assessed by Northern analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 1. The figure shows the 2.4-kb CTGF transcripts and the corresponding ethidium bromide-stained 28 S rRNA bands for a representative experiment (n = 3).C = media control; Thr = thrombin.C, thrombin stimulates CTGF mRNA levels in the presence of TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies. Confluent cultures of HFL-1 fibroblasts were quiesced in serum-free conditions and exposed to serum-free control media (DMEM) or thrombin (25 nm) with and without TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies or isotype-matched control IgG (80 μg/ml). CTGF mRNA levels at 1.5 h were assessed by Northern analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 1. The figure shows the 2.4-kb CTGF transcripts and the corresponding ethidium bromide-stained 28 S rRNA bands for a representative experiment (n = 3). Ab = TGF-β-neutralizing antibody; IgG = control antibody.D, thrombin does not induce the secretion or release of active TGF-β. MLEC were exposed to serum-free control media, control media supplemented with either thrombin (25 nm) or TGF-β1 (0.25 ng/ml), or conditioned media from HFL1 fibroblasts exposed to control media, thrombin (25 nm), or TGF-β1 (0.25 ng/ml) for 1.5 h. The last two bars represent MLEC exposed to conditioned media subsequently “spiked” with thrombin (25 nm) or TGF-β1(0.25 ng/ml). MLEC were lysed after 16 h, and luciferase activity was measured as an index of PAI-1 promoter activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The bar graph represents the data as means and S.E. for four replicate cultures, expressed in arbitrary relative light units.

Fig. 2 Bshows a representative experiment where thrombin increased CTGF mRNA levels about 4-fold relative to media control levels.

https://openalex.org/W11426206,"Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 represents the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) and is also found in other myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Previous studies have identified a common deleted region (CDR) spanning approximately 8 Mb. We have now used G-banding, FISH or microsatellite PCR to analyse 113 patients with a 20q deletion associated with a myeloid malignancy. Our results define a new MPD CDR of 2.7 Mb, an MDS/AML CDR of 2.6 Mb and a combined 'myeloid' CDR of 1.7 Mb. We have also constructed the most detailed physical map of this region to date--a bacterial clone map spanning 5 Mb of the chromosome which contains 456 bacterial clones and 202 DNA markers. Fifty-one expressed sequences were localized within this contig of which 37 lie within the MPD CDR and 20 within the MDS/AML CDR. Of the 16 expressed sequences (six genes and 10 unique ESTs) within the 'myeloid' CDR, five were expressed in both normal bone marrow and purified CD34 positive cells. These data identify a set of genes which are both positional and expression candidates for the target gene(s) on 20q."
https://openalex.org/W2037760821,"Lineage choice is of great interest in developmental biology. In the immune system, the alphabeta and gammadelta lineages of T lymphocytes diverge during the course of the beta-, gamma- and delta-chain rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes that takes place within the same precursor cell and which results in the formation of the gammadeltaTCR or pre-TCR proteins. The pre-TCR consists of the TCRbeta chain covalently linked to the pre-TCRalpha protein, which is present in immature but not in mature T cells which instead express the TCRalpha chain. Animals deficient in pre-TCRalpha have few alphabeta lineage cells but an increased number of gammadelta T cells. These gammadelta T cells exhibit more extensive TCRbeta rearrangement than gammadelta T cells from wild-type mice. These observations are consistent with the idea that different signals emanating from the gammadeltaTCR and pre-TCR instruct lineage commitment. Here we show, by using confocal microscopy and biochemistry to analyse the initiation of signalling, that the pre-TCR but not the gammadeltaTCR colocalizes with the p56lck Src kinase into glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (rafts) apparently without any need for ligation. This results in the phosphorylation of CD3epsilon and Zap-70 signal transducing molecules. The results indicate clear differences between pre-TCR and gammadeltaTCR signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2093469183,"35S-Labeled calmodulin (CaM) was used to screen a tobacco anther cDNA library. A positive clone (NtER1) with high homology to an early ethylene-up-regulated gene (ER66) in tomato, and anArabidopsis homolog was isolated and characterized. Based on the helical wheel projection, a 25-mer peptide corresponding to the predicted CaM-binding region of NtER1 (amino acids 796–820) was synthesized. The gel-mobility shift assay showed that the peptide formed a stable complex with CaM only in the presence of Ca2+. CaM binds to NtER1 with high affinity (Kd ∼ 12 nm) in a calcium-dependent manner. Tobacco flowers at different stages of development were treated with ethylene or with 1-methylcyclopropene for 2 h before treating with ethylene. Northern analysis showed that the NtER1 was rapidly induced after 15 min of exposure to ethylene. However, the 2-h 1-methylcyclopropene treatment totally blocked NtER1expression in flowers at all stages of development, suggesting thatNtER1 is an early ethylene-up-regulated gene. The senescing leaves and petals had significantly increased NtER1induction as compared with young leaves and petals, implying thatNtER1 is developmentally regulated and acts as a trigger for senescence and death.

This is the first documented evidence for the involvement of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling in ethylene action. calmodulin 1-methylcyclopropene base pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In plants, like in animals, Ca2+ is known to act as a mediator of stimulus-response coupling in the regulation of diverse cellular functions which are triggered by a variety of hormonal and environmental stimuli (1Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Trewavas A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 428-433Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N.

Calmodulin (CaM),1 a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein in eukaryotes is the primary intracellular Ca2+ receptor, which transduces the second messenger Ca2+ signal by binding to and altering the activity of the CaM-binding proteins, thereby generating the physiological responses to stimuli (3Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1987; 6: 47-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev.

In recent years, an increasing number of CaM-binding proteins in plants have been reported (6Snedden W.A. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 299-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Zielinski R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

There has been considerable interest in identifying and characterizing these proteins in order to understand the role of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal transduction in response to various environmental and hormonal stimuli. The gaseous hormone ethylene has profound effects on plant growth and development. There are numerous responses to ethylene throughout plant development, including induction of ripening in climacteric fruits, senescence, programmed cell death, abscission of various organs, promotion of seed germination, promotion, or inhibition of flowering (8Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Salveit M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1992Google Scholar). The ethylene biosynthetic pathway and aspects of its regulation have been determined (9Yang S.F. Hoffman N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar, 10Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Environmental stresses such as wounding, pathogen attack, and flooding can induce ethylene production; the stress-induced ethylene in turn can lead to certain defense responses such as accelerated senescence, abscission of infected organs, or induction of specific defense proteins (8Abeles F.B. Morgan P.W. Salveit M.E. Ethylene in Plant Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1992Google Scholar). The physiological responses to ethylene are complex, and not much is known about the mechanism of ethylene action (10Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). However, progress is being made in the understanding of the ethylene signal perception and transduction mainly on the basis of the isolation of ethylene-responsive mutants (11Chang C. Shockey J.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Ecker J.R. Science. 1995; 268: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13Bleecker A.B. Schaller G.E. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Kieber J.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The identification of early ethylene-regulated genes is another strategy in gaining further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ethylene action (15Deikman J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 561-566Crossref Google Scholar, 16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a close relationship between cell calcium status and ethylene. For example, calcium can influence ethylene biosynthesis by affecting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase transcription (17Kwak S.H. Lee S.H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and activity (18Gallardo M. Gomez-Jimenez M.C. Matilla A. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Raz and Fluhr (19Raz V. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that calcium is essential for the ethylene-dependent pathway of pathogenesis-related protein induction, and direct elevation of cytosolic calcium induced chitinase accumulation. Calcium is also required for ethylene-promoted morphogenic responses in seedlings (19Raz V. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM in ethylene action is not clear. Using the 35S-labeled CaM-binding approach, we isolated and characterized a tobacco gene,NtER1, which has high homology with tomato ethylene-up-regulated gene ER66 (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results described here demonstrate that NtER1 is an early ethylene-responsive gene, and CaM binds to NtER1 protein only in the presence of calcium. Furthermore, our results also indicate that Ca2+/CaM is involved in the mechanism of ethylene action. 35S-Labeled recombinant CaM was prepared by using a potato CaM (PCM6) cloned into the pET-3b expression vector (20Fromm H. Chua N.H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The specificity of 35S-labeled CaM was about 0.5 × 106 cpm/μg. A tobacco anther cDNA expression library (λZAP II) prepared in our laboratory was screened using 35S-labeled PCM6 as described (21Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The positive cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. DNA sequences were analyzed using GCG versions 8.0 and 9.0 software (22Devereaux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). Nicotiana tabacumcv. Xanthi plants grown under standard greenhouse conditions were used in this investigation. For ethylene treatment, flowers at various stages of development were excised and treated in 250-ml sealed jars with 100 μl liter−1 of ethylene for 15 min to 24 h at room temperature. The control flowers were exposed to air alone. For the 1-methylcyclopropene (MCP) treatment, tobacco flowers were treated for 2 h with 100 μl liter−1 MCP prior to the ethylene treatment. After treatments, the flowers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue essentially as described (23Longemann J. Shell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). RNA samples (50 μg) were denatured and separated on 1.5% formaldehyde/agarose gels. Following transfer to Hybond N+ filters, the blots were hybridized using the 32P-labeled NtER1 cDNA fragment and washed as described earlier (24Yang T. Lev-Yadun S. Feldman M. Fromm H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped and reprobed with a fragment of Arabidopsis 18 S rDNA (accession no. X16077, nucleotides 158–1669). The blots were exposed on the Kodak x-ray films from 1 to 4 days depending on the intensity of the signals. The template coding for C-terminal 643 amino acids of NtER1 was produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification from the original cDNA withNtER1 specific oligonucleotides containing appropriate restriction sites (NdeI at the 5′ end, and BamHI at the 3′ end) for cloning into the downstream of His6 tag into the pET-14b expression vector (Novagen, Inc.). The NtER1 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS according to the method of Studier et al. (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment derived by polymerase chain reaction amplification was determined after cloning into the pET-14b vector, using oligonucleotides designed for sequencing from both sides of the pET-14b cloning sites as primers. The NtER1 protein was extracted, and purified essentially as described (21Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was estimated by the Bradford's method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and incubated with35S-labeled recombinant CaM with 1 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA as described (21Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA and exposed to the x-ray film overnight. The synthetic peptides were prepared using Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology, Washington State University. Samples containing 240 pmol (4 μg) of bovine CaM (Sigma) and different amounts of purified synthetic peptides in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA in a total volume of 30 μl were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described (27Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant NtER1 (4 pmol) was spotted on an Immobilion membrane (Millipore) and incubated with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, and 500 nm35S-labeled CaM with 1 mm CaCl2overnight. After washing in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, radioactivities of bound CaM on each filter and free CaM in the incubation buffer collected before washing were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. In order to eliminate the nonspecific CaM binding, the BSA was used as a negative control. The average background count was subtracted from the counts of NtER1 protein samples when calculating the specific binding. The dissociation constantKd was calculated based on Scatchard plot. Tobacco genomic DNA was extracted as described (28Yang T. Segal G. Abbo S. Feldman M. Fromm H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ten μg of DNA was digested with BamHI,BglII, and SacI; separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose Tris acetate gel; and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 0.4m NaOH. Southern blot analysis was carried out as described earlier (28Yang T. Segal G. Abbo S. Feldman M. Fromm H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using an NtER1 cDNA as a probe. The CaM-binding screening approach was used to isolate the CaM-binding proteins from a tobacco anther cDNA expression library. Eight positive clones were obtained from 2 × 105 recombinant phages. One of these clones had high affinity to CaM. The nucleotide sequence of the 2135-bp cDNA clone contained a partial coding region (672 amino acids) and 116 bp of 3′-untranslated region. The clone was named as NtER1 because the deduced polypeptide of this partial cDNA had high homology with tomato ER66, an ethylene-up-regulated gene (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to get the full clone, the same cDNA library was screened with the partial NtER1 cDNA as a probe. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of NtER1 are shown in Fig. 1. The cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 926 amino acids flanked by a 17-bp untranslated region at the 5′ end and 153-bp untranslated region with poly(A)+tail at the 3′ end. The calculated molecular mass and the isoelectric point of the NtER1 polypeptide were 104 kDa and 8.69, respectively. The polypeptide was a serine-rich protein with 101 Ser in 926 amino acid residues. Comparisons to known sequences in GenBank™ showed that NtER1 had high homology with tomato ER66, LeER66, and an Arabidopsishomolog, AtER-like (accession number AC007168), particularly at the C-terminal portions. The C-terminal 643 amino acids of NtER1 are aligned in Fig. 2 with LeER66 and AtER-like. In this portion, the NtER1 protein is 91.5% similar and 89.2% identical with tomato ER66, 69.2% similar and 62% identical with an Arabidopsis homolog. NtER1 also displays some homology with the FIN21.9 clone (accession number AC002130; 47.1% similarity and 37.9% identity) and a transcription factor-like protein (accession number Z97340; 40.5% similarity and 31.9% identity) ofArabidopsis (data not shown). The partial NtER1 (C-terminal 643 amino acid) was expressed in E. coli, using the pET-14b expression vector. The recombinant protein was present mainly in the soluble fraction. The 73.7-kDa fusion protein (71.5-kDa NtER1 plus 2.2-kDa N-terminal His6 tag) was purified by CaM affinity chromatography to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Using CaM-binding assay, it was shown that35S-labeled CaM binds to NtER1 protein only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 A). After adding 2 mm EGTA, no CaM binding was observed, suggesting that CaM binding to NtER1 is calcium-dependent. In the control experiment, the proteins from E. coli transformed with only the pET-14b vector did not show any CaM binding (data not shown). Most characterized CaM-binding proteins have a secondary structural feature, basic amphiphilic α-helix, even though the amino acid residues in the CaM-binding region of these proteins are not conserved (27Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 30Clore G.M. Bax A. Ikura M. Gronenborn A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 838-845Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A helical wheel projection of the peptide sequences predicted that the amino acids 796–820 in the C-terminal domain of NtER1 have a CaM-binding domain feature. The amino acid residues 805–818 formed an α-helix with a hydrophobic face (including two leucines, one isoleucine, and one valine) and a basic hydrophilic face (including four arginines and one lysine). Particularly, a hydrophobic residue, often Trp (here amino acid 809), embedded in a context of basic residues Lys or Arg (here amino acids 810 and 811), is a common feature in known CaM targets (27Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Clore G.M. Bax A. Ikura M. Gronenborn A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 838-845Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A peptide with 25 residues corresponding to the putative CaM-binding region (amino acids 796–820) was incubated with bovine CaM, and the complex formation was assessed by nondenaturing PAGE in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The 25-mer peptide is capable of forming a stable complex with CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B), but not in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Without adding the peptide, a single CaM band was observed. As the peptide was added, another band of low mobility appeared, representing the peptide-CaM complex. When the ratio of peptide to CaM was equal, the CaM band disappeared, and the intensity of the peptide-CaM complex increased. At a peptide to CaM molar ratio of 1.5, no free CaM was detected. These observations indicate that the peptide binds to Ca2+/CaM with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Interestingly, the amino acids at CaM-binding region (amino acids 796–820) of NtER1 has a very high homology with the counterparts of ER66 and AtER-like (Fig. 2). The amino acids 431–455 of LeER66 are exactly the same as NtER1 amino acids 796–820. The AtER-like amino acids 909–933 have just two conservative amino acid substitutions. Both putative CaM-binding regions in LeER66 and AtER-like can form a basic amphiphilic α-helix, and contain the Trp-Arg-Arg motif, suggesting that this type of proteins in general are CaM-binding proteins. To determine the binding affinity of CaM to NtER1, the 4-pmol recombinant NtER1 was blotted on a filter and incubated with the different concentrations of 35S-labeled CaM in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The labeled CaM binds to NtER1 with a saturation at ∼100 nm (Fig. 4), indicating the presence of a saturable high affinity binding site in NtER1. From the Scatchard plot analysis of the saturation curve, the dissociation constant (Kd) of CaM for NtER1 was estimated to be about 12 nm. The binding of CaM to NtER1 was completely blocked in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. The Scatchard analysis also indicated that the C-terminal portion of NtER1 has a single CaM-binding site. Tomato ER66 is an early ethylene-up-regulated gene (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to confirm thatNtER1 is regulated by ethylene, tobacco buds and fully opened flowers were treated with 100 μl liter−1 ethylene for 15 min to 24 h. The total RNA was isolated from plant tissues, and the expression ofNtER1 mRNA was analyzed using Northern hybridization. A size of ∼3.2-kilobase band was detected on the blot. Without ethylene application, NtER1 expression was detected in the fully opened flowers (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). However, very low expression ofNtER1 in the buds was detected after a longer exposure of the blot to x-ray film (data not shown). By treating with 100 μl liter−1 ethylene, the expression ofNtER1 was quickly induced. The induction began within 15 min (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). Increased induction of NtER1 was observed after 5 and 24 h of ethylene treatment (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8). Both buds and fully opened flowers showed increased expression following ethylene treatment, but the expression was higher in fully opened flowers in comparison to the buds. It is known that MCP is a potent inhibitor of ethylene action by blocking the ethylene receptor (32Sisler E.C. Serek M. Dupille E. Plant Growth Regul. 1995; 17: 1-6Google Scholar). Treatment with MCP prior to ethylene treatment blocked the induction of NtER1 (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that NtER1 is an early ethylene-up-regulated gene. The differential expression of NtER1 in the buds and fully opened flowers suggests that the NtER1 is associated with senescence, a form of programmed cell death. To investigate the possible role of NtER1 in senescence and aging, the levels ofNtER1 mRNA were studied at different stages of development in tobacco petals and leaves. These organs are commonly used for studying plant senescence and programmed cell death. Fig. 6shows that the NtER1 expression increases during senescence in both leaves and petals. In the immature and fully mature leaves,NtER1 expression was low (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and2), while NtER1 was highly induced when the leaves started to turn yellow (Fig. 6, lane 3). In petals, NtER1 was detected at low levels in buds (Fig. 6,lane 4). There was a significant increase in the expression of NtER1 in petals of fully opened flowers coinciding with pollination and fertilization (Fig. 6, lane 5). As the flowers became senescent, NtER1expression was further increased (Fig. 6, lane 6). Results shown in Fig. 6 also indicated that NtER1 expression was higher in petals as compared with leaves. Southern analysis was carried out using a genomic DNA extracted from tobacco leaves. DNA was digested with BamHI, BglII, and SacI, for which there was no restriction site in the NtER1 cDNA. The hybridization was performed with the NtER1 cDNA as a probe. Under high stringency conditions, one or two strong bands were observed after restriction with all three enzymes (Fig. 7). These results suggest thatNtER1 belongs to a small gene family. Calmodulin is known to regulate a large number of enzymes in animals. In recent years, plant scientists have begun to isolate and characterize CaM-binding proteins to understand Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling in plants (3Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1987; 6: 47-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev.

Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This information has increased the understanding of how calcium and CaM regulate the various biochemical and molecular processes that eventually lead to a physiological response. In this study, we identified a novel CaM-binding protein encoded byNtER1, which has high homology to the tomato early ethylene-up-regulated gene ER66 (Fig. 2). Further investigations confirmed that NtER1 is up-regulated by ethylene (Fig. 5 A) and MCP, which blocks ethylene action, also blocked the expression of NtER1. The expression ofNtER1 is developmentally regulated, especially during senescence and aging. In the aging tissues, such as the yellow leaves and senescing petals, NtER1 expression is highly induced (Fig. 6). In other report, the expression of tomato ER66 is higher in the fruits at red stage and less at the mature green stage (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plant growth hormone ethylene, known as “death hormone,” promotes aging, senescence, ripening, and wilting. A close relationship exists between plant senescence and ethylene biosynthesis (33Matto A.K. Aharoni N. Nooden L.D. Leopold A.C. Senescence and Aging in Plants. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 242-280Google Scholar, 34Nooden L.D. Nooden L.D. Leopold A.C. Senescence and Aging in Plants. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 2-50Google Scholar). In senescing tissues, ethylene biosynthesis increases (33Matto A.K. Aharoni N. Nooden L.D. Leopold A.C. Senescence and Aging in Plants. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 242-280Google Scholar). In bean explants, the senescence was deferred when ethylene synthesis was inhibited (35Kushad M. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Results from this investigation revealed thatNtER1 expression greatly increased as the leaf and petal started to senesce (Fig. 6). This suggests that NtER1 is regulated by ethylene and it plays an important role in the progression of senescence and death. However, it is not known whetherNtER1 is involved in other ethylene-regulated physiological processes, such as retardation of cell elongation, response to various stresses and defense responses. A large number of studies have shown that plant senescence is associated with an elevated level of intracellular Ca2+(36Poovaiah B.W. Nooden L.D. Leopold A.C. Senescence and Aging in Plants.

The application of Ca2+ increases both DNase activity and DNA laddering in both animal cells and plant cells (47Bortner C.D. Oldenberg-Nicklas B.E. Cidlowski J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 48Wang H. Li J. Bostock R.M. Gilchrist D.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 375-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from this study show that the ethylene-up-regulated and senescence-associated gene, NtER1, encodes a Ca2+/CaM-binding protein (Fig. 3), and these results will increase the understanding of the role for calcium in plant senescence and cell death. The response of NtER1 expression to ethylene is very rapid, within 15 min (Fig. 5 A). The isolation and characterization of early ethylene-regulated genes are important in gaining an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ethylene action and in defining the role of this hormone in various physiological processes in plants. Screening ethylene-treated mature green tomato fruit has led to the isolation of a set of ethylene regulated genes including the genes' homology to transcriptional co-activator MBF-1, elongation factor EF-Ts, stress-related protein catalase, and a protease inhibitor (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Licoln J.E. Cordes S. Read E. Fischer R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Planta. 1993; 157: 22-31Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 51Broglie K.E. Gaynor J.J. Broglie R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6820-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); a glutathione S-transferase, which responds to ethylene in senescing carnation petals (52Meyer R.C. Goldsbrough P.B. Woodson W.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); ER43, a putative GTP-binding protein; and ER50, a CTR-like clone (16Zegzouti H. Jones B. Frasse P. Marty C. Maitre B. Latche A. Pech J. Bouzyen M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present it is not known whether any of these proteins is regulated by Ca2+/CaM. Identification of NtER1 and other related proteins such as tomato ER66 as CaM-binding proteins are significant in our understanding of the cross-talk between Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling and ethylene action, as well as the molecular mechanisms of these signal transduction processes during senescence. It is known that ethylene and other plant hormones such as auxin, cytokinin, gibberellic acid, and abscisic acid can induce changes in free calcium levels in plant cells and calcium can act as a messenger in triggering various physiological processes. It is also known that calcium can affect ethylene biosynthesis by affecting the transcription and activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase, a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthetic pathway (17Kwak S.H. Lee S.H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Gallardo M. Gomez-Jimenez M.C. Matilla A. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Calcium also regulates the ethylene-dependent pathway of pathogenesis-related protein induction, and is required for ethylene-promoted morphogenic responses in seedlings (19Raz V. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results described here indicate that Ca2+/CaM interacts with NtER1 protein, which is involved in ethylene action leading to senescence and death. It is possible to control the onset of senescence by manipulating the expression ofNtER1 gene. Delay of senescence could have major implications in prolonging the storage life of various agricultural products, especially fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In summary, the sequence of events that leads to programmed senescence and death involves two crucial steps. The first step involves the biosynthesis of ethylene, and the second step involves the increase of cytosolic calcium and the induction of NtER1. This study suggests that Ca2+/CaM binds to NtER1 protein, and the complex then triggers a cascade of events that ultimately lead to senescence and death. Our earlier study indicated that Ca2+/CaM is involved in auxin action by binding to SAUR (small auxin up RNA) proteins (31Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Identifying the early ethylene-regulated NtER1 as a CaM-binding protein further strengthens the importance of Ca2+/CaM messenger system in plant hormone action. It is quite clear that Ca2+/CaM affect gibberellic acid- and abscisic acid-regulated seed germination (53Gilroy S. Jones R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further isolation and characterization of the Ca2+/CaM-regulated, hormone-responsive proteins should help in the understanding of hormonal control of plant growth and development.

https://openalex.org/W2137748756,"Two cDNAs encoding human lysyl-tRNA synthetase have been identified. One encodes the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme identified previously. The second cDNA contains the same sequence but with a 180-bp insertion at the 5′-end of the mRNA. This results in a predicted protein whose carboxyl 576 amino acids are identical to those of the cytoplasmic enzyme but with a different amino terminus of 49 amino acids that contains a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. Expression of the two lysyl-tRNA synthetase-green fluorescent protein gene fusions in a human cell line confirmed that the cytoplasmic form was targeted to the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial form to mitochondria. The genomic lysyl-tRNA synthetase gene consisted of 15 exons. The two isoforms were created by alternative splicing of the first three exons of the gene. The cytoplasmic form was created by splicing exon 1 to exon 3. The inclusion of exon 2 between exons 1 and 3 produced an mRNA encoding the mitochondrial isoform with an additional upstream small open reading frame, consisting mainly of a portion of the 5′ coding region of the cytoplasmic isoform. This is the first example of mitochondrial targeting sequence being encoded on the second exon of a gene. Ribonuclease protection analysis showed that the mRNA encoding the cytoplasmic isoform makes up approximately 70%, and the mitochondrial isoform approximately 30%, of the mature transcripts from the lysyl-tRNA synthetase gene. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme, purified after expression in Escherichia coli, aminoacylated in vitro transcripts corresponding to both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNALys, despite the difference in the discriminator base sequence in the acceptor stems of these tRNAs."

Interestingly, the normal processing of PrP occurs inside the 106–126 amino acid region thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity of the pathogenic prions, whereas PrPrescleavage preserves this potentially toxic domain. Therefore, any molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced cleavage at the 110/111↓112 peptide bond could be of potential interest. We set up TSM1 neurons and HEK293 stable transfectants overexpressing the wild-type or 3F4-tagged murine PrPc, respectively. Both mock-transfected and PrPc-expressing cell lines produced an 11–12-kDa PrP fragment (referred to as N1), the immunological characterization of which strongly suggests that it corresponds to the N-terminal PrPc fragment derived from normal processing. We have established that the recovery of secreted N1 is increased by the protein kinase C agonists PDBu and PMA in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In contrast, secretion of N1 remains unaffected by the inactive PDBu analog αPDD and by the protein kinase A effectors dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin.

Neural Transm. 1997; 50: 191-210Google Scholar). The infectious agent thought to be likely responsible for these lethal diseases is closely associated with a host protein particle called prion (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar), a 33–35 kDa polypeptide displaying a widespread distribution in mammals (5Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L. Wen G.Y. Kascak R.J. Cashman N.R. Bolton D.C. Neurology. 1992; 42: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the prion pathology is mainly underlined by the physical conversion of normal cellular prion (PrPc)1 into an insoluble and protease-resistant isoform (PrPres or PrPsc) (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). PrP undergoes several post-translational modifications including signal peptide removal (6Hope J. Morton L.D.J. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), C-terminal incorporation of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and sialoglycosylations (7Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5405-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PrPc undergoes truncation in the brain that likely derives from an intrachain cleavage that appears to occur between the 110/111 and 112 amino acid residues (8Chen S.G. Teplow D.B.

The physiological significance of this cleavage is still unknown. Whether it is a maturation process leading to the production of biologically active fragments or a proteolytic cleavage responsible for the final catabolic clearance of PrPc is still questionable. However, it is striking that the “normal” cleaving enzyme responsible for PrPc breakdown targets a PrPc domain that appears as the potential “toxic” core of the protein. Thus, several studies have indicated that synthetic peptides corresponding to the 106–126 sequence of PrP could trigger toxic cellular responses (10Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 11Brown D.R. J.

Along with this observation is the fact that the cleavage appears shifted through the N-terminal domain of the PrP in Creutzfeldt-Jakob brains around amino acid residue 90, thereby leaving intact the 106–126 sequence (8Chen S.G.

The identification of the 110/111↓112-cleaving enzyme and a better understanding of putative mechanisms by which such a cleavage is regulated is of great interest. We have set up two distinct cell lines from human embryonic kidney (HEK293) or mice neuronal (TSM1) origins that overexpress murine PrPc. Both cell lines are shown here to secrete a fragment that biochemically and immunologically behaves as the N-terminal product (referred to as N1 below) of normal processing. We show that this cleavage is up-regulated by effectors of the protein kinase C pathway but not by protein kinase A agonists. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence of a protein kinase C-mediated regulation of normal PrPc cleavage and thus a potential means to exacerbate the catabolic “depletion” of the potentially pathogenic 106–126 PrP domain. Monoclonal antibodies Pri-308 and Pri-917 have been raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the 106–126 and 214–230 human PrP sequence, respectively (13Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C.

Western blot analyses indicated that Pri-917 recognizes human and mouse PrP whereas Pri-308 reacts more specifically with human PrP and shows a lower binding affinity to mouse PrP (13Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.-P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 265: 652-657Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies SAF-32, SAF-70, and SAF-84 have been raised against scrapie-associated fibrils (SAFs) from infected hamster brain. They have been shown to bind linear peptides corresponding to human residues 79–92, 142–160, and 126–164 respectively. Western blot analyses revealed that SAF-32 and SAF-70 recognize PrP from most mammalian species, whereas SAF-84 does not react with human PrP (13Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C. Frobert Y.

Monoclonal antibody 8G8 is directed against human recombinant PrP (14Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol.

All monoclonal antibodies were used as dilutions of crude ascitic fluids. The 3F4 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Kascsak) was shown to be specific for methionine 109 and 112 of human PrP (corresponding to the 108 and 111 positions of the mouse PrP sequence (16Kascsak R.J.

HEK293 cells overexpressing the 3F4MoPrPc were obtained after transfection with DAC30 reagent (Eurogentec) of 2 μg of empty pcDNA3 vector (mock) or pcDNA3 containing cDNA encoding mouse PrPc bearing the human 3F4 epitope (17Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M.J. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3367-3375Crossref Google Scholar). MoPrPc was stably transfected in neuronal TSM1 cells by means of the Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Transfectants were screened by Western blot analysis with the SAF32 antibody. Cells were subsequently maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/ml) and geneticin (1 mg/ml). Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in the absence (control) or in the presence of various pharmacological agents in 1 ml of serum-depleted DMEM. Medium was collected, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA). Both medium and lysates were complemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated overnight with a 500-fold dilution of monoclonal antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After centrifugation, beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer, once with PBS, and then resuspended in loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 16.5% Tris/Tricine gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (45 min, 100 V), capped for 45 min with skim milk (5% in PBS) and incubated with various monoclonal antibodies (dilution 1:2000 in PBS, Tween (0.05%), skim milk (5%)) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected using a sheep anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:5000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunological complexes were detected with the ECL method as described previously (18Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Methanol precipitation was performed by freezing secretion medium at −20 °C for 2 h, and then proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes of methanol. Samples were spun for 20 min at 5000 × rpm and then pellets were dried, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and electrophoresed as described above. Cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (500 μl) as described above. Lysates were complemented with a protease inhibitor mixture and 25 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% Tris/Glycine gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (2 h, 100 V) and incubated with SAF32 (dilution 1:2000 in PBS, Tween (0.05%), milk (5%)) overnight at 4 °C. PrPc was detected as described above. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for one-way analysis of variance and the unpaired Student's t test for pair-wise comparisons. All results were expressed as mean ± S.E., andp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The first aim of the present study was to set up stably transfected cell lines overexpressing the wild-type (MoPrPc) or 3F4-tagged humanized (3F4MoPrPc) mouse PrPc. As is often the case when studying neurodegenerative diseases with a cell biology approach, the choice of cell line is of great importance. One of the parent cell lines chosen here was HEK293 because these cells have been widely used as a relevant cell model from human origin to study degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (for a review see Ref. 19Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). TSM1 neurons were also used because these murine cells from neocortical origin display the unique feature to correspond to stably transfected neurons (20Chun J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) whereas very often “neuron-like or neuron-derived” cell lines are used as a central nervous system cell models. TSM1 neurons have been successfully used in our laboratory in the course of studying Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease to examine the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) maturation (21Marambaud P. Chevallier N. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 715-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1186-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and more recently to establish stable transfectants overexpressing wild-type and mutant α-synucleins (23Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that analysis of geneticin-resistant clones resulting from MoPrPc (Fig.1 A) or 3F4MoPrPc cDNA transfection (Fig.1 B) reveals cell lines overexpressing PrPc-like immunoreactivity, whose molecular weight and electrophoretic pattern correspond to previously described differently glycosylated PrP isoforms (for review see Ref. 4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Among the clones displaying various levels of PrPc expression, clone 3 (TSM1 neurons) and clone 4 (HEK293) were selected for further analysis. It should be noted here that both TSM1 neurons and HEK293 cells display endogenous PrPc-like immunoreactivity (see Figs. 3 C,4 C, and 5 B), the electrophoretic patterns of which were similar to those observed in transfected cells, indicating that the overexpressed protein appears to be properly glycosylated/folded in the two cell systems.Figure 3Detection of secreted and intracellular N1 fragment in mock- and PrPc-transfected TSM1 neurons and HEK293 cells.

The same N1 fragment was recovered from the secreted fraction of mock-transfected TSM1 neurons (Fig.3 A), indicating that N1 also results from the physiological cleavage of endogenous PrP in TSM1 neurons. Interestingly, both mock and 3F4MoPrPc HEK293 cells secrete an identical 11–12-kDa SAF32-immunoprecipitable fragment (Fig. 3 A, right lanes) that was particularly abundant in the PrP-transfected HEK293 cell line (see 3F4 in Fig.3 A). It should be noted that an identical 11.5-kDa N-terminal product was previously detected in the conditioned medium of N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells overexpressing chicken PrP (24Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.-L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To determine whether N1 could be also detected in cell lysates, we have shown (Fig. 3 B) that mock and transfected cell lines all produce an intracellular N1. Further experiments are in progress to establish whether the cell lysate counterpart of N1 results from intracellular cleavage of PrP occurring during routing to the plasma membrane or whether membrane-bound PrP undergoes cleavage in early endosomes compartments soon after its documented internalization (25Shyng S.-L.

This C1 product likely resulted from normal physiological processing of PrPc as it was isolated from normal human brain and seemed to derive from an intrachain PrPc attack occurring between the residues 110/111 and 112. The immunological characterization of the N1-secreted product detected in the present study indicates that it likely corresponds to the N-terminal counterpart of C1. Thus, by means of a series of monoclonals (13Demart S. Fournier J.G. Cremignon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmézas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.-P. Biochem.

Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) interacting with various epitopes located along the PrP sequence (Fig.4 A), we have clearly shown that all monoclonals recognizing C-terminal epitopes, i.e.SAF70, SAF84, and Pri-917 do not label the N1 product (Fig.4 B) whereas they label intracellular PrPc (not shown). Interestingly, the 8G8 antibody that interacts with a sequence located at the extreme C terminus of a fragment theoretically derived from the PrP cleavage at the 110/111↓112 bond (see Fig. 4 A) still labels the N1 fragment (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, Pri-308 that recognizes a sequence encompassing the theoretical cleavage site does not label N1. Of most interest was the use of 3F4, a well characterized monoclonal antibody recognizing the two methionine residues located at positions 109 and 112 of the human PrP sequence (lacking in the mouse sequence, see ref. 16Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna de Masi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, 3F4 antibody did not recognize intracellular mouse PrPcwhereas intense labeling of 3F4-tagged MoPrPc was observed by Western blot (Fig. 4, upper right). However, the N1 fragment secreted by human cells was not immunoprecipitated by 3F4 antibody (Fig. 4 C, lower right, lanes 3 and 4) indicating that the cleavage giving rise to N1 disrupt the 3F4-recognized epitope. Altogther, the immunological characterization of N1 strongly suggests that the N1 product is derived from a proteolytic attack occurring between the 108 and 111 residues. N1 secretion by PrPc-expressing HEK293 and TSM1 cells can be drastically up-regulated by the protein kinase C effectors PDBu (Fig. 5 A) and PMA (Fig.6), but not by the PDBu-inactive analog αPDD (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the phorbol esters also potentiate the recovery of N1 in the secreted fraction of mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the protein kinase C control of N1 secretion also takes place during the course of endogenous PrPc processing. N1 recovery was also potentiated by the phosphatase okadaic acid (Fig. 6). To assess whether N1 secretion is selectively controlled by protein kinase C or more generally affected by various kinases, we examined the putative effect of protein kinase A effectors. Clearly, forskolin and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (Fig. 6) did not modify the N1 recovery from mock- or PrP-transfected TSM1 neurons (Fig. 6 A) and HEK293 cells (Fig. 6 B). As expected, the inactive forskolin analog, dideoxyforskolin did not modify N1 secretion (Fig. 6). It is important to note that PDBu treatment does not affect the expression of intracellular PrPc, whatever the cell type examined (Fig. 5). This indicates that the protein kinase C target does not correspond to phorbol esters-responsive-transcriptional elements but more likely to downstream cellular intermediate(s) along the pathways that ultimately lead to PrPc incorporation in the plasma membranes. The possibility that this kinase directly targets PrPc, thereby modulating its susceptibility to proteolysis is supported by the recent demonstration that recombinant bovine PrP was indeed substrate of protein kinase C but not of protein kinase A (26Negro A. Meggio F. Bertoli A. Battistutta R. Sorgato M.C. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 271: 337-341Google Scholar). Alternatively, protein kinase C could also affect all the cellular intermediates involved in N1 formation including proteins participating to address or route processes or proteolytic activities themselves. It is interesting to note that the β-amyloid precursor protein that appears to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease, is also physiologically maturated by a protein kinase C-controlled mechanism (for a review see Ref. 19Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This regulated physiological cleavage leading to a secreted product (sAPPα) occurs inside the sequence of the Aβ peptide, the production of which appears to be central to the pathology (27Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and disrupts its formation (28Buxbaum J.D. Koo E.H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8376-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the normal breakdown of βAPP can be seen as a means to deplete the cells from endogenous toxic Aβ species. In this context, it is interesting to note that the production of N1 also implies a cleavage inside the 106–126 PrPc sequence that is thought to be highly neurotoxic (10Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 11Brown D.R. J.

J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, mechanisms leading to N1 production can also theoretically be seen as a way to deplete cells from PrP species bearing the 106–126 toxic domain. Supporting the view that catabolism of PrPc is central to prion pathologies is the fact that in the brains affected by Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, the cleavage of PrPsc occurs around the amino acid 90, thereby leaving intact the potential of toxicity displayed by the 106–126 domain. It is therefore of great interest to demonstrate that the protein kinase C-mediated pathways could up-regulate N1 production, i.e.normal PrP metabolism. Whether protein kinase C can be seen as a potential target for therapeutic intervention aimed at stopping or slowing down the evolution of prion-related neurodegenerative disease remains to be established. We sincerely thank Dr. G. Hunsmann (Goettingen, Germany) for the generous gift of 8G8 and Dr. R. J. Kascsak (Staten Island, NY) for providing us with 3F4 monoclonal antibody."

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mouse (M) PDE3B was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as indicated by its immunofluorescent colocalization with the ER protein BiP and subcellular fractionation studies. In transfected NIH 3006 or COS-7 cells, recombinant wild-type PDE3A and PDE3B isoforms were both found almost exclusively in the ER. The N-terminal portion of PDE3 can be arbitrarily divided into region 1 (aa 1–300), which contains a large hydrophobic domain with six predicted transmembrane helices, followed by region 2 (aa 301–500) containing a smaller hydrophobic domain (of ∼50 aa). To investigate the role of regions 1 and 2 in membrane association, we examined the subcellular localization of a series of catalytically active, Flag-tagged N-terminal-truncated human (H) PDE3A and MPDE3B recombinants, as well as a series of fragments from regions 1 and 2 of MPDE3B synthesized as enhanced green fluorescent (EGFP) fusion proteins in COS-7 cells. In COS-7 cells, the localization of a mutant HPDE3A, lacking the first 189 amino acids (aa) and therefore four of the six predicted transmembrane helices (H3A-Δ189), was virtually identical to that of the wild type. M3B-Δ302 (lacking region 1) and H3A-Δ397 (lacking region 1 as well as part of region 2) retained, to different degrees, the ability to associate with membranes, albeit less efficiently than H3A-Δ189. Proteins that lacked both regions 1 and 2, H3A-Δ510 and M3B-Δ604, did not associate with membranes. Consistent with these findings, region 1 EGFP-MPDE3B fusion proteins colocalized with the ER, whereas region 2 EGFP fusion proteins were diffusely distributed. Thus, some portion of the N-terminal hydrophobic domain in region 1 plus a second domain in region 2 are important for efficient membrane association/targeting of PDE3.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), little is known of the mechanisms that target PDEs to their intracellular destinations. PDE3 isoforms are characterized by their high affinity for both cAMP and cGMP and their sensitivity to inhibition by a number of positive inotropic agents (5Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C.

The two PDE3 subfamilies, PDE3A and PDE3B, are products of distinct but related genes, with additional diversity generated within the PDE3A subfamily by transcription initiation from alternative sites (5Degerman E.

Studies using specific inhibitors suggest that PDE3 isoforms regulate cAMP and cGMP pools involved in control of lipolysis, glycogenolysis, myocardial contractility, smooth muscle relaxation, mesangial cell proliferation, and insulin and renin secretion (14Eriksson H.

To analyze some of the structural determinants involved in membrane targeting/association of PDE3, a series of Flag-tagged full-length and N-terminal deletion mutants of PDE3A and PDE3B, as well as a series of N-terminal MPDE3B-EGFP fusion proteins, were constructed and expressed in mammalian cells. The intracellular location of endogenous PDE3B in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and of the different PDE3A and PDE3B recombinants was determined by immunofluorescence techniques. All nucleotide numbers mentioned here have been assigned by virtue of their relative position downstream from the start codon (+1). An HPDE3A cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame (31Leroy M.-J. Degerman E. Taira M. Murata T. Wang W.H. Movsesian M.A. Meacci E. Manganiello V.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was used as template for HPDE3A constructs that lacked the first 189, 397, and 510 amino acids (aa) (supplied by J. Colicelli, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) and were named H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510, respectively, and cloned into pBluescript. MPDE3B cDNA was used as a template to generate cDNA fragments lacking the coding region for the first 302 (M3B-Δ302) and 604 (M3B-Δ604) aa, which were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) vectors and designated as PCRM3B-Δ302 and PCRM3B-Δ604, respectively (32Kenan Y. Murata T. Shakur Y. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12331-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All Flag-tagged constructs were generated by inserting an eight amino acid Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) immediately upstream from the stop codon of the HPDE3A or MPDE3B cDNA (see Fig. 1). The following specific primers pairs were used: for HPDE3A, sense primer (5′-CTTCATCTCTCACATTGTGGGGCCTCTGTG-3′), which corresponds to HPDE3A nt 3009–3027 and encompasses the uniqueDraIII site (underlined) in HPDE3A, and antisense primer (5′-TTTGCGGCCGCCTCGAGTTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCCTGGTCTGGCTTTTGGGTTGG-3′), which corresponds to HPDE3A nt 3423–3403 and encodes anXhoI site, a new stop codon, and the Flag epitope (underlined); for MPDE3B, sense primer (5′-TATCACCCACATTGTGGGCCCCCTG- 3′), which corresponds to MPDE3B nt 2901–2925 and contains the unique DraIII site (underlined) in MPDE3B, and antisense primer (5′-AAAGCGGCCTCGAGGTCTTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTTCAAACATTTGTTCTTCCTC-3′), which corresponds to MPDE3B nt 3300–3280 and encodes anXhoI site, a new stop codon, and the Flag epitope (underlined). Using HPDE3A cDNA (50 ng) as template and HPDE3A primer pairs (3 pmol each) or MPDE3B cDNA (50 ng) as template and MPDE3B primers pairs (3 pmol each), PCR fragments were amplified in a GeneAmp PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 9600) withPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting PCR products contain the unique PDE3 DraIII site at the 5′end and a stop codon at the 3′end; the stop codon is flanked upstream by a Flag epitope-coding sequence and downstream by an XhoI site. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and isolated from this vector as DraIII/XhoI fragments. XhoI/DraIII fragments containing sequence upstream from the unique DraIII site of HPDE3A, H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510, were isolated from pBluescript. In a three-way ligation, these 5′ XhoI/DraIII fragments were ligated, via the DraIII site, to the 3′DraIII/XhoI HPDE3A Flag epitope-containing fragments and to XhoI-cut pZero vector (Invitrogen), to give pZ-HPDE3AFlag, pZ-H3A-Δ189Flag, pZ-H3A-Δ397Flag, and pZ-H3A-Δ510Flag, respectively (Fig. 1). In an analogous fashion, in a three fragment ligation, the 5′XhoI/AlwnI fragment from pCRM3B-Δ302 was ligated to a 3′ AlwnI/XhoI MPDE3B Flag epitope-containing fragment and XhoI-cut pBluescript (SK), generating the construct pSK-M3B-Δ302Flag. In a three fragment reaction, the 5′ XhoI/DraIII fragment isolated from pCR3B-Δ604 was ligated to a MPDE3B Flag-tagged 3′DraIII/XhoI fragment and XhoI-cut pZero, to give pZ-M3B-Δ604Flag (Fig. 1). The reconstituted DraIII sites and all sequences downstream from this site were confirmed by sequencing. For expression studies, Flag-tagged HPDE3A and MPDE3B constructs were excised from the pZ vectors with KpnI/XhoI and XhoI, and then ligated to the KpnI/XhoI sites or theXhoI site of pcDNA3, respectively (Invitrogen). A series of PCR fragments encoding MPDE3B aa 1–100, 1–200, 1–250, 1–400, 201–250, 184–250, 301–450, and 401–500 were generated using pZ-MPDE3B (MPDE3B cDNA in pZero;CLONTECH) as template. Since the pZ-MPDE3B vector contains a T7 promoter next to a unique XhoI site, which is situated adjacent to the 5′ end of the MPDE3B Kozak sequence, T7 primer was used as the sense primer for generation of MPDE3B PCR fragments encoding aa 1–100, 1–200, 1–250, and 1–400. Antisense primers used for generation of the indicated PCR fragments are listed in TableI. To allow for 3′-in-frame fusion of PDE3B PCR fragments to the 5′ end of EGFP cDNA (C-terminal fusions), all antisense primers had a 3′ extension with aSalI site. Using 50 ng of template DNA and the appropriate primer pair (3 pmol each), PCR fragments were amplified in a GeneAmp PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600) with Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), isolated from this vector asXhoI/SalI fragments and fused, in-frame, to the 5′ end of EGFP cDNA contained in vector pEGFP-N1. The PDE3B-EGFP fusion proteins were designated EGFP-3B-(1–100), EGFP-3B-(1–200), EGFP-3B-(1–250), and EGFP-3B-(1–400), respectively.Table ISense and antisense primersPDE3B region amplifiedPrimersauAntisense 1–1005′-TATTCGGTACCGTCGACTGCCCGGCTGCCGCGGCCGCCCAGCGCTCGGGCCT-3′ (nt 300–268) 1–2005′-TTATCGGTACCGTCGACACCAGGACGCCGTGCCGCAGCCTCAC-3′ (nt 600–574) 1–2505′-TATTCGGTACCGTCGACTGGGCTCCCCGGACGTGAAAGAAGTGGTC-3′ (nt 750–724) 1–4005′-CGGTACCGTCGATCGATCTCCTTTCTCAACTGG-3′ (nt 1200–1180)301–4505′-CGGTACCGTCGACTGTGAAACACTGAGTTCTTG-3′ (nt 1350–1333)401–5005′-CGGTACCGTCGACTGATGGCTTGAAGAATTCAG-3′ (nt 1500–1479)Sense201–2505′-CTCGAGGCCATGCTGCTCTTCGCCGGCCTGGAGCTCCGGTACGACGAG-3′ (nt 600–749)184–2505′-CTCGAGGGGGCCATGGGGCTGCTGACGCTCGCGCCCCGC-3′ (nt 549-–49)301–4505′-AGATCTCGAGGGGGCCATGTCCCGAGAACAGATGATCCTC-3′ (nt 900–1349)401–5005′-AGATCTCGAGGGGGCCATGAAACTTCACAAGGGATTGAGT-3′ (nt 1140–1492) Open table in a new tab For generation of PCR fragments encoding MPDE3B aa 201–250, 184–250, 301–450, and 401–500, the sense primers listed in Table I were used. Sense primers for amplification of MPDE3B PCR fragments 201–250 and 184–250 contained an XhoI site followed by a Kozak sequence and an ATG start site; for fragments 301–450 and 401–500, primers contained a BglII site followed by a Kozak sequence and an ATG start site. Antisense primers are also shown in Table I. All contain a SalI site at the 3′ end. The PCR products were generated using the conditions outlined above and subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). The fragments were isolated from this vector asXhoI/SalI or BglII/SalI fragments and fused, in-frame, to the 5′ end of EGFP cDNA contained in vector pEGFP-N1. These PDE3EGFP fusion proteins were designated pEGFP-3B-(201–250), EGFP-3B-(184–250), EGFP-3B-(301–450), and EGFP-3B-(401–500), respectively. All sequences and points of fusion between the 3′ ends of PDE3B fragments and pEGFP-N1 were confirmed by sequencing. RPDE3B pSV/SPORT (full-length rat (R) PDE3B (Ref. 31Leroy M.-J. Degerman E.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) cloned into pSV/SPORT vector) was digested with SacII to remove the putative membrane association domain of PDE3B. NarI, which digests one of the short deleted fragments at a unique site, was also used to reduce the numbers of short fragments that would have double-endedSacII sites and therefore be able to religate with the large linearized R3B-Δ101–266/pSV SPORT. To reduce further risks of intermolecular religation, the small digested fragments were removed by gel electrophoresis. The linearized R3B-Δ101–266/pSV SPORT was then recircularized with T4 DNA ligase and the deletion verified by sequencing. DNA sequences were determined using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following PCR conditions: 25 cycles of 96 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 4 min. The extension products were purified using Centri-Sep columns (Princeton Separations). Automated sequencing was performed for 16 h on an ABI 373A sequencer or for 7 h on an ABI 377 sequencer. COS-7 cells were cultured (37 °C; 5% CO2, 95% air) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml/100 μg/ml) and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. NIH-3006 cells, stably transfected with HPDE3A or RPDE3B (31Leroy M.-J. Degerman E. Taira M. Murata T. Wang W.H. Movsesian M.A. Meacci E. Manganiello V.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), were grown as described above except that 10% calf serum and hygromycin (200 μg/ml) were used. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured under the conditions described above in DMEM containing sodium pyruvate (110 μg/ml), sodium bicarbonate (3 mg/ml), and biotin (8 μg/ml). Cells (2 × 104) were grown to confluence on coverslips, and differentiation was induced by addition of DMEM containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 5 μg/ml insulin (MDI). MDI was added at the same time each day for 3 days. After incubation for 5 days with DMEM containing 5 mmglucose and 5% fetal bovine serum, >90% of the cells had differentiated into adipocytes. COS-7 cells were homogenized in KHEM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes/KOH pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 42 μm cytochalasin B and protease inhibitors (initially as a 1000× stock in Me2SO) at a final concentration of 23 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain, as described previously (27Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged (100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and the resulting supernatants centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 1 h, 4 °C). The final supernatants and resulting pellets were suspended in a volume of complete KHEM buffer equal to that of the supernatant fraction, and stored (−20 °C). Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) or, where detergent was present, by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard in all protein assays. Cells (5 × 105/10-cm plate) were cultured in antibiotic-free medium for 24 h. The medium was replaced with 5 ml of serum-free medium, and cells were transfected with 4 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with complete medium. Mock-transfected cells were treated as above, but with empty vector or pcDNA3 vector containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. For immunofluorescence, cells were plated on 18 mm × 18-mm coverslips in six-well plates, transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 or 1 μg of EGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH), and fixed and immunostained 24–48 h after transfection. The IgG fractions of rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the first 15 aa of rat PDE3B protein were purified (used at 1:200 dilution for immunostaining) as described previously (31Leroy M.-J. Degerman E. Taira M. Murata T. Wang W.H. Movsesian M.A. Meacci E. Manganiello V.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Flag mouse monoclonal antibody (dilutions of 1:200 for immunostaining and 1:2000 for immunoblotting) was purchased from Kodak IBI; rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal IgG conjugated to rhodamine B or Oregon Green (1:200 dilutions for immunostaining), fromBIOSOURCE International; mouse monoclonal BiP (1:200 dilution for immunostaining), from StressGen; mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (1:200 dilution for immunostaining) and p58 antibodies (1:50 dilution for immunostaining), from Sigma; rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin and β-COP antibodies (1:200 dilutions for immunostaining), from ABR; and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:2000 dilution for immunostaining) from CLONTECH. Cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with PBS. COS-7 cells and NIH 3006 cells were fixed for 20 min in paraformaldehyde (3% (w/v)) in PBS containing 0.5 m Ca2+ and 0.5 mMg2+. Cells were washed three times with PBS and quenched for 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were fixed in 70% EtOH, 30 mm glycine, pH 2.5, for 1 h at −20 °C. For plasma membrane staining, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated (1 h) at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml rhodamine lens culinaris agglutinin (Vector Laboratories), washed six times with ice-cold PBS, and fixed, but not quenched. Cells were permeabilized for 4 min in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS, three times with PBS/gelatin/serum (0.2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and 0.1% goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS) and incubated for 2 h with primary antibody diluted in PBS/gelatin/serum. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS/gelatin/serum, three times with PBS, stained for 2 h with the secondary antibody, then washed three times with PBS/gelatin/serum and three times with PBS. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Negative controls included staining of non-transfected cells with the primary antibody, staining of transfected cells with the secondary antibody only, peptide inhibition of staining with primary antibody, staining with pre-immune serum, and staining of transfected cells not treated with detergent. Cells were viewed using a Nikon Diaphot fluorescence microscope fitted with a 60× oil immersion objective. For analysis by confocal microscopy, the cells were examined with a Leica model TCSD/DMIRBE microscope equipped with argon and argon-krypton lasers for blue (488 nm) and green (568 nm) excitation and a 100× objective. The images shown in the different figures are representative of those obtained from at least three separate immunostaining experiments. Three to five images per experiment were taken for each combination of staining patterns. Subcellular fractions of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (in 100-mm tissue culture dishes), 13–14 days after initiation of differentiation, were prepared by a modification of Clark (37Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The cell monolayers (20 dishes/experiment) were rinsed twice with ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), harvested in buffer A, and homogenized (2 ml/dish, 27 strokes with a Teflon pestle, in a 40-ml homogenization vessel). Although 20 dishes were used per experiment, cells from 5 plates were harvested and combined for homogenization. Approximately 2 ml of the whole cell homogenate was removed for later analysis. The homogenate was centrifuged (approximately 100 × g, 10 min) to remove large fragments and whole cells. This supernatant was then centrifuged (13,000 × g, 20 min) using an SS-34 rotor (∼10 ml/tube) at −4 °C (at all other times, the samples were handled on ice or at 4 °C). The infranatant between the fat cake and the pellet (P1) was removed using a syringe and a pipette. The fat cake was discarded and the infranatant centrifuged (15,000 × g, 20 min) to produce P2. P2 was resuspended, centrifuged (20,000 ×g, 20 min), resuspended again in Buffer A (500 μl), and then layered upon a sucrose cushion containing 8–9 ml of Buffer A containing 1.12 m sucrose and centrifuged as described by Clark (37Clar"

We explored the mechanism of protein recognition by ClpA using a high affinity substrate, RepA, which is activated for DNA binding by ClpA and degraded by ClpAP. By characterizing RepA derivatives with N- or C-terminal deletions, we found that the N-terminal portion of RepA is required for recognition. More precisely, RepA derivatives lacking the N-terminal 5 or 10 amino acids are degraded by ClpAP at a rate similar to full-length RepA, whereas RepA derivatives lacking 15 or 20 amino acids are degraded much more slowly. Thus, ClpA recognizes an N-terminal signal in RepA beginning in the vicinity of amino acids 10–15. Moreover, peptides corresponding to RepA amino acids 4–13 and 1–15 inhibit interactions between ClpA and RepA. We constructed fusions of RepA and green fluorescent protein, a protein not recognized by ClpA, and found that the N-terminal 15 amino acids of RepA are sufficient to target the fusion protein for degradation by ClpAP. However, fusion proteins containing 46 or 70 N-terminal amino acids of RepA are degraded more efficiently in vitro and are noticeably stabilized in vivo inclpAΔ and clpPΔ strains compared with wild type.

For example, Escherichia coli ClpA dissociates inactive dimers of plasmid P1 RepA into monomers, thereby activating specific DNA binding by monomeric RepA (4Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D.

Some of the Clp ATPases play a role in degradation when associated with a proteolytic component that alone is unable to degrade large polypeptides (15Schmidt A. Lupas A.N. Finley D. Curr. Opin. Chem.

ClpA or ClpX can associate with ClpP forming ClpAP and ClpXP, which degrade specific proteins. For example, ClpXP and to a lesser extent ClpAP degrade SsrA-tagged protein fragments (17Keiler K.C.

When protein synthesis stalls, because the messenger RNA is damaged and lacks a stop signal, a small RNA, SsrA, is directed to the ribosome and codes for the addition of 11 amino acids to the end of the protein fragment. This 11-amino acid peptide tags the protein for degradation by ClpXP and ClpAP. Structural studies have shown that Clp ATPases self-assemble into oligomeric rings in the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (20Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L.

When associated with a proteolytic component, the ATPase rings are at either or both ends of the proteolytic core forming a structure resembling the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome (20Kessel M.

The crystal structures of two proteolytic components, ClpP and HslV of E. coli, show that the proteolytic sites are in an internal chamber of stacked rings of identical subunits resembling the proteolytic core of the 26 S proteasome, (25Wang J.

However, the pores are not large enough to allow the passage of a native globular protein. The crystal structure of an E. coliClp ATPase, HslU, shows a ring structure with 6-fold symmetry made up of individual subunits that are strikingly similar to their counterparts in a classic AAA-ATPase,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion (29Bochtler M.

It is still unclear what the requirements are for substrate recognition, and efforts to align sequences of known specific substrates have not led to the identification of a simple linear recognition motif. To gain a better understanding of substrate recognition, we characterized a site in RepA that is responsible for the interaction of RepA with ClpA. We found that ClpA recognizes an N-terminal site in RepA that begins in the vicinity of amino acids 10–15. We also found that the first 15 amino acids of RepA, when fused to an otherwise stable protein, are necessary and sufficient to target the fusion protein for degradation by ClpAP. ATP and ATPγS1 were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs. Polymerase chain reaction reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Peptides were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by mass spectrometry by Research Genetics, Inc. Plasmids expressing the N-terminal regions of RepA were constructed by BstBI or MluI cleavage of plasmid pRERepA, a plasmid carrying the P1 repAgene cloned under the control of the λ pRE promoter (45Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following cleavage, the ends were filled in and ligated in the presence of a DNA linker containing a termination codon. Plasmids expressing N-terminal deletions of RepA were constructed by generating appropriaterepA polymerase chain reaction fragments containing 5′ and 3′ NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively, and then ligating the fragments into pET11a (Stratagene). RepA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids expressing RepA(1–15)GFP, RepA(1–46)GFP, RepA(1–70)GFP, and GFPuv under the control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter were constructed as described (35Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K.

GroEL trap [GroEL(D87K)] was prepared as described (48Fenton W.A. Kashl Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The plasmid used for high expression of GroEL trap was kindly provided by Arthur Horwich (Yale University). RepA was 3H-labeledin vitro using succinimidyl propionate,N-[propionate-2,3-3H] (37Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein concentrations are expressed as molar amounts of RepA dimers, ClpA hexamers, ClpP tetradecamers, and α-casein, RepA(1–15)GFP and RepA(1–70)GFP monomers. 3H-Labeled oriP1 plasmid DNA (3800 cpm/fmol) was prepared as described (49Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained (in 20 μl) buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v)), 1 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 pmol ClpA, and 0.1 pmol RepA, unless indicated otherwise. After 10 min at 23 °C, unless indicated otherwise, the mixtures were chilled to 0 °C. Calf thymus DNA (1 μg) and 11 fmol of [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA were added. After 5 min at 0 °C, the mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured. Reaction mixtures (80 μl) contained buffer A, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATPγS, 12 pmol ClpA, and 7 pmol [3H]RepA (4020 cpm/pmol). After 20 min at 23 °C, 1 m NaCl, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml) were added to the mixtures (final volume, 100 μl), and complex formation was quantitated by measuring radioactivity retained on microcon 100 filters (Amicon) as described previously (5Pak M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To detect proteolysis as measured by acid solubilization of labeled RepA, reaction mixtures were assembled in 20 μl of buffer A containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.8 pmol ClpA, 0.8 pmol ClpP, and 0.9 pmol [3H]RepA, unless indicated otherwise. The mixtures were incubated at 24 °C for 15 min or the times indicated. Trichloroacetic acid was added to 20% (w/v), and degradation was quantitated by measuring acid soluble radioactivity. In the [3H]RepA preparations used, <1% of the label was trichloroacetic acid soluble in the absence of ClpAP. To measure proteolysis by the decrease in fluorescence of GFP or RepA-GFP fusion proteins, reaction mixtures were assembled in 100 μl of buffer A, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mmATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 6 μg of creatine kinase, 160 pmol of ClpA, 200 pmol of ClpP, and 40 pmol of GFP or a RepA-GFP derivative. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for the times indicated. The decrease in relative fluorescence was measured as a function of time with excitation at 395 nm and emission at 515 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer equipped with a well plate reader. To quantitate degradation by SDS-PAGE, 20% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) was added to reaction mixtures after a 20-min incubation as described above. The trichloroacetic acid pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of substrate was quantitated by densitometry. Protein unfolding was measured as described above for the fluorescent proteolysis assay, but ClpP was omitted. Reactions were carried out in the absence and presence of 2.5 μm GroEL trap. We wanted to investigate the mechanism of substrate recognition by ClpA by characterizing the interaction of ClpA with a known substrate. RepA was chosen because it is both a substrate for remodeling by ClpA and for degradation by ClpAP. Importantly, RepA has a high affinity for ClpA with an apparent K m of about 2 nm. To roughly define the region of RepA that contains the ClpA recognition signal, we cloned and expressed the N- and C-terminal portions of RepA separately. Degradation of the purified truncated proteins was then measured in reaction mixtures with ClpAPin vitro. We observed that a derivative lacking the N-terminal 49 amino acids of RepA, RepA(50–286), was poorly degraded by ClpAP (Fig. 1). In contrast, when the C-terminal 106 amino acids were removed, ClpAP degraded the truncated protein, RepA(1–180), at a rate similar to full-length RepA (Fig. 1). These results suggest that a signal necessary for ClpA recognition is located within the first 49 amino acids of RepA. To more precisely identify the recognition signal in RepA, we constructed, expressed, and purified RepA proteins deleted for the N-terminal portion of RepA in increments of 5 amino acids (Fig.2). The RepA derivatives were then tested as potential substrates for degradation by ClpAP (Fig.3). ClpAP degraded RepA derivatives lacking the first 5 or first 10 amino acids, RepAΔ5 and RepAΔ10, at similar rates as wild type RepA. However, proteins deleted for the N-terminal 15 or 20 amino acids, RepAΔ15 and RepAΔ20, were degraded at 4- and 8-fold slower rates, respectively, than wild type RepA, suggesting that a ClpA recognition site exists near the N terminus of RepA. One of the deletion proteins, RepAΔ35, was degraded at a rate similar to wild type, indicating that another ClpA recognition site in RepA is exposed by the deletion (data not shown).Figure 3Degradation of N-terminal RepA deletion derivatives by ClpAP. ClpA (20 pmol) and ClpP (9 pmol) were incubated with 75 pmol of wild type RepA (filled squares), RepAΔ5 (inverted open triangles), RepAΔ10 (open circles), RepAΔ15 (open triangles), or RepAΔ20 (open squares) at 24 °C in 250-μl reaction mixtures containing buffer A, 8 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP. At 0, 10, 30, and 60 min, 50-μl aliquots were removed, and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested whether ClpA could activate the DNA binding activity of the various RepA deletion derivatives as it does wild type RepA by converting inactive RepA dimers into active RepA monomers (Fig.4). ClpA activated both RepAΔ5 and RepAΔ10 as it did wild type RepA. However, RepAΔ15 was poorly activated by ClpA. To eliminate the possibility that Δ15 was recognized by ClpA but bound DNA poorly, RepA derivatives were treated with guanidine HCl using conditions known to activate DNA binding by chemically converting RepA dimers to monomers (50Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We found that guanidine-treated RepAΔ15 bound DNA with the same high affinity as similarly treated wild type, RepAΔ5, and RepAΔ10 (Fig.5). Taken together the results from the studies of RepA deletion derivatives suggest that a site necessary for ClpA recognition resides in the N-terminal portion of RepA beginning within amino acids 10–15.Figure 5Guanidine HCl activation of N-terminal RepA deletion proteins. Wild type RepA and RepA derivatives (300 nm) were incubated in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 15 min at 24 °C. One μl of each sample was then diluted 100-fold into buffer A containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μg of calf thymus DNA and 11 fmol of [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA. DNA binding was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the limits of the ClpA recognition site in RepA, we compared the ability of various RepA peptides to compete with wild type RepA for activation by ClpA and degradation by ClpAP. We observed that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–15 of RepA (MNQSFISDILYADIE) significantly inhibited both RepA activation by ClpA (Fig. 6) and degradation by ClpAP (Fig.7 A). A smaller N-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 4–13 was also inhibitory (Fig.7 A). In contrast peptides corresponding to amino acids 1–10 and 11–20 did not inhibit activation or degradation significantly. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 amino acids of RepA, RepA(272–286), had no significant effect on either reaction. Likewise, an internal RepA peptide, RepA(36–50), did not inhibit activation or degradation, although RepAΔ35 was degraded by ClpAP. Experiments measuring inhibition of degradation in a single cycle of substrate binding showed again that RepA(1–15) inhibited degradation and that the other peptides tested did not (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Inhibition of ClpAP degradation by N-terminal RepA peptide. A, [3H]RepA was incubated with ClpA and ClpP with increasing amounts RepA peptide 1–10 (inverted open triangles), 1–15 (filled squares), 4–13 (filled circles), 11–20 (open circles), 36–50 (open triangles), or 272–286 (open squares) as indicated, and protein degradation was quantitated by measuring acid soluble radioactivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of peptide, 0.18 pmol of RepA was degraded. B, RepA-ClpAP complexes were formed by incubating 0.8 pmol each of ClpA and ClpP with 0.9 pmol of [3H]RepA in 20 μl of buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATPγS, and 1 μm RepA peptide, as indicated, for 15 min at 24 °C. Complexes were diluted to 1 ml with buffer A containing 4 μm α-casein, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP and incubated an additional 5 min at 24 °C. Reaction products were precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity in the acid-soluble fractions was measured. In the absence of peptide, 34 fmol of RepA were degraded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested the RepA peptides as competitive inhibitors of complex formation between ClpA and RepA to eliminate the possibility that the peptides were inhibiting degradation by ClpP rather than recognition by ClpA. Complexes of [3H]RepA and ClpA were assembled in the presence of ATPγS and various concentrations of the peptides. After a short incubation, free [3H]RepA was separated from ClpA-RepA complexes by ultrafiltration, and the amount of [3H]RepA associated with ClpA was quantitated. We found that the RepA(1–15) peptide inhibited ClpA-RepA complex formation (Fig. 8). RepA(1–10), RepA(36–50), and RepA(272–286) had very little effect. In control experiments, RepA peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit degradation of another ClpAP substrate, α-casein. RepA(1–15) inhibited α-casein degradation, whereas RepA(36–50) and RepA(277–286) had no effect (data not shown). In another control experiment, we measured the effect of the peptides on degradation by ClpXP. Because RepA is neither activated by ClpX nor degraded by ClpXP (4Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we expected and observed that the RepA(1–15) peptide had no effect on degradation of λ O by ClpXP (data not shown). The peptide inhibition experiments demonstrate that ClpA specifically binds a site within the first 15 amino acids of RepA and more precisely within amino acids 4–13. We wanted to know whether the N-terminal portion of RepA could tag an otherwise unrecognized protein for recognition by ClpA. GFP was chosen for these experiments, because it is not recognized by ClpA (33Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 35Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Several gene fusions betweenrepA and GFP were constructed and expressed under control of the ara BAD promoter. The GFP gene cloned in the same vector was used as a control. The resulting plasmids produced fusion proteins containing the N-terminal 15, 46, or 70 amino acids of RepA fused to the N-terminal end of full-length GFP, referred to as RepA(1–15)GFP, RepA(1–46)GFP, and RepA(1–70)GFP, respectively. The plasmids were introduced into araΔ derivatives of E. coliwild type, clpAΔ, clpPΔ, orclpXΔ strains and grown in the presence of arabinose. It could be seen by visible light that the wild type, clpAΔ, and clpPΔ strains grew better than the clpXΔstrain, independent of the plasmid used (Fig.9, A, C,E, and G). When viewed under UV light, colonies of all four strains expressing GFP were fluorescent (Fig.9 B). In contrast, colonies of clpAΔ andclpPΔ strains expressing RepA(1–70)GFP were significantly more fluorescent than the wild type and clpXΔ, suggesting that the fusion protein was stabilized by the absence of ClpAP but not ClpXP (Fig. 9 D). Similarly, clpAΔ andclpPΔ strains expressing RepA(1–46) were more fluorescent than the clpXΔ strain and slightly more fluorescent than wild type (Fig. 9 F). The clpAΔ strain expressing RepA(1–15)GFP was more fluorescent than theclpXΔ and wild type strains; however, theclpPΔ strain was indistinguishable from the wild type strain (Fig. 9 H). These results suggest that in vivo the N-terminal portion of RepA targets GFP for degradation by ClpAP and not by ClpXP and that 46 or more N-terminal amino acids of RepA are required. We purified RepA(1–15)GFP and RepA(1–70)GFP and measured the disappearance of fluorescence in the presence of ClpAP in vitro as an indication of degradation (Fig.10). The fluorescence of both fusion proteins decreased following incubation with ClpAP and ATP. With these conditions, the fluorescence of GFP was unchanged (data not shown and Refs. 33Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and 35Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the fluorescence of RepA(1–15)GFP decreased more slowly than that of RepA(1–70)GFP, suggesting that it had lower affinity for ClpA than RepA(1–70)GFP. Degradation was confirmed by quantitating the disappearance of the proteins by SDS-PAGE. After a 20-min incubation with ClpAP, using conditions shown in Fig. 10, 65% of the RepA(1–70)GFP and 47% of the RepA(1–15)GFP were degraded. Thus in vitro degradation of RepA(1–70) confirms thein vivo results shown above. These results further show that the first 15 amino acids of RepA are both necessary and sufficient to tag GFP for recognition by ClpA and degradation by ClpAP. The difficulty in detecting in vivo degradation of RepA(1–15)GFP is best explained by ClpA having a lower affinity for RepA(1–15)GFP compared with RepA(1–70)GFP. To compare the affinity of RepA(1–15)GFP and RepA(1–70)GFP for ClpA by another assay, we measured steady state unfolding by ClpA. The Horwich laboratory showed that ClpA catalyzes unfolding of a GFP derivative that contains the 11-amino acid SsrA tag fused to the C-terminal end of GFP, GFP-SsrA (33Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Unfolding was measured as a decrease in fluorescence dependent on ClpA and ATP. GroEL trap (48Fenton W.A. Kashl Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), a mutant form of GroEL that binds unfolded proteins but does not release them, was required in the reaction mixtures to sequester unfolded GFP-SsrA released by ClpA, thereby preventing the spontaneous refolding of GFP-SsrA (33Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Global unfolding was confirmed by deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments (33Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). RepA(1–15)GFP, like GFP-SsrA, showed a less than 5% decrease in fluorescence upon incubation with ClpA and ATP (Fig.11 A). With the addition of GroEL trap, a 30% decrease in fluorescence was seen because of sequestration of unfolded RepA(1–15)GFP (Fig. 11 B). In contrast, when RepA(1–70)GFP was incubated with ClpA and ATP, the fluorescence decreased about 40% (Fig. 11 A). RepA (1–70)GFP was not irreversibly “trapped” by ClpA and regained its original fluorescence after about 30 min, indicating that after ATP was depleted, the steady state unfolding reaction ceased (35Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When GroEL trap was included in the reaction mixtures with RepA(1–70)GFP and ClpA, fluorescence decreased 60% (Fig. 11 B). As expected, fluorescence was not regained with time, because GroEL trap irreversibly bound the unfolded protein. Thus RepA(1–70)GFP has a higher affinity for ClpA than RepA(1–15)GFP, such that in the steady state much of the RepA(1–70)GFP is involved in cycles of binding, unfolding, releasing, and refolding. These results suggest that other signals present in RepA(1–70)GFP significantly increase the affinity of the fusion protein for ClpA. We have shown that a signal in the N-terminal 15 amino acids of RepA tags RepA for recognition by ClpA. Interestingly, the site is near but not at the N terminus, beginning in the vicinity of amino acids 10–15. This result suggests a slightly different type of recognition site than that reported by Tobias et al. (40Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), who found that the addition of certain single amino acids, including leucine and phenylalanine, to the N terminus of β-galactosidase tags the protein for degradation by ClpAP. In vivo, leucine, phenylalanine transfer RNA-protein transferase specifically adds leucine or phenylalanine to proteins bearing an N-terminal arginine or lysine, thus targeting them for degradation by ClpAP (41Shrader T.E. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For HemA, another ClpAP substrate, the recognition signal resides within the N-terminal 18 amino acids, but a more precise location has not been determined (42Wang L. Elliott M. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For SsrA-tagged proteins, both ClpAP and ClpXP recognize the C-terminal 11-amino acid addition (18Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 36Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been shown that changing the last two C-terminal residues of SsrA from Ala-Ala to Asp-Asp destroys recognition by both ClpA and ClpX, implicating the two terminal amino acids in recognition (51Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have not yet tested whether changing the N-terminal two amino acids of RepA will destroy recognition, although we know that the N-terminal 10 amino acids can be deleted without destroying recognition. Although our data in combination with data from other laboratories does not suggest a consensus ClpA or ClpX binding motif, one striking similarity is the diversity in the sequences recognized by the various ATP-dependent proteases and also in the sequences recognized by a single protease. The results presented here show that when the 15 N-terminal amino acids of RepA are transferred to a protein not normally recognized by ClpA, they target the fusion protein to be recognized by ClpA and degraded by ClpAP. However, the affinity of the fusion protein is relatively low compared with fusion proteins containing larger amounts of RepA, suggesting that there are one or more additional ClpA binding sites in RepA. A similar conclusion with respect to λ O protein was reached by the Zylicz laboratory based on the observation that ClpX was able to interact, albeit poorly, with λ O lacking the N-terminal recognition signal (44Gonciarz-Swiatek M. Wawrzynow A. Um S.-J. Learn B.A. McMacken R. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Sliekers O. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13999-14005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 11-amino acid SsrA tag is the principal factor in determining the strength of the interaction between ClpXP and a SsrA-tagged protein, and the particular protein to which the tag is attached contributes very little (34Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to understanding the sites on substrates that are important for recognition, it is important to understand how the proteases recognize the signals. Sites in the C-terminal domains of ClpA, ClpX, ClpY (HslU), ClpB, and Lon have been identified by Smith et al. (52Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as important in substrate recognition. They isolated small domains, which are referred to as “sensor and substrate discrimination domains.” These domains bind substrates with good but not perfect specificity. For example ClpX binds a SsrA-tagged protein, Arc-SsrA, with the same specificity seen in vivo. ClpA also specifically binds Arc-SsrA, but with less specificity and to a lesser extent. However, some of the domains cross-reacted with substrates normally degraded by other proteases. Therefore, it is not clear whether these substrate-binding domains are the only substrate interaction sites. Our working model of substrate recognition and discrimination by Clp ATPases is that the substrate binding domain specifically recognizes and binds with high affinity small regions of about 10 amino acids residing at or near either the N or the C terminus of substrates and therefore likely requiring a nearby end. The strength and perhaps the fidelity of the binding are increased by the presence of one or more secondary binding sites. Conformational changes associated with ATP binding and/or hydrolysis promote protein unfolding. The mechanistic details of how Clp chaperones catalyze unfolding are not known, but most likely they exert a mechanical stress. Models evoking mechanical force are most easily envisioned as having two or more sites on the Clp protein contacting two or more sites on the substrate simultaneously, followed by ATP-driven conformational changes that result in the structure of the substrate being pulled apart. Clp chaperones might be linear machines operating by an inchworm type mechanism (53Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lectures. 1992; 88: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, they may operate in a concerted reaction, globally unfolding a substrate in one cycle. Translocation to the proteolytic cavity may be coupled to unfolding, in which case the substrate would be simultaneously unfolded and extruded into the proteolytic cavity. However, we found that unfolding and translocation can be uncoupled; when they are, translocation requires additional ATP, indicating that unfolded substrates are actively pumped into the proteolytic chamber (35Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of ATP-dependent degradation is becoming clearer, important questions remain unanswered, and the working model remains speculative.

https://openalex.org/W1988140254,"The signaling pathway by which environmental stresses activate heat shock factors (HSFs) is not completely understood. We show that the small GTPase rac1, and Rac1-regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in stress-stimulated heat shock response. A dominant-negative allele of Rac1 (Rac1N17) inhibits the hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite-induced transcriptional activity of HSF-1 and the transcription of heat shock protein 70. Rac1N17 also suppresses the production of intracellular ROS induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation or sodium arsenite. Moreover, direct suppression of intracellular ROS levels by antioxidants decreases stress-stimulated HSF activity. However, expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (Rac1V12) in the absence of extracellular stresses does not increase intracellular ROS levels or induce the heat shock response.

Science. 1993; 259: 1014-1409Crossref Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Mammalian HSFs are activated by a variety of stresses, including exposure to heat, cytokines, genotoxic agents, heavy metals, and hypoxia/reoxygenation (1Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1014-1409Crossref Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, HSFs exist in the cytoplasm as inactive monomers that oligomerize as homotrimers with high DNA binding affinity after exposure to cellular stresses (3Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol.

Previous studies have linked the induction of the heat shock response in vitro andin vivo to redox changes (6Schoeniger L.O. Andreoni K.A. Ott G.R. Risby T.H. Bulkley G.B. Udelsman R. Burdick J.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, millimolar doses of H2O2 can stimulate binding of HSFs to the heat shock element (HSE) and result in heat shock protein synthesis through a thioredoxin-dependent mechanism (8Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, thiol-reducing agents inhibit the heat shock response (7Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many cellular stresses, such as hypoxia/reoxygenation, cytokines, and heat shock, that lead to HSF activation are capable of increasing the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (9Reddy M.V. Gangadharam P.R. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2386-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Larrick J.W. Wright S.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.S.

Nonetheless, the signaling pathway through which such extracellular stresses lead to the production of ROS, activation of heat shock factors, and transcription of heat shock genes is not fully characterized. Rho proteins participate in a variety of cellular functions including cytoskeletal reorganization, growth, and transformation (12Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The Rac1 GTPase belongs to the rho family of small GTP binding proteins, and its role in the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells such as neutrophils is well established (13Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In such cells, Rac proteins are essential for the assembly of the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase that is responsible for the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen leading to the production of superoxide anions. Rac proteins, in particular Rac1, serve a similar function in nonphagocytic cells (14Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Furthermore, Rac1-regulated ROS can lead to the induction of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the possibility that Rac1, through the production of reactive oxygen species, may also modulate the transcriptional activity of heat shock factors and thereby participate in the stress-stimulated heat shock response. HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 104/cm2 the day prior to transfection. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the transfectant according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 48 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to the indicated stress, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured by the phase extraction method as described previously (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assessed using a luciferase reporter kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendation. CAT activity was normalized against protein content and luciferase activity, to correct for variations in transfection efficiencies. The normalized CAT activity is expressed relative to that from cells transfected with pEXV under normoxic conditions. Results of each CAT reporter assay were reproducible in three separate experiments. The empty expression vector pEXV, the expression vectors encoding the constitutively active (rac1V12) and dominant negative (rac1N17) Myc epitope-tagged cDNAs of Rac1, and the expression plasmid for dominant negative c-ras (rasN17), have been previously described (14Irani K.

Δ5N/−105 is a CAT reporter plasmid that has 105 base pairs, containing two HSE binding sites, of the inducible hsp70 promoter upstream of the initiation codon. pRSV-Luc is a constitutive expression plasmid encoding firefly luciferase. The adenovirus Adβgal, encoding the inert Escherichia coli lacZ gene and the adenovirus AdRac1N17, encoding the Myc-tagged dominant negativerac1 cDNA, which was constructed in our laboratory, have been previously described (21Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both viruses were amplified in HEK 293 cells and purified on double cesium gradients. HepG2 cells were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 18 h, after which the infection medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium for another 48 h. Hypoxia was attained in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) by flushing the chamber with a 95% N2, 5% CO2 gas mixture for 15 min and sealing the chamber. This method has been shown to achieve a pO2 of 10 ± 5 torr (22Crawford L.E. Milliken E.E. Irani K. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Johnson T.M. Eissa N.T. Crystal R.G. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J.

Cells were reoxygenated by opening the chamber and replacing the hypoxic medium with oxygenated medium. Sodium arsenite, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), andN-acetylcysteine were obtained from Sigma. 48 h after infection with adenoviruses or transfection with expression plasmids, 20 μg of whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The Myc epitope-tagged constitutively active and dominant negative forms of Rac1 were detected using an antibody against Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to HSF-1 and HSF-2 were a generous gift from R. Morimoto (Northwestern University). GST-tagged SEK(KR) expression was confirmed with an antibody to GST. In some cases detection of tubulin with a monoclonal antibody (DM 1A; Sigma) was used as an internal control to verify equal protein loading. Immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of extract was incubated with 106 cpm of an end-labeled HSE consensus sequence oligonucleotide (5′-GCCTCGAATGTTCGCGAAGTT-3′) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg of dIdC, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin). HSF-1 and HSF-2 antibodies (αHSF1 and αHSF2) were preincubated with the nuclear extract for 15 min on ice prior to adding labeled oligonucleotide. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Intracellular fluorescence of the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore 2′-7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF diacetate) was used to qualitatively assess ROS production (15Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with DCF diacetate (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 5 min and imaged immediately using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope. A representative field is shown. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration was quantified using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The fluorescence of 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent), a highly sensitive and stable probe for hydrogen peroxide (23Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), was measured with a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore Corp.). A standard curve, generated using exogenous H2O2, was used to calculate hydrogen peroxide concentration. Values represent mean ± S.D. from a representative experiment that was reproduced twice. 30 μg of whole cell lysates were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Active JNKs were detected using an antibody directed specifically against dually phosphorylated (Thr183 and Tyr185) JNK1 (46 kDa) and JNK2 (54 kDa) (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total JNKs were detected with an antibody to JNK1 and JNK2 (Cell Signaling). Immunocomplexes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was extracted by a standard protocol (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel, RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, which was hybridized with 3 × 107 cpm of 32P-labeled single-strand cDNA of human inducible hsp70. After washing under stringent conditions, the membrane was autoradiographed. The membrane was then stripped and rehybridized with a probe to 18 S rRNA and autoradiographed. Hsp70 mRNA normalized to 18 S rRNA was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Results are from a single representative experiment that was reproduced once. Past studies have shown that exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (hypoxia/reoxygenation) results in a robust heat shock response (6Schoeniger L.O. Andreoni K.A. Ott G.R. Risby T.H. Bulkley G.B. Udelsman R. Burdick J.F. Buchman T.G. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 177-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Das D.K. Engelman R.M. Kimura Y. Cardiovasc.

Physiol. 1994; 267: H2213-H2219PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the role of Rac1 in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF transcriptional activity. Hypoxia/reoxygenation but not hypoxia alone leads to a marked increase in CAT reporter activity in HepG2 cells transfected with the pEXV expression vector alone (Fig.1 A). The increase in CAT activity was specifically due to HSF activation, since cells transfected with a similar reporter plasmid (LSPN) bearing a 4-base mutation within the HSE sites show no comparable increase with hypoxia/reoxygenation. Expression of Rac1N17 results in reduction of basal and inhibition of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activity without affecting steady state levels of HSF-1 or HSF-2 (Fig.1 B). Importantly, transfection with an expression plasmid for constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1V12) has no effect on HSF activity under unstressed conditions. Expression of the Rac1 mutants was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). Thus, Rac1 is necessary but not sufficient for basal and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced activation of HSFs. Individual proteins of the Ras superfamily have specific cellular targets. We therefore examined the specificity of Rac1 in regulating hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activity. Expression of a dominant negative allele of c-ras, rasN17, is not effective at suppressing hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the regulation of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation by Rac1 is specific for this small GTPase and was not shared by other small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily, in particular, c-Ras. The heat shock response is a multistep process that involves the conversion of HSFs from nonbinding to DNA binding states and transcriptional competency. We therefore also examined the role of Rac1 in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF binding to its sequence-specific HSE using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. HepG2 cells were infected with a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus encoding Rac1N17 (AdRac1N17). Control cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding the inert E. coli lacZ gene (Adβgal). The cells were then maintained under normoxic conditions or exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Nuclear extracts from these cells were subjected to an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a sequence-specific HSE oligonucleotide. Hypoxia/reoxygenation results in a significant increase in specific HSF-HSE binding in Adβgal-infected cells (Fig. 2 A). Infection with AdRac1N17 blunts this hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced increase in HSF-HSE binding. Preincubation of the nuclear extract with an antibody to HSF-1 suppresses hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced binding to HSE and results in a supershifted band implicating activation of HSF-1 by hypoxia/reoxygenation. In contrast, antibody to HSF-2 had little effect on DNA binding activity. Expression of the epitope-tagged Rac1N17 was evident in HepG2 cells infected with AdRac1N17 but not in Adβgal-infected cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in addition to transcriptional competency, Rac1 also regulates hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF-1 DNA binding. Previous studies have shown that heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury induce many heat shock proteins (27Bauman J.W. Liu J. Klaassen C.D. Fund. Appl. Toxicol. 1993; 21: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of Rac1 in sodium arsenite-induced HSF activation. Sodium arsenite leads to induction of HSF transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells transfected with the pEXV vector alone (Fig. 3). Transfection with the expression plasmid for Rac1N17 results in a significant inhibition of both absolute and relative increase of sodium arsenite-induced HSF activation. Thus, sodium arsenite, another known activator of the heat shock response, is also dependent upon Rac1-regulated pathways for this response. Many of the diverse cellular stresses, including hypoxia/reoxygenation and heavy metals, that induce the expression of heat shock protein genes, lead to an increase in intracellular oxidative stress. We therefore assessed the role of Rac1 in regulating hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite-induced intracellular production of ROS. ROS levels were measured using two intracellular peroxide-sensitive fluorophores: DCF and Amplex Red. DCF fluorescence has been used extensively in the past to detect intracellular ROS, and Amplex Red is a new, highly sensitive and specific fluorophore that fluoresces upon interaction with H2O2. Hypoxia/reoxygenation results in a profound increase in DCF fluorescence in HepG2 cells transfected with the control plasmid (Fig. 4 A). Cells transfected with the rac1N17 expression plasmid show a significant decrease in hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated rise in DCF fluorescence. This finding was corroborated and quantified using the Amplex Red probe (Fig. 4 B). The 2–3-fold rise in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced intracellular H2O2 concentration seen in cells transfected with the control pEXV vector is almost completely blunted in cells transfected with the rac1N17 expression plasmid. Similarly, sodium arsenite-induced H2O2 accumulation within HepG2 cells is also significantly inhibited by Rac1N17. In contrast, hypoxia alone, which does not activate the heat shock response in HepG2 cells, does not result in an increase in intracellular H2O2. Thus, induction of the heat shock response by two independent extracellular stresses correlates with the intracellular Rac1-dependent generation of H2O2 by these stresses. In further support of a role for ROS in Rac1-regulated signaling pathway(s) responsible for stress-induced HSF activation, we found that expression of Rac1V12 alone, in the absence of extracellular stresses, does not activate HSFs (Fig. 1 A) and has no effect on intracellular H2O2 production (Fig.4 B). Moreover, since c-Ras appeared not to be involved in stress-stimulated HSF activity, we also examined the role of this small GTPase in hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite-stimulated production of intracellular ROS. Transfection of HepG2 cells with an expression vector encoding the dominant negative allele of c-ras, rasN17, does not affect H2O2 production by either stimulus (Fig.4 B). Thus, the inability of Rac1V12 and RasN17 to regulate ROS production under nonstressed and stress conditions, respectively, correlates with their ineffectiveness in modulating HSF activity. Finally, we also assessed the effects of transfecting HepG2 cells with a plasmid encoding catalase or treating them with the thiol agentN-acetylcysteine (NAC) on intracellular H2O2 levels. Transfection with catalase or treatment with NAC both result in significant inhibition of hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite-induced increase in H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 4 B). Notably, NAC is more effective than catalase at reducing hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced H2O2 levels. Thus, catalase and NAC are both potent scavengers of H2O2 in HepG2 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that both the addition of exogenous oxidants and modulation of the intracellular redox state influences the heat shock response (8Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Having shown that Rac1 mediates hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite-induced intracellular accumulation of ROS and activation of HSF, we next assessed the role of intracellular ROS in stress-induced HSF activation. Levels of intracellular ROS-1 were directly manipulated by either expression of superoxide dismutase and catalase or by treatment with NAC. HepG2 cells transfected with expression plasmids for superoxide dismutase or catalase or pretreated with NAC show a significant decrease in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation (Fig. 5 A). Of the three antioxidants examined, NAC has the greatest effect, with HSF activity approaching basal levels. However, none of the antioxidants is as effective in suppressing hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation as Rac1N17. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). Rac1 regulates ROS production by a NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein oxidase (14Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether DPI, a flavoprotein antagonist, has any effect on stress-stimulated HSF activity. Treatment of cells with DPI dose-dependently suppresses H/R-induced HSF transcriptional activity (Fig.5 B). Many environmental stresses including hypoxia/reoxygenation and heavy metals lead to activation of the JNK family of stress-activated protein kinases (28Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). JNKs are one of the many downstream targets of the rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (30Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that JNKs can mediate the transcriptional activation and post-translational modification of certain heat shock proteins (31Lee Y.J. Corry P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29857-29863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that regulation of stress-induced HSF activity by Rac1 was mediated via the activation of JNKs. JNK activation was inhibited by transfection of HepG2 cells with a plasmid encoding for dominant-negative stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (SEK1). SEK1 is a kinase that lies immediately upstream of JNKs and is necessary for their activation, and SEK(KR) is a dominant inhibitory mutant of this kinase (18Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Similar torac1N17, transfection with the SEK(KR) expression plasmid inhibits hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation (Fig.6). Therefore, activation of JNKs is necessary for the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced heat shock response. We also examined the effect of Rac1N17 on stress-induced JNK activation. Hypoxia/reoxygenation and sodium arsenite led to an induction of JNKs, which is inhibited by both Rac1N17 and SEK(KR) (Fig.7). Moreover, treatment with NAC suppressed hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced JNK activation. This suggests that the stress-induced activation of JNKs is governed by Rac1-regulated ROS and that this activation is at least partly responsible for the stress-induced heat shock response. Activated HSFs bind to upstream sequence-specific motifs present in the promoters of all stress-inducible heat shock protein genes, promoting their transcription. Hsp70 is a prototypical example of a heat shock protein that is induced by stresses that change the cellular redox status, such as hypoxia/reoxygenation. We therefore looked at the role of Rac1 in hsp70 gene transcription. Hypoxia/reoxygenation strongly induces hsp70 mRNA in HepG2 cells (Fig. 8). Expression of Rac1N17 significantly suppresses the induction of hsp70. Expression of catalase or treatment with NAC leads to a partial inhibition of hsp70 transcription. Quantification of the Northern blot demonstrates a correlation between the efficacy of the two antioxidants, catalase and NAC, to suppress hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced intracellular ROS (Fig.5) and hsp70 transcription. Finally, expression of the constitutively active Rac1V12, which does not lead to HSF activation, also does not result in induction of hsp70 transcription. HSF activation and hsp transcription occurs in response to myriad stresses. Many such stresses result in an increase in intracellular ROS. In this study we found that sodium arsenite and hypoxia/reoxygenation depend upon Rac1 for the induction of the heat shock response through activation of HSF-1, the HSF best known to be responsive to extracellular stresses. Moreover, Rac1 also regulates the production of intracellular H2O2 induced by these stresses. In contrast, hypoxia does not induce the heat shock response in HepG2 cells and correspondingly does not increase intracellular H2O2 in these cells. This finding is in contrast to some other studies, which report that hypoxia alone can up-regulate HSF binding and transcription (32Benjamin I.J. Kroger B. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6263-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between these findings and ours might reflect differences in cell types, or they could be due to variations in hypoxic conditions. In the present study, HSF transcriptional activity was measured immediately after hypoxia and therefore is a true reflection of hypoxia and not hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activity. The central role of ROS, in particular H2O2, as mediators of stress-induced, Rac1-regulated HSF activation is supported by two observations. First, RasN17, which is ineffective at suppressing the stress-induced heat shock response, is also incapable of inhibiting H2O2 production. Second, expression of Rac1V12 has no discernible effect on either H2O2generation or HSF activation in HepG2 cells. This latter finding is in contrast to the effect of Rac1V12 on H2O2production in HeLa cells (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our findings agree with studies looking at the role of Rac1 in ROS generation, specifically in HepG2 cells (33Cool R.H. Merten E. Theiss C. Acker H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such studies have shown only a very modest increase in intracellular ROS in HepG2 cells expressing Rac1V12, and only after NAD(P)H stimulation. Thus, the effect of expressing activated Rac1, in the absence of extracellular stimuli or stresses, on intracellular ROS production may be very cell type-specific. In this context, a previous report has shown that Rho proteins signal to the nucleus in cell type-specific manners (34Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Close analysis of our data shows that the peroxide scavengers catalase and NAC are more effective than superoxide dismutase in suppressing hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activity, implying that H2O2 is the main oxidant species responsible for HSF activation. This is in agreement with previous reports showing that the activation of HSF by exogenous oxidants is selective for the type of oxidant used, H2O2 being effective while superoxide was not (35Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Jornot L. Polla B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14094-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fact that superoxide dismutase does suppress HSF activation to a modest degree suggests that a secondary oxidant such as the hydroxyl radical, the formation of which requires both H2O2 and superoxide, may also participate in HSF activation. Regardless of the oxidant(s) responsible for HSF activation, the molecular targets of this oxidant(s) are likely to include intracellular thiols such as GSH, since agents that modulate the intracellular GSSG/GSH ratio can profoundly influence the induction of heat shock proteins (7Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Aucoin M.M. Barhoumi R. Kochevar D.T. Granger H.J. Burghardt R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1651-H1658PubMed Google Scholar, 37Saunders E.L. Maines M.D. Meredith M.J. Freeman M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within this context, it is interesting to note that another oxidant species, nitric oxide, which leads to an increase in oxidized glutathione, induces hsp70 expression in hepatocytes (38Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that Rac1-regulated production of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, or their derivatives, results in an induction of the heat shock response by a similar mechanism. Although ROS appear to have an important role, this study also implicates redox-independent mechanisms in regulating basal and stress-induced heat shock transcription. Rac1N17 results in a significant reduction of basal HSF transcriptional activity. However, under these same conditions there is no difference in intracellular H2O2 concentrations between control cells and those expressing Rac1N17, thus signifying the importance of Rac1-dependent, ROS-independent mechanisms in regulating HSF-mediated transcription in unstressed conditions. The role of redox-independent mechanisms in also mediating stress-induced heat shock response is suggested by the observation that NAC is very effective at inhibiting the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced increase in intracellular H2O2 levels but only partly effective at suppressing hsp70 transcription. The precise redox-sensitive mechanisms by which HSFs gain full transcriptional activity are likely to be multiple and complex. HSF-1 contains redox-sensitive cysteine residues, and oxidants have been shown to inhibit HSF-DNA binding (8Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, direct redox modifications of cysteine residues in HSF-1 is an unlikely mechanism for its activation. However, it is plausible that the stress-induced oxidation of critical cysteine residues within HSFs is balanced by the up-regulation of endogenous oxidant-stimulated reducing agents such as thioredoxin and redox factor-1 (Ref-1), thereby permitting HSF activation (8Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Extracellular stresses also lead to phosphorylation of HSFs (39Mivechi N.F. Koong A.C. Giaccia A.J. Hahn G.M. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1994; 10: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and therefore redox-modulated changes in protein phosphorylation may contribute to HSF-1 activation. In this regard, several studies have implicated JNK-regulated phosphorylation of HSFs in augmenting the heat shock response to specific stresses (31Lee Y.J. Corry P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29857-29863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Kim S.H. Kim D. Jung G.S. Um J.H. Chung B.S. Kang C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our observation that SEK(KR) abrogates the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HSF activation is in concert with these previous reports. In contrast to JNKs, phosphorylation of HSF-1 via the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway has been shown to correlate with repression of its activity (41Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5512-5519PubMed Google Scholar, 42Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 43Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This too is consistent with our finding that RasN17 is ineffective at inhibiting stress-induced HSF transcriptional activity. Thus, the activation of c-Ras and Rac1, with consequent induction of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and JNKs, respectively, has distinct and perhaps opposing effects on stress-induced HSF activation. Induction of heat shock proteins is a universal cellular response to a variety of developmental cues and environmental stresses, and expression of many heat shock proteins conveys protection against such stresses. The physiological relevance of this adaptive response is amply demonstrated in animal studies in which forced overexpression of inducible heat shock proteins protect against hypoxic and post-hypoxic organ damage (44Otterbein L.E.

This study implicates Rac1 and Rac1-regulated ROS production as an important step in the multistep process that results in the heat shock transcriptional response to two distinct environmental stresses. As such, it suggests that Rac1 may play an integral part in the cell's defense mechanisms against diverse extracellular stresses ranging from ischemia/reperfusion to heavy metals, and adds to the growing list of functions for this ubiquitous and versatile small GTPase.

However, the signaling mechanisms controlling these physiological processes are poorly understood. In a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (i.e.A431), 12(S)-HETE activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), which is mediated by upstream kinases MEK and Raf. 12(S)-HETE stimulates phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 and activity of protein kinase Cα (PKCα). In addition, independent of PKC 12(S)-HETE increases tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, and Grb2, stimulates association between Shc and Src, and increases the activity of Ras, via Src family kinases. Furthermore, at low (10–100 nm) concentrations 12(S)-HETE counteracts epidermal growth factor-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 via stimulating protein tyrosine phosphatases. We also present evidence that 12(S)-HETE stimulates ERK1/2 via G proteins and that A431 cells have multiple binding sites for 12(S)-HETE. Finally, inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase induced apoptosis of A431 cells, which was reversed by addition of exogenous 12(S)-HETE.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4047-4051PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies suggest that the pleiotropic effects of 12(S)-HETE on tumor cells are mediated by an eicosanoid receptor which activates protein kinase C (PKC) (7Liu B. Khan W.A. Hannun Y.A. Timar J.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and -2, also known as p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/44 MAPK), respectively, are well characterized as convergence points of numerous signal transduction pathways. Through their diverse substrates, ERKs modulate nuclear, as well as cytoplasmic events in cells resulting in increased proliferation (8Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), differentiation (9Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). It is well established that receptor-tyrosine kinases activate ERK via the consecutive stimulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, monomeric G protein Ras, and the Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade of protein kinases. In addition to growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, G protein-coupled receptors also are stimulators of ERK. G proteins can influence ERK activity via multiple mechanisms (11Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 5: 337-351Google Scholar), which include activation of tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor (12Li X. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or Src (13Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), stimulating the early stages of the conventional cascade. Alternatively, G proteins may activate ERK by promoting the production of lipid second messengers via phospholipase C (PLC) or phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase resulting in the activation of PKC. Protein kinase C in turn can stimulate the ERK cascade through Raf and MEK. An earlier study, reported that 12(S)-HETE increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins migrating in the 40–50-kDa range (14Tang D.G. Tarrien M. Dobzynski P. Honn K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which led us to hypothesize that ERK1/2 may be mediators of 12(S)-HETE-induced cellular responses. In this study we identify ERK1/2 as signaling targets of exogenous 12(S)-HETE in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and we describe the signaling mechanisms leading to this stimulation through the following: (a) the Src family-mediated activation of PLCγ1 and PKCα, (b) Src family-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and subsequent stimulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade via Ras. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the involvement of G proteins in 12(S)-HETE signaling.

The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 25 mg/liter gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were passaged with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Platelet type 12 lipoxygenase-transfected A431 cells were described earlier (22Tang K. Finley R.L. Nie D. Honn K.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3185-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For drug treatments, A431 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates, cultured for 1 day in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and then serum-starved overnight (20 h). Fresh serum-free DMEM was added 1 h prior to treatments. Inhibitors (at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends) or vehicle (0.1%) treatment was 15 min before stimulation with 12(S)-HETE or other chemicals, with the exception of farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTase inhibitor II, 1 h) and Src family kinase inhibitor (PP2, 30 min). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 200 μl of boiling gel loading buffer (20% glycerol; 2% SDS; 2.5 × 10−2mg/ml bromphenol blue; 125 mm Tris base, pH 6.8; 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell lysates were sonicated briefly and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots (20 μl) were resolved on 10 or 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (the latter from Fisher) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). In gels used to detect the mobility shift of phosphorylated proteins, the acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio was 118:1. Membranes were probed with the antibodies indicated in the text, and bands were visualized with the Supersignal system (Pierce). Blots were routinely stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol; 2% SDS; 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7) and reprobed with other antibodies. Densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed with an LKB 2222–010 UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Bromma, Sweden). Cells were serum-starved overnight, pretreated with drugs, followed by washing with ice-cold PBS. For immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions, cells were lysed (200 μl boiling 1% SDS; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), boiled for 5 min, and briefly sonicated. Cell lysates were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 5 min), and equal amounts of debris-free supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of IP buffer (1% Triton X-100; 150 mmNaCl; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm Na3VO4; 0.2 mm PMSF; 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and anti-phosphotyrosine (3 μg) or other antibodies (1 μg). In the case of non-denaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off into 1 ml of ice-cold IP buffer, sonicated, incubated with agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged (13,000 ×g, 10 min) to remove insoluble material. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with 2 μg of antibody for 3 h and then with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After overnight incubation (4 °C), beads were washed twice with dilution buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0; 140 mm NaCl; 0.1% Triton X-100; 0.1% BSA; 0.025% NaN3) and once with TSA solution (10 mm Tris-HCl; 140 mm NaCl; 0.025% NaN3). For PLCβ2 coprecipitation with Gβ antibody anti-Gβ (2 μg) was mixed with protein G-Sepharose (50 μl) for 3 h and then washed (2 times) with IP buffer before mixing with cell lysates. Immunocomplexes were denatured by boiling in gel loading buffer. Kinase assays were performed using an MAPK assay kit from New England Biolabs according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, activated ERK was precipitated from cell lysates using anti-phospho-ERK antibody, and precipitates were incubated with a specific substrate, Elk-1, and ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding boiling gel loading buffer. ERK activity was detected by immunoblotting the products of the kinase reaction with anti-phospho-Elk antibody. Raf kinase assay was performed using the c-Raf1 immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, Raf was precipitated and incubated with GST-MEK and GST-ERK1 in [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing buffer. ERK1 was recovered on phosphocellulose paper, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured with a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). After various treatments, A431 cells were lysed, and Src was precipitated under non-denaturing conditions with anti-Src polyclonal antibody (SRC2; 3 μg/sample). Precipitates were washed (1 time) with lysis buffer and then (3 times) with 0.5m LiCl, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 time in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, then resuspended and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 15 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mm MgCl2; 25 μm ATP; 1 μg/sample Src substrate; 5 μCi of [32P]ATP). The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 2× gel loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide, and incorporated radioactivity was quantitated with a Storm 940 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Ras activity was assessed using Raf-1 RBD (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, beads conjugated to the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf were used to precipitate GTP-bound Ras. The amount of precipitated Ras was determined by Western blotting, with a pan antibody that recognizes all human isoforms of Ras. Translocation of PKC was determined as described previously (7Liu B. Khan W.A. Hannun Y.A. Timar J. Taylor D.J. Lundy S.K. Butovich I. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9323-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Gopalakrishina R. Barsky S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Following 12(S)-HETE treatment, cells were rinsed (twice) with cold PBS, scraped off, and homogenized with 26-gauge needle in 2 ml of buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6; 1 mm EGTA; aprotinin (5 μg/ml); leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and 1 mm PMSF). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation (100,000 ×g; 1 h, 4 °C). The membrane fraction was rinsed (twice) with buffer A and resuspended in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were applied to a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 0.2 mm PMSF; 0.15 mm pepstatin A). PKC was eluted with 2 ml of buffer B containing 120 mm NaCl. Samples were concentrated using a Centricon (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and the protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). PKC activity was inhibited using two approaches. First, cells were treated with PKC inhibitor as described above. Second, PKC protein level in A431 cells was down-regulated with chronic PMA treatment (22 h, 100 nm) in serum-free media (24Liu B. Timar J. Howlett J. Diglio C.A. Honn K.V. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester-containing media were removed 1 h prior to initiating treatment with various drugs, and cells were washed (twice) with serum-free DMEM. 2 × 105 cells were plated per well of 24-well plates (Corning Glass), cultured for 1 day under regular growth conditions, and then serum-starved overnight. Prior to performing the binding assay, cell count/well was determined, and media were changed to 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 4 °C cold DMEM, and plates were placed at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding assay was initiated by adding [3H]12(S)-HETE with or without 1000× concentration of cold 12(S)-HETE or other eicosanoids in DMEM/HEPES at final volume of 400 μl. The plates were kept under constant and gentle swirling at 4 °C for the times indicated in the text. Following the incubation period 50% of the binding media was set aside and the rest decanted, and plates were washed 4 times with PBS, and cells were solubilized with 300 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature. Cell lysates or 200 μl of the binding media were mixed with Ultima Gold scintillation liquid (Packard Instrument Co.), and radioactivity was measured with a Packard 1900TR scintillation counter. Each sample was counted for 20 min to accumulate at least 500 counts. Data points under 3 nm [3H]12(S)-HETE concentration represent the mean of triplicate determinations, and at higher concentrations duplicates were used. 3 × 106 cells were incubated similar to binding assay with 3 nm[3H]12(S)-HETE in the presence or absence of 300 nm (100 times) cold 12(S)-HETE for 30 min and rinsed 4 times with PBS; cells were scraped off and homogenized with brief sonication in 2 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 1 mm EGTA; aprotinin (5 μg/ml); leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and 1 mm PMSF). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation (100,000 × g; 1 h, 4 °C). The membrane fraction was rinsed (4 times) with buffer A and solubilized with sonication in 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1). Lipids dissolved in the chloroform layer were loaded on Whatman silica gel 60A thin layer chromatography plates and developed with ethyl acetate:methyl chloride:glacial acetic acid (5:5:1). Plates were dried, and position of lipids was determined following treatment with iodine vapor. Ten identical areas of each lane were scraped into scintillation vials, and Ultima Gold scintillation fluid added and radioactivity measured with a Packard 1900TR scintillation counter. Cells (2.5 × 106) were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes in DMEM until 90% confluent and serum-starved (18 h) prior to experimental use. Cells were washed with PBS (3 times) and then either treated with BHPP at different concentrations (25, 50, 100 μm) for 24 h or pretreated with 12(S)-HETE at 1 μm for 5 h. Equal amounts of ethanol were used as a vehicle control. Subsequently, cells were harvested with a rubber policeman, and fragmented DNA was extracted with 200 μl of the lysis buffer (50 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min. The resultant supernatants were transferred to a clean set of Eppendorf tubes, and pellets were dissolved in 200 μl of lysis buffer and extracted for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged again, and the resultant supernatants were combined with previous supernatants. Subsequently, SDS and DNase-free RNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added to the pooled supernatants to the final concentration of 0.1% and 5 mg/ml, respectively, and samples were incubated at 56 °C for 2 h. At the end of RNase treatment, proteinase K (2.5 ml/ml) was added, and samples were further incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were extracted once with alkaline phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and DNA precipitated with 0.3 m NaAc, pH 5.2. DNA from equal number of cells or equal amounts of DNA (20 μg) were run on a 1.2% agarose gel, and the DNA ladder formation was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Following 12(S)-HETE treatment both ERK1 and -2 were transiently activated, as determined by Western blot analyses with an antibody to the activated forms of ERK1/2. A single peak of activation (10-fold) was observed 10 min after stimulation with 12(S)-HETE (300 nm) (Fig. 1 A). The increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected as early as 2 min, returned to basal level 30 min after stimulation, and was concentration-dependent in the 0–500 nm 12(S)-HETE range (Fig. 1 B). These results were confirmed with an in vitro kinase assay where an increase in phosphorylation of a MAPK-specific substrate, i.e. Elk, paralleled the increase in ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether 12(S)-HETE is unique or whether other eicosanoids also activate ERK1/2 in A431 cells in similar dose and time ranges, cells were treated with 5(S)-HETE, 11(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE (300 nm, 10 min). Anti-phospho-ERK probed Western blots revealed (Fig. 1 C) that under these conditions 12(S)-HETE is the most potent activator of ERK1/2, whereas 11(S)-HETE was 50% less potent. 5- and 15(S)-HETE stimulated ERK1/2 only to the extent of 5–15% of 12(S)-HETE, respectively. These results indicate that multiple HETEs may activate ERK1/2 in A431 cells, but 12(S)-HETE is the most potent, suggesting that this function is mediated by a specific response. To investigate whether activation of ERK kinase by 12(S)-HETE was restricted to the A431 cell line, we tested human melanoma (WM983B and HT168), human prostate carcinoma (DU145), mouse melanoma (B16a), mouse lung carcinoma (3LL), endothelial (RVECT and HUVEC) as well as Chinese hamster ovary and African green monkey kidney (COS-1) cell lines. In these cell lines, with the exception of HT168, Chinese hamster ovary, and COS-1 cells, 12(S)-HETE also increased ERK1/2 activity within 10 min of treatment (data not shown). These findings indicate that 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK1/2 is not unique to A431 cells, but neither is it a ubiquitous phenomenon. Other investigators (25Bleich D. Chen S. Wen Y. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 230: 448-3451Google Scholar) have reported that 12(S)-HETE increases the activity of another MAPK, i.e. c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In contrast, by using A431 cells, we found no evidence that either p38 or JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases were stimulated by this lipid mediator in a similar time and dose range as observed for ERK (data not shown). The activity of ERK can be modulated at several levels in the evolutionarily conserved ERK cassette, i.e. either by enhancing GTP loading of Ras, by phosphorylation of Raf and MEK (26Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-300082Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), or by binding non-enzymatic scaffold proteins (27Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Ebling S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Some studies also suggest MEK-independent mechanisms for ERK activation, such as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-dependent or conventional PKC-dependent pathways (28Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether MEK, the immediate upstream dual specificity kinase to ERK, was involved in 12(S)-HETE-stimulated ERK1/2 activity. 12(S)-HETE increased (8-fold) the activity of MEK in a dose-dependent manner in the 0–600 nm range (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 dose dependently abolished MAPK activation by 12(S)-HETE (Fig. 2 B), thus ruling out the possibility that 12(S)-HETE modulates ERK activity by a MEK-independent mechanism. Since MEK is a convergence point for several signaling pathways, we next tested for the involvement of Raf1 in 12(S)-HETE signaling. By utilizing an in vitrokinase assay, we observed that Raf kinase activity was increased (3-fold) 5 min after cells were treated with 300 nm12(S)-HETE (Fig. 3) and that this activation was decreased (75%) in cells pretreated with the PKC inhibitor, Go6976 (at 10× IC50 dose (15Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)). These data suggest that PKC participates in 12(S)-HETE activation of Raf1. The inhibition of 12(S)-HETE-stimulated Raf activity by Go6976 led us to examine the extent to which conventional PKCs were involved in the observed ERK1/2 stimulation. Treatment with 12(S)-HETE induced a dose-dependent translocation (5-fold at 600 nm) of PKCα from the cytosol to the membrane fraction accompanied by increased phosphorylation (5-fold at 300 nm) (Fig. 4, A and B). Enzyme activity in the subcellular fractions was confirmed with a kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate for immunoprecipitated PKC (data not shown). Phosphorylation of PKCα reached a maximum at approximately 2.5 min (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, the time course of PKC activation by 12(S)-HETE, in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, is similar to that observed in B16a murine melanoma cells (7Liu B. Khan W.A. Hannun Y.A. Timar J. Taylor D.J. Lundy S.K. Butovich I. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9323-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Western blotting of A431 cells revealed that they express seven isoforms of PKC, i.e. α, δ, ε, ζ, λ, μ, and ι (Fig. 5 A). Chronic exposure to phorbol esters leads to degradation of the activated PKC species. In A431 cells PKC α, δ, and ε but not PKC ζ, μ, λ, and ι were eliminated by chronic phorbol ester exposure. To determine whether 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK1/2 was mediated by PKC, we tested whether PKC depletion could block ERK1/2 activation. Depletion of PKC resulted in a partial (40%) inhibition of 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, this treatment completely abolished ERK1/2 activation by PMA, a direct and potent activator of PKC (Fig. 5 B). Chronic exposure to another, non-related PKC activator, bryostatin, also resulted in a partial inhibition of 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK1/2 (data not shown). Chemical inhibition of conventional PKC isoforms by Go6976 partially (60%) reduced 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). Even at 50 times the IC50 concentration, Go6976 failed to completely block the 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK1/2. Together, these results suggest that the conventional PKC pathways are important but are not the exclusive mechanism for 12(S)-HETE activation of ERK. Activation of PKCα by 12(S)-HETE in B16a murine melanoma cells can be blocked by either PLC inhibitors or by an inhibitor of Gi proteins,i.e. pertussis toxin (7Liu B. Khan W.A. Hannun Y.A. Timar J. Taylor D.J. Lundy S.K. Butovich I. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9323-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PLCβ family of isoforms are activated by G proteins (29Katan M. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 121-199Google Scholar), and stimulation of PLCβ2 is sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment (30Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested for a role for this PLC isoform in 12(S)-HETE signaling. PLCβ2 co-immunoprecipitated with the Gβ subunit after a stimulus with exogenous ATP, but not after 12(S)-HETE, or in non-stimulated cell lysates (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that this PLC isoform is not involved in 12(S)-HETE signaling events. Members of the PLCγ family were thought to be activated by receptors with inherent tyrosine kinase activity (29Katan M. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 121-199Google Scholar). However, recent publications demonstrate that angiotensin II (31Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol.

Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a common form of reaction oxygen species, triggers a series of intracellular events, including actin cytoskeletal reorganization, cytoplasm shrinkage, membrane blebbing and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of H2O2 on endothelial cells is dramatically enhanced when a survival pathway involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase is blocked by PD098059. In contrast, the injury of endothelial cells mediated by H2O2 is inhibited by PP2, a selective specific inhibitor for protein-tyrosine kinase Src. Cortactin, a filamentous actin (F-actin)-associated protein, becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine residues upon stimulation by H2O2 in a manner dependent on the activity of Src. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is correlated with the formation of membrane blebs. Overexpression of wild-type cortactin tagged with green fluorescent protein in endothelial cells via a retroviral vector substantiates the H2O2-induced morphological changes, whereas overexpression of a green fluorescent protein-cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation renders endothelial cells resistant to H2O2. The functional role of cortactin in H2O2-mediated shape changes was also evaluated in NIH 3T3 cells. Stable 3T3 transfectants expressing wild-type cortactin in the presence of either H2O2/PD098059 or H2O2alone at 200 μm exhibited a dramatic shape change characterized by rounding up or aggregation. However, the similar changes were not detected with cells overexpressing a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation.

Numerous studies have shown that exposure to local reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes for the injury of endothelial cells. Reactive oxygen species can be derived from the dismutation of superoxide anion or from the products of activated neutrophils or macrophages that accumulate in the blood vessel wall as a consequence of ischemia and reperfusion injury (1Hull D.S. Green K. Thomas L. Alderman N. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 1246-1253PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schror K. Thiemermann C. Ney P. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

Invest. 1978; 61: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Cancer cells also produce reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may contribute to the damage of endothelium during the metastatic process (4Orr F.W. Wang H.H. Lafrenie R.M. Scherbarth S. Nance D.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to be one of the common forms of reactive oxygen species and can easily penetrate the plasma membrane and affect neighboring cells as well as H2O2-producing cells (5Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). One of the prominent events within endothelial cells upon exposure to H2O2 is the formation of plasma membrane blebs (6Hinshaw D.B. Sklar L.A. Bohl B. Schraufstatter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Rossi M.W. Spragg R.G. Cochrane C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 454-464PubMed Google Scholar). The surface blebbing of endothelial cells promotes platelets to adhere to the injured endothelium as well as leukocytes to block capillary lumens, which would lead ultimately to cardiac, brain, lung, kidney, and liver failure. Although the mechanism of the formation of membrane blebs is not fully understood, it appears to be intimately associated with the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that are mediated by cytoskeleton binding or cross-linking proteins. For example, cells deficient in an actin filament cross-linking protein, ABP-280, show prolonged blebbing (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Similarly, redistribution of filamin, another F-actin cross-linking protein, is one of the early events in H2O2-mediated endothelial cell injury (8Hastie L.E. Patton W.F. Hechtman H.B. Shepro D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).H2O2 triggers signal transduction within cells in a similar manner as growth factors (9Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Pott M.

Exposure to H2O2 induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a various proteins, including Src- and Syk-related non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (11Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Al Hassani M. Vepa S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and enhances the kinase activity of Src in endothelial cells (12Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The implication of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-mediated signal transduction is further strengthened by the findings that non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein and herbimycin A can abolish the response of cells to H2O2 (13Carbajal J.M. Schaeffer Jr., R.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 249: 461-466Google Scholar, 14Barchowsky A. Munro S.R. Morana S.J. Vincenti M.P. Treadwell M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L829-L836PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to protein-tyrosine kinases, H2O2 also induces the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk),1 a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Induction of Erk may represent a surviving pathway because selective inhibition of Erk by PD098059, can increase apoptosis induced by H2O2 (9Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Pott M. Beyerle A. Squillace K.

Haudenschild C.C. Ni Y. Smith E. Huang C. Blood. 1997; 89: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a prominent substrate of protein-tyrosine kinase Src in vivo and in vitro(18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of cortactin is featured by six and a half tandem repeats of a unique 37-amino acid sequence and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Between the repeat and the SH3 domain, there is an α-helical structure followed by a proline-rich region. Our previous studies have determined that Src targets cortactin primarily at three residues (Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482) between the proline-rich and the SH3 domain (20Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In vitro, cortactin binds to and cross-links F-actin into meshworks (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin can be dramatically reduced upon tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The role of Src in the function of cortactin was also appreciated during the study of Src-deficient (Src−/−) cells in which cortactin fails to respond to FGF-1 for tyrosine phosphorylation and shows less association with polarized lamellipodia. Concomitant with low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, Src−/− cells are less motile compared with normal cells and resistant to FGF-1-mediated shape changes (19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin plays an important role in the dynamic change of the actin cytoskeleton induced by growth factors. In the study presented here, we examined the role of cortactin and Src in the injury of endothelial cells induced by H2O2. We found that H2O2 induces a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of human endothelial cortactin in a manner dependent on the activity of Src. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type cortactin enhances the response of endothelial cells to H2O2, whereas overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation significantly reduces the H2O2-mediated injury of endothelial cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that the signal pathway involving Src and cortactin is implicated in the injury of endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for H2O2-induced shape changes in human endothelial cells. First, either H2O2 alone at high concentrations (more than 1.6 mm) or H2O2 at a low concentrations (100 μm) in the presence of PD098059, a selective inhibitor for Erk, induces a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin appears to be one of the major events induced by H2O2, as indicated by analyzing total phosphotyrosyl proteins (data not shown). Second, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is correlated with the shape changes induced by H2O2. The conditions that induce high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin are also able to induce shape changes of endothelial cells. These conditions include high concentrations of H2O2, H2O2 plus PD098059, and H2O2 plus vanadate. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation induced by H2O2 is time-dependent and plateaus at 45 min (Fig. 2 C). This kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is correlated with shape changes induced by H2O2 (data not shown). Third, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is dependent upon the activity of Src. Treatment of cells with a selective Src inhibitor PP2 can abrogate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (data not shown) as well as the shape changes induced by H2O2(Fig. 3). Finally, overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation can significantly inhibit shape changes induced by H2O2 either in endothelial cells or in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 6 and7).Cortactin, a prominent substrate of Src, is a potent filament actin-binding protein. In vitro, cortactin also exhibits a potent activity to cross-link actin filaments into a filamentous meshwork (21Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this F-actin cross-linking activity can be down regulated upon tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin likely constitutes an important mechanism by which Src or its-related protein-tyrosine kinases regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in cell shape changes, cells such as Src−/− cells in which cortactin is deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation are more resistant to shape changes induced by extracellular stimuli compared with cells with elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, non-phosphorylated cortactin tend to accumulate within the cytoplasm. Thus, the cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation likely acts as a dominant negative fashion (20Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Conversely, cells overexpressing wild-type cortactin increase susceptibility to H2O2(Figs. 6 and 7).Upon exposure to H2O2, many endothelial cells develop extensive membrane blebs. Similar morphological changes were also observed in cells expressing high levels of cortactin. For example, tumor cells with high levels of cortactin expression due to gene amplification often develop large spherical membrane protrusions. 2E. Schuuring, personal communication. Furthermore, transient transfection of GFP-wt-cortactin, which led to expression of extreme high levels of expression, can also result in apoptosis-like membrane blebbing. 3X. Zhan, unpublished result. Membrane blebbing may involve a mechanism similar to the formation of membrane protrusions, lamellipodia, and filopodia (29Hagmann J. Burger M.M. Dagan D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In normal cells, cortactin is mainly associated with cell cortical structures, including lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and punctate-like protrusions. Within these structures, cortactin co-localizes with F-actin (20Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 30Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We found that H2O2-induced blebs are rich in cortactin (Fig. 3), suggesting that locally concentrated cortactin may be implicated in the formation of membrane blebs. The primary driving force to form membrane protrusions is the actin polymerization occurring underneath the plasma membrane (31Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). One possibility is that cortactin could be directly implicated in actin polymerization. Evidence to support this possibility is our recent finding that cortactin is a potent activator of Arp2/3, a protein complex that is responsible for the nucleation of actin polymerization. 4T. Uruno, J. Liu, B. Zhang, X. Fan, and X. Zhan, personal communication. Cortactin may also contribute to membrane blebbing through its regulation of F-actin cross-linking. It has been postulated that the flow of the cortical actin gel is a determining factor in the formation of membrane blebs (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The rate of flow of the actin gel is inversely regulated by the activity of F-actin cross-linking proteins. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin, which has a significant lower F-actin cross-linking activity than non-phosphorylated cortactin (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), would increase the flow of the actin gel and eventually favor a tuned balance toward the formation of membrane blebs. Indeed, human melanoma cell lines deficient in an actin filament cross-linking protein, ABP-280, show prolonged and extensive membrane blebbing (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The effect of H2O2 on the shape changes in endothelial cells can be dramatically enhanced by PD098059, a chemical that specifically inhibits the activity of Erk 1/2. However, the role of activation of Erk in the oxidant-mediated injury of endothelial cells is still not clear. Because the activation of Erk is implicated in the signal pathways of growth factors, Erk may represent a survival factor for cells to antagonize the effect of H2O2 (15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Although our data appear to be consistent with this view, we did not find an intimate correlation of the activity of Erk either with phosphorylation of cortactin nor with shape changes. Exposure to H2O2 at high concentrations or H2O2 at low concentrations in the presence of vanadate can increase tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and shape changes as well (Fig.4). 5Y. Li, unpublished data. These treatments also induce significant increase in the activity of Erk (Fig. 4). Thus, inhibition of Erk by PD098059 is not necessary either for the H2O2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin or for cell shape changes. It appears that inhibition of Erk only affects tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin when cells expose to low concentrations of H2O2. One explanation is that inhibition of Erk may potentiate the activation of Src related kinases by H2O2. It has been shown that extracellular H2O2 can activate the intracellular Ras pathway (32Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recent studies also demonstrated that Ras can further activate both Src via Ral and Erk via Raf independently (16Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that inhibition of the activation of Erk pathway would favor the pathway by which Ras/Ral activates Src and leads to apparent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin.In summary, the data presented in this study demonstrate an important role of Src and cortactin in H2O2-induced shape changes of endothelial cells. The future studies using small antagonists for cortactin may reveal a novel approach to target specifically at the actin cytoskeleton and protect endothelium from reactive oxygen species. The injury of endothelial cells underling the lumen of blood vessels contributes significantly to the development of atherosclerosis and hypertension. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to local reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes for the injury of endothelial cells. Reactive oxygen species can be derived from the dismutation of superoxide anion or from the products of activated neutrophils or macrophages that accumulate in the blood vessel wall as a consequence of ischemia and reperfusion injury (1Hull D.S. Green K. Thomas L. Alderman N. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 1246-1253PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schror K. Thiemermann C. Ney P. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1988; 338: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Sacks T. Moldow C.F. Craddock P.R. Bowers T.K. Jacob H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Cancer cells also produce reactive oxygen species in vivo, which may contribute to the damage of endothelium during the metastatic process (4Orr F.W. Wang H.H. Lafrenie R.M. Scherbarth S. Nance D.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to be one of the common forms of reactive oxygen species and can easily penetrate the plasma membrane and affect neighboring cells as well as H2O2-producing cells (5Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). One of the prominent events within endothelial cells upon exposure to H2O2 is the formation of plasma membrane blebs (6Hinshaw D.B. Sklar L.A. Bohl B. Schraufstatter I.U. Hyslop P.A. Rossi M.W. Spragg R.G. Cochrane C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 454-464PubMed Google Scholar). The surface blebbing of endothelial cells promotes platelets to adhere to the injured endothelium as well as leukocytes to block capillary lumens, which would lead ultimately to cardiac, brain, lung, kidney, and liver failure. Although the mechanism of the formation of membrane blebs is not fully understood, it appears to be intimately associated with the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that are mediated by cytoskeleton binding or cross-linking proteins. For example, cells deficient in an actin filament cross-linking protein, ABP-280, show prolonged blebbing (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Similarly, redistribution of filamin, another F-actin cross-linking protein, is one of the early events in H2O2-mediated endothelial cell injury (8Hastie L.E. Patton W.F. Hechtman H.B. Shepro D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). H2O2 triggers signal transduction within cells in a similar manner as growth factors (9Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Pott M. Beyerle A. Squillace K. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest Dermatol. 1998; 110: 966-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Berk B.C. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Exposure to H2O2 induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a various proteins, including Src- and Syk-related non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (11Natarajan V. Scribner W.M. Al Hassani M. Vepa S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and enhances the kinase activity of Src in endothelial cells (12Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The implication of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-mediated signal transduction is further strengthened by the findings that non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein and herbimycin A can abolish the response of cells to H2O2 (13Carbajal J.M. Schaeffer Jr., R.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 249: 461-466Google Scholar, 14Barchowsky A. Munro S.R. Morana S.J. Vincenti M.P. Treadwell M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L829-L836PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to protein-tyrosine kinases, H2O2 also induces the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk),1 a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Induction of Erk may represent a surviving pathway because selective inhibition of Erk by PD098059, can increase apoptosis induced by H2O2 (9Peus D. Vasa R.A. Meves A. Pott M. Beyerle A. Squillace K. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest Dermatol. 1998; 110: 966-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Cortactin, a cortical actin-associated protein that is widely expressed in most adherent cells (17Zhan X. Haudenschild C.C. Ni Y. Smith E. Huang C. Blood. 1997; 89: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a prominent substrate of protein-tyrosine kinase Src in vivo and in vitro(18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of cortactin is featured by six and a half tandem repeats of a unique 37-amino acid sequence and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Between the repeat and the SH3 domain, there is an α-helical structure followed by a proline-rich region. Our previous studies have determined that Src targets cortactin primarily at three residues (Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482) between the proline-rich and the SH3 domain (20Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In vitro, cortactin binds to and cross-links F-actin into meshworks (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin can be dramatically reduced upon tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The role of Src in the function of cortactin was also appreciated during the study of Src-deficient (Src−/−) cells in which cortactin fails to respond to FGF-1 for tyrosine phosphorylation and shows less association with polarized lamellipodia. Concomitant with low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, Src−/− cells are less motile compared with normal cells and resistant to FGF-1-mediated shape changes (19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin plays an important role in the dynamic change of the actin cytoskeleton induced by growth factors. In the study presented here, we examined the role of cortactin and Src in the injury of endothelial cells induced by H2O2. We found that H2O2 induces a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of human endothelial cortactin in a manner dependent on the activity of Src. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type cortactin enhances the response of endothelial cells to H2O2, whereas overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation significantly reduces the H2O2-mediated injury of endothelial cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that the signal pathway involving Src and cortactin is implicated in the injury of endothelial cells. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for H2O2-induced shape changes in human endothelial cells. First, either H2O2 alone at high concentrations (more than 1.6 mm) or H2O2 at a low concentrations (100 μm) in the presence of PD098059, a selective inhibitor for Erk, induces a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin appears to be one of the major events induced by H2O2, as indicated by analyzing total phosphotyrosyl proteins (data not shown). Second, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is correlated with the shape changes induced by H2O2. The conditions that induce high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin are also able to induce shape changes of endothelial cells. These conditions include high concentrations of H2O2, H2O2 plus PD098059, and H2O2 plus vanadate. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation induced by H2O2 is time-dependent and plateaus at 45 min (Fig. 2 C). This kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is correlated with shape changes induced by H2O2 (data not shown). Third, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is dependent upon the activity of Src. Treatment of cells with a selective Src inhibitor PP2 can abrogate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (data not shown) as well as the shape changes induced by H2O2(Fig. 3). Finally, overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation can significantly inhibit shape changes induced by H2O2 either in endothelial cells or in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 6 and7).Cortactin, a prominent substrate of Src, is a potent filament actin-binding protein. In vitro, cortactin also exhibits a potent activity to cross-link actin filaments into a filamentous meshwork (21Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this F-actin cross-linking activity can be down regulated upon tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin likely constitutes an important mechanism by which Src or its-related protein-tyrosine kinases regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in cell shape changes, cells such as Src−/− cells in which cortactin is deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation are more resistant to shape changes induced by extracellular stimuli compared with cells with elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, non-phosphorylated cortactin tend to accumulate within the cytoplasm. Thus, the cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation likely acts as a dominant negative fashion (20Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Conversely, cells overexpressing wild-type cortactin increase susceptibility to H2O2(Figs. 6 and 7).Upon exposure to H2O2, many endothelial cells develop extensive membrane blebs. Similar morphological changes were also observed in cells expressing high levels of cortactin. For example, tumor cells with high levels of cortactin expression due to gene amplification often develop large spherical membrane protrusions. 2E. Schuuring, personal communication. Furthermore, transient transfection of GFP-wt-cortactin, which led to expression of extreme high levels of expression, can also result in apoptosis-like membrane blebbing. 3X. Zhan, unpublished result. Membrane blebbing may involve a mechanism similar to the formation of membrane protrusions, lamellipodia, and filopodia (29Hagmann J. Burger M.M. Dagan D. J. Cell.

We found that H2O2-induced blebs are rich in cortactin (Fig. 3), suggesting that locally concentrated cortactin may be implicated in the formation of membrane blebs. The primary driving force to form membrane protrusions is the actin polymerization occurring underneath the plasma membrane (31Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). One possibility is that cortactin could be directly implicated in actin polymerization. Evidence to support this possibility is our recent finding that cortactin is a potent activator of Arp2/3, a protein complex that is responsible for the nucleation of actin polymerization. 4T. Uruno, J. Liu, B. Zhang, X. Fan, and X. Zhan, personal communication. Cortactin may also contribute to membrane blebbing through its regulation of F-actin cross-linking. It has been postulated that the flow of the cortical actin gel is a determining factor in the formation of membrane blebs (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The rate of flow of the actin gel is inversely regulated by the activity of F-actin cross-linking proteins. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin, which has a significant lower F-actin cross-linking activity than non-phosphorylated cortactin (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), would increase the flow of the actin gel and eventually favor a tuned balance toward the formation of membrane blebs. Indeed, human melanoma cell lines deficient in an actin filament cross-linking protein, ABP-280, show prolonged and extensive membrane blebbing (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The effect of H2O2 on the shape changes in endothelial cells can be dramatically enhanced by PD098059, a chemical that specifically inhibits the activity of Erk 1/2. However, the role of activation of Erk in the oxidant-mediated injury of endothelial cells is still not clear. Because the activation of Erk is implicated in the signal pathways of growth factors, Erk may represent a survival factor for cells to antagonize the effect of H2O2 (15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Although our data appear to be consistent with this view, we did not find an intimate correlation of the activity of Erk either with phosphorylation of cortactin nor with shape changes. Exposure to H2O2 at high concentrations or H2O2 at low concentrations in the presence of vanadate can increase tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and shape changes as well (Fig.4). 5Y. Li, unpublished data. These treatments also induce significant increase in the activity of Erk (Fig. 4). Thus, inhibition of Erk by PD098059 is not necessary either for the H2O2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin or for cell shape changes. It appears that inhibition of Erk only affects tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin when cells expose to low concentrations of H2O2. One explanation is that inhibition of Erk may potentiate the activation of Src related kinases by H2O2. It has been shown that extracellular H2O2 can activate the intracellular Ras pathway (32Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recent studies also demonstrated that Ras can further activate both Src via Ral and Erk via Raf independently (16Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that inhibition of the activation of Erk pathway would favor the pathway by which Ras/Ral activates Src and leads to apparent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin.In summary, the data presented in this study demonstrate an important role of Src and cortactin in H2O2-induced shape changes of endothelial cells. The future studies using small antagonists for cortactin may reveal a novel approach to target specifically at the actin cytoskeleton and protect endothelium from reactive oxygen species.

We found that H2O2-induced blebs are rich in cortactin (Fig. 3), suggesting that locally concentrated cortactin may be implicated in the formation of membrane blebs. The primary driving force to form membrane protrusions is the actin polymerization occurring underneath the plasma membrane (31Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). One possibility is that cortactin could be directly implicated in actin polymerization. Evidence to support this possibility is our recent finding that cortactin is a potent activator of Arp2/3, a protein complex that is responsible for the nucleation of actin polymerization. 4T. Uruno, J. Liu, B. Zhang, X. Fan, and X. Zhan, personal communication. Cortactin may also contribute to membrane blebbing through its regulation of F-actin cross-linking. It has been postulated that the flow of the cortical actin gel is a determining factor in the formation of membrane blebs (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The rate of flow of the actin gel is inversely regulated by the activity of F-actin cross-linking proteins. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin, which has a significant lower F-actin cross-linking activity than non-phosphorylated cortactin (18Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), would increase the flow of the actin gel and eventually favor a tuned balance toward the formation of membrane blebs. Indeed, human melanoma cell lines deficient in an actin filament cross-linking protein, ABP-280, show prolonged and extensive membrane blebbing (7Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The effect of H2O2 on the shape changes in endothelial cells can be dramatically enhanced by PD098059, a chemical that specifically inhibits the activity of Erk 1/2. However, the role of activation of Erk in the oxidant-mediated injury of endothelial cells is still not clear. Because the activation of Erk is implicated in the signal pathways of growth factors, Erk may represent a survival factor for cells to antagonize the effect of H2O2 (15Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Although our data appear to be consistent with this view, we did not find an intimate correlation of the activity of Erk either with phosphorylation of cortactin nor with shape changes. Exposure to H2O2 at high concentrations or H2O2 at low concentrations in the presence of vanadate can increase tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and shape changes as well (Fig.4). 5Y. Li, unpublished data. These treatments also induce significant increase in the activity of Erk (Fig. 4). Thus, inhibition of Erk by PD098059 is not necessary either for the H2O2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin or for cell shape changes. It appears that inhibition of Erk only affects tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin when cells expose to low concentrations of H2O2. One explanation is that inhibition of Erk may potentiate the activation of Src related kinases by H2O2. It has been shown that extracellular H2O2 can activate the intracellular Ras pathway (32Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recent studies also demonstrated that Ras can further activate both Src via Ral and Erk via Raf independently (16Goi T. Shipitsin M. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Klinz S.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that inhibition of the activation of Erk pathway would favor the pathway by which Ras/Ral activates Src and leads to apparent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. In summary, the data presented in this study demonstrate an important role of Src and cortactin in H2O2-induced shape changes of endothelial cells. The future studies using small antagonists for cortactin may reveal a novel approach to target specifically at the actin cytoskeleton and protect endothelium from reactive oxygen species.

https://openalex.org/W2080210935,"Many hormones and sensory stimuli signal through a superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors to activate heterotrimeric G proteins. How the seven transmembrane segments of the receptors (a molecular architecture of bundled α-helices conserved from yeast to man) work as “on/off” switches remains unknown. Previously, we used random saturation mutagenesis coupled with a genetic selection in yeast to determine the relative importance of amino acids in four of the seven transmembrane segments of the human C5a receptor (Baranski, T. J., Herzmark, P., Lichtarge, O., Gerber, B. O., Trueheart, J., Meng, E. C., Iiri, T., Sheikh, S. P., and Bourne, H. R. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15757–15765). In this study, we evaluate helices I, II, and IV, thereby furnishing a complete mutational map of the seven transmembrane helices of the human C5a receptor. Our analysis identified 19 amino acid positions resistant to non-conservative substitutions. When combined with the 25 essential residues previously identified in helices III and V–VII, they delineate two distinct components of the receptor switch: a ligand-binding surface at or near the extracellular surface of the helix bundle and a core cluster in the cytoplasmic half of the bundle. In addition, we found critical amino acids in the first and second helices that are predicted to face the lipid membrane. These residues form an extended surface that might mediate interactions with lipids and other membrane proteins or function as an oligomerization domain with other receptors.

These receptors then catalyze ligand-dependent exchange of GTP for GDP on the α-subunit of the heterotrimer, causing dissociation of α·GTP from the βγ-dimer; α·GTP and free βγ subsequently activate effector enzymes and ion channels (1Clapham D.E.

More than 1000 G protein-coupled receptors of mammals share with their counterparts in yeast and plants a conserved three-dimensional architecture, comprising seven α-helices in a transmembrane bundle (3Gether U.

The switch mechanism is also conserved, as indicated by the abilities of mammalian receptors to activate G protein trimers in yeast (7Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K.

The switch clearly resides in the seven-helix bundle: swapping of extra- or intracellular loops preserves the ability of ligands to activate G proteins while transferring specificity of ligand binding or G protein activation, respectively, from one receptor to another (10Cotecchia S.

Our understanding of receptor mechanisms remains limited by a lack of precise structural information and the general difficulties of characterizing integral membrane proteins. A low-resolution (5 Å) electron cryomicroscopic structure of rhodopsin (14Krebs A. Villa C. Edwards P.C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the retinal light receptor, reveals relative positions and tilts of seven transmembrane helices in the plane of the membrane. Based on many mutations, the rhodopsin structure, and an analysis of the primary structures of >500 rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors, Baldwin et al.(15Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) constructed an α-carbon template of the helix bundle, hereafter termed the Baldwin model. In this model, transmembrane helices I–VII bundle together in clockwise order as viewed from the cytoplasm. The probable arrangement of helices and the positions of specific amino acids in the model are inferred from patterns of conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in many receptors. The Baldwin model specifies which helix corresponds to which density in the electron projection map, approximate orientations of cognate amino acids around the helical axes, and the cytoplasmic and extracellular limits of each transmembrane sequence (16Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Random saturation mutagenesis provides a comprehensive method to explore the structural characteristics of protein segments and has recently been used to elucidate the helical orientations of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (17Minor Jr., D.L. Masseling S.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1999; 96: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This comprehensive approach determines the relative importance of side chains in each α-helix by identifying those that cannot be altered in mutant receptors selected for maintenance of function. We undertook a systematic genetic analysis of a single G protein-coupled receptor, the human C5a receptor, with the goal of identifying functionally important residues and sites of helix/helix interactions that relay the ligand signal to G protein activation. The human chemoattractant C5a receptor, a member of the rhodopsin family, couples to Gαi and Gα16. The C5a ligand, a 74-amino acid glycoprotein produced as a cleavage product in the complement cascade, mediates leukocyte chemotaxis, vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction (18Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Previously, we selected functional C5a receptors after random saturation mutagenesis of four transmembrane helices (III and V–VII) (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In our current study, we examine the remaining three transmembrane segments (I, II, and IV) of the human C5a receptor. We anticipated that these helices would demonstrate the same characteristics as the previously studied four helices: essential amino acids would be located on surfaces of helices that face other helices, and these critical residues would cluster at either the extracellular side of the receptor or at the core of the helix bundle. The results of scanning helices I and IV conform to these expectations; however, helix II possesses essential amino acids that map to a surface that is predicted to be in contact with the surrounding lipid. In addition, the functional receptors mutated in helix I all share a hydrophobic patch that faces the lipid membrane and, with helix II, forms an extended hydrophobic surface. These helix I and II residues facing the lipid bilayer might function as an interaction domain with other membrane molecules or as an oligomerization domain with other receptors. The results of this study, combined with our previous work (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), provide the first complete mutational map of the transmembrane segments of a G protein-coupled receptor and will serve as a useful model for further structure/function studies. To construct mutagenized C5a receptors, we engineered restriction endonuclease sites (which did not alter the amino acid sequence) into the C5a receptor gene at the approximate boundaries of the cDNA encoding helices I (MluI and BstEII, 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively), II (NdeI, 5′-end), and IV (BsrGI, 3′-end). Endogenous restriction endonuclease sites bound the cDNA encoding helices II (BsrGI, 3′-end) and IV (SfiI, 5′-end); however, for the helix IV library, the BsrGI site at the 3′-end of the second encoded helix and a second SfiI site in the 3′-untranslated region of the C5a receptor gene were removed. ANcoI site at the start methionine introduced aspartic acid in place of asparagine at position 2. To ensure efficient library construction and to eliminate the possibility of contamination by wild-type receptor DNA, for each helix library, we created a subcloning vector that contained non-receptor DNA substituted between the flanking restriction sites. The following oligonucleotides were used to encode the transmembrane segments (bases doped with 20% non-wild-type nucleotides are underlined): helix I, 5′-AAAATACGCGTTCCAGATATTCTTGCTCTTGTTATCTTTGCTGTTGTCTTTCTTGTTGGTGTTCTTGGTAATGCTCTTGTTGTTTGGGTGACCCA-3′; helix II, 5′-AACTTACACATATGGTTTCTTAATCTTGCTGTTGCCGATTTTCTCTCTTGTCTTGCTCTTCCTATCCTTTTCACTTCTATTGTACAAT-3′; and helix IV, 5′-CTAATATTGGCCGGCTTGGCCTGGATTGCTTGTGCTGTCGCTTGGGGTCTTGCTCTTCTTCTTACAATTCCATCTTTTCTGTACAGA-3′. Oligonucleotides (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) encoding helix I, II, or IV were mutually primed via extended palindromic sequences at their 3′ termini, and the complementary strands were synthesized using Klenow DNA polymerase. The products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the C5a receptor gene in the pBS-SK Bluescript vector. After determining the complexity and quality of the library (by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping), we subcloned each mutated helix library into the yeast shuttle vector p1303ADE2 (derived from p1303; Cadus Pharmaceuticals). The number of recombinants obtained equaled or exceeded the initial size of the mutated helix library. Strain BY1142, engineered by standard yeast strategies, has the genotype far1Δ1442 tbt1-1 FUS1-HIS3 can1 ste14::trp1::LYS2 ste3Δ1156 GPA1(41)-Gαi2 lys2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2. BY1142 expresses a yeast/human Gα chimera in which the N-terminal 41 residues of yeast GPA1 (a region predicted to interact with Gβγ based on the crystal structure of the Gi heterotrimer) (20Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) replaces the first 33 residues of human Gαi2. A SacI restriction site introduces a point mutation that substitutes leucine for valine at position 34 of Gαi2. The chimera is designed for optimal ability to sequester yeast Gβγ and to release it upon C5a receptor activation, thereby triggering the mating response pathway. Expression of the FUS1/HIS3 reporter enzyme, stimulated by the mating response pathway, allows BY1142 cells (his3) to grow in histidine-deficient medium. The far1 deletion blocks cell cycle arrest induced by pheromone. The tbt1-1mutation increases electroporation transformation efficiency; andste14, a carboxymethylase deletion, reduces basal signaling of the pheromone response pathway. Inclusion of an ADE2 gene in the C5a receptor plasmid p1303 (p1303ADE2,PGK-hC5aRADE2 REP3 2μm-ori AmpR f1ori) allowed us to infer from the color of a colony whether its growth on histidine-deficient medium depends on the C5a receptor (red colonies lack ADE2 and, by implication, the receptor plasmid). A separate plasmid, p1297 (ADH1-mfα1-hC5aURA3 REP3 2μm-ori AmpR f1ori; Cadus Pharmaceuticals), allowed autocrine expression of the C5a ligand as an prepro-α-factor/C5a ligand fusion protein; autocrine expression was necessary because C5a cannot traverse the yeast cell wall. We cotransformed BY1142 yeast cells by electroporation with plasmid libraries of mutant C5a receptors and the C5a ligand plasmid p1297. Colonies bearing functional receptors were selected by replica plating on histidine-deficient medium containing 1 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT1; Sigma). We recovered the plasmids encoding functional C5a receptors and confirmed the phenotypes by retransforming each candidate C5a receptor plasmid and the C5a ligand plasmid (or without C5a ligand, to assess constitutive signaling) into the parental yeast strain, BY1142. Growth after 3 days at 30 °C on plates containing different concentrations of AT (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm) served to quantitate the relative intensities of signals mediated by mutant receptors. For each mutant receptor, phenotypes were scored from the average growth of at least 20 independent transformants. In each case, the wild-type C5a receptor expressed in parallel yeast cells served as a positive control. The results of 10 independent transformations of the wild-type C5a receptor were growth at 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, and 5 mm AT. The mutant receptor sequences were obtained by DNA sequencing with Taq polymerase using ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing (Ready Reaction kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To select functional receptors from populations of mutant receptors, we used a genetic selection that couples functional receptors with the G protein-mediated response to mating pheromones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In yeast strain BY1142, activation of the C5a receptor induces expression of the HIS3 gene, thereby allowing cells with functional receptors to survive and proliferate in medium lacking histidine. In this selection procedure, the relative intensities of signals mediated by mutant receptors can be quantitated by assessing growth in the presence of different concentrations of AT, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product (21Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Expression of both C5a and the C5a receptor allowed BY1142 cells to grow in selective medium lacking histidine and containing up to 5 mm AT (Fig.1, first column). Similar yeast cells harboring chimeras of yeast/human G proteins have been utilized to expression clone mammalian receptors (22Chambers J.K. Macdonald L.E. Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Freeman K. Foley J.J.

Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J. Trueheart J. Manfredi J.P. Broach J.R. Murphy A.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previously, we described how we used this genetic selection system to analyze transmembrane helices III and V–VII of the C5a receptor (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O.

Here, using the same mutagenesis and genetic selection, we have studied the remaining three transmembrane helices of the C5a receptor. Helix by helix, we subjected stretches of amino acid sequence to random saturation mutagenesis for a total of 64 positions in helices I, II, and IV. The quality of the libraries was assessed in two ways. First, DNA sequencing of 15–20 independent recombinants from each library, prior to selection, revealed oligonucleotide mutagenesis rates between 19 and 23%, resulting in amino substitution rates of 31–43% (TableI). Second, we determined the substitution rate at the third nucleotide position of degenerate codons for amino acid positions at which few substitutions were observed in functional receptors (see below). The observed substitution rate of 22% closely matches the predicted rate of 20%, demonstrating that little or no bias occurred in the randomization of the libraries.Table ICharacteristics of mutant C5a receptorsLibrariesSelected receptorsHelixSize (×10−3)AA scannedAAΔ avTotalAAΔ avConstitutiveI500247.5 (31%)256.1 (26%)1II100219.1 (43%)225.3 (25%)0IV100196.1 (32%)374.2 (22%)0III200218.0 (38%)304.4 (21%)5V10002510.5 (42%)404.7 (19%)0VI50249.9 (38%)258.1 (31%)16VII1000217.6 (36%)283.2 (15%)0Size indicates the number of individual recombinants in each helix library.

We then selected recombinants from three separate libraries of mutant receptors, each library containing mutations in a single helix, for ability to support growth of BY1142 cells in the absence of histidine. At the high mutation rate of 6–9 amino acid substitutions per helix, <0.1% of BY1142 cells transformed with a mutant C5a receptor survived the selection. 2A. Geva, T. B. Lassere, and T. J. Baranski, unpublished data. As expected, these rare functional receptors identified by the selection contain fewer amino acid substitutions (22–26% substitution rate) than receptors prior to selection (31–43%) (Table I). For the three scanned helices, the yeast selection identified 84 functional mutant receptors (at least 22 from each helix library), providing a data set of 425 amino acid substitutions (summarized in Table I). We first analyzed two general properties of the mutant, yet functional, C5a receptors: constitutive (ligand-independent) receptor activity and overall resistance to mutations. A single mutant receptor obtained from the helix I selection (R306) (Fig. 1) displayed constitutive activity when expressed in yeast lacking the C5a ligand. All other mutant receptors obtained from helix I, II, and IV selections required the C5a ligand to signal in yeast. The relative insensitivity of helices I, II, and IV to activating mutations (Table I) contrasts with the results obtained previously from scanning helices III and V–VII (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar): five helix III-mutated receptors and 16 helix VI-mutated receptors demonstrated ligand-independent signaling. We did not specifically attempt to select for constitutively active receptors; nonetheless, the locations of the mutations in the 22 activated C5a receptors provide a comprehensive map of the “hot spots” for activation within the seven transmembrane helices of a single G protein-coupled receptor (Table I). These results from the genetic screen of the C5a receptor reflect the sensitivity of many other G protein-coupled receptors to activating mutations: naturally occurring mutations and artificially introduced substitutions that result in activated receptors predominantly map to helices III and VI (24Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The abundance of activating mutants in helices III and VI, when compared with the rarity of such mutants in the other five helices, strengthens the possible role of helices III and VI as essential elements of the turn-on switch. Likewise, the helices can be classified as either more or less resistant to amino acid substitutions, an indicator of the relative importance of that helix for the overall folding and stability of the molecule. In the Baldwin model, helices I, II, and IV reside on the periphery of the seven-helix bundle (see Fig. 4 and below); as such, they might be expected to tolerate more mutations than the centrally located helix III (which, in the model, makes contacts with five other helices) or helix VII (which contacts four other helices). Helices I, II, and IV displayed intermediate levels of resistance to substitution, tolerating 6.1, 5.3, and 4.2 amino acid substitutions per mutant receptor, respectively (Table I). The most resistant transmembrane segment, helix VII, tolerated only an average of 3.2 amino acid substitutions per receptor (15% mutation rate versus a 36% average amino substitution rate prior to selection) (Table I, as taken from Ref. 19Baranski T.J.

Conversely, helix VI tolerated more than twice the number of amino acid substitutions (8.1 or 31%) (Table I) (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Despite its central location in the model, helix III tolerated a similar rate of mutations as helices I, II, and IV. However, the propensity for mutations in helix III and VI to activate the receptor likely increases the observed mutation rates in these two helices. We analyzed the mutant C5a receptors, amino acid position by position, in an attempt to rank their relative importance in that helix for the function of the receptor. We expected that, in functional mutant receptors, the side chains that face other helices would tolerate fewer mutations than the side chains that face the surrounding lipid since association of transmembrane helices with one another depends upon preservation of complementary shapes that maximize van der Waals interactions (25MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We defined side chain character as “preserved” if we observed at that position no more than 1 amino acid substitution or if all substitutions at that position involved closely related amino acids (log odds score of 1.0 or greater in the PAM 250 scoring matrix) (26Dayhoff J.U. Schwartz R.M. Dayhoff J.U. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1979: 353Google Scholar). We assume that most amino acid substitutions occur at less important parts of the receptor switch; some mutations, however, may compensate for functional defects caused by other mutations in the same helix. Single amino acid substitutions were included to allow for the rare mutation that might have occurred at a critical position, but only in the setting of other compensatory substitutions. For example, the single P90I substitution obtained in R05 occurs in the setting of substitutions in the two neighboring residues, I89L and L91I (Fig. 2). In addition, some combinations of mutations might increase the function of the C5a receptor: all of the mutant receptors obtained from selections of the three libraries functioned at levels equal to or greater than the wild-type C5a receptor (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Although these criteria may be subjective, they nonetheless accurately identified essential amino acids when applied to the results obtained with helices III and V–VII (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); as reported previously, single amino acid substitutions at 14 of 17 preserved positions in helices III and V–VII significantly impaired receptor function (19Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Mutant C5a receptors and the C5a ligand were expressed in yeast strain BY1142, and functional receptors were selected by the ability of yeast to grow in the absence of histidine and in 1 mm AT. See the legend to Fig. 1 for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functional mutant receptors preserved side chain character at 19 of the 64 positions mutated (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). When localized on helical wheel diagrams, the helix I preserved residues (Asp37, Ala40, Gly51, Asn55, and Val58) (Fig. 4, red letters) map to a single face of the α-helix that, in the Baldwin model, points toward helices II and VII. Likewise, for helix IV, 4 of the 6 preserved residues (Cys157, Ala164, Thr168, and Ser171) map to a single face of helix IV that points toward helices III and V. For helix II, the 8 preserved residues (Leu76, Asn77, Ala79, Ala81, Asp82, Leu84, Leu87, and Pro90) are distributed on multiple faces of the helix and thus provide little information to help orient the helix relative to the other transmembrane segments. Our results (Fig. 4) fit equally well with an orientation that rotates the helix 180° relative to its current position, thereby pointing the majority of the preserved residues inward. However, helix II, repositioned in that way, orients 2 highly conserved polar residues, Asp82 and Asn77, into the lipid bilayer. Moreover, biochemical data obtained from studies of three different members of the G protein-coupled receptor family support the Baldwin helix II orientation as evidenced by studies of the following: (i) accessibility of substituted cysteines at each position in helix II of the D2-dopamine receptor to a water-soluble chemical probe (27Javitch J.A. Ballesteros J.A. Chen J. Chiappa V. Simpson M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7961-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), (ii) metal ion-binding sites formed by substituted histidines in extracellular ends of helices II and III of the NK-1 receptor (28Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6213-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and (iii) site-directed spin labeling studies of the intracellular end of rhodopsin helix II (29Altenbach C.

The binding of a high affinity ligand, Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2, to PTP1B (K d = 0.24 μm) is favored by both enthalpic and entropic contributions. Disruption of ionic interactions between the side chain of Arg-47 and the N-terminal acidic residues reduces the binding affinity primarily through the reduction of the TΔS term. The role of Arg-47 may be to maximize surface contact between PTP1B and the peptide, which contributes to high affinity binding. The active site Cys-215 → Ser mutant PTP1B binds ligands with the same affinity as the wild-type enzyme. However, unlike wild-type PTP1B, peptide binding to C215S is predominately driven by enthalpy change, which likely results from the elimination of the electrostatic repulsion between the thiolate anion and the phosphonate group. The increased enthalpic contribution is offset by reduction in the binding entropy, which may be the result of increased entropy of the unbound protein caused by this mutation. The general acid-deficient mutant D181A binds the peptide 5-fold tighter than the C215S mutant, consistent with the observation that the Asp to Ala mutant is a better “substrate-trapping” reagent than C215S. The increased binding affinity for D181A as compared with the wild-type PTP1B results primarily from an increase in the ΔH of binding in the mutant, which may be related to decreased electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate moiety and PTP1B.

The PTPase superfamily is presently comprised of approximately 100 enzymes, which includes tyrosine-specific, dual specificity, and low molecular weight phosphatases (4Zhang Z.-Y. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). PTP1B is one member of this enzyme family, which in common with all PTPases has the active site signature motif C(X 5)R(S/T) (5Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L.

PTPases share a common catalytic mechanism, utilizing a Cys nucleophile (Cys-215 in PTP1B) in the formation of a thiophosphoryl covalent enzyme intermediate (Fig. 1), which undergoes hydrolysis in a second step (7Guan K.L.

The initial phosphoryl transfer step is assisted by the conserved Asp (Asp-181 in PTP1B), which protonates the leaving group (10Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Two types of substrate-trapping mutants have been used to isolate PTPase substrates. In the first, the active site Cys residue is replaced by a Ser, whereas in the second, the general acid Asp residue is substituted by an Ala. Although the Cys to Ser mutant has no measurable phosphatase activity (22Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the catalytic activity of the Asp to Ala mutant is reduced 105-fold toward a protein substrate (21Flint A.J. Taganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), both mutants retain the ability to bind substrates, enabling their use as “affinity reagents” for the isolation of in vivo PTPase substrates. Interestingly, in several instances, the Asp to Ala mutant has been found to be a better substrate-trapping reagent than the Cys to Ser mutant (17Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Flint A.J. Taganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Substrate-trapping mutants have also been employed extensively in structural studies of PTPases. In fact, most of the structural information regarding PTPase-substrate interactions has been obtained not from wild-type PTPases but from substrate complexes with the active site Cys to Ser substrate-trapping mutants (23Jia Z.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it is often assumed that substrate-trapping mutants retain the structural and binding properties of the wild-type PTPases, significant differences have been found in the few studies that have addressed this issue (22Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Juszczak L.J. Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Gottfried D.S. Eads D.D.

Given the importance of PTPases in signal transduction, and the importance of substrate-trapping mutants in the studies of PTPases, a clear understanding of the molecular basis of the ability of these mutants to bind substrates is highly desirable. PTP1B has been implicated as a negative regulator of insulin signaling (29Ahmad F. Li P.M. Meyerovitch J. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

In addition, mice lacking functional PTP1B exhibit increased sensitivity toward insulin and are resistant to obesity (33Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.-C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 34Klaman L.D.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). These results, taken together, suggest that specific inhibition of PTP1B may be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of Type II diabetes and obesity. Thus, there is considerable interest in understanding the molecular basis of PTP1B-ligand interactions. An improved understanding of the interactions between PTP1B and its ligands (substrates and/or inhibitors) should facilitate the development of potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors. We describe here a detailed thermodynamic study of ligand binding to PTP1B and its substrate-trapping mutants using isothermal titration calorimetry. The major advantage of isothermal titration calorimetry is that the association constant as well as the energetics of binding can be measured simultaneously. Differences in ligand binding affinity can be understood in terms of the relative contributions of the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the entropy change (ΔS) for binding of each ligand, thereby providing a thermodynamic basis for the ability of PTP1B and several mutants to bind ligands. Significant differences between the thermodynamic consequences of the interactions between various forms of PTP1B and a specific phosphonopeptide are reported herein. In addition, the energetics of binding of several ligands to a number of different PTP1B mutants is described, which permits an improved understanding of the observed differences and similarities in ligand binding affinity in terms of the relative contributions of the ΔH and the ΔS of binding for each ligand. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluka Co. Other chemicals were from Fisher Co. Solutions were prepared using deionized and distilled water. The nonhydrolyzable Tyr(P) mimetic phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp)-containing peptides, Ac-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2, Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2, and Ac-Ser-Ser-Val-Leu-F2Pmp-Thr-NH2, were synthesized using a modification of previously reported solid-phase technique (35Burke Jr., T.R.

Final high pressure liquid chromatography-purified products provided NMR and mass spectral data consistent with their assigned structures. The catalytic domain of PTP1B (residues 1–321) was used in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis for C215S, D181A, D181N, and R47E was described previously (11Hengge A.C. Sowa G Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y.

The recombinant wild-type and mutant PTP1Bs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described (24Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc.

Protein concentration was determined from absorbance measurement at 280 nm using an absorbance coefficient of 1.24 for 1 mg/ml PTP1B. The PTPase activity was assayed at 25 °C in a reaction mixture (0.2 ml) containing an appropriate concentration of pNPP as a substrate. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme and quenched after 2–3 min by addition of 1 ml of 1 n NaOH. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of the enzyme. The amount of p-nitrophenol produced was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m−1 cm−1. The inhibition constants for the F2Pmp-containing peptides were determined for PTP1B in the following manner. At various fixed concentration of inhibitors, the initial rate at variouspNPP concentrations was measured as described (40Zhang Y.-L. Zhang Z.-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All inhibition experiments were performed in 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer (pH 7.0). The ionic strength of each solution was adjusted to 0.15 m by addition of NaCl. Inhibition was competitive with respect to the substrate, and data were fit to Equation 1 using KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) to obtain the inhibition constant (K i): ν=Vmax·SKm(1+I/Ki)+SEquation 1 where V max is the maximal velocity,K m, the Michaelis constant, S, the substrate concentration, I, the inhibitor concentration, andK i, the inhibition constant. All isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed using an MCS isothermal titration calorimetry system from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA). Experiments at pH 7.0 were conducted at 25 °C, in 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. The ionic strength of the buffer was adjusted to 0.15m by addition of NaCl. Protein concentration in the calorimeter cell was 27–85 μm, whereas the ligand in the syringe was 0.37–1 mm. The PTP1B samples used in the isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were dialyzed completely against buffer. High concentration stock solutions were prepared for ligands with distilled water and adjusted to pH 7.0. Stock was diluted at least 26-fold with 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer before titration. Protein dilution during titration was determined by titration of buffer into the protein solution. The heat of protein dilution was found to be negligible. The heat of ligand dilution was corrected by subtracting the average heat of injection after saturation. The binding data were analyzed using Origin software (41Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Binding constants, K, and enthalpy changes, ΔH, were used to calculate free energy change, ΔG, and entropy change, ΔS, according to Equation 2: −RTLnK=ΔG=ΔH−TΔSEquation 2 where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Accessible surface area (ASA) calculations were carried out using the program Delphi-Insight II (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). A 1.4-Å probe radius was employed. The structures used in this study have the following accession numbers in the Protein Data Bank at Rutgers University: PTP1B (2HNP); PTP1B/C215S complexed with Asp-Ala-Asp-Gly-Tyr(P)-Leu-NH2 (1PTU); PTP1B/C215S complexed with Ac-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu (1PTT). To calculate the change in accessible surface area (ΔASA) upon peptide binding, the surface areas of ligand-free PTP1B (ASAPTP1B), free peptide (ASApeptide), and PTP1B-peptide complex (ASAPTP1B-peptide) were determined for both the hexapeptide and the tetrapeptide. The change in accessible surface area was then calculated from ΔASA = ASAPTP1B + ASApeptide − ASAPTP1B-peptide (42Bradshaw J.M. Grucza R.A. Ladbury J.E. Waksman G.

ASApeptide was calculated as the sum of the accessible surface areas of the individual residues in the extended Ala-Xaa-Ala geometry. ASAPTP1B and ASAPTP1B-peptide were calculated from the corresponding crystal structures using coordinates for residues 5–282 in PTP1B to keep the ligand-free and ligand-bound form constant. Isothermal titration calorimetry allows a simultaneous determination of the binding constant (K), stoichiometry, as well as the enthalpy change (ΔH) associated with the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule (41Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). From these parameters, the Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔG) and the entropy change (ΔS) of binding can also be derived from the expression ΔG = −RTlnK = ΔH − TΔS. Evaluation of these thermodynamic parameters yields important insight into the nature of binding reaction that is not evident from the measurement of binding constants alone (43Connelly P.R. Varadarajan R. Sturtevant J.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6108-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Ladbury J.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For example, from changes in the magnitude and the sign of the ΔH and ΔS and in conjunction with structural data provided by NMR and x-ray crystallography, one can obtain information about structural alterations that accompany ligand binding in terms of 1) changes in solvation state of the ligand or protein; 2) interactions between ligand and macromolecule, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, electrostatic, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interaction; and 3) changes in conformation/dynamics induced by ligand binding or by mutation. In the following, we describe a thermodynamic analysis of binding reactions between PTP1B and several site-directed mutants with phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp)-containing peptides using isothermal titration calorimetry. The phosphopeptide Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu-NH2(modeled after the epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation site Tyr-992, residues 988–993) is an excellent substrate for PTP1B with a k cat/K m value (1.88 × 107m−1s−1) 2100-fold higher than that of Tyr(P) (45Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This indicates that amino acid residues flanking Tyr(P) contribute to efficient PTP1B binding and catalysis. The crystal structure of the catalytically inactive PTP1B/C215S complexed with Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu-NH2 provides a structural snapshot of the interaction of PTP1B/C215S with this peptide 2PTP1B hydrolyzes Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu-NH2 and the N-terminal acetylated form Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-Tyr(P)-Leu-NH2 with the same kinetic constants (45Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). (23Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, to fully appreciate the interactions between a protein binding site and its ligands, a detailed thermodynamic description is a highly desirable complement to the structural data. Because of inherent hydrolytic activity, it has not been possible to study binding interactions between a PTPase and its substrate directly. In fact, most structural studies have employed catalytically inactive, active site Cys to Ser mutant PTPases to visualize enzyme-substrate complexes (23Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 24Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To compare binding interactions between wild-type PTP1B and its various mutants (either active or inactive), we must use nonhydrolyzable phosphopeptide analogs. The most commonly used phosphorus-based Tyr(P) analogs are phosphonomethyl phenylalanine (Pmp) (45Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and F2Pmp (46Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M. Nomizu M. Otaka A. Roller P.P. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1336-1340Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Peptides bearing F2Pmp are over 1000 times more potent PTPase inhibitors than the analogous peptides containing Pmp (46Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M. Nomizu M. Otaka A. Roller P.P. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1336-1340Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 47Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke T.R. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 976-984Google Scholar). This has been attributed to a direct interaction between the fluorine atoms and PTPase active site residues (47Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke T.R. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 976-984Google Scholar). Specific interactions between one of the fluorine atoms in difluoronaphthylmethyl phosphonic acid and PTP1B have been observed (48Burke Jr., T.R. Ye B. Yan X. Wang S. Jia Z. Chen L. Zhang Z.-Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies indicate that the phenolic oxygen in the substrate receives a proton from the general acid Asp-181 (10Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Hengge A.C. Sowa G Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13982-13987Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The enhanced affinity of F2Pmp over Pmp likely arises from the ability of the fluorine atoms in F2Pmp to interact with the PTPase active site residues in a fashion analogous to that involving the phenolic oxygen and side chains in the active site of PTPases. Thus, F2Pmp-containing peptides are excellent nonhydrolyzable substrate analogs for PTPases. The F2Pmp-containing peptide Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2 is a nonhydrolyzable, competitive inhibitor of PTP1B with aK i value of 0.25 μm at pH 7.0 and 25 °C (Table I). This value is similar to a previous measurement of 0.18 μm at pH 7.0 and 30 °C (47Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke T.R. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 976-984Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were performed at pH 7.0 and 25 °C in this study. The dissociation constant (K d) and thermodynamic parameters for the binding of Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2 to PTP1B were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and are summarized in Table I. A typical titration curve and binding isotherm is shown in Fig. 3. Binding of Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH2 was exothermic at 25 °C (ΔH = −3.9 kcal/mol). From curve fitting of such binding isotherms, the stoichiometry for the binding of the peptide to PTP1B was determined to be 1:1. The dissociation constantK d was 0.24 μm, which is very close to the K i values determined from inhibition studies.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the binding of PTP1B with F2Pmp-containing peptidesLigandK dΔHTΔSΔGμmkcal mol −1Ac-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH21.4 ± 0.5−5.9 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.4−7.9 ± 0.2(0.8 ± 0.1)Ac-Asp-Ala-Asp-Glu-F2Pmp-Leu-NH20.24 ± 0.05−3.9 ± 0.25.1 ± 0.2−9.0 ± 0.1(0.25 ± 0.02) 1-aK i values (inhibition constants) were measured by steady-state kinetic experiments under the same conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2165736145,"Abstract Activation of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor signaling promotes glucose lowering via multiple mechanisms, including regulation of food intake, glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and stimulation of β-cell mass. As GLP-1 exhibits a short t in vivo, the biological consequences of prolonged GLP-1 receptor signaling remains unclear. To address this question, we have now generated metallothionein promoter-preproexendin (MT-Ex) transgenic mice. MT-Ex mice process preproexendin correctly, as is made evident by detection of circulating plasma exendin-4 immunoreactivity using high pressure liquid chromatography and an exendin-4-specific radioimmunoassay. Despite elevated levels of exendin-4, fasting plasma glucose and glucose clearance following oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests are normal in MT-Ex mice. Induction of transgene expression significantly reduced glycemic excursion during both oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (p < 0.05) and increased levels of glucose-stimulated insulin following oral glucose administration (p < 0.05). Despite evidence that exendin-4 may induce β-cell proliferation, β-cell mass and islet histology were normal in MT-Ex mice. MT-Ex mice exhibited no differences in basal food intake or body weight; however, induction of exendin-4 expression was associated with reduced short term food ingestion (p < 0.05). In contrast, short term water intake was significantly reduced in the absence of zinc in fluid-restricted MT-Ex mice (p < 0.05). These findings illustrate that sustained elevation of circulating exendin-4 is not invariably associated with changes in glucose homeostasis, increased β-cell mass, or reduction in food intake in mice in vivo."

One major virulence factor of this pathogen is the type b capsular polysaccharide, which is also the basis of the presently used vaccine (1Moxon E.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 165 (suppl.): 77-81Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)1 play a crucial role in the interaction of this microorganism with the host's immune system. LPS contribute to each stage of pathogenesis of H. influenzae infection including colonization of the upper respiratory tract, systemic dissemination, and the invasion of the central nervous system (2Hood D.R. Moxon E.R. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Diseases. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 39-54Google Scholar). During these processes, several surface exposed epitopes of the molecule are the subject of high frequency phase variation. LPS are the major amphiphilic constituents of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. They share a common architecture composed of a membrane-anchored phosphorylated and acylated β(1→6) linked glucosamine disaccharide, termed lipid A, to which a carbohydrate moiety of varying size is attached. The latter always contains 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) linked to lipid A. Mutants that are defective in biosynthetic enzymes of the Kdo-lipid A region are conditionally thermosensitive, indicating that this minimal structure is absolutely required for the integrity of the outer membrane and microbial cell growth (3Rick P.D.

The lipid A-linked Kdo residue is often substituted with a second Kdo, forming the disaccharide α-Kdo-(2→4)-α-Kdo, which also has been identified as the minimal core structure in enterobacterial deep rough mutants of the Re-type. Further core sugars are always attached to position 5 of the inner Kdo in wild-type bacteria. In contrast, LPS from H. influenzaecontain only a single Kdo residue substituted with phosphate or 2-aminoethanol pyrophosphate in position 4 (6Holst Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C.

Kdo transferases (WaaA) have been described as multifunctional enzymes that are able to transfer several Kdo residues from CMP-Kdo to different precursor molecules forming different linkages, which has not been observed for other glycosyltransferases (11Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Bifunctional enzymes capable of synthesizing an α(2→4)-linked Kdo disaccharide have been cloned and characterized from Escherichia coli (12Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Furthermore, in Chlamydiaceae, even tri- and tetrafunctional WaaA have been identified that are responsible for the biosynthesis of a family-specific surface epitope comprising an α-Kdo-(2→8)-α-Kdo-(2→4)-α-Kdo trisaccharide of diagnostic value (12Belunis C.J.

In contrast, a monofunctional Kdo transferase activity has been demonstrated together with an LPS-specific, ATP-dependent Kdo kinase from membrane extracts of H. influenzae (16White K.A. Kalashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data have been recently confirmed by the cloning and in vitro characterization of a Kdo kinase gene (kdkA) (17White K.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

However, due to limiting amounts of thein vitro reaction products of KdkA, the position to which phosphate had been transferred has not been determined. We have established a cloning system based on a defined Re-typeE. coli strain that is devoid of the host's Kdo transferase activity and additionally harbors a ΔwaaCF mutation within the heptosyltransferase I and II genes involved in the consecutive transfer ofl-glycero-d-manno-heptose residues to Kdo. This strategy allowed us to characterize LPS that were synthesized in vivo by cloned Kdo transferases without interfering activity of the essential host-specific enzyme (18Brabetz W. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 167: 5458-5465Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we now show that the cloned monofunctionalwaaA from H. influenzae is not able to complement a knockout mutation within the corresponding gene of E. coli; however, cloning of both waaA and kdkAfrom a wild type or the I69 strain of H. influenzae, respectively, we are able to complement the mutation.

All polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) used for cloning were performed withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), which exhibits proofreading activity. The digoxygenin-11-dUTP system (Roche Diagnostics) was used for DNA labeling and detection in Southern experiments according to the instructions of the manufacturer. DNA sequence analysis of both strands of the cloned genes was done by cycle sequencing with fluorescent dye terminators and sequence-specific primers on an ABI 377 sequencing automat (Perkin-Elmer).

The primers HinfI (5′-ATATGGATCCGAATTTCTTTATGTGGCG-3′,BamHI site underlined and start codon in boldface type) andHinfII (5′-ATATCTGCAGCGTCATACATTGCGCTCC-3′,PstI site underlined and stop codon in boldface type) were used to amplify by PCR a 1297-bp waaA-encoding fragment from chromosomal DNA of H. influenzae I69. The amplificate was cut with BamHI and PstI and ligated with pCB20 (13Bode C.E. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which had been linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The resultant construct, termed pCB23, encoded the Kdo transferase under transcriptional control of the tac promoter (Fig.1 A). The expression cassette with the tacpromoter, waaA of H. influenzae I69, and the kanamycin resistance gene (kan) of pCB20 was amplified from pCB23 with the primers W151 (5′-TTTTTCGTCGACGGTACCCGG-3′,SalI site underlined) and W152 (5′-AGAAAGTGGTCGACCCACGGTTGATG-3′, SalI site underlined), cut with SalI, and ligated into theSalI site of pJSC2 (4Belunis C.J.

The construct with the orientation of the inset shown in Fig. 1 B was selected and termed pJKB49. The recombinant strain was cultivated at 30 °C due to the temperature-sensitive origin of replication of pJSC2 (4Belunis C.J. Clementz T. Carty S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27646-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ThekdkA genes were amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA ofH. influenzae DSM11121 and H. influenzae I69 using the primers HIK3 (5′-ATAACAACGTCATGACCCACCAATTCCAACAAG-3′,BspHI site underlined and start codon in boldface type) and HIK4 (5′-TCATAATTAGGTACC TTATTGATGATAAGCTGACGT-3′,KpnI site underlined and stop codon in boldface type). The 755-bp amplificates were cut with BspHI and KpnI and ligated with pCF-TET (25Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which had been linearized withNcoI and KpnI. The resultant plasmids that encoded the kdkA genes of H. influenzae DSM11121 or H. influenzae I69 under transcriptional control of thetrc promoter were termed pJKB113 and pJKB113A, respectively (Fig. 1 C). In addition, PCR fragments that encodedwaaA or kdkA of H. influenzae DSM11121 and H. influenzae I69 with additional sequences around the open reading frames were amplified from chromosomal DNA and sequenced to determine the 5′- and 3′-ends of the genes including the binding sites of the cloning primers. For this purpose, the primer pairs HIWAAA1 (5′-AATGACCGTTCGTAATCGG-3′) and HIWAAA2 (5′-ATTGCAACGCTAATTGTAGGC-3′) were used in the case of waaA, and HIKDKA1 (5′-CTTCTGGGCTTTCAATGCC-3′) and HIKDKA2 (5′-TAAGGCATGACAGACATCGC-3′) were used in the case ofkdkA. The plasmids pJKB113 and pJKB113A were linearized withPvuII and ScaI and transformed into E. coli JC7623 (26Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is recBC sbcBC and, thus, could be used to transfer the expression cassettes with the kdkAgenes of the H. influenzae strains DSM11121 and I69 together with the tetracycline resistance gene of pCF-TET to the chromosomalwaaCF locus by homologous recombination in one step (27Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding strains derived from pJKB113 and pJKB113A were termedE. coli WBB21 and E. coli WBB32, respectively. Both recombinant strains were further transformed with pJKB49 that had been linearized with EcoRI and AflII to integrate the waaA gene from H. influenzae together with the kanamycin resistance gene (kan) into the chromosomalwaaA locus. The corresponding derivatives of E. coli WBB21 and E. coli WBB32 were termed E. coli WBB22 and E. coli WBB34, respectively. E. coli WBB01 (25Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is a ΔwaaCF derivative of strain E. coli JC7623, was used as a control recipient of linearized pJKB49 DNA. All chromosomal knockout mutants were characterized by Southern experiments, PCR, and DNA sequence analysis of the recombinant genes reamplified from the chromosomes. For this purpose, the primers LACP (5′-CGGCTCGTATAATGTGTGGA-3′) and WSB10R (5′-CGATTGTAAAACAGGCTGGC-3′) were used to amplify by PCR an 824-bpkdkA encoding fragment from chromosomal DNA of the recombinant strains that was not present in the wild type strain. The primers EC49A (5′-TGATCTGGATACGGCTCTGG-3′) and EC49B (5′-GCAGCAATCAGCGTAATACG-3′) were used to amplify from E. coli K-12 wild type DNA a 499-bp fragment around the singleSalI site that is located within the waaA gene (see Fig. 1 B). The same PCR revealed a single product of 3057 bp in the cases of E. coli WBB22 and E. coliWBB34. The preparation of cell extracts from recombinant strains and standard conditions for the Kdo transferase assay were performed as described (13Bode C.E. Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The protein content in cell extracts was determined using a commercial reagent (Bradford kit; Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. The enzyme reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.2 mm Triton X-100, 2 mm Kdo, 5 mmCTP, 0.1 mm synthetic bisphosphorylated tetraacyl lipid A precursor 406 (18Brabetz W.

Biochem. 2000; 167: 5458-5465Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 1.67 picokatal of CMP-Kdo synthetase and cell extracts from recombinant C. glutamicum strains (40 μg of protein). The in vitro tests were incubated up to 60 min at 37 °C and stopped by spotting 5 μl onto a TLC plate. Kinetic experiments were performed with 40-μl reaction mixtures from which 5-μl samples were withdrawn at different time points and stopped with 10 μl ice-cold ethanol before spotting onto TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water in a ratio of 30:70:16:10 (by volume). Radioactive [4′-32P]406 was synthesized from monophosphorylated lipid A precursor 405 as described (27Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using recombinant lipid A 4′-kinase prepared from E. coli BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pJK2 (19Imoto M. Yoshimura H. Yamamoto M. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1984; 26: 1545-1548Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The specific activity was adjusted with unlabeled 406 to approximately 15,000–20,000 cpm/nmol. Radioactive products were detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager equipped with the software ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). A standard enzyme reaction with radioactively labeled acceptor 406 and cell extract of C. glutamicum R163/pCB23 was scaled up to 800 μl and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were separated by TLC as described above. The product Kdo-406 was identified by autoradiography and isolated from the TLC plate according to Brozek et al. (28Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of Kdo-406 (39.7%) was calculated from its glucosamine content, which was determined according to published procedures (29Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Brade H. Verhoef J. Sinnwell V. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein-free whole cell lysates were prepared as described (25Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The samples were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% total acrylamide, 3.3% cross-linker) and silver-stained according to Tsai and Frasch (30Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of LPS after blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes was done according to Löbau et al. (15Löbau S. Mamat U. Brabetz W. Brade H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Colony immunoblots were performed as described (25Brabetz W. Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The specificities of mAbs used in this study were described elsewhere (mAb A20 (31Rozalski A. Brade L. Kosma P. Appelmelck B.J. Krogmann C. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); mAbs S42–16 and S42–21 (10Rozalski A. Brade L. Kosma P. Moxon R. Kusumoto S. Brade H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) and are indicated in the legend to Fig. 5 and under “Results.” E. coli WBB22 was cultivated for 24 h at 30 °C in 6 liters of LB supplemented with tetracycline and kanamycin sulfate. The cells were centrifuged at 4 °C; washed 10 min with 200 ml of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, 16 h with 200 ml of 96% ethanol, and twice for 3 h with 200 ml of acetone; and air-dried (yield: 1.1 g of dry cells/liter). Bacterial LPS was obtained by extraction of the dried bacteria with phenol-chloroform-petrolether as described (32Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) (yield: 4.1%). Analyses of GlcN, Kdo, and phosphate were performed as described (29Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Brade H. Verhoef J. Sinnwell V. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). LPS (50 mg, containing 30 μmol of GlcN) was de-O-acylated by mild hydrazinolysis as described (33Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (yield: 34 mg, 21 μmol of GlcN, 70%). De-O-acylated LPS (30 mg) was subjected to de-N-acylation by strong alkaline treatment as described (33Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After neutralization with hydrochloric acid and desalting on Sephacryl G-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in pyridinium actetate, pH 4.0, a single fraction was obtained, which was analyzed by analytical high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Dionex DX 300 chromatography system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA 1 column (4.5 × 250 mm), eluted at 1 ml/min using eluents A (water) and B (1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0) and a linear gradient of 0–60% B in 70 min. NMR spectra were recorded on a solution of 5 mg of oligosaccharide (in 500 μl of D2O, 99.99%; Sigma) at pD 2.8 after three deuterium exchanges by evaporation at reduced pressure. All spectra were recorded at a temperature of 300 K using standard Bruker pulse programs. 1H NMR and1H,13C COSY spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer (600.13 MHz, measured relative to acetone, 2.225 ppm) equipped with a 5-mm multinuclear inverse probe head with Z-gradient. One-dimensional 13C NMR (90.6 MHz, relative to acetone, 31.07 ppm) and 31P spectra (145.8 MHz, relative to 85% H3PO4, 0.00 ppm) were recorded on a Bruker DPX360 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm multinuclear inverse Z-gradient probe head. 13C and 31P NMR chemical shift assignments were achieved by inverse heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments (34Bax A. Subaramaniam S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar) in phase-sensitive mode using states-time proportional phase incrementation (35Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn.

The spectral width was 110 ppm in F1 and 10 ppm in F2. Prior to Fourier transformation, a qsine window function was ap"
https://openalex.org/W2125929148,"X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Escherichia coli P(II) protein paralogues GlnB and GlnK has shown that they share a superimposable structural core but can differ in conformation of the T-loop, a region of the protein (residues 37-54) that has been shown to be important for interaction with other proteins. In Klebsiella pneumoniae GlnK has been shown to have a clearly defined function in regulating NifL-mediated inhibition of NifA activity in response to the nitrogen status, and GlnB, when expressed from the chromosome, does not substitute for GlnK. Because the T-loops of K. pneumoniae and E. coli GlnB and GlnK differ at just three residues, 43, 52, and 54, we have used a previously constructed heterologous system, in which K. pneumoniae nifLA is expressed in E. coli, to investigate the importance of GlnK residues 43, 52, and 54 for regulation of the NifLA interaction. By site-directed mutagenesis of glnB we have shown that residue 54 is the single most important amino acid in the T-loop in the context of the regulation of NifA activity. Furthermore, a combination of just two changes, in residues 54 and 43, allows GlnB to function as GlnK and completely relieve NifL inhibition of NifA activity."
https://openalex.org/W2036861647,"To investigate the roles of site I and II invariant Glu residues 41 and 77 in the functional properties and calcium-induced structural opening of skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) regulatory domain, we have replaced them by Ala in intact F29W TnC and in wild-type and F29W N domains (TnC residues 1–90). Reconstitution of intact E41A/F29W and E77A/F29W mutants into TnC-depleted muscle skinned fibers showed that Ca2+-induced tension is greatly reduced compared with the F29W control. Circular dichroism measurements of wild-type N domain as a function of pCa (= −log[Ca2+]) demonstrated that ∼90% of the total change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222 nm) could be assigned to site II Ca2+ binding. With E41A, E77A, and cardiac TnC N domains this [θ]222 nm change attributable to site II was reduced to ≤40% of that seen with wild type, consistent with their structures remaining closed in +Ca2+. Furthermore, the Ca2+-induced changes in fluorescence, near UV CD, and UV difference spectra observed with intact F29W are largely abolished with E41A/F29W and E77A/F29W TnCs. Taken together, the data indicate that the major structural change in N domain, including the closed to open transition, is triggered by site II Ca2+ binding, an interpretation relevant to the energetics of the skeletal muscle TnC and cardiac TnC systems.

Each of the three components of this complex, troponin C, I, and T (TnC, TnI, and TnT, respectively)1 has distinct functional properties. Conformational changes in TnC associated with Ca2+ binding to its regulatory N domain lead to a strengthening of its interaction with TnI and a weakening of the latter's interaction with actin. Inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase activity is thereby released. TnT fulfills the role of anchoring the complex to tropomyosin and potentiating actomyosin ATPase activity (for reviews, see Refs. 1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C.

Each of the N and C domains consists of two intimately associated EF-hand or helix-loop-helix metal binding motifs. Those of C domain (sites III and IV) have high affinity for Ca2+ (K d ≅ 10−7m) and bind Mg2+competitively (K d ≅ 10−3m). Sites I and II are of lower affinity withK d values of ∼16 and ∼1.7 μm, respectively (22Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D.

Helices are designated A–H, corresponding to the four helix-loop-helix motifs of sites I–IV. In addition, an extension of the NH2 terminus forms the N helix; the central helix seen in the crystals connecting site II to site III is designated D/E. Based on a substantial body of evidence, the C domain sites III/IV are believed to be occupied by Ca2+/Mg2+ throughout the contraction/relaxation cycle and to serve a structural role in anchoring TnC to the other troponin components. Association and dissociation of Ca2+from sites I/II of N domain are considered to fulfill the regulatory function of TnC. As originally postulated by Herzberg et al. (24Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for avian skeletal TnC N domain, Ca2+ binding to sites I/II has been shown to promote a structural transition from a closed (apo) to open (2Ca2+) conformation (13Strynadka N.C.J.

Involving significant changes in interhelical angles, helices B and C are seen to have altered their positions relative to those of N, A, and D. As a result, a number of previously fully and partially buried apolar residues are exposed at the protein surface to create a hydrophobic pocket or patch. The intact TnC (4Ca2+) now possesses two nonpolar surface patches, one in each domain, with surrounding constellations of negatively charged residues. Evidence for these as interaction sites with regions of TnI has been reported (see Ref. 25McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholarand references therein). In each loop of sites I–IV of TnC, Ca2+ complexes with seven ligands in a pentagonal bipyramidal arrangement. By convention, the six amino acids contributing to these liganding groups are designated X, Y, Z, −Y, −X, and −Z or as residues 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 in the 12-residue loop. Depending on the position within the loop and the amino acid occupying a particular position, Ca2+ligation may be to a protein main or side chain oxygen or to H2O. In most EF-hands/loops, the highly conserved bidentate Glu residue at position 12 (−Z) provides two Ca2+ ligands through its two side chain carboxyl oxygens. Binding of 2Ca2+ to sTnC N domain has been shown to occur in a stepwise manner with estimated K D values in the range of 0.8–3.0 and 5–23 μm (22Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Structurally, site II is more preformed for liganding to Ca2+ and, based on this and other considerations, is believed to have the higher affinity of the two (13Strynadka N.C.J. Cherney M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ca2+ titrations monitored by NMR spectral changes revealed that chemical shifts occur throughout the N domain upon binding of each Ca2+ (22Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Spyracopoulos L. Kloks C.P.A.M. Audette G. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12519-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An important structural feature involved in the tight coupling is a short antiparallel β-sheet comprised of a segment of each of the loops of sites I and II (for structural details, see Ref. 13Strynadka N.C.J. Cherney M. Sielecki A.R. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-induced transition from closed to open structures can be understood in terms of two hinge or pivot regions located in the loop regions of the two sites. Opening and closing of the structure would thus involve the reorientation of helices B/C at these pivot points relative to that of the N/A/D unit whose helical dispositions one to the other are virtually unchanged. Cardiac TnC, while highly homologous, differs in several important respects from its skeletal muscle counterpart. Amino acid sequence differences are largely confined to the first 41 residues corresponding to the N helix and site I EF-hand. Site I is deficient in Ca2+ binding due to an amino acid insertion and the substitution of Ca2+ liganding residues in its binding loop (27Van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Calcium binding to site II is relatively unaffected, however, with a dissociation constant similar to that of site II of the skeletal protein (23Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Spyracopoulos L. Kloks C.P.A.M.

Recently, the apo and Ca2+-saturated NMR solution structures of human cardiac intact and N domain TnCs have been reported (18Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Ca2+ binding is not accompanied by an “opening” of the regulatory domain and concomitant exposure of a hydrophobic surface area although Ca2+ binding to site II leads to spectral shifts throughout the entire N domain sequence (23Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Spyracopoulos L. Kloks C.P.A.M. Audette G. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12519-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In related NMR studies, Gagnéet al. (26Gagné S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown that with a mutated form of skeletal TnC in which the invariant Glu at position 41 of site I is replaced by Ala, the “closed” to “open” transition is impeded. An earlier study (31Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown that mutation of the equivalent Glu in rabbit sTnC to either Asp or Gln led to a reduction in Ca2+ binding and functional activity in a reconstituted skinned fiber assay. Gagnéet al. (20Gagné S.M. Li M.X. McKay R.T. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Gagné S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have suggested that in the wild-type protein initial Ca2+ binding to preformed site II would involve only minor structural changes but set the stage for Ca2+binding to site I. The latter would involve large conformational changes including opening of the structure. The invariant Glu41 at position 12 of site I was postulated to be the key residue in facilitating this structural transition. In order to provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of this Ca2+-sensitive regulatory switch, we have replaced the invariant Glu residue 41 or 77 by Ala in intact sTnCF29Wand in the recombinant N domains sNTnC and sNTnCF29W. The effects of mutating Glu77 on the properties of sTnC have not to our knowledge been previously investigated. Both Glu to Ala mutations in intact TnC largely abolished Ca2+-induced tension development in muscle skinned fibers. Of the total Ca2+-induced ellipticity change (Δ[θ]222 nm) in isolated wild-type N domain, ∼90% could be attributed to site II Ca2+ binding. With sNTnCE41A, sNTnCE77A, and cNTnC, this [θ]222 nm change associated with site II was reduced to ≤40% of that seen in sNTnC, a result consistent with impairment of the closed to open structural transition (26Gagné S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In keeping with this interpretation, the Ca2+-induced changes in fluorescence, near UV CD, and difference spectra observed with sTnCF29W are largely abolished with sTnCF29W/E41A and sTnCF29W/E77A. Our interpretation is that sites I/II in sTnC are highly interdependent, that the closed to open structural change is associated with Ca2+ binding to site II, and that the integrity of both sites I/II invariant Glu residues is essential for this important conformational transition. These deductions have important implications for interpretations of the intramolecular mechanisms for the opening of the skeletal structure and for energetic considerations of the skeletal and cardiac systems. To produce sTnCF29W/E77A, the double mutant of intact TnC, site-directed mutagenesis of M13mp19CII.Fx.sTnCF29W was performed by the oligonucleotide-directed (32Zoller M.J. Smith M.

BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar), uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was obtained by two rounds of transfection of the phagemid into competent E. coli CJ236 (ung−dut−) and subsequent infection by helper phage M13KO7. A 17-mer oligonucleotide 5′-CACCAAGGCGTTGGGCA-3′ (with base change underlined) was used to introduce the single mutation. After mutagenesis, ligation mix was transformed into competent DH5α, and transformants were selected on ampicillin plates. Eight colonies were screened by the dot blotting method and the DNA from positive colonies transformed into competent JM109. Single-stranded DNA was isolated and sequenced by the chain termination method (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52597) Google Scholar) to confirm the base change. Since suitable sites were not available for digestion by restriction enzymes, the intact double mutant sTnCF29W/E41A was subsequently produced by carrying out a second round of mutagenesis using the DNA from sTnCE41A as the template and the 17-mer oligonucleotide reported previously (34Pearlstone J.R.

TheEcoRI fragment with the entire coding region of sTnCF29W/E41A TnC was cloned into the phosphatasedEcoRI fragment of protein expression vector pLCII.Fx.sTnC.

PCR product IV was then cloned into pET3a via the engineered Ndel andBamHI sites. Construct pET3a.sNTnCE41A was made using the Stratagene mutagenesis protocol with pET3a.sNTnC as template, the 17-mer forward primer used previously for intact sTnCE41A, and its complementary 3′-reverse 17-mer primer. pET3a.cNTnC was constructed as follows: 1) the DNA region incorporating intact human slow skeletal TnC (equivalent in amino acid sequence to intact cardiac TnC) was transferred from clone TC1 (42Gahlmann R. Wade R. Gunning P. Kedes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) into the pET vector using PCR technology with TC1 as template, and the two primers 37-mer 5′-CCCGCGCCCCGCCATATGGATGACATCTACAAGGCT-3′ (withNdeI site underlined) and 30-mer 5′-GCTCTGGATCCAGGTCAGCATCTACTCCAC-3′ (with BamHI site underlined); 2) pET3a.cTnC (produced in step 1) was used as template in the next round of PCR to produce N domain construct pET3a.cNTnC by including in the PCR mixture the same 37-mer 5′-primer (with NdeI site) used initially and a 36-mer primer 5′-CCTCCTCAGGGATCCCCTAGCTGTCGTCCTTCATGC-3′ with a stop codon (in boldface type) after Ser89, followed by aBamHI site (underlined). Using theNdeI/BamHI sites, this second PRC product was cloned into pET3a. For the three N domain fragments sNTnCE41A and sNTnCE77A (residues 1–90), and cNTnC (residues 1–89), pET3a.sNTnCE41A, pET3a.sNTnCE77A or pET3a.cNTnC was transformed into Ca2+ competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) for inducible protein expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (43Studier F.W.

Final purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid analyses. Chemically skinned fibers were prepared from rabbit psoas muscle and stored in the presence of glycerol at −20 °C (44Eastwood A.B. Wood D.S. Bock K.L. Sorenson M.M.

Here we report that Nm23 proteins can phosphorylate geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphates to give triphosphates. Wild type Nm23-H1 had higher geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate kinase activities than did mutants of Nm23-H1 that do not inhibit cell motility. The phosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate appears to occur in vivo as cells with an elevated level of Nm23-H1 contained more farnesyl triphosphate than did control cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report that farnesyl triphosphate exists in cells. The phosphorylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate by Nm23 proteins could alter isoprenoid metabolism, and cells with an elevated level of Nm23 proteins were found to contain more farnesylated 46- and 24-kDa proteins than did control cells.

NDP kinases are thought to be responsible for maintaining nucleoside triphosphate pools; however, this activity does not account for all of the biological effects of Nm23 proteins.

However, with the exception of the transfer of phosphate fromEscherichia coli NDP kinase to a histidine on a Tar/EnvZ chimera (19Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these phosphotransferase reactions have not been shown to occur in vivo, and it has not been shown under which physiological conditions E. coli NDP kinase phosphorylates proteins. The binding of ADP to Nm23 proteins is primarily through the sugar and pyrophosphate; the base lies in a hydrophobic cleft and forms no specific polar interactions with the enzyme (22Morera S. Lascu I. Dumas C. LeBras G. Briozzo P. Veron M. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The lack of specific interaction between the base and the enzyme accounts for the ability of NDP kinase to phosphorylate a variety of nucleoside diphosphates and suggests that Nm23 proteins might also phosphorylate other kinds of diphosphates. Here we report that Nm23 proteins phosphorylate geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to give the corresponding triphosphates in vitro and that cells with an elevated level of Nm23-H1 contain an elevated level of farnesyl triphosphate (FTP). Isoprenoid pyrophosphates are important metabolic intermediates. FPP is a branch point in isoprenoid metabolism and is a precursor of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), cholesterol, heme A, ubiquinone, and dolichol phosphate (23Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that the isolated rat liver NDP kinase and the recombinant human Nm23 proteins were greater than 99% pure. Autophosphorylated Nm23 proteins or NDP kinases were made by incubating these proteins with [γ-32P]ATP (2 × 1015 cpm/mol) in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 5 min, and phosphorylated Nm23 proteins were separated from [γ-32P]ATP by gel filtration (20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After gel filtration, phosphorylated Nm23 proteins contained 0.4–0.5 mol of32P/mol of 18-kDa subunit. The concentrations of [32P]Nm23 proteins or [32P]NDP kinase given in this paper are the concentrations of 32P bound to the proteins after gel filtration. GPP, FPP, and GGPP were incubated in 100 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 0.5–1 μm [32P]Nm23 proteins or 1 μmNm23 proteins and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1/2 volume of 18 mm EDTA. Products of these reactions were analyzed by TLC on polyethyleneimine cellulose (PEI) sheets developed with either 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate/isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile (1:1:1) or 0.5 m NaCl and 0.75 m Tris, pH 7.5. The labeled products were detected by autoradiography and quantified using a Fuji Bio-Image Analyzer. C100 and H1-177 cells were lysed in 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.7, and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. These extracts (3.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at room temperature with 40 μm[γ-32P]ATP and either GPP or FPP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1/2 volume of 18 mm EDTA. Products of these reactions were analyzed by TLC on PEI sheets developed with 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate/isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile (1:1:1). H1-177 cell extracts were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 80 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-rat NDP kinase antibodies (26Vu N.D. Wagner P.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or preimmune IgG. These extracts were then incubated with Omnisorb Cells (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g. The level of Nm23 proteins in these extracts were determined by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 20 mm EDTA. Under these conditions, Nm23 proteins are specifically phosphorylated (20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). C100 and H1-177 cells were incubated with 25 μm lovastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, in culture medium for 8 h to reduce endogenous levels of mevalonate. The cells were then incubated for 16 h in culture medium containing 100 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonolactone (60 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 25 μm lovastatin. The cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5 mNH4OH in 75% ethanol at 75 °C (27Watson J.A. Havel C.M. Lobos D.V. Baker F.C. Morrow C.J. J. Biol.

The ethanolic phases were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min to remove denatured proteins. The supernatants were saved, and the pellets were reextracted with 0.5 mNH4OH in 75% ethanol at 75 °C. The supernatants were combined and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The isoprenoid phosphates in these extracts were fractionated by reverse phase, ion pair HPLC (28Beyer P. Kreuz K. Kleinig H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 248-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on a Hamilton PRP-1 (0.4 × 15-cm) HPLC column (29Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. Biochem.

The column was eluted using the following gradient: 0 min, 25% B; 2 min, 45% B; 36 min, 65% B; 50 min, 80% B. The flow rate was at 1 ml/min, and 0.5-min fractions were collected. The radioactivity in 100-μl aliquots was determined by scintillation counting. [3H]GPP, [3H]FPP, [3H]GGPP, [3H]FTP, and3H-labeled HPLC fractions were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase in 10 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm glycine, pH 9.5, for 6 h at room temperature. The resulting alcohols were extracted with chloroform/methanol (9:1) (30Farnsworth, C. C., Casey, P. J., Howald, W. N., Glomset, J. A., and Gelb, M. H. (1990) Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 231–240.Google Scholar) and analyzed on RP18F (Analtech) TLC plates developed with acetonitrile. The plates were sprayed with an EN3HANCE (DuPont), and the 3H-labeled alcohols were visualized by fluorography. C100 and H1-177 cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of 25 μm lovastatin. After washing, the cells were lysed in SDS sample. Aliquots containing 100 μg of protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, equilibrated in EN3HANCE (DuPont), and dried. 3H-Prenylated proteins were visualized by fluorography. C100 and H1-177 cells were also labeled by incubation with 50 μCi/ml [3H]FPP (20 Ci/mmol) or [3H]GGPP (20 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 25 μm lovastatin (31Danesi R. McLellan C.A. Myers C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 206: 637-643Google Scholar). To examine whether pyrophosphates, other than nucleoside diphosphates, are substrates for Nm23 proteins, autophosphorylated rat liver NDP kinase, [32P]NDP kinase, was incubated with 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm5′-phosphorylribose pyrophosphate, 1 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, or 100 μm GPP for 10 min. Only the incubation with GPP resulted in the removal of 32P from the NDP kinase (data not shown). Thin layer chromatography was used to examine the phosphorylation of the isoprenoid pyrophosphates by NDP kinases. Incubation of [32P]NDP kinase with GPP, FPP, and GGPP resulted in the formation of new 32P-labeled compounds (Fig.1). The 32P-labeled compound formed by the incubation of FPP with [32P]NDP kinase had the same mobility as the [3H]FTP standard and less than those of [3H]FPP and [3H]FMP. The32P-labeled compounds formed by the incubation of GPP and GGPP with [32P]NDP kinase had lower mobilities than the [3H]GPP and [3H]GGPP standards (Fig. 1). [32P]NDP kinase, nucleoside diphosphates, nucleoside triphosphates, and inorganic phosphate all remained at the origin. No new 32P-labeled compounds were formed when of GPP, FPP, and GGPP were incubated with [32P]NDP kinase in EDTA or with denatured [32P]NDP kinase in MgCl2. The products from the phosphorylation of GPP, FPP, and GGPP by [32P]NDP were also analyzed by reverse phase, ion pair HPLC. The 32P-labeled compound formed by the incubation of FPP with [32P]NDP kinase eluted at the same time as the [3H]FTP standard and after the [3H]FMP and [3H]FPP standards. The 32P-labeled compounds formed by the incubation of GPP and GGPP with [32P]NDP kinase eluted just after the corresponding pyrophosphate standards (data not shown). These results indicate that GPP and FPP, and to a lesser extent GGPP, were phosphorylated by [32P]NDP kinase to give the corresponding triphosphates. These kinase reactions showed specificity as incubation of [32P]NDP kinase with isopentenyl pyrophosphate, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, geranyl monophosphate, or FMP did not result in the formation of any new32P-labeled compounds. The time courses of 32P transfer from [32P]NDP kinase to GPP and FPP are shown in Fig.2, A and B. The half-lives of transfer of 32P to GPP and FPP were 9 and 28 min, respectively (Fig. 2 C). After 60 min, almost all of the32P was transferred from [32P]NDP kinase to GPP. Half the maximum rate of transfer occurred in about 125 μm GPP and in about 60 μm FPP. GPP and FPP were also phosphorylated when incubated with NDP kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The rates of phosphorylation of GPP and FPP by rat liver NDP kinase at room temperature were 1.2 ± 0.2 and 0.72 ± 0.07 nmol/min·mg, respectively (TableI), and at 37 °C the rates of phosphorylation of GPP and FPP were 4.5 ± 0.3 and 2.1 ± 0.3 nmol/min·mg, respectively. No phosphorylation was observed when GPP and FPP were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and no added NDP kinase. The phosphorylation of farnesyl and geranyl pyrophosphates by NDP kinase was catalytic; one molecule of NDP kinase transferred phosphates to many molecules of geranyl or farnesyl pyrophosphate.Table IGPP and FPP kinase activities of Nm23 proteinsNDP kinaseSubstrateGPPFPPnmols/min/mgRat liver1.2 ± 0.20.72 ± 0.08Nm23-H12.2 ± 0.20.78 ± 0.08Nm23-H1P96S0.51 ± 0.140.41 ± 0.03Nm23-H1S120G0.79 ± 0.030.38 ± 0.05Nm23-H1S120A2.7 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.1FPP and GPP kinase activities of Nm23 proteins were measured at room temperature in 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP and either 250 μm GPP or 225 μm FPP.

The half-life for the transfer of 32P from [32P]Nm23-H1 (autophosphorylated Nm23-H1) to GPP was 3 min, and the half-lives for the transfer of 32P from [32P]Nm23-H1S120G and [32P]Nm23-H1P96S GPP were about 10 min. The half-life for the transfer of 32P from [32P]Nm23-H1 to FPP was 22 min, and half-lives for the transfer of 32P from [32P]Nm23-H1S120G and [32P]Nm23-H1P96S to FPP were 50 and 80 min, respectively. C100 and H1-177 cell lines are stable transfectants of the highly metastatic human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cell line. The H1-177 line was transfected with nm23-H1, and C100 is a control transfectant (34Leone A. Flatow U. VanHoutte K. Steeg P.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2325-2333PubMed Google Scholar). H1-177 cells contain 5 times as much nm23-H1 as do C100 cells and have a lower metastatic potential. Extracts from these two cell lines were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and either GPP or FPP, and the products were examined by TLC (Fig.4). During the first 20 min of incubation, the rate of phosphorylation of GPP by H1-177 cell extracts was 1.95 ± 0.12 times (mean ± S.D. for three experiments) that by C100 extracts (Fig. 4 A). A similar result was obtained with FPP; the rate of phosphorylation by H1-177 cell extracts was 1.8 ± 0.3 times that by C100 extracts (Fig. 4 B). After 15–20 min, the amounts of [32P]GerTP and [32P]FTP in these extracts decreased; endogenous phosphatases dephosphorylated these triphosphates. During these incubations, some 32P was also transferred from [γ-32P]ATP to nucleoside diphosphates present in the extracts. After 15 min, most of the [γ-32P]ATP was hydrolyzed to give 32Pi (data not shown). GerTP and FTP were formed when these cell extracts were incubated with as little as 5 μm GPP or FPP. Extracts of H1-177 cells were partially depleted of Nm23 proteins by incubation with anti-rat liver NDP kinase antibodies. The depleted extracts gave less phosphorylation of GPP and FPP (Fig.5, A and B) than did the control extracts (treated with prebleed IgG). The rate of FPP phosphorylation by the depleted extracts was 45 ± 2% (mean ± S.D. for four experiments) that of the control extracts, and the rate of GPP phosphorylation by the depleted extracts was 54 ± 5% that of the control extracts. In three of the four experiments, the depleted extracts contained about half as much Nm23 proteins as did the control extracts (Fig. 5 C). In one trial, the depleted extract contained only 8% as many Nm23 proteins as did the control extract, but it still had about half the GPP and FPP kinase activities of the control extract. C100 and H1-177 cells were labeled with [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of lovastatin to inhibit the synthesis of endogenous mevalonate. C100 and H1-177 cells took up the same amounts of [3H]mevalonolactone. Isoprenoid phosphates were extracted from these cells and analyzed by reverse phase, ion-pair HPLC (Fig.6 A). The gradient used for this column (decreasing tetrabutylammonium phosphate and increasing acetonitrile) was optimized to separate FTP from FPP. Mevalonate phosphate, mevalonate pyrophosphate, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate were not retained on the column. The [3H]FTP standard eluted just after the [3H]FPP standard (Fig. 6 A), and32P-labeled GerTP, FTP, and geranylgeranyl triphosphates, made by the phosphorylation of the pyrophosphates with [32P]NDP kinase, eluted just after the pyrophosphate standards. The [3H]FMP standard eluted just before the [3H]FPP standard (Fig. 6 A). Four major peaks of 3H were obtained for both C100 and H1-177 cells (Fig. 6 A). Three of these eluted at the same times as the FPP, FTP, and GGPP standards. The fourth peak of3H did not elute with any of the standards. The3H-labeled compound that eluted from the HPLC column at the same time as the FTP standard had the same mobility on TLC (PEI sheet developed with acetic acid/acetonitrile/NaCl) as the [3H]FTP standard (Fig. 6 B, lane TP). Most of the 3H-labeled compounds that eluted from the HPLC column at the same time as the FPP standard had the same mobility as did the [3H]FPP standard (Fig.6 B, lane PP), but some had the same mobility as the [3H]FTP standard. The unidentified3H peak did not contain either FPP or FTP (Fig.6 B, lane UN). Farnesol and FMP moved with the solvent front. Dephosphorylation was used to show that the 3H-labeled compound that eluted from the HPLC column at the same time as the FTP standard contained farnesyl. Extracts from [3H]mevalonolactone-labeled H1-177 cells were separated on this reverse phase, ion pair HPLC column, and fractions that eluted at the same times as the FPP and FTP standards were treated with alkaline phosphatase. After dephosphorylation, both fractions contained [3H]farnesol (Fig. 6 C, lanes PP and TP), the expected product for the dephosphorylation of both [3H]FPP and [3H]FTP. These TLCs indicate that the 3H-labeled compounds in these cell extracts that eluted from the HPLC column at the same time as the FPP and FTP standards were FPP and FTP, respectively. As shown in Fig.6 A, the C100 cells contained more [3H]FPP than did H1-177 cells, and conversely, H1-177 cells contained more [3H]FTP than did the C100 cells. The ratio of [3H]FPP to [3H]FTP in C100 cells was about 2:1, and the ratio in H1-177 cells was about 1:1. Similar differences were observed with two other sets of cells. The unidentified3H peak and that for GGPP were about the same for C100 and H1-177 cells. Additional evidence that these cells contain FTP was obtained using a different HPLC system and a different TLC system. When the reverse phase HPLC column was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in NH4CHO3 (35Zhang D. Poulter C.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the elution of the [3H]FTP and [3H]FPP standards usually overlapped, but [3H]FTP started to elute slightly before [3H]FPP. The 3H-labeled compounds in extracts of H1-177 cells that eluted from this HPLC column at the same times as the FPP and FTP standards were examined by TLC (silica gel G developed with 1-propanol/NH4OH/H2O). Fraction 31 contained a 3H-labeled compound with the same mobility as the FTP standard (Fig. 6 D). Fraction 33 contained a3H-labeled compound with the same mobility as the FPP standard. The advantage of this TLC system is that mobility of FTP is much less than those of FPP and GGPP. Farnesol and FMP moved with the solvent front. This TLC system could not be used when the HPLC column (Fig. 6 A) was eluted with buffers containing tetrabutylammonium phosphate. Under basic conditions, tetrabutylammonium binds to isoprenoid pyrophosphates and triphosphates, causing them to remain at the origin. Prenyl transferases use FPP and GGPP to covalently attach farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups to cysteines near the C termini of certain intracellular proteins (25Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of Nm23 proteins on protein prenylation, C100 and H1-177 cells were labeled with [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of lovastatin (Fig. 7). Although the overall pattern of protein prenylation was the same in these two cell lines, the relative levels of prenylation differed. C100 and H1-177 cells contained comparable amounts of prenylated proteins of about 27 and 25 kDa, but H1-177 contained 80–100% more prenylated 46-kDa proteins and 40–50% more prenylated 24-kDa proteins than did the C100 cells. Farnesylated or geranylgeranylated proteins can be specifically labeled by incubating cells with either [3H]FPP or [3H]GGPP (31Danesi R. McLellan C.A. Myers C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 206: 637-643Google Scholar). When H1-177 and C100 cells were incubated with [3H]GGPP, both the pattern and extent of protein geranylgeranylation were comparable (Fig. 7). However, when incubated with [3H]FPP, more [3H]farnesyl was incorporated into proteins in H1-177 cells than into proteins in C100 cells. The greatest differences (50–100%) were in the amounts of [3H]farnesyl incorporated into proteins of 46 and 24 kDa, but there were also smaller differences in several other proteins. Western blots and enzymatic assays showed that C100 and H1-177 cells contain comparable levels of farnesyl transferase (data not shown). The 46- and 24-kDa farnesylated proteins have not yet been identified. The 24-kDa protein does not appear to be Ras, nor does the 46-kDa protein appear to be 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase, since under these conditions the fractions of these proteins farnesylated in H1-177 cells were the same as those in C100 cells (data not shown). The phosphorylation of GPP and FPP by Nm23 proteins provides a novel mechanism by which these proteins might exert their effects on metastasis, motility, or differentiation. In this paper, we report 1) the phosphorylation of GPP and FPP to the corresponding triphosphate by purified Nm23 proteins and by Nm23 proteins in crude cell extracts, 2) an increase in the concentration of FTP in cells that have an elevated level of Nm23-H1, and 3) an altered pattern of protein prenylation in cells that have an elevated level of Nm23-H1. We also show that Nm23-H1S120G, a mutant found in some aggressive neuroblastomas (32Chang C.L. Zhu X.X. Thoraval D.H. Ungar D. Rawwas J. Hora N. Strahler J.R. Hanash S.M. Radany E. Nature. 1994; 370: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), has reduced GPP and FPP kinase activities and that Nm23 proteins that inhibit cell motility have higher GPP and FPP kinase activities than do Nm23 proteins that do not inhibit cell motility. In contrast, NDP kinase activities and histidine to histidine protein phosphotransferase activities of Nm23 proteins (18Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wagner P.D. Steeg P.S. Vu N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and binding of Nm23 proteins to the c-myc promoter (36Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) do not correlate with inhibition of cell motility. A histidine to aspartate protein phosphotransferase activity of Nm23 proteins does appear to correlate with inhibition of motility (21Wagner P.D. Steeg P.S. Vu N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); however, the stoichiometry of this phosphotransferase reaction is very low. Only 2–4% of the phosphate bound to NDP kinase is transferred (37Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All of the phosphate bound to NDP kinase can be transferred to GPP or FPP. The rates of phosphorylation of GPP and FPP by Nm23 proteins (1–4 nmol/min/mg) in vitro are much less than rates of phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates (500 μmol/min/mg). However, the K m values for the phosphorylation of GPP and FPP by Nm23 proteins (60–125 μm) compare favorably with K m values for the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates (0.2–1 mm), and GPP and FPP effectively competed with nucleoside diphosphates for phosphorylation by Nm23 proteins in crude cell extracts. More importantly, cells with an elevated level of Nm23-H1 contained more FTP than did control cells. Isoprenoid pyrophosphates were detected by labeling cells with [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of lovastatin, an inhibitor of endogenous mevalonate synthesis. Under these conditions, the concentrations of GPP and FPP are lower than in the untreated cells. Our inability to detect GPP in these cells probably results from it being rapidly metabolized. NIH3T3 cells labeled using a similar protocol contained one-tenth as much GPP as FPP (29Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, neither FTP nor GerTP has been previously reported to be present in any type of cell. A possible explanation for this is that these triphosphates have not been directly looked for and that the published procedures used to fractionate cellular isoprenoid pyrophosphates do not separate triphosphates from pyrophosphates. When phosphorylated isoprenoids extracted from [14C]mevalonolactone-labeled NIH3T3 cells were fractionated by HPLC, a peak of 14C-labeled material eluted immediately before the FPP (29Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This peak was not identified, but perillyl alcohol, a monoterpene, caused an increase in both FPP and this unidentified peak. Depending on the solvent system used, FTP elutes immediately before or after FPP. Two observations suggest that mammalian cells may contain kinases other than Nm23 proteins that can phosphorylate GPP and FPP. 1) H1-177 cell extracts contain 5 times as many Nm23 proteins as do C100 cell extracts but only twice as much GPP and FPP kinase activity. 2) Immunodepleted H1-177 cell extracts contained as little as 8% as much Nm23 protein as did the control extract, but they retained half the GPP and FPP kinase activities. Extracts of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi contain a kinase that phosphorylates FPP to give FTP (38Shechter I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Unlike NDP kinases, this kinase is relatively specific for ATP, and it does not phosphorylate GPP. When labeled with [3H]mevalonolactone, H1-177 cells contained about twice as much FTP as did the C100 cells, and several prenylated proteins were almost twice as abundant in H1-177 cells as in C100 cells. These proteins appear to be farnesylated, since a similar result was obtained when the cells were labeled with [3H]FPP. Thus, at least under this condition, cells with an elevated level of Nm23 proteins have an increased level of protein farnesylation. These results predict that FTP is substrate for farnesyl transferase, and we have found that farnesyl transferase isolated from bovine brain will use FTP to farnesylate recombinant Ras. 2N.-D. Vu and P. D. Wagner, unpublished results. The labeling of prenylated proteins was performed in cells treated with lovastatin to inhibit the synthesis of endogenous mevalonate. In cells not treated with lovastatin, the amount of FPP may be sufficient for complete protein farnesylation. When cells not treated with lovastatin were examined, the fractions of Ras and lamin B farnesylated in H1-177 cells appeared to be the same as in C100 cells (data not shown). However, there did appear to be differences in the extent of prenylation of several low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins. FPP is a branch point in isoprenoid metabolism and is a precursor of GGPP, cholesterol, heme A, ubiquinone, and dolichol phosphate (23Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar, 24Grunler J. Ericsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 259-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). FPP and GGPP are used by prenyl transferases to prenylate proteins, many of which play critical roles in signal transduction, growth regulation, and cell motility. Farnesylation of oncogenic forms of Ras is essential for their transforming activity, and several small GTP-binding proteins involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton are prenylated. Cholesterol is involved in membrane structure and affects endocytosis and cell signaling. Dolichol phosphate functions as a saccharide carrier for protein glycosylation and for synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein anchors. The conversion of GPP or FPP to triphosphates could alter their flows through these pathways, resulting in changes in cellular metabolism that affect metastatic potential, cell motility, or differentiation (i.e. altered protein prenylation, membrane structure, or protein glycosylation). The observation that cells with an elevated level of FTP had an increased level of protein farnesylation suggests that cellular FTP is a substrate for farnesyl transferase but not for one or more of the other enzymes that use FPP as a substrate. GerTP and FTP may also have metabolic roles distinct from those of the pyrophosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2043032459,"The studies reported here address the molecular events underlying the interactions of arrestins with the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). In particular, we focused on the role of receptor phosphorylation in this process. Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR can occur at clusters of serines and threonines at positions 286–290 (site P1) or 307–311 (site P2) in the third intracellular loop (Pals-Rylaarsdam, R., and Hosey, M. M. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14152–14158). Phosphorylation at either P1 or P2 can support agonist-dependent internalization. However, phosphorylation at P2 is required for receptor interaction with arrestins (Pals-Rylaarsdam, R., Gurevich, V. V., Lee, K. B., Ptasienski, J. A., Benovic, J. L., and Hosey, M. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23682–26389). The present study investigated the role of acidic amino acids between P1 and P2 in regulating receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and receptor/arrestin interactions. Mutation of the acidic amino acids at positions 298–300 (site A1) and/or 304–305 (site A2) to alanines had significant effects on agonist-dependent phosphorylation. P2 was identified as the preferred site of agonist-dependent phosphorylation, and full phosphorylation at P2 required the acidic amino acids at A1 or their neutral counterparts. In contrast, phosphorylation at site P1 was dependent on site A2. In addition, sites A1 and A2 significantly affected the ability of the wild type and P1 and P2 mutant receptors to internalization and to interact with arrestin2. Substitution of asparagine and glutamine for the aspartates and glutamates at sites A1 or A2 did not influence receptor phosphorylation but did influence arrestin interaction with the receptor. We propose that the amino acids at sites A1 and A2 play important roles in agonist-dependent phosphorylation at sites P2 and P1, respectively, and also play an important role in arrestin interactions with the M2 mAChR. The studies reported here address the molecular events underlying the interactions of arrestins with the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR).

However, studies with peptide substrates have suggested that acidic amino acids such as aspartate or glutamate (Asp or Glu) at positions either N- or C-terminal to the phosphorylatable Ser/Thr appear to be required to direct GRKs to their substrates (15Palczewski K.

Receptor activation and phosphorylation serve as necessary triggers to convert visual arrestin (arrestin1) from a closed conformation into a high affinity conformation that can interact with Rh (23Hirsch J.A.

A similar mechanism is believed to govern the association of the β2AR with the non-visual arrestins, arrestin2 and -3 (30Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The requirement for phosphorylation of either Rh or the β2AR to allow for arrestin interaction can be bypassed under certain conditions. For example, mutations in the phosphorylation-recognition domain of arrestins can lead to a partial activation of arrestin and allow arrestin to interact with Rh and β2AR mutants that are unable to undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation (28Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

Arrestin/receptor interactions still require agonist activation of these GPCRs, but since these arrestin mutants can bind to non-phosphorylated Rh or β2AR, these arrestins are referred to as “phosphorylation-independent” forms of arrestins. Like Rh and the β2AR, the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 mAChR) undergoes agonist-dependent phosphorylation (31Kwatra M.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12429-12432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kwatra M.M. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hosey M.M.

However, the phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR occurs at Ser/Thr in the third intracellular (i3) loop of the receptor (34Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation can occur at two clusters of Ser/Thr, phosphorylation site one (P1, amino acids 286–290) and phosphorylation site two (P2, amino acids 307–311) (Fig. 1) (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at either P1 or P2 can support the agonist-induced internalization of the M2 mAChR in HEK cells; this internalization occurs via an arrestin-independent pathway (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

However, phosphorylation at P2 is required for desensitization and arrestin binding, whereas phosphorylation at P1 is unable to support either of these processes (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J.

Mutation of the Ser/Thr to alanines in P2 results in a loss of arrestin binding, even though phosphorylation can still occur at P1 (36Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A.

Of interest, unlike phosphorylation-deficient mutants of Rh and the β2AR, the M2 mAChR was unable to interact with phosphorylation-independent forms of arrestin when P2 was mutated (37Lee K.B.

This result was surprising given that the model of arrestin/receptor interaction developed from studies of Rh and the β2AR suggested that the role of phosphorylation of the GPCR was to help trigger activation of arrestin (23Hirsch J.A.

Since the P2 mutant of the M2 mAChR was unable to bind to phosphorylation-independent forms of arrestin, these results suggested that different molecular events participate in the interaction of arrestins with the M2 mAChR compared with those governing the interactions of arrestins with Rh or the β2AR. In particular, the results suggested that phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR at P2 might not be serving to activate arrestins in the same manner as phosphorylation of Rh or the β2AR (37Lee K.B.

In a recent study, we demonstrated that a phosphorylation-deficient M2 mAChR was able to interact with arrestin2 or -3 if 15 amino acids surrounding P2 (amino acids 304–319) were deleted (37Lee K.B.

These data indicated that P2 and surrounding amino acids were acting as an inhibitory element to preclude arrestin binding in the absence of phosphorylation of P2 (37Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A.

In the present study we have sought to elucidate further the molecular determinants of arrestin interactions with the M2 mAChR.

Mutants were prepared to test the roles of specific acidic amino acids that reside between the phosphorylatable Ser/Thr in the P1 and P2 clusters (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

The *A1A2 mutants were created using the primers for the A1 mutants using the WT*A2, *P1A2, and *P2A2 mutant constructs as templates, following the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. All mutations were verified by automated sequencing at the Northwestern University Biotechnology Laboratory. HEK-tsA201 cells (human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing simian virus 40 large T antigen) were cultured as described (39Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12967-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HEK-tsA201 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method followed by a rinse with 4 ml of culture medium and incubated with fresh culture medium until cells were utilized for assays 48–72 h post-transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of receptor cDNAs and either 5 μg of bovine arrestin2, dominant-negative arrestin3 (arrestin3-(293–405)), or 0.1 μg of hemagglutinin-tagged dominant-negative dynamin (dynK44A) cDNA. The affinities of the receptor mutants for carbachol were assayed in whole cell binding assays. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of carbachol in the presence of 2 nm [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to assess if the mutations made in the M2 mAChR influenced receptor affinity for carbachol. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Changes in the number of mAChRs present on the cell surface as a function of time of agonist exposure were measured using the hydrophilic radioligand,N-[3H]methylscopolamine, as described previously (39Lee K.B.

The cells used in these experiments expressed approximately 0.2–0.5 pmol of receptor per mg of protein at the cell surface. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined using the Student'st test. HEK-tsA201 cells transiently expressing the various receptor constructs were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM with 400 μCi of 32Pifor a minimum of 4 h and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm carbachol. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmNaPO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA in the presence of protease inhibitors (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

The resuspended cells were then lysed using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman) and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to collect the membrane fraction. The resulting pellet was solubilized in buffer containing a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS in lysis buffer for 1 h on ice. The solubilized fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with polyclonal anti-M2 mAChR antisera (raised in rabbits against the i3 loop raised of the M2 mAChR; Alamone Labs) and protein G-agarose (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed in solubilization buffer, resuspended in protein sample buffer, resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Receptor protein was detected using the anti-M2 mAChR polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitated receptors were quantified using densitometry and phosphate incorporation was determined by phosphorimage analysis using a Molecular Dynamics Storm system. Data were quantified using ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). The expression of arrestin2, dominant-negative arrestin3 (arrestin3-(293–405)), or hemagglutinin-tagged dominant-negative dynamin (hemagglutinin-dynK44A) was analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (39Lee K.B.

In order to investigate the role of specific acidic amino acids between the P1 and P2 phosphorylation clusters in the phosphorylation of the M2 mAChR and the role of these acidic amino acids on receptor interaction with arrestins, a series of mutants were made in which acidic amino acids between P1 and P2 were mutated (Fig.1). The mutations were made in wild type (WT), P1 mutant (*P1), and P2 mutant (*P2) backgrounds (35Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The receptor/G-protein coupling of all mutated constructs was intact, as all mutant receptors activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels in a manner similar to wild type M2 mAChR when stimulated with the agonist acetylcholine (data not shown). A summary of the affinity these receptors have for carbachol is shown in TableI. These receptor constructs all exhibited similar affinity for carbachol (Table I).

To investigate the role of specific acidic amino acids in the regulation of the M2 mAChRs, we examined the phosphorylation of receptor constructs in response to agonist treatment (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Studies with peptide substrates and purified GRKs have suggested that acidic amino acids act to direct GRK-mediated phosphorylation of specific Ser/Thr in GPCRs (16Onorato J.J. Palczewski K.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the activation of FVII to FVIIa, as well as occupation of the active site by pseudo-substrate inhibitors, results in conformational changes within the heavy chain with implications on cofactor and substrate interaction (13Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J.

To date, the conformational effects of these events on the TF-binding EGF-1 domain of the native FVII molecule have not been reported. Relevantly, experiments by Ambrosini et al. (16Ambrosini G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8340-8345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have described conformational changes in the region of the EGF-1 domain of the highly homologous FX molecule upon activation which appears to be needed for binding to effector cell protease receptor-1. Chang and co-workers (17Chang J.Y. Stafford D.W. Straight D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12227-12232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have also observed conformational change in the Gla/EGF-1 region of a FVII/FIX chimera upon proteolytic activation. As well, Persson and others (12Persson E. Petersen L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Persson E. Olsen O.H. Østergaard A. Nielsen L.S. J. Biol.

Conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with well characterized binding epitopes have been used as effective probes to study the conformational structure of proteins (for a review see Ref.21Goldberg M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 10: 358-362Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as to identify functional consequences of binding to epitopes (22Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15057-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently our laboratory has used a conformation-sensitive mAb, 231-7, to help characterize the nature of the naturally occurring FVII EGF-1 structural variant N57D (24Leonard B.J.N. Chen Q. Blajchman M.A. Ofosu F.A. Sridhara S. Yang D. Clarke B.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 142-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope specificity of mAb 231-7, within amino acid residues 51–88 of FVII (5Clarke B.J. Ofosu F.A. Sridhara S. Bona R.D. Rickles F.R. Blajchman M.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), makes it a unique tool to investigate conformational changes specifically involving the FVII EGF-1 domain. An understanding of the mechanisms by which the EGF-1 domain of FVII interacts with TF is of particular relevance, as the interaction of FVII with TF appears to play a critical role not only in coagulation, but in other biological processes such as tumor metastasis and angiogenesis (25Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Deng Y. Luther T. Muller M. Ziegler R. Waldherr R. Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The recent evidence that the interaction of FVIIa with TF elicits signal transduction indicates that these processes likely involve intracellular signaling events (27Poulsen L. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this report, we utilize the mAb 231-7 to investigate the conformational ramifications to the FVII EGF-1 domain upon the activation and active site occupation of the FVII molecule. We provide evidence demonstrating that both modifications are associated with conformational changes involving the FVII EGF-1 region, as well as providing evidence of functional consequences for these changes on cofactor binding and the catalytic activity of factor VII. Recombinant human FVIIa was purified from 293 cell culture supernatant 2R. Kelley, unpublished results. using a protocol adapted from Ref. 28Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Recombinant human FVII(R152Q) was purified from 293 cell culture supernatant using a protocol slightly modified from that described previously (29Ruiz S.M. Sridhara S. Blajchman M.A. Clarke B.J. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The FVII(R152Q) mutant was chosen because of its inability to become activated during the course of analysis, thus ensuring the zymogen conformation is maintained, as indicated by others (30Dickinson C.D.

Recombinant re-lipidated human TF (Ortho RecombiPlasTin®) was purchased from Hemoliance (Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). All FVII protein concentrations were determined by antigen assay as described previously (24Leonard B.J.N. Chen Q. Blajchman M.A. Ofosu F.A. Sridhara S. Yang D. Clarke B.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 142-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to AP was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (Bio/Can Scientific, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Monospecific rabbit anti-human FVII polyclonal sera were obtained from Diagnostica Stago (Wellmark Diagnostics, Guelph, Ontario, Canada).

Tween 20 detergent (Surfact-Amps) was obtained from Pierce. All other reagents were of the finest quality available. The chloromethyl ketone inhibitors were reconstituted according to the manufacturers instructions and diluted in reaction buffer immediately prior to reaction. FVIIa samples were diluted to 1 ml in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mMCaCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA) to a final FVIIa concentration of 1 μm and reacted with a 25 μm excess of chloromethyl ketone inhibitor (1 μl addition) for 30 min. At this time another 25 μm inhibitor was added (50 μm total), and the reaction mix incubated at room temperature for 2 h total. The reaction mixture underwent purification using a protein spin column (Millipore Ultrafree®, molecular mass cut-off at 5 kDa) with 3× buffer exchange into TBS, pH 8.0. The completeness of FVIIa inhibition was verified to be ∼99% using the prothrombin time assay, essentially as described previously (24Leonard B.J.N. Chen Q. Blajchman M.A. Ofosu F.A. Sridhara S. Yang D. Clarke B.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 142-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloromethyl ketone labeling was specific for the protease domain of factor VIIa, as judged by Western blot analysis. 10 μg of the appropriate FVII sample was diluted to a concentration of 1 μm in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml BSA) and the Gla-domainless FVIIa, -FVII(R152Q), -FPRckFVIIa,-D·EGRckFVIIa molecules were generated by cathepsin G-mediated proteolytic cleavage, according to the method of Nicoliasen et al. (32Nicholaisen E.M. Petersen L.C. Thim L. Jacobsen J.K. Christensen M. Hedner U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), shown to be specific for removal of the Gla domain. The samples were judged by Western blot to have achieved complete cleavage. No nonspecific cleavage patterns were seen. Reaction mixtures were stored frozen (−20 °C) before direct use in the binding affinity analyses. Relative bindings of native, heat-denatured, and DTT-reduced FVII zymogen to both mAb 231-7 and rabbit anti-human FVII polyclonal antibody were performed using an ELISA technique. Briefly, to prepare reduced FVII, plasma-derived FVII zymogen was pretreated overnight with 10 mm DTT, and to prepare heat-denatured FVII plasma-derived FVII zymogen was boiled for 5 min in 1% SDS followed by snap cooling. Native, DTT-reduced and heat-denatured FVII samples were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in carbonate antigen coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.6) in microtiter wells on an Immulon II 96 well microtiter plate. Microtiter wells were washed 3 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.025% Tween 20,) followed by blocking of nonspecific binding sites with blocking buffer (5 mg/ml BSA in TBS-T/Ca2+) for 3 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of mAb 231-7 or rabbit anti-human FVII polyclonal sera in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer, containing 5 mg/ml BSA, were incubated in triplicate in the sample wells for 3 h at room temperature. Sample wells were washed (3 times) with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer followed by incubation with either goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated AP for mAb 231-7 or goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated AP for the rabbit anti-FVII polyclonal sera, for 1 h at room temperature. Sample wells were washed with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer (3 times) followed by addition of AP substrate (100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, disodium, and hexahydrate) at 1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 405 nm on an Automated Microplate Reader (model EL 808, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) and plotted versusantibody concentration. Briefly, mAb 231-7 (100 ng/well) was immobilized in microtiter wells on a 96-well microtiter plate overnight at 4 °C in carbonate antigen-coating buffer. Nonspecific binding sites were subsequently blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer for ≥3 h at room temperature. After washing 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer, serial dilutions of FVII(R152Q), FVIIa, FPRckFVIIa, and D·EGRckFVIIa molecules in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer containing 2 mg/ml BSA were incubated in duplicate in the microtiter wells for 2 h at room temperature. Samples to be analyzed in the absence of Ca2+ were incubated in TBS-T/E buffer, replacing CaCl2 with 10 mm EDTA. Sample wells were then washed 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer and incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-human FVII polyclonal antibody (100 μl of 1 μg/ml antibody concentration) in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer containing 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Sample wells were washed again 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer, followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated AP in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer containing 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer, AP substrate was added (100 μl, 1 mg/ml in diethylanolamine buffer), and the color reaction was allowed to develop for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm on an automated microplate reader, and the results were plotted as absorbanceversus FVII concentration. The K D of mAb 231-7 for FVII(R152Q), FVIIa, BFPRckFVIIa, FPRckFVIIa, FFRckFVIIa, D·EGRckFVIIa, dGla-FVII(R152Q), dGla-FVIIa, dGla-FPRckFVIIa, dGla-FFRckFVIIa, dGla-D·EGRckFVIIa and the EGF-1 peptide were determined using the homogeneous solution phase method described by Friguet et al. (33Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 pm mAb 231-7-binding sites were incubated in buffer solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA) with serial dilutions of FVII molecules overnight with agitation at 4 °C. Samples to be measured in the absence of Ca2+ were incubated in buffer containing 10 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2. The amount of mAb 231-7 that remained unbound at equilibrium for each sample was determined using an ELISA. Briefly, for the ELISA, 25 ng/well of FVII zymogen was immobilized in 96-well microtiter plates by incubation overnight at 4 °C in carbonate antigen-coating buffer. After washing 2 times with TBS-T buffer, nonspecific binding sites were subsequently blocked with 2 mg/ml BSA in either TBS-T/Ca2+ or TBS-T/EDTA buffer for ≥3 h at room temperature. Following blocking, samples were incubated in duplicate in the blocked microtiter wells for 45 min at room temperature. Sample wells were then washed 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated AP in TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer containing 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Sample wells were washed again 5 times with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer followed by the addition of AP substrate (100 μl, 1 mg/ml in diethylanolamine buffer), and the color reaction was allowed to develop for 30 min. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using an automated microplate reader, with the raw ELISA data transformed and analyzed using Scatchard analysis with linear regression. Dissociation constants (K D) were determined from the reciprocal of the slope of the linear regression curves of the Scatchard plots (33Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Measurements of the inhibitory constant for 50% inhibition (IC50) of the interaction between biotinylated FVIIa and recombinant, relipidated human TF for the FVIIa, FPRckFVIIa, D·EGRckFVIIa, and FFRckFVIIa molecules were performed using a competitive ELISA, based on a method described previously by our laboratory (34Sridhara S. Chaing S. High K.A. Blajchman M.A. Clarke B.J. Am. J. Hematol. 1996; 53: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 100 nm FVIIa was incubated in amidolytic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml BSA) with increasing concentrations (see Fig. 3) of mAb 231-7, or a mAb not specific for FVII, for 3 h at room temperature (final volume, 100 μl). A 96-well microtiter plate was blocked for 3 h with amidolytic buffer + 1 mg/ml BSA. Spectrozyme FVIIa in amidolytic buffer (100 μl), at a final concentration of 200 μm, was added to the mAb/FVIIa mix and agitated. Aliquots of the mAb 231-7/FVIIa/substrate mix (100 μl) were incubated in triplicate in the 96-well microtiter plate, and the color was allowed to develop for 6 h at room temperature, at which time the absorbance at 405 nm was determined using the automated microplate reader. To verify the sensitivity of mAb 231-7 for perturbations in factor VII structure, the relative bindings of mAb 231-7 and polyclonal rabbit anti-human FVII antibody to native, heat-denatured, and DTT-reduced FVII zymogen were compared by ELISA. mAb 231-7 exhibited significantly reduced binding affinity to heat-denatured FVII zymogen compared with that for native FVII zymogen. In addition, the binding of mAb 231-7 to antigen was rendered negligible upon reduction of the FVII zymogen with 10 mm DTT. In contrast, the binding of native, heat-denatured, and DTT-reduced FVII zymogen to polyclonal rabbit anti-human FVII antibody was unaffected by either heat denaturation or DTT reduction treatment of the antigen, indicating that the observed reduction was specific for mAb 231-7 (data not shown). Immobilized mAb 231-7 specifically bound FVII(R152Q), FVIIa, FPRckFVIIa and D·EGRckFVIIa in both the presence and absence of Ca2+. In the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, mAb 231-7 bound FVII(R152Q), FVIIa, FPRckFVIIa, and D·EGRckFVIIa with distinctly different binding characteristics, indicative of different conformations in the region of the EGF-1 domain for each molecule. FVII(R152Q) bound immobilized mAb 231-7 with greatest affinity, followed by FPRckFVIIa, FVIIa, and D·EGRckFVIIa in descending order (Fig.1 A). In the absence of Ca2+, the binding differential between FVII(R152Q) and FVIIa could not be demonstrated, indicating the activation-dependent conformational change to be calcium-dependent. In the absence of Ca2+, FVIIa bound with greater affinity to immobilized mAb 231-7 than did any of the active site- inhibited FVIIa molecules analyzed (Fig.1 B). Fig.2 and TableI show the equilibrium binding data of various full-length FVII molecules to mAb 231-7. In the presence of Ca2+, mAb 231-7 bound FVII(R152Q) with aK D of 3.8 nm, a 2.5-fold greater affinity than that determined for FVIIa (K D = 9.7 nm). In the absence of calcium the affinity of FVIIa increased approximately 2.5-fold, such that there was no significant difference between the K D of FVII(R152Q) and FVIIa for mAb 231-7. In the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, FPRckFVIIa (4.0 nm) and BFPRckFVIIa (4.8 nm) bound mAb 231-7 with significantly greater affinity than FVIIa, whereas D·EGRckFVIIa (42 nm) bound mAb 231-7 with significantly less affinity (4-fold less) than FVIIa. FFRckFVIIa did not bind mAb 231-7 with a significantly different affinity than uninhibited FVIIa in the presence of calcium. Upon removal of Ca2+, the affinities of FPRckFVIIa and FFRckFVIIa for mAb 231-7 were not significantly altered (5.5 and 11 nm, respectively), whereas the affinity of D·EGRckFVIIa (19 nm) was increased significantly by approximately 2-fold, a value similar to the increase in affinity for uninhibited FVIIa.Table IAffinity of mAb 231–7 for various FVII moieties in the presence or absence of 10 mm Ca 2+SamplePresence of Ca2+Absence of Ca2+K DnK DnnmnmFVIIa9.7 ± 1.054.2 ± 1.05FVII(R152Q)3.6 ± 0.7 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.43.5 ± 0.64BFPRckFVIIa4.8 ± 1.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.3ND1-bND, not determined.FPRckFVIIa4.0 ± 1.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.35.5 ± 2.03FFRckFVIIa13.0 ± 3.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.311.0 ± 1.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.3D · EGRckFVIIa42.0 ± 9.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.419.0 ± 3.0 1-ap < 0.05 when compared with FVIIa, as determined using the Student's two-sample ttest.3The data show the mean and S.D. of the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) for the various FVII moieties in their interaction with mAb 231–7, as determined by the method of Friguet et al.

Table II shows the equilibrium binding data for various FVII molecules with the Gla domain removed, as well for the isolated EGF-1 peptide. Removal of the Gla domain resulted in a 2-fold reduction in binding affinity for dGla-FVIIa for mAb 231-7 compared with that seen for FVIIa in the presence of calcium (19 versus 9.7 nm) (TableIII). This contrasts with the apparent increase in mAb 231-7 binding affinity for dGla-FVII(R152Q) compared with that seen for FVII(R152Q) (1.7 versus 3.8 nm). The removal of the Gla domain thus increased the affinity differential between the zymogen and active form of FVII for mAb 231-7 from 2.5- to 10-fold in the presence of calcium and no difference to 10-fold difference in the absence of calcium. Gla removal increased the mAb 231-7 affinity of D·EGRckFVIIa almost 4-fold in the presence of calcium. Gla removal also increased the affinity of D·EGRckFVIIa in the absence of calcium to 12.3 nm, eliminating the calcium-dependent difference. Gla removal decreased the mAb 231-7 affinity of FPRckFVIIa in both the presence (7.2 nm) and absence (10 nm) of calcium, showing no calcium-dependent difference in affinity for mAb 231-7. Gla removal had no significant effect on the mAb 231-7 affinity for FFRckFVIIa in either the presence or absence of calcium (data not shown). As well, the presence or absence of calcium had no significant effect on the mAb 231-7 binding affinity of the isolated EGF-1 peptide.Table IIAffinities of dGlaFVII derivatives and the isolated EGF-1 domain to mAb 231–7SamplePresence of Ca2+Absence of Ca2+K DnK DnnmnmdGlaFVIIa19.0 ± 4.0324.0 ± 6.03dGlaFVII(R152Q)1.7 ± 0.2 2-ap < 0.05 when compared with dGlaFVIIa, as determined using the Student's t test.32.5 ± 0.4 2-ap < 0.05 when compared with dGlaFVIIa, as determined using the Student's t test.3dGlaFPRckFVIIa7.2 ± 2.0 2-ap < 0.05 when compared with dGlaFVIIa, as determined using the Student's t test.310.0 ± 7.04dGlaD · EGRckFVIIa11.0 ± 2.0 2-ap < 0.05 when compared with dGlaFVIIa, as determined using the Student's t test.312.0 ± 5.03FVII EGF-19.4 ± 3.0 2-ap < 0.05 when compared with dGlaFVIIa, as determined using the Student's t test.414.0 ± 4.03The data show the mean and S.D. of the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) of dGlaFVIIa, dGlaFVII(R152Q), dGlaFPRckFVIIa, dGlaD · EGRckFVIIa, and the isolated FVII EGF-1 peptide for mAb 231–7, as determined by the method of Friguet et al.
