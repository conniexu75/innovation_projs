https://openalex.org/W4292774518,"The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is an integral process that converts feedstock materials into high-value synthetic intermediates1-3. The most viable method to achieve this in one chemical step is with ozone4-7; however, this poses technical and safety challenges owing to the explosive nature of ozonolysis products8,9. Here we report an alternative approach to achieve oxidative cleavage of alkenes using nitroarenes and purple-light irradiation. We demonstrate that photoexcited nitroarenes are effective ozone surrogates that undergo facile radical [3+2] cycloaddition with alkenes. The resulting 'N-doped' ozonides are safe to handle and lead to the corresponding carbonyl products under mild hydrolytic conditions. These features enable the controlled cleavage of all types of alkenes in the presence of a broad array of commonly used organic functionalities. Furthermore, by harnessing electronic, steric and mediated polar effects, the structural and functional diversity of nitroarenes has provided a modular platform to obtain site selectivity in substrates containing more than one alkene."
https://openalex.org/W4292634223,"The extracellular pH is a vital regulator of various biological processes in plants. However, how plants perceive extracellular pH remains obscure. Here, we report that plant cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes can function as extracellular pH sensors. We found that pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) dramatically alkalinizes the acidic extracellular pH in root apical meristem (RAM) region, which is essential for root meristem growth factor 1 (RGF1)-mediated RAM growth. The extracellular alkalinization progressively inhibits the acidic-dependent interaction between RGF1 and its receptors (RGFRs) through the pH sensor sulfotyrosine. Conversely, extracellular alkalinization promotes the alkaline-dependent binding of plant elicitor peptides (Peps) to its receptors (PEPRs) through the pH sensor Glu/Asp, thereby promoting immunity. A domain swap between RGFR and PEPR switches the pH dependency of RAM growth. Thus, our results reveal a mechanism of extracellular pH sensing by plant peptide-receptor complexes and provide insights into the extracellular pH-mediated regulation of growth and immunity in the RAM."
https://openalex.org/W4292646798,"Skeletal muscle regeneration depends on the correct expansion of resident quiescent stem cells (satellite cells), a process that becomes less efficient with aging. Here, we show that mitochondrial dynamics are essential for the successful regenerative capacity of satellite cells. The loss of mitochondrial fission in satellite cells-due to aging or genetic impairment-deregulates the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), leading to inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and mitophagy and increased oxidative stress. This state results in muscle regenerative failure, which is caused by the reduced proliferation and functional loss of satellite cells. Regenerative functions can be restored in fission-impaired or aged satellite cells by the re-establishment of mitochondrial dynamics (by activating fission or preventing fusion), OXPHOS, or mitophagy. Thus, mitochondrial shape and physical networking controls stem cell regenerative functions by regulating metabolism and proteostasis. As mitochondrial fission occurs less frequently in the satellite cells in older humans, our findings have implications for regeneration therapies in sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W4292633994,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease involving multiple immune cells. To elucidate SLE pathogenesis, it is essential to understand the dysregulated gene expression pattern linked to various clinical statuses with a high cellular resolution. Here, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome study with 6,386 RNA sequencing data covering 27 immune cell types from 136 SLE and 89 healthy donors. We profiled two distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures: disease-state and disease-activity signatures, reflecting disease establishment and exacerbation, respectively. We then identified candidate biological processes unique to each signature. This study suggested the clinical value of disease-activity signatures, which were associated with organ involvement and therapeutic responses. However, disease-activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants than disease-state signatures, suggesting that current genetic studies may not well capture clinically vital biology. Together, we identified comprehensive gene signatures of SLE, which will provide essential foundations for future genomic and genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W4292646795,"Quiescence regulation is essential for adult stem cell maintenance and sustained regeneration. Our studies uncovered that physiological changes in mitochondrial shape regulate the quiescent state of adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We show that MuSC mitochondria rapidly fragment upon an activation stimulus, via systemic HGF/mTOR, to drive the exit from deep quiescence. Deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 and mitochondrial fragmentation transitions MuSCs into G-alert quiescence, causing premature activation and depletion upon a stimulus. OPA1 loss activates a glutathione (GSH)-redox signaling pathway promoting cell-cycle progression, myogenic gene expression, and commitment. MuSCs with chronic OPA1 loss, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, continue to reside in G-alert but acquire severe cell-cycle defects. Additionally, we provide evidence that OPA1 decline and impaired mitochondrial dynamics contribute to age-related MuSC dysfunction. These findings reveal a fundamental role for OPA1 and mitochondrial dynamics in establishing the quiescent state and activation potential of adult stem cells."

As of August 1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report over 23,000 cases in 80 countries. An inclusive and global collaborative effort to understand the biology, evolution, and spread of the virus as well as commitment to vaccine equity will be critical toward containing this outbreak. We share the voices of leading experts in this space on what they see as the most pressing questions and directions for the community."
https://openalex.org/W4292767252,"There are a number of questionnaires assessing the self-reported trait-like aspect of interoception, also called interoceptive sensibility (ISb). Based on the varying purposes of their development and characteristics, however, it is not likely that they assess exactly the same construct. In a community sample of 265 adults, we examined this assumption for three commonly used questionnaires of ISb, namely the Body Awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ-BA), the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ), and the eight subscales of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). We investigated their associations, and their relation to positive and negative affect and somatosensory amplification. According to the results of correlation analysis, BPQ-BA, BAQ and MAIA were partly unrelated to each other, partly showed weak to moderate positive associations. Also, differences with respect to their association with positive and negative affect were found. These findings suggest that the investigated questionnaires cannot be used interchangeably to assess the subjective aspect of interoception, and the term ISb is not appropriately defined."
https://openalex.org/W4292767227,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves severe acute respiratory syndrome and poses unprecedented challenges to global health. Structure-based drug design techniques have been developed targeting the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2, responsible for viral replication and transcription, to rapidly identify effective inhibitors and therapeutic targets. Herein, we constructed a phytochemical dataset of 1154 compounds using deep literature mining and explored their potential to bind with and inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The three most effective phytochemicals Cosmosiine, Pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, and Cleomiscosin A had binding energies of -8.4, -8.4, and -8.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in the docking analysis. These molecules could bind to Gln189, Glu166, Cys145, His41, and Met165 residues on the active site of the targeted protein, leading to specific inhibition. The pharmacological characteristics and toxicity of these compounds, examined using absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analyses, revealed no carcinogenicity or toxicity. Furthermore, the complexes were simulated with molecular dynamics for 100 ns to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen profiles from the simulation trajectories. Our analysis validated the rigidity of the docked protein-ligand. Taken together, our computational study findings might help develop potential drugs to combat the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 and help alleviate the severity of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4292767256,"No microbiological criteria were included in the 2018 EFP-AAP classification of periodontal diseases that could be used to differentiate between stages and grades. Furthermore, differences in the subgingival microbiome depending on stage and grade have not been established. Sixty subgingival biofilm samples were collected in Spain (n = 30) and Colombia (n = 30) from three distinct patient categories: those with periodontal health/gingivitis (n = 20), those with stage I-II periodontitis (n = 20), and those with stage III-IV periodontitis (n = 20). Patients were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene amplification sequencing. Amplicon sequence variants were used to assign taxonomic categories compared to the Human Oral Microbiome Database (threshold ≥97% identity). Alpha diversity was established by Shannon and Simpson indices, and principal coordinate analysis, ANOSIM, and PERMANOVA of the UNIFRAC distances were performed using QIIME2. Although differences in the alpha diversity were observed between samples according to country, Filifactor alocis , Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-4] bacterium HMT 369, Fretibacterium fastidiosum , Lachnospiraceae [G-8] bacterium HMT 500, Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-5] [Eubacterium] saphenum , Peptostreptococcus stomatis , and Tannerella forsythia were associated with periodontitis sites in all stages. However, only F . alocis , Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-4] bacterium HMT 369, Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-9] [Eubacterium] brachy , Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-5] [Eubacterium] saphenum , and Desulfobulbus sp. HMT 041 were consistent in stage III-IV periodontitis in both countries. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were differentially expressed in severe lesions in the countries studied. Although some non-cultivable microorganisms showed differential patterns between the different stages of periodontitis, they were not the same in the two countries evaluated. Further studies using larger samples with advanced next-generation techniques for high-throughput sequencing of phyla and non-cultivable bacteria within the subgingival microbiome could provide more insight into the differences between stages of periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W4292787717,"The outcomes anxiety and depression are measured frequently by healthcare providers to assess the impact of a disease, but with numerous instruments. PROMIS item banks provide an opportunity for standardized measurement. Cross-cultural validity of measures and the availability of reference values are prerequisites for standardized measurement.PROMIS Anxiety and Depression item banks were completed by 1002 representative Dutch persons. To evaluate cross-cultural validity, data from US participants in PROMIS wave 1 were used and differential item functioning (DIF) was investigated, using an iterative hybrid of logistic regression and item response theory. McFadden's pseudo R2-change of 2% was the critical threshold. The impact of any DIF on full item banks and short forms was investigated. To obtain Dutch reference values, T-scores for anxiety and depression were calculated for the complete Dutch sample, and age-group and gender subpopulations. Thresholds corresponding to normal limits, mild, moderate and severe symptoms were computed.In both item banks, two items had DIF but with minimal impact on population level T-scores for full item banks and short forms. The Dutch general population had a T-score of 49.9 for anxiety and 49.6 for depression, similar to the T-scores of 50.0 of the US general population. T-scores for age-group and gender subpopulations were also similar to T-scores of the US general population. Thresholds for mild, moderate and severe anxiety and depression were set to 55, 60 and 70, identical to US thresholds.The limited number of items with DIF and its minimal impact, enables the use of standard (US) item parameters and comparisons of scores between Dutch and US populations. The Dutch reference values provide an important tool for healthcare professionals and researchers to evaluate and interpret symptoms of anxiety and depression, stimulating the uptake of PROMIS measures, and contributing to standardized outcome measurement."
https://openalex.org/W4292767178,"Focal epileptic seizures can remain localized or, alternatively, spread across brain areas, often resulting in impairment of cognitive function and loss of consciousness. Understanding the factors that promote spread is important for developing better therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that: (1) seizure spread undergoes “critical” phase transitions in models (epileptor-networks) that capture the neural dynamics of spontaneous seizures while incorporating patient-specific brain network connectivity, axonal delays and identified epileptogenic zones (EZs). We define a collective variable for the spreading dynamics as the spread size, i.e. the number of areas or nodes in the network to which a seizure has spread. Global connectivity strength and excitability in the surrounding non-epileptic areas work as phase-transition control parameters for this collective variable. (2) Phase diagrams are predicted by stability analysis of the network dynamics. (3) In addition, the components of the Jacobian’s leading eigenvector, which tend to reflect the connectivity strength and path lengths from the EZ to surrounding areas, predict the temporal order of network-node recruitment into seizure. (4) However, stochastic fluctuations in spread size in a near-criticality region make predictability more challenging. Overall, our findings support the view that within-patient seizure-spread variability can be characterized by phase-transition dynamics under transient variations in network connectivity strength and excitability across brain areas. Furthermore, they point to the potential use and limitations of model-based prediction of seizure spread in closed-loop interventions for seizure control."
https://openalex.org/W4292767226,"Background Maternal and child mortality remains a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Improving short birth interval practice is a main strategy to reduce neonatal mortality, maternal mortality, adverse pregnancy outcomes, high fertility rate, and enhance economic development efforts. However, there has been limited study done regarding short birth intervals in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to assess short birth intervals and associated factors among women who gave birth in the last three years in Dembecha district, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 880 reproductive-age multipara mothers using a stratified cluster sampling technique. The data were collected by face-to-face interviews through pretested and semi-structured questionnaires. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted. Variables with a p-value ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant factors. Adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the association between predictors and the outcome variable. Results The prevalence of short birth interval was found to be 43.4% (95% CI: 40.2, 46.9). Husband education (able to read and write) [AOR:2.81,(95% CI:1.04,7.85)], wealth index (lowest quartile) [AOR:3.75,(95% CI:2.35,5.97), residence (urban) [AOR:3.20,(95% CI:1.62,6.33)],age at first marriage (15–17 years old) [AOR: 1.65,(95% CI:1.15, 2.26),and non-use of contraceptive [AOR: 8.78, (95% CI: 6.18, 12.47) were statistically significant variables. Conclusion The study revealed that the prevalence of short birth intervals among multipara women is found to be high. Husband education, wealth index, urban residence, age at first marriage, and non-use of contraceptives were variables significantly associated with short birth intervals. Hence, to overcome the problem the focus should be on increasing family planning utilization, avoiding early marriage, strengthening paternal education, and improving family income."
https://openalex.org/W4292767232,"AFRICAT is a prospective cohort study intending to develop an atrial fibrillation (AF) screening program through the combination of blood markers, rhythm detection devices, and long-term monitoring in our community. In particular, we aimed to validate the use of NT-proBNP, and identify new blood biomarkers associated with AF. Also, we aimed to compare AF detection using various wearables and long-term Holter monitoring.359 subjects aged 65-75 years with hypertension and diabetes were included in two phases: Phase I (n = 100) and Phase II (n = 259). AF diagnosis was performed by baseline 12-lead ECG, 4 weeks of Holter monitoring (NuuboTM), and/or medical history. An aptamer array including 1310 proteins was measured in the blood of 26 patients. Candidates were selected according to p-value, logFC and biological function to be tested in verification and validation phases. Several screening devices were tested and compared: AliveCor, Watch BP, MyDiagnostick and Fibricheck.AF was present in 34 subjects (9.47%). The aptamer array revealed 41 proteins with differential expression in AF individuals. TIMP-2 and ST-2 were the most promising candidates in the verification analysis, but none of them was further validated. NT-proBNP (log-transformed) (OR = 1.934; p<0.001) was the only independent biomarker to detect AF in the whole cohort. Compared to an ECG, WatchBP had the highest sensitivity (84.6%) and AUC (0.895 [0.780-1]), while MyDiagnostick showed the highest specificity (97.10%).The inclusion and monitoring of a cohort of primary care patients for AF detection, together with the testing of biomarkers and screening devices provided useful lessons about AF screening in our community. An AF screening strategy using rhythm detection devices and short monitoring periods among high-risk patients with high NT-proBNP levels could be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W4292847796,"Mental well-being among low-income urban populations is arguably challenged more than any other population amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms and quality of life among Malaysia's multi-ethnic urban lower-income communities.This is a community-based house-to-house survey conducted from September to November 2020 at the Petaling district in Selangor, Malaysia. Five hundred and four households were identified using random sampling, and heads of eligible households were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years with a monthly household income ≤RM6960 (estimated $1600) without acute psychiatric illness. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D were used for depression, anxiety, and quality of life, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for the final analysis.A total of 432 (85.7%) respondents with a mean age of 43.1 years completed the survey. Mild to severe depression was detected in 29.6%, mild to severe anxiety in 14.7%, and problematic quality of life in 27.8% of respondents. Factors associated with mild to severe depression were younger age, chronic health conditions, past stressful events, lack of communication gadgets and lack of assets or commercial property. While respiratory diseases, marital status, workplace issues, financial constraints, absence of investments, substance use and lack of rental income were associated with mild to severe anxiety. Attributing poverty to structural issues, help-seeking from professionals, and self-stigma were barriers, while resiliency facilitated good psychological health. Problematic quality of life was associated with depression, older age, unemployment, cash shortage, hypertension, diabetes, stressful life events and low health literacy.A high proportion of the sampled urban poor population reported mild to severe anxiety and depression symptoms. The psychosocial determinants should inform policymakers and shape future work within this underserved population."

We address two challenges: 1) limited number of cases in MRSI datasets and 2) interpretability of results in the form of relevant spectral regions.A shallow CNN with only one hidden layer and an ad-hoc loss function was constructed involving two branches for processing spectral and image features of a brain voxel respectively. Each branch consists of a single convolutional hidden layer. The output of the two convolutional layers is merged and fed to a classification layer that outputs class predictions for the given brain voxel.Our CNN method separated glioma grades 3 and 4 and identified Alzheimer's disease patients using MRSI and complementary MRI data with high MCC score (Area Under the Curve were 0.87 and 0.91 respectively). The results demonstrated superior effectiveness over other popular methods as Partial Least Squares or Support Vector Machines. Also, our method automatically identified the spectral regions most important in the diagnosis process and we show that these are in good agreement with existing biomarkers from the literature.Shallow CNNs models integrating image and spectral features improved quantitative and exploration and diagnosis of brain diseases for research and clinical purposes.

https://openalex.org/W4293105112,"Bullet fragments have been previously observed in the remains and edible portions of big game animals that were harvested using rifles. The fragmentation issue has attracted attention because traditional hunting bullets are more than 70% lead, which is toxic to humans and scavengers in the ecosystem. We prepared gunshot wounds in ballistic gelatin blocks, and then applied synchrotron X-ray imaging technology to the bullet fragmentation process for the first time. The K edge subtraction (KES) imaging method allowed a clear separation of lead in an image from false positives, including the other major bullet component, copper, and non-lead objects such as bone fragments. The superior brightness of synchrotron radiation was also harnessed to resolve thousands of embedded sub-10 μm fragments, a size range not previously observed using commonly applied X-ray imaging modalities. The results challenge the current understanding of the maximum extent that fragments may be distributed, and the effectiveness of imaging methods used to screen wild game donations at food banks for lead bullet fragments."
https://openalex.org/W4293105747,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy. In this paper, we use the Phillips curve to compare and analyze the macroeconomics of three different countries with distinct income levels, namely, lower-middle (Nigeria), upper-middle (South Africa), and high (Canada) income. We aim to (1) find macroeconomic changes in the three countries during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time, (2) compare the countries in terms of response to the COVID-19 economic crisis, and (3) compare their expected economic reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in the near future. An advantage to our work is that we analyze macroeconomics on a monthly basis to capture the shocks and rapid changes caused by on and off rounds of lockdowns. We use the volume and social sentiments of the Twitter data to approximate the macroeconomic statistics. We apply four different machine learning algorithms to estimate the unemployment rate of South Africa and Nigeria on monthly basis. The results show that at the beginning of the pandemic the unemployment rate increased for all the three countries. However, Canada was able to control and reduce the unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, in line with the Phillips curve short-run, the inflation rate of Canada increased to a level that has never occurred in more than fifteen years. Nigeria and South Africa have not been able to control the unemployment rate and did not return to the pre-COVID-19 level. Yet, the inflation rate has increased in both countries. The inflation rate is still comparable to the pre-COVID-19 level in South Africa, but based on the Phillips curve short-run, it will increase further, if the unemployment rate decreases. Unfortunately, Nigeria is experiencing a horrible stagflation and a wild increase in both unemployment and inflation rates. This shows how vulnerable lower-middle-income countries could be to lockdowns and economic restrictions. In the near future, the main concern for all the countries is the high inflation rate. This work can potentially lead to more targeted and publicly acceptable policies based on social media content."
https://openalex.org/W4292633092,"Neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex represent the formation of a decision when it is linked to a specific action, such as an eye movement to a choice target. However, these neurons should be unable to represent a decision that transpires across actions that would disrupt this linkage. We investigated this limitation by simultaneously recording many neurons from two rhesus monkeys. Although intervening actions disrupt the representation by single neurons, the ensemble achieves continuity of the decision process by passing information from currently active neurons to neurons that will become active after the action. In this way, the representation of an evolving decision can be generalized across actions and transcends the frame of reference that specifies the neural response fields. The finding extends previous observations of receptive field remapping, thought to support the stability of perception across eye movements, to the continuity of a thought process, such as a decision."
https://openalex.org/W4292633938,"Of the neurotransmitters that influence neurogenesis, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an outstanding role, and GABA receptors support non-synaptic signaling in progenitors and migrating neurons. Here, we report that expression levels of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endozepine that modulates GABA signaling, regulate embryonic neurogenesis, affecting the long-term outcome regarding the number of neurons in the postnatal mouse brain. We demonstrate that DBI is highly expressed in radial glia and intermediate progenitor cells in the germinal zones of the embryonic mouse brain that give rise to excitatory and inhibitory cells. The mechanism by which DBI controls neurogenesis involves its action as a negative allosteric modulator of GABA-induced currents on progenitor cells that express GABAA receptors containing γ2 subunits. DBI's modulatory effect parallels that of GABAA-receptor-mediating signaling in these cells in the proliferative areas, reflecting the tight control that DBI exerts on embryonic neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4292767214,"COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of vaccines against its etiologic agent, SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new variants of the virus lead to the generation of new alternatives to improve the current sub-unit vaccines in development. In the present report, the immunogenicity of the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion and a water-in-oil emulsion with squalene was evaluated in mice and hamsters. The RBD protein was expressed in insect cells and purified by chromatography until >95% purity. The protein was shown to have the appropriate folding as determined by ELISA and flow cytometry binding assays to its receptor, as well as by its detection by hamster immune anti-S1 sera under non-reducing conditions. In immunization assays, although the cellular immune response elicited by both adjuvants were similar, the formulation based in water-in-oil emulsion and squalene generated an earlier humoral response as determined by ELISA. Similarly, this formulation was able to stimulate neutralizing antibodies in hamsters. The vaccine candidate was shown to be safe, as demonstrated by the histopathological analysis in lungs, liver and kidney. These results have shown the potential of this formulation vaccine to be evaluated in a challenge against SARS-CoV-2 and determine its ability to confer protection."
https://openalex.org/W4292844468,"Surgical and FFP2 masks are recommended to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The cardiopulmonary effects of facemasks in patients with chronic heart failure are unknown. This prospective, cross-over study quantified the effects of wearing no mask (nm), surgical mask (sm), and FFP2 mask (ffpm) in patients with stable heart failure.12 patients with clinically stable chronic heart failure (HF) (age 63.8±12 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 43.8±11%, NTProBNP 573±567 pg/ml) underwent spiroergometry with and without masks in a randomized sequence. Comfort/discomfort was assessed using a standardized questionnaire.Maximum power was reduced with both types of masks (nm: 108.3 W vs. sm: 101.2 W vs. ffpm: 95.6 W, p<0.01). Maximum respiratory oxygen uptake (1499ml/min vs. 1481 ml/min vs. 1300 ml/min, p = 0.95 and <0.01), peak ventilation (62.1 l/min vs. 56.4 l/min vs. 50.3 l/min, p = 0.15 and p<0.05) and O2-pulse (11.6 ml/beat vs. 11.8 ml/beat vs. 10.6 ml/beat, p = 0.87 and p<0.01) were significantly changed with ffpm but not sm. Discomfort was moderately but significantly increased (nm: 1.6 vs. sm: 3.4 vs. ffpm: 4.4, p<0.05).Both surgical and FFP masks reduce exercise capacity in heart failure patients, while FFP2 masks reduce oxygen uptake and peak ventilation. This reduction in cardiopulmonary performance should be considered in heart failure patients whose daily life activities are often just as challenging as exercise is for healthy adults."

Monitoring of water mass loss due to perspiration was performed by medical balance measurements following one of two different treadmill physical exercise regimens over 90 minutes in 15-minute intervals with intervening 10-minute rest periods. Participants wore two different models of the dehydration body monitor device mated to commercially-available smartwatches (Samsung Gear S2 and Samsung Gear Fit2). Device output was recorded by Bluetooth wireless link to a standard smartphone in 20-second blocks. Comparison of the devices with the standard measurement method (change in body mass measured by medical balance) indicated very close agreement between changes in body water mass and device output (percent normalized mean root square error averaged approximately 2% for all participants). Bland-Altman analyses of method agreement indicated that &lt;5% of participant values fell outside of the 95% confidence interval limits of agreement and all measured value differences were normally distributed around the line of equality. The results of this first-ever field trial of a practical, wearable hydration monitor suggests that this device will be a reliable tool to aid in geriatric hydration monitoring and physical training scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4293105708,"Smoke from Hazard Reduction Burns (HRBs) and wildfires contains pollutants that are harmful to human health. This includes particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM 2.5 ), which affects human cardiovascular and respiratory systems and can lead to increased hospitalisations and premature deaths. Better models are needed to predict PM 2.5 levels associated with HRBs so that agencies can properly assess smoke pollution risk and balance smoke risk with the wildfire mitigation benefits of HRBs. Given this need, our aim was to develop a probabilistic model of daily PM 2.5 using Bayesian regression. We focused on the region around Sydney, Australia, which regularly has hazard reduction burning, wildfires and associated smoke. We developed two regional models (mean daily and maximum daily) from observed PM 2.5 , weather reanalysis and satellite fire hotspot data. The models predict that the worst PM 2.5 in Sydney occurs when PM 2.5 was high the previous day, there is low ventilation index (i.e. the product of wind speed and planetary boundary layer height), low temperature, west to northwest winds in the Blue Mountains, an afternoon sea breeze and large areas of HRBs are being conducted, particularly to the west and north of Sydney. A major benefit of our approach is that models are fast to run, require simple inputs and Bayesian predictions convey both predicted PM 2.5 and associated prediction uncertainty. Future research could include the application of similar methods to other regions, collecting more data to improve model precision and developing Bayesian PM 2.5 models for wildfires."
https://openalex.org/W4292767202,"Background COVID‐19 vaccination acceptance is important, and combating hesitancy which is generally based on the individuals’ beliefs and perceptions is essential in the present pandemic. This study assesses COVID‐19 vaccine hesitancy and associated factors, beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 492 Bangladeshi residents (76% male; mean age = 24.21 ± 4.91 years; age range = 18–50 years) prior to the nationwide mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign (September 28, 2021). A semi-structured e-questionnaire included three sections (demographic variables, beliefs around the vaccination, and perceived barriers regarding COVID-19 vaccination). Results More than a quarter of participants (26.42%) were hesitant, 70.33% reported to accept the vaccine, and 3.25% refused to be vaccinated. While (54%) believed that mass vaccination would be the most effective method to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns regarding the side effects of the vaccine (58%), inadequate vaccine trials before human administration (43%), commercial profiteering (42%), and mistrust of the benefits of the vaccine (20%) were also reported. In addition, other barriers including a short supply of vaccines, unknown future adverse effects (55%), low confidence in the health system (51%), doubts regarding its effectiveness (50%) and safety (45%), and insufficient information regarding potential adverse effects (44.7%) were reported. In bivariate analysis, variables such as current political affiliation, previous vaccination history, and health status were significantly associated with the COVID-19 vaccine uptake variable (acceptance, hesitancy, refusal). Regression analysis showed that participants who identified with the opposing current political parties, and not having been vaccinated since the age of 18 years were significantly more likely to report vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions The current findings relating to COVID-19 vaccination demonstrate that government and policy makers need to take all necessary measures to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccination program among the Bangladeshi people."

It is necessary to identify the influencing factors of postoperative pneumonia in patients with hip fracture.Elderly patients with hip fractures admitted to a tertiary hospital in China from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021 were included. The characteristics of patients with and without postoperative pneumonia were evaluated and compared. Logistic multivariate regression analyses were conducted to assess the risk factors of postoperative pneumonia.267 patients with hip fracture were included, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients with hip fracture was 13.11%. There were significant differences in the age, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, anesthesia method and duration of surgery between infection and no infection group, no significant differences in the gender, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type of fracture, preoperative oxygen saturation, white blood cell count, platelet count, red blood cell count, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, estimated blood loss during surgery were detected between infection and no infection group. Logistic regression analysis showed that age≥70y (OR2.326, 95%CI1.248~3.129), diabetes mellitus (OR2.123, 95%CI1.021~3.551), anemia (OR3.199,95%CI1.943~5.024), hypoalbuminemia (OR2.377, 95%CI1.211~3.398), general anesthesia (OR1.947, 95%CI1.115~3.038), duration of surgery≥120min (OR1.621, 95%CI1.488~2.534) were the risk factors of postoperative pneumonia in elderly patients with hip fracture (all p<0.05). Escherichia Coli (33.33%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.57%), Staphylococcus aureus (21.43%) were the most common bacteria of pulmonary infection.There are many risk factors for postoperative pneumonia in elderly patients with hip fractures after surgery. In clinical practice, medical workers should take targeted interventions for those risk factors to reduce postoperative pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4292767236,"Background Despite efforts made towards the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission, socioeconomic inequality in prenatal HIV test uptake in East Africa is not well understood. Therefore, this study aimed at measuring socioeconomic inequalities in prenatal HIV test uptake and explaining its main determinants in East Africa Method We analysed a total weighted sample of 45,476 women aged 15–49 years who birthed in the two years preceding the survey. The study used the most recent DHS data from ten East African countries (Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). The socioeconomic inequality in prenatal HIV test uptake was measured by the concentration index and illustrated by the concentration curve. Then, regression based Erreygers decomposition method was applied to quantify the contribution of socioeconomic factors to inequalities of prenatal HIV test uptake in East Africa. Results The concentration index for prenatal HIV test uptake indicates that utilization of this service was concentrated in higher socio-economic groups with it being 15.94% higher among these groups in entire East Africa (p &lt;0.001), 40.33% higher in Ethiopia (p &lt;0.001) which was the highest and only 1.87% higher in Rwanda (p &lt;0.01) which was the lowest. The decomposition analysis revealed that household wealth index (38.99%) followed by maternal education (13.69%), place of residence (11.78%), partner education (8.24%), watching television (7.32%), listening to the radio (7.11%) and reading newsletters (2.90%) made the largest contribution to socioeconomic inequality in prenatal HIV test in East Africa. Conclusion In this study, pro-rich inequality in the utilization of prenatal HIV tests was evident. The decomposition analysis findings suggest that policymakers should focus on improving household wealth, educational attainment, and awareness of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) through various media outlets targeting disadvantaged sub-groups."
https://openalex.org/W4292767245,"The COVID-19 outbreak brought online learning to the forefront of education. Scholars have conducted many studies on online learning during the pandemic, but only a few have performed quantitative comparative analyses of students' online learning behavior before and after the outbreak. We collected review data from China's massive open online course platform called icourse.163 and performed social network analysis on 15 courses to explore courses' interaction characteristics before, during, and after the COVID-19 pan-demic. Specifically, we focused on the following aspects: (1) variations in the scale of online learning amid COVID-19; (2a) the characteristics of online learning interaction during the pandemic; (2b) the characteristics of online learning interaction after the pandemic; and (3) differences in the interaction characteristics of social science courses and natural science courses. Results revealed that only a small number of courses witnessed an uptick in online interaction, suggesting that the pandemic's role in promoting the scale of courses was not significant. During the pandemic, online learning interaction became more frequent among course network members whose interaction scale increased. After the pandemic, although the scale of interaction declined, online learning interaction became more effective. The scale and level of interaction in Electrodynamics (a natural science course) and Economics (a social science course) both rose during the pan-demic. However, long after the pandemic, the Economics course sustained online interaction whereas interaction in the Electrodynamics course steadily declined. This discrepancy could be due to the unique characteristics of natural science courses and social science courses."
https://openalex.org/W4292845400,"Background Despite vaccine and antiviral treatment availability, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to circulate among pregnant women in Iraq. HBV spread is due to many factors. This study evaluated HBV prevalence among pregnant women and Syrian refugees residing in Zakho city, Iraq, and identified risk factors associated with infection. Materials and methods Demographic data were collected from 2,054 pregnant women via a questionnaire assessing risk factors associated with HBV infection. Blood samples were collected for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and were screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Tests revealed that 1.1% of pregnant women in Zakho and 11.3% of Syrian refugees ( p = 0.001) were positive for HBsAg. The average age of HBsAg-positive patients was 31.4286 ± 6.6746 years ( p = 0.002). Average rates of parity and abortion in HBV-infected subjects were 3.5 ± 2.6874 and 0.1785 ± 0.5479, respectively ( p = 0.044 and 0.012, respectively). The following were identified as associated risk factors for HBV infection: nationality, (Zakho versus the city centre), tattoos, and polygamy ( p = 0.001, 0.03, 0.007, and 0.001, respectively). No significant associations between HBV prevalence and blood transfusion, prior injection history, dental procedures, or surgical procedures were found. Conclusion The prevalence of HBV infection among Syrian refugees was higher than that of indigenous participants. Several risk factors were significantly associated with HBV positivity, which may facilitate effective preventive program implementation and decrease mother-to-child transmission risk. This will likely reduce infant and childhood HBV chronicity, and mortality rates."
https://openalex.org/W4292847070,"Stress associated proteins (SAPs) in plants have a key role in providing tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. SAP gene family in Solanum tuberosum has not been fully studied before. This study identified 17 StSAP genes in S. tuberosum which code for A20/AN1 zinc-finger proteins. All the genes were distributed on ten different chromosomes and six segmental duplication events were identified. The SAPs in S. tuberosum and its orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana were classified into six groups through the phylogenetic analysis. Introns across StSAP genes were identified in four genes. The promotor study of the StSAP genes showed different hormone and stress-related cis-elements that could potentially have a role in environmental stress response. The expression of StSAP genes in response to heat, mannitol, and salt were analyzed through in silico transcriptomic analysis. This study could potentially help in further understanding the functions of SAP genes in S. tuberosum."
https://openalex.org/W4293104216,"Canine obesity is becoming an increasingly prevalent concern among companion animal veterinarians and professionals alike. A number of sociodemographic, dietary, and exercise related variables have been shown to be predictive of a dog's bodyweight, however, all previous surveys designed to address these variables have been focussed on only one area of the world at a time. The objective of this survey was to investigate how an owner's exercise routine influences their dog's exercise routine and which of the owner's dietary and exercise habits influence their perception of their dog's body weight. The survey included respondents across France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The survey was distributed online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics XM, Utah, USA) and a total of 3,298 responses were collected, equally distributed across country and between sexes. Comparison of column proportions and multinomial logistic regression were performed in SPSS Statistics (Version 26, IBM Corp, North Castle, New York, USA). Respondents from Germany were more likely to exercise their dog for a longer amount of time, rank the importance of exercise as extremely important, report that their dog is an ideal body weight, and were less likely to report that someone (including a veterinarian) had told them their dog was overweight. Results from linear regression revealed that those who had been told their dog was overweight, those who restrict their dog's food intake to control weight, those who select a weight control diet and those who give their dog more other foods (treats, table scraps, fruits/vegetables) on a daily basis were all less likely to believe that their dog is an ideal body weight. In contrast, only those who reported doing more vigorous exercise themselves or those who reported that their dog performs vigorous exercise were more likely to believe that their dog is an ideal body weight. The results highlight owner's perceptions of healthy weight and the role of nutrition and exercise. Owner's intentions and attitudes towards the value of exercise and promoting an ideal body weight in their dog should be explored, but may require a One Health approach to ensure successful weight management among both dogs and their owners."
https://openalex.org/W4292767163,"Barefoot shoes have recently become a popular alternative to conventional shoes among the parents of pre-school children. As the long-term effect of habitual shoe-wearing on the foot is still unclear, the aim of this study was to compare the arch index, dynamic foot anthropometry and gait parameters in toddlers who had been habitually wearing barefoot shoes or conventional shoes since their first steps.30 toddlers- 15 habitually wearing barefoot shoes (BF group) and 15 habitually wearing conventional shoes (N-BF group)-participated in this study. Each child was measured twice during the study. The first data collection session occurred within one month after the first five consecutive unsupported steps were performed by the toddler. The second data collection session occurred seven months after this event. At each data collection session, the toddler was instructed to walk barefooted at its natural speed over an Emed® platform (Novel GmbH, Germany). The Emed ® software generated data regarding the arch index, dynamic foot anthropometry, foot progression angle, contact area, contact time, peak pressure and maximum force. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the differences between the 1st and 2nd data collections. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between the BF and N-BF groups.The results of this study show a higher plantar arch and a smaller foot progression angle in the BF group. The forefoot width in both the BF and N-BF groups remained proportional to the foot length after seven months of independent walking.These findings may encourage parents and caregivers to introduce barefoot shoes or create a habitual barefoot time for their child."
https://openalex.org/W4292767177,"Existing learning-based methods for low-light image enhancement contain a large number of redundant features, the enhanced images lack detail and have strong noises. Some methods try to combine the pyramid structure to learn features from coarse to fine, but the inconsistency of the pyramid structure leads to luminance, color and texture deviations in the enhanced images. In addition, these methods are usually computationally complex and require high computational resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient adaptive feature aggregation network (EAANet) for low-light image enhancement. Our model adopts a pyramid structure and includes multiple multi-scale feature aggregation block (MFAB) and one adaptive feature aggregation block (AFAB). MFAB is proposed to be embedded into each layer of the pyramid structure to fully extract features and reduce redundant features, while the AFAB is proposed for overcome the inconsistency of the pyramid structure. EAANet is very lightweight, with low device requirements and a quick running time. We conducted an extensive comparison with some state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, parameters, computations and running time on LOL and MIT5K datasets, and the experiments show that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of comprehensive performance. The proposed method reconstructs images with richer color and texture, and the noises is effectively suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W4292767197,"In a time of worldwide physician shortages, the advanced practice providers (APPs) might be a good alternative for physicians as the leaders of a rapid response team. This retrospective analysis aimed to establish whether the performance of APP-led rapid response teams is comparable to the performance of rapid response teams led by a medical resident of the ICU.In a retrospective single-center cohort study, the electronic medical record of a tertiary hospital was queried during a 12-months period to identify patients who had been visited by our rapid response team. Patient- and process-related outcomes of interventions of rapid response teams led by an APP were compared with those of teams led by a medical resident using various parameters, including the MAELOR tool, which measures the performance of a rapid response team.In total, 179 responses of the APP-led teams were analyzed, versus 275 responses of the teams led by a resident. Per APP, twice as many calls were handled than per resident. Interventions of teams led by APPs, and residents did not differ in number of admissions (p = 0.87), mortality (p = 0.8), early warning scores (p = 0.2) or MAELOR tool triggering (p = 0.19). Both groups scored equally on time to admission (p = 0.67) or time until any performed intervention.This retrospective analysis showed that the quality of APP-led rapid response teams was similar to the quality of teams led by a resident. These findings need to be confirmed by prospective studies with balanced outcome parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4292767217,"This paper takes a practice-based approach to the study of cultural identity, focusing on how raw material and technical choices involved in the production of quotidian tools served to both reproduce, and reflect a social group’s very way of being. We then consider the (dis)continuity of obsidian blade-making traditions from Middle–Late Bronze Age Malia (north-central Crete), i.e., before and after a period of island-wide destructions, and appearance of foreign elements believed to reflect the arrival of a population from the Greek mainland (Mycenaeans). Methodologically this involves an integrated, ‘thick description’ obsidian characterisation study to detail long-term cultural traditions, including the use of Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) to source the raw materials of 36 artifacts. The results show a significant degree of continuity in the community’s lithic traditions, suggesting that many of the innovative features at Malia can be interpreted in terms of local factions appropriating new and foreign means of social distinction, rather than wholescale changes in community composition."
https://openalex.org/W4292767235,"Substantial evidence suggests an important role of liver function in brain health. Liver function is clinically assessed by measuring the activity of hepatic enzymes in the peripheral blood. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of brain function. Therefore, we hypothesized that blood BDNF levels are associated with liver function and fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, in this cross-sectional study, we investigated whether serum BDNF concentration is associated with liver enzyme activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index in middle-aged and older women. We found that serum BDNF level showed a significant positive association with ALT and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity and negative association with FIB-4 index, and a trend of negative association with the AST/ALT ratio after adjustment for age. Additionally, these associations remained statistically significant even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose level. These results demonstrate associations of serum BDNF levels with liver enzymes and hepatic fibrosis-related indices, which may underlie liver-brain interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4292767260,"Although farmlands are the most extensive terrestrial biomes, the abandonment of traditional agriculture in many parts of the world has brought opportunities and challenges for the restoration of such human-disturbed habitats. Seed arrival is a crucial necessary ecological process during plant recolonization that can be enhanced by the use of the so-called ""perch plants"". Little is known, however, about whether the seed arrival via frugivorous birds is affected by the spatial distribution of the perch plants in disturbed habitats. To evaluate several spatial aspects of ""perching"" effect, we used a spatially explicit approach in two disturbed plots within the Doñana National Park (SW Spain). Specifically, we chose as study system the pioneer Mediterranean dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis L., which is often used as a perch by a variety of frugivorous bird species. A total of 289 C. humilis individuals were sampled in search of bird feces (N = 2998) and dispersed seeds (N = 529). Recorded seeds belonged to six different woody species from five different families. Nine bird species from six different families were recorded using C. humilis as perches. GLMs analyses indicated that taller C. humilis males with higher numbers of spatially associated woody species received more dispersed seeds. We detected a random spatial structure of bird feces and dispersed seeds in one study plot, while a nonrandom spatial structure was found in the other one, where isolated C. humilis received a higher number of bird feces and dispersed seeds than expected under spatial null models. The difference in spatial patterns between both study plots could relate, among other factors, to their different state of development in the ecological succession. Most of dispersed seeds were concentrated in a small number of C. humilis individuals, usually male and large ones, that acted as ""hotspots"" of seed arrival. The fact that frugivorous birds in one study site visited most often isolated C. humilis questions the aggregated spatial structure of revegetation designs typically used in restoration projects. This study reveals novel spatial aspects of the ""perching"" effect which could be helpful in the restoration of human-disturbed habitats worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4292767261,"A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter ECG have been established as gold standards for detection of arrhythmias. Recently, wearable ECG monitoring devices have been available. Our purpose of the present study was to investigate whether a novel wearable electrode embedded in an undershirt is useful for ECG monitoring and detection of arrhythmias.We studied 31 consecutive hospitalized patients who underwent catheter ablation of tachyarrhythmias. Patients equipped a wearable electrode and a lead CM5 of Holter ECG simultaneously, and total heart beats, maximum heart rate (HR), mean HR, minimum HR, detections of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and premature ventricular contractions (Lown's grade >II), were compared between the two methods using a Holter ECG analysis software.Median recording time of ECG by wearable electrodes was 12.6 hours. Strong correlations between the two methods were observed in total heart beats (R = 0.999, P <0.001), maximum HR (R = 0.997, P <0.001), mean HR (R = 0.999, P <0.001), minimum HR (R = 0.989, P <0.001) and QRS duration (R = 0.900, P <0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent concordance between each parameter measured by two methods. In addition, the detection of atrial fibrillation (nine events), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (two events), and premature ventricular contractions of Lown's grade >II (five events) were concordant in two methods. In addition, there were no significant difference in parameters of time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of heart rate variability between the two methods.The usefulness of a novel electrode embedded in an undershirt is equivalent to that of a Holter ECG in monitoring the ECG and detection of arrythmias."
https://openalex.org/W4292767270,"The relative age effect (RAE) is a well-established phenomenon in football. However, while the majority of previous studies focussed on established football nations, it remains unclear if the constraint of a limited population of soccer players in smaller countries associated with less strict selection procedures may reduce the risk of RAE. This study aims to investigate the RAE in Luxembourg that follows an 'open-door' selection policy in youth football due to the limited pool of players. Birthdates from all licensed and actively playing Luxembourgish youth footballers including all players of the youth national teams (396 girls and 10981 boys) competing in the season 2018/2019 were analysed and categorised into birth quarters and semesters. To further investigate a performance dependence of the RAE in amateur leagues, success was determined based on the teams' rankings at the end of the season. Differences between observed and expected birthdate distributions were calculated across all licensed players and age groups, within the national teams, and for the top- and bottom-tier football teams using chi-square statistics. While a RAE was absent across all age groups (except U7), significant RAEs with high effect sizes were observed in the top-level and national teams. These findings contrast the substantial RAE effects in large football nations and suggest that open selection systems might reflect an environmental constraint that limit the prevalence of RAE in football. Further, this study indicates that a performance dependence of the RAE is not limited to high level football but already occurs on an amateur level."
https://openalex.org/W4292846841,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in aqueous humor (AH) from dogs with anterior uveitis and post-operative ocular hypertension (POH) following phacoemulsification, in AH from dogs with primary glaucoma, and in normal healthy eyes with no signs of anterior uveitis or other ocular diseases.An exploratory study including 21 samples of AH collected from 15 dogs; post-phacoemulsification with anterior uveitis and POH ('POH group', n = 10 samples), primary glaucoma ('glaucoma group', n = 6 samples), and normal ('normal group', n = 5 samples). Target mass spectrometry via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM-MS) with the Canine Cytokine SpikeMix™ as internal standard was used to measure the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.The MRM-MS method measured 15 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels in AH were different between all three groups (glaucoma>POH>normal) (p = .05, p = .02, respectively). Additionally, IL-6 was higher in the 'POH group' compared to the 'glaucoma group' (p = .04) and IL-4 was higher in the 'POH group' compared to the 'normal group' (p = .04). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was positively associated with increased AH levels of IL-18 (Spearman correlation = .64, p = .03).MRM-MS using the Canine Cytokine SpikeMix™ as an internal standard was established as a method to detect pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in canine AH. The study demonstrated increased levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, and TNFα in AH from canines with POH following phacoemulsification. Primary glaucomatous eyes had the highest levels of IL-18 and TNFα which may indicate that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of primary glaucoma in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4292847736,"Background Leishmaniases are diseases caused by Leishmania protozoans that affect around 12 million people. Leishmania promastigotes are transmitted to vertebrates by female phlebotomine flies during their blood meal. Parasites attach to phagocytic cells, are phagocytosed and differentiate into amastigotes. We previously showed that PH8 and LV79 strains of Leishmania amazonensis have different virulence in mice and that their amastigotes differ in their proteomes. In this work, we compare promastigotes’ infectivity in macrophages, their proteomes and morphologies. Methods/Principal findings Phagocytosis assays showed that promastigotes adhesion to and phagocytosis by macrophages is higher in PH8 than LV79. To identify proteins that differ between the two strains and that may eventually contribute for these differences we used a label-free proteomic approach to compare promastigote´s membrane-enriched fractions. Proteomic analysis enabled precise discrimination of PH8 and LV79 protein profiles and the identification of several differentially abundant proteins. The proteins more abundant in LV79 promastigotes participate mainly in translation and amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, while the more abundant in PH8 are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton composition and vesicle/membrane trafficking. Interestingly, although the virulence factor GP63 was more abundant in the less virulent LV79 strain, zymography suggests a higher protease activity in PH8. Enolase, which may be related to virulence, was more abundant in PH8 promastigotes. Unexpectedly, flow cytometry and morphometric analysis indicate higher abundance of metacyclics in LV79. Conclusions/Significance Proteome comparison of PH8 and LV79 promastigotes generated a list of differential proteins, some of which may be further prospected to affect the infectivity of promastigotes. Although proteomic profile of PH8 includes more proteins characteristic of metacyclics, flow cytometry and morphometric analysis indicate a higher abundance of metacyclics in LV79 cultures. These results shed light to the gaps in our knowledge of metacyclogenesis in L . amazonensis , and to proteins that should be studied in the context of infection by this species."
https://openalex.org/W4292952163,"The kinase IKKβ controls pro-inflammatory gene expression, and its activity in the liver and leukocytes was shown to drive metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. However, it was also proposed that liver IKKβ signaling protects obese mice from insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by increasing XBP1s protein stability. Furthermore, mice lacking IKKβ in leukocytes display increased lethality to lipopolysaccharides. This study aims at improving our understanding of the role of IKKβ signaling in obesity. We induced IKKβ deletion in hematopoietic cells and liver of obese mice by Cre-LoxP recombination, using an INF-inducible system, or a liver-specific IKKβ deletion in obese mice by adenovirus delivery of the Cre recombinase. The histopathological, immune, and metabolic phenotype of the mice was characterized. IKKβ deletion in the liver and hematopoietic cells was not tolerated in mice with established obesity exposed to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) and exacerbated liver damage and ER-stress despite elevated XBP1s. By contrast, liver-specific ablation of IKKβ in obese mice reduced steatosis and improved insulin sensitivity in association with increased XBP1s protein abundance and reduced expression of de-novo lipogenesis genes. We conclude that IKKβ blockage in liver and leukocytes is not tolerated in obese mice exposed to TLR3 agonists. However, selective hepatic IKKβ ablation improves fatty liver and insulin sensitivity in association with increased XBP1s protein abundance and reduced expression of lipogenic genes."

A total of 575 (18.2%) symptomatic patients and 4 (4.4%) asymptomatic patients developed the severe illness. All asymptomatic patients recovered; no deaths were observed in this group. The median duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic patients was 17 (interquartile range, 9.25-25) days. Patients with higher levels of ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (odds ratio [OR] = 1.025, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.04), lower red blood cell volume distribution width (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.88), lower creatine kinase Isoenzyme(0.94, 0.89-0.98) levels, or lower lesion ratio (OR = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.33) at admission were more likely than their counterparts to have asymptomatic disease.Patients with younger ages and fewer comorbidities are more likely to be asymptomatic. Asymptomatic patients had similar laboratory characteristics and longer virus shedding time than symptomatic patients; screen and isolation during their infection were helpful to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4292767180,"Under field conditions, the moisture content of rock changes with the weather during prolonged creep. In order to investigate the effect of moisture content change on long-term shear strength and deformation behavior, a shear apparatus for intact rock was developed. Since three prefabricated holes are drilled in the upper part of the rock sample, the water injection device and the gas injection device can be used to inject water and gas into the rock sample alternately during the test to adjust the moisture content without removing the normal load and shear load. By using silicone gasket and seals in the shear box, fluid injection at a pressure of 5 MPa was achieved without leakage. Shear creep tests of argillaceous shale were conducted under both constant and dynamic moisture conditions, and the results were described by the Nishihara model. The experimental results revealed that there are significant differences in the long-term shear strength and deformation of argillaceous shale under different moisture content conditions. The proposed rock shear apparatus can advance the quantitative study of the shear creep properties of rock samples during moisture content changes and has certain practical application value for the prediction of engineering rock mass stability during rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W4292767225,"Background This retrospective cohort study investigated the risk of major bleeding events during the concurrent use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and anticoagulants in clinical practice. Methods A total of 4,470 patients receiving anticoagulant drugs were selected from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Half (n = 2,235) were also using CHMs (CHM cohort); the other half were not (non-CHM cohort). Each cohort was matched 1:1 using the propensity score. Chi-square testing and the Student’s t -test were used to examine differences between two cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis assessed the risks for major bleeding events in each cohort, as well as bleeding risks associated with specific CHM formulas and herbs. Cumulative incidence curves for major bleeding events were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Compared with the non-CHM cohort, the CHM cohort had a lower risk of overall bleeding events (p &lt; 0.001) including hemorrhagic stroke (p = 0.008), gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (p &lt; 0.001), urogenital bleeding (p ≤ 0.001) and nasal/ear/eye bleeding (p = 0.004). Single herbs, such as Glycyrrhiza uralensis et Rhizoma , Panax notoginseng , Panax ginseng , Platycodon grandiflorum , Eucommia ulmoides Oliver and formulas, such as Shu Jing Huo Xue Tang, Shao Yao Gan Cao Tang and Ji Sheng Shen Qi Wan were associated with a lower risk of major bleeding events. Conclusion Using CHMs with anticoagulants appeared to decrease the risk of major bleeding, especially CHMs products containing Glycyrrhiza uralensis et Rhizoma , Panax notoginseng , Panax ginseng , Platycodon grandiflorum and Eucommia ulmoides Oliver . Further investigations are needed to determine whether CHM can maintain the therapeutic efficacy of anticoagulants while simultaneously reducing potential side effects."

Though, Fiji National University students' (FNU), had no option than to quickly adopt to this mode of learning, within limited period, their learning experiences are yet to be examined and documented. We used phenomenological study design to explore students' online learning challenges, coping strategies and their perceptions on the causes of COVID-19. A total of 120 in-depth interviews were conducted with FNU students, at different levels and colleges, and analysed thematically, using inductive approach. The three themes emerged included COVID-19 misconception beliefs among students, online learning challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and online learning coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The misconception beliefs identified were natural occurrence, manmade for depopulation, unreal/fake and as a means of soliciting for funds. The challenges included ineffective tutorial sessions, lack of learning devices, unstable internet service, inadequate learning environment, socio-cultural practices, feeling of loneliness, anxiety and stress, and difficulties accessing online platforms and acquiring practical skills. The coping strategies used by students ranged from support from family and counsellors, help-seeking, frequent communication, time management, learning flexibility to control over learning environment.

https://openalex.org/W4292767253,"The special width approach lane (SWAL) is a newly proposed unconventional design, whereby a wide approach lane is divided into two narrower lanes. The design entails the use of a single lane by two passenger cars or one heavy vehicle. Such design has been applicated at signalized intersections of Karlsruhe, Germany. This paper focuses on the saturation flow rate analysis since most existing studies on such design rely on the default highway capacity manual (HCM) values. Saturation flow rate data was collected at four SWAL design based signalized intersections with procedural steps of the HCM 2010 using the video camera. The two-sample t-test was performed to explore the potential influencing factors, and then the non-linear regression analysis was conducted to estimate the saturation flow rate of SWAL. The proposed model can effectively depict the saturation flow rate with lane marking, presence of cyclists, and rainfall being the influencing factors. The overall accuracy of the proposed model is about 95%. The results indicate that the three influencing factors are independent of each other. The existence of cyclists and rainfall lead to a decrease in the saturation flow rate, while the lane markings can improve the saturation flow rate. Moreover, the SWAL works well in Karlsruhe, Germany. The model predicts a base saturation flow rate value of 1652 pcu/h/ln, which is plausible with comparison of the base saturation flow rate recommended in the German Highway Capacity Manual."
https://openalex.org/W4292844639,"We systematically investigated the influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA), unlock nucleic acid (UNA), and 2'-O-methyl-RNA (2'-O-Me-RNA) residues on the thermal stability, structure folding topology, biological activity and enzymatic resistance of three sequence-related DNA G-quadruplexes. In order to better understand the mechanism of action of the studied modifications, a single-position substitution in the loops or G-tetrads was performed and their influence was analyzed for a total of twenty-seven modified G-quadruplex variants. The studies show that the influence of each modification on the physicochemical properties of G-quadruplexes is position-dependent, due to mutual interactions between G-tetrads, loops, and additional guanosine at 5' or 3' end. Nevertheless, the anticancer activity of the modified G-quadruplexes is determined by their structure, thus also by the local changes of chemical character of sugar moieties, what might influence the specific interactions with therapeutic targets. In general, UNA modifications are efficient modulators of the G-quadruplex thermodynamic stability, however they are poor tools to improve the anticancer properties. In contrast, LNA and 2'-O-Me-RNA modified G-quadruplexes demonstrated certain antiproliferative potential and might be used as molecular tools for designing novel G-quadruplex-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4292845402,"The biological activities of dehydrocostus lactone and its analogues are suggested to be mediated by the lactone ring and α , β -methylene- γ -lactone. However, few studies exist on the structure-activity relationship of 13-amino derivatives of dehydrocostus latone. In this study new 13-amino derivatives of dehydrocostus lactone DHLC ( 1–4 ) were synthesized through Michael addition reactions, and were screened against three different breast cancer cell lines, namely hormone receptor positive breast cancer (MCF-7), triple-negative breast cancer (HCC70), and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial (MCF-12A) cell lines. Dehydrocostus lactone ( DHLC ) exhibited IC 50 values of 1.11 (selectivity index (SI) = 0.06), 24.70 (SI = 0.01) and 0.07 μM against HCC70, MCF-7 and MCF-12A cells, respectively. All the amino derivatives, except DHLC-3 displayed low micromolar IC 50 values (ranging from 0.07–4.24 μM) against both breast cancer cell lines, with reduced toxicity towards MCF-12A non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (SI values ranging from 6.00–126.86). DHLC-1 and D HLC-2 demonstrated the greatest selectivity for the MCF-7 cells (with SI of 121 and 126.86 respectively) over the MCF-12A cells. This reveals that, overall, the derivatives display greatly improved selectivity for breast cancer over non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, with between 100-fold and 12 000-fold higher SI values. The improved docking scores were recorded for all the 13-amino dehydrocostus lactone derivatives for the enzymes analyzed. Compounds DHLC-4 , and DHLC-3 recorded higher docking scores of -7.33 and -5.97 Kca/mol respectively, compared to the parent structure, dehydrocostus lactone (-5.34 Kca/mol) for protein kinase (PKC) theta (1XJD) and -6.22 and -5.88 Kca/mol, respectively for protein kinase iota (1RZR). The compounds further showed promising predicted adsorption, distribution, metabolisms and excretion (ADME) properties. Predicting the ADME properties of these derivatives is of importance in evaluating their drug-likeness, which could in turn be developed into potential drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W4293102231,"The pharmacokinetics of valproic acid have been evaluated in a variety of populations however, the comparison in two different populations was yet to be reported. This study is aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid in Pakistani and South Korean patients.The therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data of valproic acid from 92 Pakistani patients with 218 samples was combined with the data of 99 South Korean patients with 335 samples in order to form a pooled dataset of 191 patients with 553 samples. Population pharmacokinetic model was developed on NONMEM® software by using first order conditional estimation method for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The influence of different covariates including ethnicity was evaluated the stepwise covariate modelling. The final model was evaluated for predictive performance and robustness by using goodness of fit plots and bootstrap analysis respectively.The data was better described by one compartment model with first order elimination. The value for clearance (CL) of valproic in pooled data was 0.931 L/h with 43.4% interindividual variability (IIV) while volume of distribution (Vd) was 16.6 L with 22.3% IIV. In covariate analysis, ethnicity and body weight were significant covariates for CL while body weight was also significant for Vd.A significant difference in CL of valproic acid among Pakistani and South Korean patients was observed. The model can be used for the dose tailoring of valproic acid based on ethnicity and body weight of Pakistani and South Korean patients."
https://openalex.org/W4293104162,"Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and subsequent unusual mortality event, adverse health impacts have been reported in bottlenose dolphins in Barataria Bay, LA including impaired stress response and reproductive, pulmonary, cardiac, and immune function. These conditions were primarily diagnosed through hands-on veterinary examinations and analysis of standard diagnostic panels. In human and veterinary medicine, gene expression profiling has been used to identify molecular mechanisms underlying toxic responses and disease states. Identification of molecular markers of exposure or disease may enable earlier detection of health effects or allow for health evaluation when the use of specialized methodologies is not feasible. To date this powerful tool has not been applied to augment the veterinary data collected concurrently during dolphin health assessments. This study examined transcriptomic profiles of blood from 76 dolphins sampled in health assessments during 2013–2018 in the waters near Barataria Bay, LA and Sarasota Bay, FL. Gene expression was analyzed in conjunction with the substantial suite of health data collected using principal component analysis, differential expression testing, over-representation analysis, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Broadly, transcript profiles of Barataria Bay dolphins indicated a shift in immune response, cytoskeletal alterations, and mitochondrial dysfunction, most pronounced in dolphins likely exposed to Deepwater Horizon oiling. While gene expression profiles in Barataria Bay dolphins were altered compared to Sarasota Bay for all years, profiles from 2013 exhibited the greatest alteration in gene expression. Differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in immunity, inflammation, reproductive failure, and lung or cardiac dysfunction, all of which have been documented in dolphins from Barataria Bay following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The genes and pathways identified in this study may, with additional research and validation, prove useful as molecular markers of exposure or disease to assist wildlife veterinarians in evaluating the health of dolphins and other cetaceans."
