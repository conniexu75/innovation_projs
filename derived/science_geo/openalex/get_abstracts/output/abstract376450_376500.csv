https://openalex.org/W1991771535,"One of the most consistent observations in human functional imaging is that a network of brain regions referred to as the “default network” increases its activity during passive states. Here we explored the anatomy and function of the default network across three studies to resolve divergent hypotheses about its contributions to spontaneous cognition and active forms of decision making. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed the network comprises multiple, dissociated components. A midline core (posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortex) is active when people make self-relevant, affective decisions. In contrast, a medial temporal lobe subsystem becomes engaged when decisions involve constructing a mental scene based on memory. During certain experimentally directed and spontaneous acts of future-oriented thought, these dissociated components are simultaneously engaged, presumably to facilitate construction of mental models of personally significant events."
https://openalex.org/W1972869628,"Studies of visual processing in rodents have conventionally been performed on anesthetized animals, precluding examination of the effects of behavior on visually evoked responses. We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice."
https://openalex.org/W2143076232,"Background Systems biology has embraced computational modeling in response to the quantitative nature and increasing scale of contemporary data sets. The onslaught of data is accelerating as molecular profiling technology evolves. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) is a community effort to catalyze discussion about the design, application, and assessment of systems biology models through annual reverse-engineering challenges. Methodology and Principal Findings We describe our assessments of the four challenges associated with the third DREAM conference which came to be known as the DREAM3 challenges: signaling cascade identification, signaling response prediction, gene expression prediction, and the DREAM3 in silico network challenge. The challenges, based on anonymized data sets, tested participants in network inference and prediction of measurements. Forty teams submitted 413 predicted networks and measurement test sets. Overall, a handful of best-performer teams were identified, while a majority of teams made predictions that were equivalent to random. Counterintuitively, combining the predictions of multiple teams (including the weaker teams) can in some cases improve predictive power beyond that of any single method. Conclusions DREAM provides valuable feedback to practitioners of systems biology modeling. Lessons learned from the predictions of the community provide much-needed context for interpreting claims of efficacy of algorithms described in the scientific literature."
https://openalex.org/W1994367478,"Background Mitochondrial dysfunction and degradation takes a central role in current paradigms of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Loss of DJ-1 function is a rare cause of familial PD. Although a critical role of DJ-1 in oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function has been recognized, the effects on mitochondrial dynamics and downstream consequences remain to be determined. Methodology/Principal Findings Using DJ-1 loss of function cellular models from knockout (KO) mice and human carriers of the E64D mutation in the DJ-1 gene we define a novel role of DJ-1 in the integrity of both cellular organelles, mitochondria and lysosomes. We show that loss of DJ-1 caused impaired mitochondrial respiration, increased intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and characteristic alterations of mitochondrial shape as shown by quantitative morphology. Importantly, ultrastructural imaging and subsequent detailed lysosomal activity analyses revealed reduced basal autophagic degradation and the accumulation of defective mitochondria in DJ-1 KO cells, that was linked with decreased levels of phospho-activated ERK2. Conclusions/Significance We show that loss of DJ-1 leads to impaired autophagy and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that under physiological conditions would be compensated via lysosomal clearance. Our study provides evidence for a critical role of DJ-1 in mitochondrial homeostasis by connecting basal autophagy and mitochondrial integrity in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1992203578,"Adult brain function and behavior are influenced by neuronal network formation during development. Genetic susceptibility factors for adult psychiatric illnesses, such as Neuregulin-1 and Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), influence adult high brain functions, including cognition and information processing. These factors have roles during neurodevelopment and are likely to cooperate, forming pathways or ""signalosomes."" Here we report the potential to generate an animal model via in utero gene transfer in order to address an important question of how nonlethal deficits in early development may affect postnatal brain maturation and high brain functions in adulthood, which are impaired in various psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. We show that transient knockdown of DISC1 in the pre- and perinatal stages, specifically in a lineage of pyramidal neurons mainly in the prefrontal cortex, leads to selective abnormalities in postnatal mesocortical dopaminergic maturation and behavioral abnormalities associated with disturbed cortical neurocircuitry after puberty."
https://openalex.org/W1972400371,"Sequential neural activity patterns are as ubiquitous as the outputs they drive, which include motor gestures and sequential cognitive processes. Neural sequences are long, compared to the activation durations of participating neurons, and sequence coding is sparse. Numerous studies demonstrate that spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), the primary known mechanism for temporal order learning in neurons, cannot organize networks to generate long sequences, raising the question of how such networks are formed. We show that heterosynaptic competition within single neurons, when combined with STDP, organizes networks to generate long unary activity sequences even without sequential training inputs. The network produces a diversity of sequences with a power law length distribution and exponent -1, independent of cellular time constants. We show evidence for a similar distribution of sequence lengths in the recorded premotor song activity of songbirds. These results suggest that neural sequences may be shaped by synaptic constraints and network circuitry rather than cellular time constants."
https://openalex.org/W2069264443,"The Wnt signaling pathway plays key roles in development, adult tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance. Further understanding of the function of Wnt signaling in specific cell types could benefit from lentiviral vectors expressing reporters for the Wnt pathway or vectors interfering with signaling.We have developed a set of fluorescent and luminescent lentiviral vectors that report Wnt signaling activity and discriminate between negative and uninfected cells. These vectors possess a 7xTcf-eGFP or 7xTcf-FFluc (Firefly Luciferase) reporter cassette followed by either an SV40-mCherry or SV40-Puro(R) (puromycin N-acetyltransferase) selection cassette. We have also constructed a vector that allows drug-based selection of cells with activated Wnt signaling by placing Puro(R) under the control of the 7xTcf promoter. Lastly, we have expressed dominant-negative Tcf4 (dnTcf4) or constitutively active beta-catenin (beta-catenin(4A)) from the hEF1alpha promoter in a SV40-Puro(R) or SV40-mCherry backbone to create vectors that inhibit or activate the Wnt signaling pathway. These vectors will be made available to the scientific community through Addgene.These novel lentiviruses are efficient tools to probe and manipulate Wnt signaling. The use of a selection cassette in Wnt-reporter viruses enables discriminating between uninfected and non-responsive cells, an important requirement for experiments where selection of clones is not possible. The use of a chemiluminescent readout enables quantification of signaling. Finally, selectable vectors can be used to either inhibit or activate the Wnt signaling pathway. Altogether, these vectors can probe and modulate the Wnt signaling pathway in experimental settings where persistence of the transgene or gene transfer cannot be accomplished by non-viral techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2018175367,"Beta oscillations (12-30 Hz) in local field potentials are prevalent in the motor system, yet their functional role within the context of planning a movement is still debated. In this study, a human participant implanted with a multielectrode array in the hand area of primary motor cortex (MI) was instructed to plan a movement using either the second or fourth of five sequentially presented instruction cues. The beta amplitude increased from the start of the trial until the informative (second or fourth) cue, and was diminished afterwards. Moreover, the beta amplitude peaked just prior to each instruction cue and the delta frequency (0.5-1.5 Hz) entrained to the interval between the cues-but only until the informative cue. This result suggests that the beta amplitude and delta phase in MI reflect the subject's engagement with the rhythmically presented cues and work together to enhance sensitivity to predictable and task-relevant visual cues."
https://openalex.org/W1973617706,"The dynamics of PKA activity in the olfactory learning and memory center, the mushroom bodies (MBs), are still poorly understood. We addressed this issue in vivo using a PKA FRET probe. Application of dopamine, the main neuromodulator involved in aversive learning, resulted in PKA activation specifically in the vertical lobe, whereas octopamine, involved in appetitive learning, stimulated PKA in all MB lobes. Strikingly, MB lobes were homogeneously activated by dopamine in the learning mutant dunce, showing that Dunce phosphodiesterase plays a major role in the spatial regulation of cAMP dynamics. Furthermore, costimulation with acetylcholine and either dopamine or octopamine led to a synergistic activation of PKA in the MBs that depends on Rutabaga adenylyl cyclase. Our results suggest that Rutabaga acts as a coincidence detector and demonstrate the existence of subcellular domains of PKA activity that could underlie the functional specialization of MB lobes in aversive and appetitive learning.

PKA activity was imaged in vivo in the Drosophila olfactory memory center The mushroom body contains neuromodulator-specific microdomains of PKA activity Dunce phosphodiesterase spatially restricts PKA dynamics Rutabaga adenylyl-cyclase acts as a coincidence detector in the mushroom body During classical conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS) is linked temporally with a positive or negative unconditioned stimulus (US). Following association of the two stimuli, the CS alone will elicit a conditioned response characteristic of the US. Drosophila melanogaster can be classically conditioned both aversively and appetitively, by association of an odorant with electric shock or sugar (Keene and Waddell, 2007Keene A.C. Waddell S. Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This system represents a powerful model with which to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying learning and memory, not least because of the wide range of molecular genetic and imaging tools available (Gerber et al., 2004Gerber B.

Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The mushroom body (MB) was the first brain region to be shown to play a role in Drosophila olfactory learning (Heisenberg et al., 1985Heisenberg M. Borst A. Wagner S. Byers D. Drosophila mushroom body mutants are deficient in olfactory learning.J. Neurogenet. 1985; 2: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).

Associative odor learning in Drosophila abolished by chemical ablation of mushroom bodies.Science. 1994; 263: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Moreover, MB synaptic output is involved in both appetitive and aversive memory processing (Dubnau et al., 2001Dubnau J. Grady L. Kitamoto T. Tully T.

Kenyon cell bodies are located in the dorsal posterior part of the brain, and project dendrites to form a neuropil field called the calyx. Adult Kenyon cells may be classified into three major types based on their axonal projection configuration: γ neurons, which form a single medial lobe, α/β neurons, whose axons branch to form a vertical (α) and a medial (β) lobe, and α′/β′ neurons, which also form a vertical (α′) and a medial (β′) lobe (Crittenden et al., 1998Crittenden J.R. Skoulakis E.M. Han K.A. Kalderon D. Davis R.L. Tripartite mushroom body architecture revealed by antigenic markers.Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 38-51PubMed Google Scholar). The first two Drosophila genes identified in blind screens for learning and memory mutants correspond to two components of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) cascade. Dunce (dnc) encodes a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE), whereas rutabaga (rut) encodes a type I Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) (Dudai et al., 1976Dudai Y. Jan Y.N. Byers D.

Loss of calcium/calmodulin responsiveness in adenylate cyclase of rutabaga, a Drosophila learning mutant.Cell. 1984; 37: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Several studies in other systems indicate that this type of AC may serve as a molecular site of convergence between the US and the CS (Abrams and Kandel, 1988Abrams T.W. Kandel E.R. Is contiguity detection in classical conditioning a system or a cellular property? Learning in Aplysia suggests a possible molecular site.Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 128-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 1995Wu Z.L. Thomas S.A. Villacres E.C.

USA. 1995; 92: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, type I AC may act as a coincidence detector that integrates Ca2+ influx (resulting from the CS) and G protein activation (resulting from the US-induced binding of a neuromodulator to its G protein-coupled receptor). Biochemical studies have shown that AC activation increases the local concentration of cAMP, leading to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation through dissociation of the cAMP-binding regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunit (Taylor et al., 1990Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. cAMP-dependent protein kinase: framework for a diverse family of regulatory enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, strong modifications of the activity of the major PKA catalytic subunit (DCO) impair olfactory memory (Drain et al., 1991Drain P. Folkers E.

Horiuchi J. Nakagami Y. Nagano S. Tamura T. Saitoe M. The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a mild decrease in DCO activity enhances a specific form of long-lasting memory, known as anesthesia-resistant memory (Horiuchi et al., 2008Horiuchi J. Yamazaki D. Naganos S. Aigaki T. Saitoe M. Protein kinase A inhibits a consolidated form of memory in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20976-20981Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with their role in learning and memory, Rut, Dnc, and DCO proteins are all preferentially expressed in MB neurons, albeit with slightly different expression patterns (Nighorn et al., 1991Nighorn A. Healy M.J. Davis R.L.

The distinct gene expression profiles and morphologies of the individual lobes suggest that they may have distinct functions. This has been confirmed by functional studies showing that (1) Rut AC is required in the α/β and γ MB lobes for normal learning and short-term memory (Zars et al., 2000Zars T. Fischer M. Schulz R.

Localization of long-term memory within the Drosophila mushroom body.Science. 2001; 294: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and (5) a long-term aversive memory trace forms within the α branch of the α/β MB neurons (Yu et al., 2006Yu D. Akalal D.B. Davis R.L. Drosophila α/β mushroom body neurons form a branch-specific, long-term cellular memory trace after spaced olfactory conditioning.Neuron. 2006; 52: 845-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, memory acquisition and consolidation require neurotransmission from α′/β′ MB neurons (Krashes et al., 2007Krashes M.J. Keene A.C. Leung B. Armstrong J.D. Waddell S. Sequential use of mushroom body neuron subsets during Drosophila odor memory processing.Neuron. 2007; 53: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the MBs and the cAMP/PKA pathway are critically important for olfactory learning and memory. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cAMP/PKA signaling in the Drosophila MBs are poorly understood. Evidence currently suggests that dopaminergic neurons represent the reinforcing substrate of an aversive US (Claridge-Chang et al., 2009Claridge-Chang A. Roorda R.D. Vrontou E. Sjulson L. Li H. Hirsh J. Miesenbock G. Writing memories with light-addressable reinforcement circuitry.Cell. 2009; 139: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), whereas the reinforcing stimulus of an appetitive US is signaled through octopaminergic neurons (Schwaerzel et al., 2003Schwaerzel M. Monastirioti M. Scholz H. Friggi-Grelin F. Birman S. Heisenberg M. Dopamine and octopamine differentiate between aversive and appetitive olfactory memories in Drosophila.J.

Dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons innervate wide areas of the brain including the MBs (Nassel and Elekes, 1992Nassel D.R. Elekes K.

Selcho M. Ito K. Tanimoto H. A map of octopaminergic neurons in the Drosophila brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 513: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the different components of this signaling pathway interact dynamically in vivo and, in particular, in which MB compartment they operate. We therefore do not know how the numerous cAMP/PKA-related proteins interact with each other during learning and memorization, or even whether they are important in the same sets of MB neurons. In the present study, we used in vivo multiphoton imaging to measure the dynamics of PKA responses to dopamine and octopamine in the MB neurons of living flies. We performed real-time measurements of PKA activity using the genetically encoded FRET probe AKAR2 (Zhang et al., 2001Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y.

Insulin disrupts β-adrenergic signalling to protein kinase A in adipocytes.Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The AKAR2 probe is based on a phosphothreonine-binding domain derived from yeast (FHA1) and an optimized PKA substrate domain. When phosphorylated by PKA, the substrate domain interacts with the binding pocket of the FHA1 domain, increasing the FRET between two GFP variants CFP and citrine. The reporter is a substrate for endogenous PKA and therefore simultaneously reports the activities of endogenous PKA and its opposing phosphatases (Zhang et al., 2005Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S. Olefsky J.M. Tsien R.Y. Insulin disrupts β-adrenergic signalling to protein kinase A in adipocytes.Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our work with AKAR2 in the Drosophila MBs indicates that this sensor is functional and suitable for detection of PKA signaling in living flies. We present data that address important questions about the dynamics of PKA in MB neurons and integration of neuromodulatory signals. In particular, we show that MB dendrites and axons integrate cAMP/PKA stimulation with different efficiencies and time courses. This activity is modified in rut and dnc learning and memory mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dopaminergic stimulation, which represents the aversive US, leads to activation of PKA specifically in the α lobes, whereas octopamine activates PKA in all MB lobes. We show that dopamine-induced PKA activity is restricted to the α lobes by Dnc PDE. Finally, we show that Rut AC potentiates PKA activation when dopamine or octopamine stimulations are temporally paired with increased intracellular calcium. We generated recombinant flies carrying insertions of the AKAR2 gene, and used the Gal4/UAS system to drive expression of the probe in MB neurons (see Experimental Procedures). Before analyzing PKA dynamics in vivo, we needed to verify that AKAR2 expression does not affect brain development and neuronal morphology. We expressed the AKAR2 probe in MB neurons both during development and in the adult using the driver 238Y-Gal4. This driver has a broad expression and is not restricted to MB neurons (Yang et al., 1995Yang M.Y. Armstrong J.D. Vilinsky I. Strausfeld N.J. Kaiser K.

Associative learning disrupted by impaired Gs signaling in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Science. 1996; 274: 2104-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). As expected, 238Y-Gal4/UAS-AKAR2 flies display CFP and YFP fluorescence in MB cell bodies, calyces, and all MB lobes (Figure 1C). At this level of resolution, no defects in MB structure are detected following AKAR2 expression, in contrast to a previously described sensor, PKA-GFP, whose expression led to developmental abnormalities (Lissandron et al., 2007Lissandron V.

We tested whether the physiology of MB neurons is affected by AKAR2 expression or the 238Y driver. 238Y-Gal4/UAS-AKAR2 flies were trained with the aversive or appetitive olfactory conditioning protocols (Tully et al., 1994Tully T.

Both aversive and appetitive short-term and long-term memory were found to be normal (see Figure S1 available online). Thus, AKAR2 expression did not disrupt the ability of MB neurons to mediate olfactory learning and memory. Two-photon microscopy is particularly suitable for noninvasive fluorescence imaging of tissue explants and living animals, as it provides both reduced photodamage outside the focal volume and increased depth penetration (hundreds of microns) compared with conventional confocal microscopy. We first verified by two-photon imaging that the AKAR2 sensor is able to detect changes of PKA activity in vivo after direct stimulation of the cAMP-generating enzyme AC. The dose-response curve of the effect of forskolin (Figure 1B), an activator of most forms of AC (de Souza et al., 1983de Souza N.J. Dohadwalla A.N. Reden J. Forskolin: a labdane diterpenoid with antihypertensive, positive inotropic, platelet aggregation inhibitory, and adenylate cyclase activating properties.Med. Res. Rev. 1983; 3: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), shows a clear increase in the YFP/CFP emission ratio in all the MB compartments analyzed, except in the Kenyon cell bodies (Figures 1C and 1D). AKAR2 can be detected in the α′ and β′ lobes with the 238Y driver, but in vivo brain movements, and the fact that the α′ and β′ lobes are more weakly labeled than other lobes, prevented us from obtaining reliable FRET measurements in these lobes. As expected, FRET ratios return to baseline values after forskolin washout (Figures 1C and 1D). Importantly, this FRET increase was not accompanied by photobleaching of CFP or YFP (see Experimental Procedures). We were able to record PKA activity in vivo for at least 2 hr without observing any significant bleaching and/or decrease in FRET response amplitude to forskolin (data not shown). These results are consistent with changes corresponding to a FRET increase after PKA activation. To verify that AC activation is responsible for the increase in FRET ratio, we used a forskolin analog that does not activate AC, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (10 μM). This compound produces no FRET ratio change (Figures S2A and S2B). To further test the specificity of the AKAR2 probe for PKA, we used a cAMP analog that specifically blocks PKA, Rp-8-CPT-cAMPs (500 μM). In the presence of this PKA inhibitor, forskolin responses are reduced to approximately 20%–30% in axons and dendrites (Figures S2C and S2D). The fact that we did not observe a complete block of PKA activation by forskolin was expected because Rp-8-CPT-cAMPs is a competitive inhibitor of the cAMP-binding site, and therefore its effects are weakened when endogenous levels of cAMP are high, such as after forskolin stimulation (Gjertsen et al., 1995Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G. Otten A. Maronde E. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Vintermyr O.K. McKnight G.S. Doskeland S.O. Novel (Rp)-cAMPS analogs as tools for inhibition of cAMP-kinase in cell culture. Basal cAMP-kinase activity modulates interleukin-1β action.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20599-20607Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Together, these results confirm that forskolin-induced increases in FRET ratio are indeed a consequence of PKA activation. Bath application of forskolin results in nonhomogeneous activation of PKA in the different subcellular compartments of the MB neurons (Figure 2A). Responses in dendrites (measured at the level of the calyces) are significantly smaller in amplitude than those observed in axons (measured at the level of α, β, and γ lobes) (Figure 2B). We did not detect significant differences in PKA activation by forskolin between the different lobes. Heterogeneity in forskolin response between axons and dendrites cannot be attributed to differences in basal FRET ratio (Vincent et al., 2008Vincent P. Gervasi N. Zhang J. Real-time monitoring of cyclic nucleotide signaling in neurons using genetically encoded FRET probes.Brain Cell Biol. 2008; 36: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and we found no correlation between this basal value and the maximal FRET ratio observed after forskolin application (Figures S2E and S2F). The kinetics of PKA activation were estimated by measuring 10%–90% rise times. Rise times are significantly longer in dendrites than in axons (Figure 2C). This difference in kinetics cannot be attributed to forskolin diffusion, because the axons lie deeper in the brain than the calyces but respond faster (Figure 1A). The time course of forskolin-induced FRET is comparable in magnitude and onset to that reported for this sensor in mouse brain slices (Gervasi et al., 2007Gervasi N. Hepp R. Tricoire L. Zhang J. Lambolez B. Paupardin-Tritsch D. Vincent P. Dynamics of protein kinase A signaling at the membrane, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus of neurons in mouse brain slices.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2744-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and rat retinal ganglion cells (Dunn et al., 2006Dunn T.A. Wang C.T. Colicos M.A. Zaccolo M. DiPilato L.M. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Feller M.B. Imaging of cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity reveals that retinal waves drive oscillations in second-messenger cascades.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12807-12815Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Kenyon cell bodies display no significant FRET response to forskolin (Figure 2B; 0.48% ± 0.3% ratio change). The fluorescence intensity and the YFP/CFP ratio measured in the Kenyon cell bodies are both high, and are often above the maximum response observed in other subcellular compartments, as though the AKAR2 probe present in MB cell bodies were permanently phosphorylated (Figures 1B and 1C). However, the reason why the cell bodies fail to respond to forskolin application remains unknown and, for this reason, we decided to focus exclusively on the calyces and lobes in subsequent experiments. In summary, we have shown that widespread brain AC stimulation leads to heterogeneous AKAR2 FRET responses in various MB compartments, suggesting that these subcellular domains are not equivalent in terms of PKA dynamics. Having established that the AKAR2 probe is suitable for monitoring PKA dynamics in the MBs, we studied in vivo how this pathway is affected in rut and dnc learning and memory mutants. We first generated a homozygous UAS-AKAR2;238Y-Gal4 strain, and verified that rut2080/Y;AKAR2/+;238Y/+ males show a 2 hr memory defect comparable to that reported for rut2080 in previous studies (Figure 3A) (Han et al., 1992Han P.L.

Preferential expression of the Drosophila rutabaga gene in mushroom bodies, neural centers for learning in insects.Neuron. 1992; 9: 619-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Application of forskolin to the rut2080 mutant generates FRET ratio increases that are weaker than those observed in controls (Figure 3B). All neuronal compartments (α, β, γ, and calyces) show a similar reduction in the amplitude of the PKA response compared with controls. In terms of kinetics, we observed a general increase in the rise time of PKA signals in the rut2080 mutant (Figure 3C). Interestingly, heterozygous rut2080/+;AKAR2/+;238Y/+ females show a normal 2 hr memory (Figure 3A) and a normal forskolin response in both amplitude and rise time (Figure S3). It has been reported that cAMP concentrations are increased in the brain of the mutant dnc1 (Byers et al., 1981Byers D. Davis R.L. Kiger Jr., J.A. Defect in cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase due to the dunce mutation of learning in Drosophila melanogaster.Nature. 1981; 289: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and we therefore investigated PKA dynamics in this mutant. We verified that dnc1/Y;AKAR2/+;238Y/+ flies show a 2 hr memory deficit comparable to that reported for dnc1 in other studies (Figure 3D) (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T. Quinn W.G. Classical conditioning and retention in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1985; 157: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). FRET responses in axons are significantly increased in dnc1 mutant compared to wild-type control flies in response to bath application of forskolin. Interestingly, however, no difference in amplitude was recorded in the dendrites between dnc1 mutant and wild-type flies (Figure 3E). No differences were also measured in the kinetics of the response to forskolin (Figure 3F). Heterozygous dnc1/+;AKAR2/+;238Y/+ females display normal 2 hr memory (Figure 3D) and normal forskolin responses with respect to both amplitude and rise time (Figure S3).

However, little is understood regarding its activity and the mechanisms underlying this differential expression in cancers. Here, we employed GATA3-positive, non-invasive (MCF-7) and GATA3-negative, invasive (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells to define its role in the transformation between these two distinct phenotypes. Ectopic expression of GATA3 in MDA-MB-231 cells led to a cuboidal-like epithelial phenotype and reduced cell invasive activity. These cells also increased E-cadherin expression but decreased levels of vimentin, N-cadherin, and MMP-9. Further, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GATA3 grew smaller primary tumors without metastasis compared with larger metastatic tumors derived from control MDA-MB-231 cells in xenografted mice. GATA3 was found to induce E-cadherin expression through binding GATA-like motifs located in the E-cadherin promoter. Blockade of GATA3 using small interfering RNA gene knockdown in MCF-7 cells triggered fibroblastic transformation and cell invasion, resulting in distant metastasis. Studies of human breast cancer showed that GATA3 expression correlated with elevated E-cadherin levels, ER expression, and long disease-free survival. These data suggest that GATA3 drives invasive breast cancer cells to undergo the reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to the suppression of cancer metastasis."

Nodal Na+ channel clustering in the peripheral nervous system is regulated by myelinating Schwann cells through unknown mechanisms.

Here, we show that initial clustering of Na+ channels at heminodes requires glial NrCAM and gliomedin, as well as their axonal receptor neurofascin 186 (NF186). We further demonstrate that heminodal clustering coincides with a second, paranodal junction (PNJ)-dependent mechanism that allows Na+ channels to accumulate at mature nodes by restricting their distribution between two growing myelin internodes. We propose that Schwann cells assemble the nodes of Ranvier by capturing Na+ channels at heminodes and by constraining their distribution to the nodal gap.

With additional longitudinal growth of the myelin, these heminodal clusters approach each other until two neighboring heminodes fuse, giving rise to a focal node of Ranvier (Dugandzija-Novaković et al., 1995Dugandzija-Novaković S.

Throughout this process, myelinating Schwann cells make contact with the axon at two distinct sites: the developing nodes and the adjacent paranodal axoglial junction (PNJ) (Poliak and Peles, 2003Poliak S.

This contact is likely mediated by the binding of the multimeric matrix protein gliomedin to both NrCAM and NF186 (Eshed et al., 2007Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Carey D.J. Peles E.

Furthermore, in vitro studies indicate that binding of gliomedin may cluster the axonodal CAMs into higher-ordered oligomers, thereby facilitating the recruitment of ankyrin G and Na+ channels (Dzhashiashvili et al., 2007Dzhashiashvili Y. Zhang Y. Galinska J. Lam I. Grumet M. Salzer J.L. Nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments are ankyrin G-dependent domains that assemble by distinct mechanisms.J.

Secreted gliomedin is a perinodal matrix component of peripheral nerves.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To elucidate how Schwann cells control the clustering of Na+ channels along myelinated axons, we genetically eliminated the expression of gliomedin alone or in combination with other nodal and paranodal adhesion components. We show that gliomedin and NrCAM are glial components of PNS nodes and that together they mediate axon-glia interaction and clustering of Na+ channels at heminodes by interacting with axonal NF186. Moreover, we show that heminodal clustering of Na+ channels coincides with a second PNJ-dependent mechanism that constrains their distribution between two myelin segments. Thus, we propose that Schwann cells govern the assembly of PNS nodes by two independent, yet overlapping, adhesion systems to ensure fast conduction in myelinated nerves. To examine the role of gliomedin in the assembly of the nodes of Ranvier, we generated gliomedin null mice (Figure 1). Homozygous gldn−/− mice display no overt neurological abnormalities and exhibit normal nerve conduction (see Table S1 available online). These mutant mice formed compact PNS myelin that was indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates, but displayed disorganization and impaired attachment of Schwann cell microvilli to the nodal axolemma (Figure 1). As Schwann cell microvilli were implicated in node formation (Gatto et al., 2003Gatto C.L. Walker B.J. Lambert S.

Early events in node of Ranvier formation during myelination and remyelination in the PNS.Neuron Glia Biol. 2006; 2: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We found that in wild-type nerves Na+ channels were clustered in both mature nodes (i.e., nodes that are flanked by two adjacent Caspr-labeled PNJs) and heminodes, while in gldn−/− nerves these channels were absent from heminodes and were only detected in mature nodes (Figure 2A ). In adult sciatic nerves of gldn−/− mice, Na+ channels were colocalized at the nodes of Ranvier with NF186, NrCAM, ankyrin G, and βIV spectrin (Figure 2D), Caspr was present at the PNJ and Kv1 channels were localized at the juxtaparanodal region similar to wild-type nerves (Figure S1). As an additional experimental approach, we used myelinating Schwann-dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultures, which enable the monitoring of the detailed molecular assembly of the nodes in PNS axons (Eshed et al., 2005Eshed Y.

In contrast to wild-type cultures, Na+ channels, NF186, as well as ankyrin G and βIV spectrin were not clustered at heminodes in gldn−/− myelinating cultures (Figure 2B). Notably, while both in vivo (Figure 2A) and in myelinating cultures of wild-type nerves (Figure 2B) heminodes appeared adjacent to Caspr-labeled PNJs, in gldn−/− nerves heminodes were absent near Caspr-positive sites, indicating that heminodal clustering is not the result of PNJ formation. We then counted the number of sites in which Na+ channels were clustered near the edge of a myelin segment (Figure 2C). In gldn−/− the majority of Na+ channels were either absent or diffused (gldn−/− culture 92%, nerve 81%) in comparison to wild-type nerves where they were clustered in more than 90% of the sites. These results demonstrate that gliomedin is required for clustering the nodal complex at heminodes during myelination.Figure 2Gliomedin Clusters Na+ Channels at HeminodesShow full caption(A) Na+ channels are not clustered at heminodes but are present at nodes in gldn−/− mice.

The observation that clustering of the nodal complex requires gliomedin prompted us to examine whether this activity is mediated by its two axonodal receptors, NrCAM and NF186 (Eshed et al., 2005Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Poliak S. Sabanay H. Sarig-Nadir O. Spiegel I. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Peles E. Gliomedin mediates Schwann cell-axon interaction and the molecular assembly of the nodes of Ranvier.Neuron. 2005; 47: 215-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We first examined sciatic nerves of nrcam−/− mice, in which Na+ channel clustering in PNS nodes is delayed (Custer et al., 2003Custer A.W. Kazarinova-Noyes K. Sakurai T. Xu X. Simon W. Grumet M. Shrager P. The role of the ankyrin-binding protein NrCAM in node of Ranvier formation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10032-10039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of teased sciatic nerves isolated from 6-day-old (P6) mice using antibodies to Na+ channels and Caspr (to label the PNJs) showed that Na+ channels were not clustered at heminodes that were already bordered by Caspr-labeled PNJs (Figures 3A and 3D ). In addition, Na+ channels, NF186 and gliomedin were all detected at heminodes in myelinating DRG cultures derived from wild-type, but not from nrcam−/− mice (Figures 3B and 3D). In both sciatic nerves and myelinated cultures, Na+ channels, NF186, gliomedin, ankyrin G, and βIV spectrin were accumulated at mature nodes (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S2). Thus, similar to gliomedin, NrCAM is required for heminodal clustering but not for the accumulation of Na+ channels at mature nodes of Ranvier. Genetic ablation of the neuronal (NF186) and glial (NF155) isoforms of neurofascin leads to the disruption of both PNJs and nodes (Sherman et al., 2005Sherman D.L. Tait S. Melrose S. Johnson R. Zonta B. Court F.A. Macklin W.B. Meek S. Smith A.J. Cottrell D.F. Brophy P.J. Neurofascins are required to establish axonal domains for saltatory conduction.Neuron. 2005; 48: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, nodes fail to form in myelinating cocultures of DRG neurons and Schwann cells isolated from nfasc−/− mice (Figure S2A). To examine directly the role of NF186 in the assembly of PNS nodes, we determined whether Na+ channels accumulate at nodes in the absence of NF186 by coculturing DRG neurons isolated from nfasc−/− mice with wild-type Schwann cells. In agreement with a recent report (Zonta et al., 2008Zonta B. Tait S. Melrose S. Anderson H. Harroch S. Higginson J. Sherman D.L. Brophy P.J. Glial and neuronal isoforms of Neurofascin have distinct roles in the assembly of nodes of Ranvier in the central nervous system.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the expression of NF155 in myelinating Schwann cells promoted the full recovery of the PNJs, as demonstrated by immunolabeling for Caspr (Figure 3C). PNJ formation in these axons was accompanied by the accumulation of Na+ channels at the nodes together with all other components of the nodal complex (i.e., ankyrin G, βIV spectrin, and NrCAM) except NF186 (Figures 3C, 3E, and S2A and Table S2). However, similarly to gliomedin and NrCAM-deficient DRG cultures, in the absence of axonal NF186, Na+ channels were not clustered at heminodes (Figures 3C and 3D). To further determine the contribution of the axonodal CAMs to the formation of mature nodes, we established myelinating cultures using DRG neurons isolated from double nrcam−/−/nfasc−/− mutant mice and wild-type Schwann cells (to recover the PNJs). Analysis of these cultures showed that Na+ channels, a"

An interaction between anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized inositol trisphosphate receptor Ca2+ release channel (InsP3R) enables Bcl-xL to be fully efficacious as an anti-apoptotic mediator (White, C., Li, C., Yang, J., Petrenko, N. B., Madesh, M., Thompson, C. B., and Foskett, J. K. (2005) Nat. Cell Biol. 7, 1021–1028). Physiologically, Bcl-xL binds to the InsP3R to enhance its gating and Ca2+ signaling. Here we have discovered that structurally related proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 function similarly. Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL bind with comparable affinity to the carboxyl termini of all three mammalian InsP3R isoforms with important functional consequences. Stable expression of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 lowered ER Ca2+ content and enhanced the rate of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release in response to submaximal InsP3 stimulation in permeabilized wild-type DT40 cells but not in cells lacking InsP3R. In addition, expression of either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 enhanced spontaneous InsP3R-dependent Ca2+ oscillations and spiking in intact cells in the absence of agonist stimulation. Bcl-2- and Mcl-1-mediated protection from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or etoposide was enhanced in cells expressing InsP3R, demonstrating that their interactions with InsP3R enable Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 to be fully efficacious anti-apoptotic mediators. Our data suggest a molecular mechanism that is shared by several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that provides apoptosis resistance by direct interactions at the ER with the InsP3R that impinges on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators of programmed cell death with both pro- and anti-apoptotic members. In response to apoptotic stimuli, activation of the principle pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak causes increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c, a critical mediator in the commitment to cell death (1Korsmeyer S.J.

The ability of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to disrupt mitochondrial membrane integrity is held in check through heterodimeric interactions with anti-apoptotic members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (3Decaudin D.

The interaction modifies Ca2+- and InsP3-dependent regulation of channel activity in vitro and enhances Ca2+ signaling in vivo. Enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the form of spontaneous cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) oscillations or spiking, is correlated with increased apoptosis resistance (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H.

These data provide a molecular basis for the involvement of the ER as a major effector organelle in apoptosis, and they support a paradigm in which Bcl-xL is a direct effector of the InsP3R, increasing its sensitivity to InsP3 and enabling ER Ca2+ release to be more sensitively coupled to extracellular signals that enhances resistance to apoptotic stimuli. endoplasmic reticulum glutathione S-transferase wild type analysis of variance inositol trisphosphate receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate staurosporine etoposide knockout.

However, it is unknown whether the interaction of InsP3R with Bcl-xL, and the functional consequences for Ca2+ signaling, ER Ca2+ homeostasis, and apoptosis protection are more generally applicable to other anti-apoptotic proteins.

Thus, there is no a priori reason to assume that different anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members will interact with and affect InsP3R Ca2+ release activity similarly. To address this, in the present study we explored the role of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members with structural homology to Bcl-xL. We have assessed the binding of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 to the carboxyl termini of all three mammalian InsP3R isoforms and examined the relationship between ER Ca2+ store content, [Ca2+]i oscillations and apoptosis resistance conferred by the InsP3R-Bcl-2 protein interaction. COS-7 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin mixture at 37 °C, 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere.

Full-length human Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 cDNAs were cloned into the pIRES2-DsRed2 vector (Clontech).

After brief sonication (10 s) and centrifugation, the total protein concentration in the lysate was adjusted to 5 mg/ml and incubated with GST fusion protein (1 h, 4 °C).

Flag-tagged Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 bound to GST-TM6+C beads were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-Flag M2 antibody. We have determined that these protocols, with appropriate numbers of replicates and controls for amounts of proteins, exposure time, and gel loading, can discriminate affinities that differ by greater than a factor of 5. 3K. Foskett, unpublished observations. DT40 cells were plated onto a glass-bottomed perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) and incubated with Fura-2 AM (2 μm; Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature in normal culture media. Cells were then continuously perfused with Hanks Balanced Salt solution (Sigma) containing (mm) 1.8 CaCl2 and 0.8 MgCl2, pH 7.4. Fura-2 was alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm and the emitted fluorescence filtered at 510 nm was collected and recorded using a CCD-based imaging system running SimplePCI software (Hamamatsu Corp.). Dye calibration was achieved by applying experimentally determined constants in Equation 1.[Ca2+]=kd×β×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)(Eq. 1) Cells were loaded with mag-Fura-2AM (5 μm) in normal culture medium for 45 min at room temperature and then perfused with Hanks Balanced Salt solution for 15 min prior to recording. Cells were washed briefly with intracellular-like medium (ICM) containing: 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.3 with KOH), and 1 mm EGTA and permeabilized by 2–3 min exposure to ICM containing β-escin (Sigma; 25 μm). Store loading was achieved by switching to ICM containing Ca2+ (free concentration 100 nm) and MgATP (1.5 mm). To induce Ca2+ release, various concentrations of InsP3 were applied in ICM without MgATP to prevent reuptake and containing a free [Ca2+] of 1 μm to produce optimal InsP3R activation (16Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.-H. Mak D.-O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Data were acquired and calibrated as described for Fura-2. Cells were dual-labeled with AlexaFluor488-conjugated Annexin V and TOTO-3 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions and analyzed using flow cytometry (FACs Calibur; Beckton Dickinson) with CELLquest software. All experiments were performed at the RFUMS Flow Cytometry/Cell Sorting Research Support Laboratory. In all experiments data from two independent clones expressing vector, Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 in WT or InsP3R-KO background were pooled and summarized as mean ± S.E. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD (Least Significant Difference) posthoc comparisons were used to assess statistical significance of differences between means. Unpaired comparisons for normal and non-normally distributed data employed the Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test, respectively. Differences between independent proportions were determined using a z-test. For all tests the differences between means were accepted as statistically significant at the 95% level (p < 0.05). It was previously demonstrated that Bcl-xL binds to all three mammalian InsP3R isoforms in a region localized to the carboxyl terminus extending from the luminal loop between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 to the carboxyl terminus (TM6+C) (8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This region contains the pore, including the putative pore helix, selectivity filter and TM6, and a distal 160 amino acids located in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we assessed whether or not Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 could also bind to this same channel region. GST-TM6+C fusion proteins of the rat types 1, 2, and 3 were immobilized on glutathione beads. The quantities of beads were titrated, and the amounts of GST-InsP3R fragments used for pull-down experiments, as well as the concentrations of Flag-tagged Bcl-2 family member proteins expressed in COS-7 cell lysates, were adjusted to equivalent levels. The carboxyl-terminal fragments of each of the three InsP3R isoforms effectively pulled-down Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 with quantitatively similar (within a factor of 5) apparent affinities (Fig. 1A). The functional effects of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 on steady-state ER luminal [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]ER) and ER Ca2+ permeability were examined in stably transfected wild-type DT40 cells (DT40-WT) and in DT40 cells with all three InsP3R isoforms genetically deleted (DT40-InsP3R-KO) (17Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The cell lines were characterized by Western blot and all subsequent experiments were carried out on two independent clones (shown in Fig. 1B). To monitor the ER store capacity directly, cells were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ indicator mag-Fura-2, which compartmentalizes in the ER lumen and cytoplasm. The plasma membrane was then permeabilized to remove cytoplasmic dye and the cells were bathed in a Ca2+-free intracellular solution (18Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Won J.H. Yule D.I. Methods. 2008; 46: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After equilibration, cells were exposed to MgATP and 100 nm free Ca2+ to stimulate ER Ca2+ uptake until a new steady-state filling level was achieved (Fig. 2, A–D). Of note, steady-state [Ca2+]ER was markedly lower in DT40-WT cells expressing Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 compared with control cells expressing the vector only (Fig. 2A). In contrast, steady-state [Ca2+]ER was normalized in Bcl-2- and Mcl-1-expressing cells when ER Ca2+ uptake was activated in the presence of the InsP3R inhibitor heparin (Fig. 2B). Because steady-state [Ca2+]ER is determined by the balance between active uptake and passive release, these data suggest that reduced [Ca2+]ER in the presence of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 is due to increased Ca2+ release mediated by InsP3R. To test this, similar experiments were performed in Bcl-2- or Mcl-1-expressing DT40-InsP3R-KO cells. In contrast to the effects observed in WT cells, Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 expression had no effect on [Ca2+]ER in the InsP3-KO cells (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 reduce steady-state [Ca2+]ER by a mechanism that requires InsP3R. It was previously demonstrated in patch clamp studies that purified recombinant Bcl-xL binding to the InsP3R increases its single channel open probability and the number of activated channels in response to subsaturating [InsP3] (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This activation increases ER Ca2+ efflux in the presence of low [InsP3]. The low aqueous solubilities of full-length Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins prevent comparable patch clamp studies. To determine if Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 have similar functional effects as Bcl-xL, InsP3-dependent ER Ca2+ fluxes were measured directly in permeabilized, mag-Fura-2-loaded DT40-WT cells. After steady-state [Ca2+]ER was achieved by exposure to MgATP and 100 nm Ca2, the perfusion solution was rapidly switched to one containing various [InsP3] and 1 μm free Ca2+ (optimal for InsP3R activation (16Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.-H. Mak D.-O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar)), with no MgATP to prevent Ca2+ reuptake. A saturating [InsP3] (10 μm) (16Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.-H. Mak D.-O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) evoked a rapid decrease in [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2E). As expected, the absolute Δ[Ca2+]ER was significantly smaller in both Bcl-2- and Mcl-1-expressing cells, because of reduced steady-state [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2E, inset). In response to subsaturating [InsP3] (100 nm), a more complete store depletion was observed in the Bcl-2- and Mcl-1-expressing cells, which released about the same total Ca2+ as vector controls, despite the reduced pool size prior to stimulation (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that the sensitivity of InsP3R-dependent Ca2+ release is enhanced by the presence of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. The absence of MgATP during InsP3-induced Ca2+ release prevents Ca2+ reuptake into the ER (18Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Won J.H. Yule D.I. Methods. 2008; 46: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accordingly, monitoring Ca2+ release under these conditions provides a measure of the rate of the InsP3-dependent Ca2+ efflux. Plotting the first order derivative d[Ca2+]ER/dt as a function of [Ca2+]ER during InsP3 stimulation revealed that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 increased the Ca2+ release rate in response to subsaturating (100 nm) InsP3 without affecting the responses to high [InsP3] (Fig. 2, G and H). Thus, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 both increase the apparent sensitivity of InsP3R-dependent Ca2+ release to low levels of InsP3. Single cell imaging of Fura-2-loaded DT40-WT cells was performed to determine the effects of the interactions of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with the InsP3R on cellular Ca2+ signaling. In the first series of experiments, InsP3-mediated [Ca2+]i signals were evoked upon ligation of the B cell receptor (BCR) by application of a saturating concentration of IgM antibody (anti-IgM; 5 μg ml−1) (17Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The majority (∼70%) of vector control cells responded with a single [Ca2+]i transient, while the remaining cells displayed sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 3A). In contrast, when Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 were overexpressed, the majority of cells displayed sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations/spiking (Fig. 3, A and D), with fewer cells responding with a single [Ca2+]i transient (∼55% for both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1; Fig. 3D). The amplitude of the initial [Ca2+]i peak following anti-IgM was reduced in cells expressing Bcl-2, although the total Ca2+ released during the 500 s after the initial [Ca2+]i peak was unchanged (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, in Mcl-1-expressing cells the initial peak and total released Ca2+ was larger than vector control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). It was previously shown that expression of Bcl-xL enhances the frequency of spontaneous, InsP3R-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations in resting DT40-WT cells (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to the observed Bcl-xL-mediated enhanced sensitivity of InsP3R channels to low levels of InsP3 that exist in un-stimulated cells. In the absence of stimulation, ∼25% of DT40-WT cells expressing empty vector displayed spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations/spiking (Fig. 3E). Expression of Bcl-2 increased this to nearly 40% and enhanced the proportion of cells displaying higher frequency oscillations (Fig. 3F) that resulted in an average oscillation frequency increase by nearly 2-fold compared with vector controls (Fig. 3G). Similarly, Mcl-1 expression also increased the number of oscillating cells (to nearly 50%) and high frequency oscillators, resulting in the mean oscillation frequency enhanced by 2.4-fold compared with control (Fig. 3H). Expression of Mcl-1 also increased the proportion of higher amplitude [Ca2+]i spikes (Fig. 3F), elevating the mean spike amplitude by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 3G). Taken together, the effects of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression on InsP3-mediated [Ca2+]i signals are similar to those observed for Bcl-xL, including enhanced InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ flux (Fig. 2), InsP3R-dependent reduced steady-state [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2), and enhanced [Ca2+]i oscillations in resting cells (Fig. 3). However, there were also distinctive features associated with the expression of each anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Bcl-2 expression reduced and Mcl-1 enhanced the amplitude of the initial Ca2+ response to anti-IgM, whereas Bcl-xL has no effect (8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) affected the amplitude of individual spontaneous [Ca2+]i spikes in resting cells, whereas Mcl-1 increased the spike amplitudes. These differences between the effects of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL may be due to their different expression levels. Despite these differences, the predominant [Ca2+]i signaling phenotypes induced by the expression of the three anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are qualitatively similar and consistent with their having a primary effect to increase the excitability of the InsP3R. To determine the significance of enhanced InsP3R excitability by Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, apoptosis was assessed in DT40 WT and InsP3-KO cells stably expressing Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. After exposure to staurosporine (STS; 0.5 μm) or etoposide (ETS; 50 μm), reagents that induce apoptosis in DT40 cells (19Khan M.T. Bhanumathy C.D. Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32983-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Korfali N. Ruchaud S. Loegering D. Bernard D. Dingwall C. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1030-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), cells were assayed at various times to assess apoptotic cell death. Cells labeled positive for annexin V or positive for annexin V and the vital stain TOTO-3 were considered to represent the total apoptotic cell population (Fig. 4A). In vector-only expressing control cells, apoptosis initially progressed faster in WT than in InsP3R-KO cells, as indicated by a higher percentage of apoptotic cells at the 8-h and 2-h time points in STS- and ETS-treated samples, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). This is consistent with previous reports identifying the InsP3R as a proapoptotic mediator during early apoptosis (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Khan M.T. Bhanumathy C.D. Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32983-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 provided apoptosis protection when expressed in either the WT or InsP3R-KO backgrounds (Fig. 4, B–D). Bcl-2 provided better protection against STS than ETS (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas MCl-1 was more effective against ETS (Fig. 4, D and E). In general, protection was more effective when the two proteins were expressed in WT compared with InsP3R-KO cells. These data demonstrate that expression of the InsP3R enables both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 to provide greater apoptosis resistance. The lack of difference between WT and InsP3-KO in the ability of Mcl-1 to inhibit apoptosis in response to STS (Fig. 4D) may indicate that the efficacy of protection afforded by this mechanism is stimulus dependent, suggesting that InsP3R interactions with different Bcl-2 proteins may couple to different downstream targets. We previously identified a biochemical and functional interaction of Bcl-xL with the InsP3R channel carboxyl terminus that impinged on InsP3R gating activity and apoptosis protection (8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have determined that Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 also interact with this same region in all three rat InsP3R isoforms. By semi-quantitative pull-down assays, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 appear to bind to this region in each isoform with approximately equal affinities. The similar binding to the three isoforms may not have been unexpected, as there is considerable sequence homology in the InsP3R region studied. However, the similar binding affinities of the three Bcl-2 family proteins is unexpected, and suggests that shared structural features among them are important for their interaction with the InsP3R carboxyl terminus. Direct binding of Bcl-2 to the InsP3R has been previously reported (14Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), whereas this is the first report of an interaction of Mcl-1 with InsP3R. Previous studies of Bcl-2 binding suggested weak binding to the InsP3R carboxyl terminus (21Rong Y.P. Aromolaran A.S. Bultynck G. Zhong F. Li X. McColl K. Matsuyama S. Herlitze S. Roderick H.L.

However, the weak binding can be accounted for by the use of a carboxyl-terminal fragment that lacked critical binding determinants further upstream. 4K. Foskett, unpublished observations. Bcl-2 was also reported to bind to a region within the channel regulatory domain (21Rong Y.P. Aromolaran A.S. Bultynck G. Zhong F. Li X. McColl K. Matsuyama S. Herlitze S. Roderick H.L.

Both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 bind weakly to this region,4 whereas we show here that they, as well as Bcl-2, bind with similar and much higher affinity to the carboxyl-terminal construct employed in our studies. It was reported that the BH4 domain was necessary and sufficient in mediating the interaction between Bcl-2 and the InsP3R (22Rong Y.P. Bultynck G. Aromolaran A.S. Zhong F. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Mignery G.A. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 14397-14402Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), whereas we have observed robust binding between the InsP3R carboxyl terminus and Mcl-1 that lacks a BH4 domain (23Day C.L.

Thus, Bcl-2 protein interactions with the InsP3R are likely to be complex and involve multiple binding sites within the channel. The interactions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with the InsP3R have been previously demonstrated to affect cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms are controversial. Expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL attenuate InsP3R-dependent Ca2+ release in response to maximal InsP3 stimulation, but this has been attributed either to inhibition (14Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F.

In support of the former, recombinant Bcl-2 inhibited reconstituted InsP3R gating in planar lipid bilayers (14Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the latter case, reduced InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signals were proposed to be caused by Bcl-2 protein-mediated reduction of steady-state [Ca2+]ER (reviewed in Ref. 6Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We previously identified the mechanism of this reduction by demonstrating that full-length, soluble recombinant Bcl-xL activated InsP3R single channel gating in native ER membranes, by an allosteric mechanism that sensitized the channel to low [InsP3] (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This activation mechanism is robust, because it was observed for the three mammalian InsP3R isoforms as well as the Sf9 insect cell InsP3R. We have been unable to perform similar studies with Bcl-2 because of its well-recognized poor solubility. Sensitization by Bcl-xL of the InsP3 sensitivity of the InsP3R can account for reduced steady-state [Ca2+]ER observed in some studies (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) because increased InsP3R activity resets the ER membrane Ca2+ pump-leak balance. Here, we demonstrate directly, using an ER-localized Ca2+ indicator, that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, like Bcl-xL, enhance the InsP3 sensitivity of InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release that results in decreased steady-state [Ca2+]ER. These effects of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 are InsP3R-dependent because store filling is normalized by InsP3R inhibition, and they are not observed when Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 is expressed in InsP3R-KO cells. These results are significant because they demonstrate that reduced [Ca2+]ER, observed when Bcl-2 is overexpressed in many studies (25Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J.

A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), is caused by Bcl-2 interaction with the InsP3R. Our results therefore conflict with the reported inhibition of InsP3R channel gating by Bcl-2 (14Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Zhong F. Davis M.C. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they reveal for the first time that Mcl-1 interacts with the InsP3R to produce qualitatively similar effects to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on ER Ca2+ release and steady state [Ca2+]ER. Whereas our results suggest a common mechanism by which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins impinge on Ca2+ signaling, the mechanisms whereby enhanced InsP3R Ca2+ signaling impinges on apoptosis protection are themselves controversial. Evidence that ER Ca2+ release and subsequent uptake into mitochondria promotes cytochrome c release, and that reduced [Ca2+]ER can minimize this effect and provide apoptosis protection, have supported the hypothesis that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL impinges on apoptosis by modulating [Ca2+]ER (28Hajnóczky G. Csordás G. Das S. Garcia-Perez C. Saotome M. Sinha Roy S. Yi M. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, such a the model is not supported by observations in many studies of unchanged [Ca2+]ER during Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis protection (5Distelhorst C.W. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2875-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-expression of Bcl-xL with each individual InsP3R isoform in an InsP3R null background reduced [Ca2+]ER only in cells expressing type-3 InsP3R whereas it provided InsP3R-dependent apoptosis protection in all of them. Thus, while lowering [Ca2+]ER can provide apoptosis protection, it may not be the only or even most important mechanism involved. In contrast, a consistent feature associated with Bcl-xL/InsP3R-dependent apoptosis protection was the presence of enhanced InsP3R-dependent spontaneous [Ca2+]i spiking or oscillations (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M.

We now show that expression of either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 provides InsP3R-dependent apoptosis resistance and enhances InsP3R activity that is similarly manifested as an increase in the frequency and number of cells displaying of spontaneous [Ca2+]i spiking. Similar enhanced, low-level InsP3R-dependent [Ca2+]i signaling has been observed previously in other Bcl-2 expression cell models (15Zhong F. Davis M.C. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a primary mechanism by which the ER impinges on apoptosis involves enhanced low-level spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling mediated similarly by Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 interactions with the InsP3R. The mechanisms that transduce enhanced spontaneous InsP3R [Ca2+]i spiking into apoptotic resistance are unknown but are of obvious importance. Frequency modulation of [Ca2+]i signals regulates numerous processes, including gene transcription (29Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Periodic transient InsP3R-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations activate NF-κB to afford apoptosis resistance (30Li J. Zelenin S. Aperia A. Aizman O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, enhanced low-level spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling mediated by Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 may impinge on the nucleus to alter gene expression that promotes apoptosis resistance. Periodic InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release might also be an efficient mechanism to facilitate Ca2+ delivery to mitochondria at a rate and magnitude that is optimal for stimulating mitochondrial bioenergetics but insufficient to trigger irreversible mitochondrial permeability transition and membrane disruption. In this model, increased apoptosis protection is linked to enhanced cellular bioenergetics (8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 31Hammerman P.S. Fox C.J. Thompson C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 586-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Future studies are necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby constitutive low-level Ca2+ signaling affords apoptosis protection. In summary, we have discovered that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, three structurally related anti-apoptotic proteins with differential expression and responses to different stimuli, bind with similar affinity to the carboxyl terminus of all three isoforms of the InsP3R. We have determined that both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 have similar functional effects to those reported for Bcl-xL (7Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), in that they provide enhanced InsP3R activity and InsP3R-dependent spontaneous [Ca2+]i signaling and apoptosis resistance. We conclude that multiple anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues function at the ER by interacting with the InsP3R to generate pro-survival Ca2+ signals that adapt cells to withstand apoptotic stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2056752073,"The human brain is adept at anticipating upcoming events, but in a rapidly changing world, it is essential to detect and encode events that violate these expectancies. Unexpected events are more likely to be remembered than predictable events, but the underlying neural mechanisms for these effects remain unclear. We report intracranial EEG recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients, and from the nucleus accumbens of depression patients. We found that unexpected stimuli enhance an early (187 ms) and a late (482 ms) hippocampal potential, and that the late potential is associated with successful memory encoding for these stimuli. Recordings from the nucleus accumbens revealed a late potential (peak at 475 ms), which increases in magnitude during unexpected items, but no subsequent memory effect and no early component. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activity in a loop involving the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens promotes encoding of unexpected events."

Given the limited evidence that resting CD4+ T cell infection (RCI) is affected by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA), we measured the stability of RCI and residual viremia in patients who added VPA with or without raltegravir (RAL), or enfuvirtide (ENF) with or without VPA, to standard ART.Patients with plasma HIV RNA<50 c/mL added sustained-release VPA (Depakote ER) twice daily, RAL 400 mg twice daily, or ENF 90 mcg twice daily. Change in RCI was measured by outgrowth assays. Low-level viremia was quantitated by single-copy plasma HIV RNA assay (SCA).In three patients on standard ART a depletion of RCI was observed after 16 weeks of VPA, but this effect waned over up to 96 weeks of further VPA. In two patients ENF added to stable ART had no effect on RCI. Simultaneous intensification with ENF and addition of VPA had no effect on RCI frequency in one patient, and resulted in a 46% decline in a second. No significant depletion of RCI (>50%) was seen in six volunteers after the addition of RAL and VPA. In 4 of the 6 patients this lack of effect might be attributed to intermittent viremia, low VPA levels, or intermittent study therapy adherence. Overall, there was no effect of the addition of RAL or ENF on low-level viremia measured by SCA.The prospective addition of VPA and RAL, VPA and ENF, or ENF failed to progressively reduce the frequency of RCI, or ablate intermittent and low-level viremia. New approaches such as more potent HDAC inhibition, alone or in combination with intensified ART or other agents that may disrupt proviral latency must be pursued."

One of the most frequently asked questions in cancer imaging is how many cells can be detected non-invasively in a live animal. Although many factors limit such detection, increasing the light emission from cells is one of the most effective ways of overcoming these limitations. Here, we describe development and utilization of a lentiviral vector containing enhanced firefly luciferase (luc2) gene. The resulting single cell clones of the mouse mammary gland tumor (4T1-luc2) showed stable light emission in the range of 10,000 photons/sec/cell. In some cases individual 4T1-luc2 cells inserted under the skin of a nu/nu mouse could be detected non-invasively using a cooled CCD camera in some cases. In addition, we showed that only few cells are needed to develop tumors in these mice and tumor progression can be monitored right after the cells are implanted. Significantly higher luciferase activity in these cells allowed us to detect micrometastases in both, syngeneic Balb/c and nu/nu mice."

Analysis of replication protein A (RPA)-associated proteins reveals extensive physical interactions between RPA-associated proteins and Mec1/Tel1-specific substrates. Among them, multiple subunits of the chromatin remodeling complexes including ISW1, ISW2, INO80, SWR1, RSC, and SWI/SNF are identified and they undergo DNA damage-induced phosphorylation by Mec1 and Tel1.

https://openalex.org/W2009109694,"Inflammatory response following central nervous system (CNS) injury contributes to progressive neuropathology and reduction in functional recovery. Axons are sensitive to mechanical injury and toxic inflammatory mediators, which may lead to demyelination. Although it is well documented that degenerated myelin triggers undesirable inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), there has been very little study of the direct inflammatory consequences of damaged myelin in spinal cord injury (SCI), i.e., there is no direct evidence to show that myelin debris from injured spinal cord can trigger undesirable inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that myelin can initiate inflammatory responses in vivo, which is complement receptor 3 (CR3)-dependent via stimulating macrophages to express pro-inflammatory molecules and down-regulates expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mechanism study revealed that myelin-increased cytokine expression is through activation of FAK/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathways and CR3 contributes to myelin-induced PI3K/Akt/NF-κB activation and cytokine production. The myelin induced inflammatory response is myelin specific as sphingomyelin (the major lipid of myelin) and myelin basic protein (MBP, one of the major proteins of myelin) are not able to activate NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a crucial role of myelin as an endogenous inflammatory stimulus that induces pro-inflammatory responses and suggest that blocking myelin-CR3 interaction and enhancing myelin debris clearance may be effective interventions for treating SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2030634427,"Background M2 proton channel of H1N1 influenza A virus is the target protein of anti-flu drugs amantadine and rimantadine. However, the two once powerful adamantane-based drugs lost their 90% bioactivity because of mutations of virus in recent twenty years. The NMR structure of the M2 channel protein determined by Schnell and Chou (Nature, 2008, 451, 591–595) may help people to solve the drug-resistant problem and develop more powerful new drugs against H1N1 influenza virus. Methodology Docking calculation is performed to build the complex structure between receptor M2 proton channel and ligands, including existing drugs amantadine and rimantadine, and two newly designed inhibitors. The computer-aided drug design methods are used to calculate the binding free energies, with the computational biology techniques to analyze the interactions between M2 proton channel and adamantine-based inhibitors. Conclusions 1) The NMR structure of M2 proton channel provides a reliable structural basis for rational drug design against influenza virus. 2) The channel gating mechanism and the inhibiting mechanism of M2 proton channel, revealed by the NMR structure of M2 proton channel, provides the new ideas for channel inhibitor design. 3) The newly designed adamantane-based inhibitors based on the modeled structure of H1N1-M2 proton channel have two pharmacophore groups, which act like a “barrel hoop”, holding two adjacent helices of the H1N1-M2 tetramer through the two pharmacophore groups outside the channel. 4) The inhibitors with such binding mechanism may overcome the drug resistance problem of influenza A virus to the adamantane-based drugs."

IntroductionAs in other soluble proteins, the charged and polar side chains of SOD1 are found in connection to the protein surface where they protrude freely into the solvent or are involved in solvent-accessible salt links and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1). Replacement of such surface groups by point mutation has typically small effects on protein folding and stability. Even so, charged side chains have been observed to play key roles in controlling protein-protein interactions and aggregation. This control can either be exerted in the context of the folded structure by, e.g. providing edge protection of β-sheets (1Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), or by modulation the aggregation propensity of the unfolded chain (1Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In this perspective it is interesting that 48 out of the 142 SOD1 mutations that have so far been linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 2The abbreviations used are: ALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPDBProtein Data Bank. involve charge replacements (4AlsodThe ALS Online Database. 2009; (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/Als/index.aspx)Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S1). Like most proteins, SOD1 carries a net negative charge under physiological conditions, which assure some degree of electrostatic repulsion between the molecular components in the crowded cellular interior. Strikingly, 83% of the ALS-mutations targeting SOD1 charges are found to decrease this net repulsive charge (5Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and genetic data suggest the loss of a single negative charge is enough to trigger ALS (5Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At the other end of the spectrum are the ALS-associated mutations of hydrophobic residues in the SOD1 interior and of the loop glycines (Fig. 1). The common effect of these mutations is to destabilise the SOD1 framework by shifting the folding equilibrium toward the denatured state. For some mutants, e.g. A4V and G93A, the protein is even destabilised to the extent that the nascent chain cannot fold under physiological conditions without oxidation of the Cys57–Cys146 disulfide bridge or acquisition of the native metals (6Lindberg M.J. Normark J. Holmgren A. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15893-15898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, this tendency of the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations to reduce either repulsive charge or structural stability point at protein aggregation as a deterministic factor in ALS (5Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Shaw B.F. Valentine J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This physical-chemical link to protein aggregation complies also with the occurrence of pathological SOD1 inclusions in the spinal cord of ALS patients (8Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S.

Brain. 2004; 127: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Another conspicuous feature of the ALS mechanism is that several of the SOD1 mutations show a characteristic uniform disease progression. For example, the survival time after symptomatic onset for patients carrying the A4V is invariable short (<2 years), whereas the survival time for patients with the H46R is always very long (≫10 years). On this basis several investigations have been directed to examine if there is a coupling between the physical-chemical properties of the ALS-provoking SOD1 mutations and the severity of disease (12Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Wang Q. Johnson J.L. Agar N.Y. Agar J.N.

That is, are the most perturbing mutations also the ones that cause the worse damage? Regarding the age of onset there is no apparent trend, most mutations for which reliable data are available has a mean age of onset of 46–47 years (14Andersen P.M. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2006; 6: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicating the ALS mechanism in this respect is different from that of Lund-Huntington disease where the length of the poly(Q) additions correlates with age of onset of clinical symptoms (15Chen S.M. Ferrone F.A. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2002; 99: 11884-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 16Landles C. Bates G.P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). When it comes to the disease progression, however, the thermodynamic stability of the apoSOD1 species hints at a weak correlation with survival time after first diagnosis for a subset of non-charged ALS mutations selected on the basis of good clinical statistics (17Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This trend has also been discerned with a more extensive set of ALS mutations even though the scatter of the data is close to abbreviate the significance of the signal (13Wang Q. Johnson J.L. Agar N.Y. Agar J.N. Plos Biology. 2008; 6: 1508-1526Google Scholar). The main problem is uncertain survival statistics because of low patient numbers. For the majority (76%) of the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations there are less than 5 reported disease cases and this shortage of data is particularly alarming for mutations with long survival times (supplemental Table S1). In addition to this statistical uncertainty, however, there seems also to be mutations that simply break the pattern. A good example of such a statistically safe outlier is the mutation D101N. This mutation yields a thermal melting transition close to that of the wild-type protein and is still associated with patient survival times of <5 years (n = 17). In sharp contrast, the more destabilizing ALS mutation D90A displays typically survival times >5 years (n = 15) despite having the same effect on the net repulsive charge. Both mutations reduce the charge of the apoSOD1 monomer from −6 to −5 accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that these differences in survival time stem from specific effects on the SOD1 molecule or its interaction with cellular components that go beyond any underlying dependence on the global parameters net charge and thermodynamic stability. In this study, we have systematically tried to verify and extend the set of property outliers to see if these deviating SOD1 mutations can reveal new clues to the ALS mechanism. The analysis identifies 5 ALS-associated charge mutations with apo-state stabilities and global folding transitions identical to those of the wild-type protein, i.e. D76V, D76Y, D101N, N139D, and N139K. The results provide direct experimental support for the genetic indication that reduction of the net charge by just one unit induces ALS with high penetrance. Moreover, the data point at an additional molecular factor in the mechanism of SOD-induced ALS: the rupture of conserved hydrogen-bond networks at the SOD1 surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experiments were done on apo-protein under oxidizing conditions with the intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys57 and Cys146 kept intact.Protein PreparationAll mutants were made on a background of C6A/C111A and for the monomers on C6A/C111A/F50E/G51E.

IntroductionAs in other soluble proteins, the charged and polar side chains of SOD1 are found in connection to the protein surface where they protrude freely into the solvent or are involved in solvent-accessible salt links and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1). Replacement of such surface groups by point mutation has typically small effects on protein folding and stability. Even so, charged side chains have been observed to play key roles in controlling protein-protein interactions and aggregation. This control can either be exerted in the context of the folded structure by, e.g. providing edge protection of β-sheets (1Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), or by modulation the aggregation propensity of the unfolded chain (1Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In this perspective it is interesting that 48 out of the 142 SOD1 mutations that have so far been linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 2The abbreviations used are: ALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPDBProtein Data Bank. involve charge replacements (4AlsodThe ALS Online Database. 2009; (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/Als/index.aspx)Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S1). Like most proteins, SOD1 carries a net negative charge under physiological conditions, which assure some degree of electrostatic repulsion between the molecular components in the crowded cellular interior. Strikingly, 83% of the ALS-mutations targeting SOD1 charges are found to decrease this net repulsive charge (5Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and genetic data suggest the loss of a single negative charge is enough to trigger ALS (5Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At the other end of the spectrum are the ALS-associated mutations of hydrophobic residues in the SOD1 interior and of the loop glycines (Fig. 1). The common effect of these mutations is to destabilise the SOD1 framework by shifting the folding equilibrium toward the denatured state. For some mutants, e.g. A4V and G93A, the protein is even destabilised to the extent that the nascent chain cannot fold under physiological conditions without oxidation of the Cys57–Cys146 disulfide bridge or acquisition of the native metals (6Lindberg M.J. Normark J. Holmgren A. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15893-15898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Taken together, this tendency of the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations to reduce either repulsive charge or structural stability point at protein aggregation as a deterministic factor in ALS (5Sandelin E.

Sci. 2007; 32: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This physical-chemical link to protein aggregation complies also with the occurrence of pathological SOD1 inclusions in the spinal cord of ALS patients (8Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S.

Brain. 2004; 127: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Another conspicuous feature of the ALS mechanism is that several of the SOD1 mutations show a characteristic uniform disease progression. For example, the survival time after symptomatic onset for patients carrying the A4V is invariable short (<2 years), whereas the survival time for patients with the H46R is always very long (≫10 years). On this basis several investigations have been directed to examine if there is a coupling between the physical-chemical properties of the ALS-provoking SOD1 mutations and the severity of disease (12Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Wang Q. Johnson J.L. Agar N.Y. Agar J.N.

That is, are the most perturbing mutations also the ones that cause the worse damage? Regarding the age of onset there is no apparent trend, most mutations for which reliable data are available has a mean age of onset of 46–47 years (14Andersen P.M. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2006; 6: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicating the ALS mechanism in this respect is different from that of Lund-Huntington disease where the length of the poly(Q) additions correlates with age of onset of clinical symptoms (15Chen S.M. Ferrone F.A. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2002; 99: 11884-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 16Landles C. Bates G.P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). When it comes to the disease progression, however, the thermodynamic stability of the apoSOD1 species hints at a weak correlation with survival time after first diagnosis for a subset of non-charged ALS mutations selected on the basis of good clinical statistics (17Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This trend has also been discerned with a more extensive set of ALS mutations even though the scatter of the data is close to abbreviate the significance of the signal (13Wang Q. Johnson J.L. Agar N.Y. Agar J.N. Plos Biology. 2008; 6: 1508-1526Google Scholar). The main problem is uncertain survival statistics because of low patient numbers. For the majority (76%) of the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations there are less than 5 reported disease cases and this shortage of data is particularly alarming for mutations with long survival times (supplemental Table S1). In addition to this statistical uncertainty, however, there seems also to be mutations that simply break the pattern. A good example of such a statistically safe outlier is the mutation D101N. This mutation yields a thermal melting transition close to that of the wild-type protein and is still associated with patient survival times of <5 years (n = 17). In sharp contrast, the more destabilizing ALS mutation D90A displays typically survival times >5 years (n = 15) despite having the same effect on the net repulsive charge. Both mutations reduce the charge of the apoSOD1 monomer from −6 to −5 accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that these differences in survival time stem from specific effects on the SOD1 molecule or its interaction with cellular components that go beyond any underlying dependence on the global parameters net charge and thermodynamic stability. In this study, we have systematically tried to verify and extend the set of property outliers to see if these deviating SOD1 mutations can reveal new clues to the ALS mechanism. The analysis identifies 5 ALS-associated charge mutations with apo-state stabilities and global folding transitions identical to those of the wild-type protein, i.e. D76V, D76Y, D101N, N139D, and N139K. The results provide direct experimental support for the genetic indication that reduction of the net charge by just one unit induces ALS with high penetrance. Moreover, the data point at an additional molecular factor in the mechanism of SOD-induced ALS: the rupture of conserved hydrogen-bond networks at the SOD1 surface. As in other soluble proteins, the charged and polar side chains of SOD1 are found in connection to the protein surface where they protrude freely into the solvent or are involved in solvent-accessible salt links and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1). Replacement of such surface groups by point mutation has typically small effects on protein folding and stability.

https://openalex.org/W2022418824,"Emerging evidence suggests that immune proteins regulate activity-dependent synapse formation in the central nervous system (CNS). Mice with mutations in class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) genes have incomplete eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon projections to the CNS. This effect has been attributed to causes that are nonretinal in origin. We show that a key component of MHCI receptor, CD3ζ, is expressed in RGCs. CD3ζ-deficient mice have reduced RGC dendritic motility, an increase in RGC dendritic density, and a selective defect of glutamate-receptor-mediated synaptic activity in the retina. Disrupted RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility is associated with a failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the CNS. These results provide direct evidence of an unrecognized requirement for immune proteins in the developmental regulation of RGC synaptic wiring and indicate a possible retinal origin for the disruption of eye-specific segregation found in immune-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2019859503,"Background The homeobox gene Prox1 is required for lens, retina, pancreas, liver, and lymphatic vasculature development and is expressed in inner ear supporting cells and neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings We have investigated the role of Prox1 in the developing mouse ear taking advantage of available standard and conditional Prox1 mutant mouse strains using Tg(Pax2-Cre) and Tg(Nes-Cre). A severe reduction in the size of the canal cristae but not of other vestibular organs or the cochlea was identified in the E18.5 Prox1Flox/Flox; Tg(Pax2-Cre) mutant ear. In these mutant embryos, hair cell differentiated; however, their distribution pattern was slightly disorganized in the cochlea where the growth of type II nerve fibers to outer hair cells along Prox1 expressing supporting cells was severely disrupted. In the case of Nestin-Cre, we found that newborn Prox1Flox/Flox; Tg(Nestin-Cre) exhibit only a disorganized innervation of outer hair cells despite apparently normal cellular differentiation of the organ of Corti, suggesting a cell-autonomous function of Prox1 in neurons. Conclusions/Significance These results identify a dual role of Prox1 during inner ear development; growth of the canal cristae and fiber guidance of Type II fibers along supporting cells in the cochlea."
https://openalex.org/W2041447821,"Understanding the neural code underlying perception requires the mapping of physical stimulus parameters to both psychophysical decisions and neuronal responses. Here, we employed a novel psychophysical task in head-fixed rats to measure discriminability of vibrotactile whisker deflections. Rats could discriminate 90 Hz from 60 Hz pulsatile stimuli if stimulus intensity covaried with frequency. To pin down the physical parameters used by the rats to discriminate these vibrations, we manipulated stimulus amplitude to arrive at pairs of nondiscriminable stimuli. We found that vibrations matched in intensity (measured as mean absolute velocity), but differing in frequency, were no longer discriminable. Recordings of trigeminal ganglion neurons revealed that the distribution of neurometric sensitivities based on spike counts, but not interspike intervals, matched the rats' inability to discriminate intensity-matched stimuli. In conclusion, we suggest that stimulus mean absolute velocity, encoded in primary afferent spike counts, plays a prominent role for whisker-mediated perception."

Expression of MS4A genes is variable in tissues throughout the body; however, several are limited to cells in the hematopoietic system where they have known roles in immune cell functions. Genes in the small TMEM176 group share significant sequence similarity with MS4A genes and there is evidence of immune function of at least one of the encoded proteins. In this study, we examined the evolutionary history of the MS4A/TMEM176 families as well as tissue expression of the phylogenetically earliest members, in order to investigate their possible origins in immune cells.Orthologs of human MS4A genes were found only in mammals; however, MS4A gene homologs were found in most jawed vertebrates. TMEM176 genes were found only in mammals and bony fish. Several unusual MS4A genes having 2 or more tandem MS4A sequences were identified in the chicken (Gallus gallus) and early mammals (opossum, Monodelphis domestica and platypus, Ornithorhyncus anatinus). A large number of highly conserved MS4A and TMEM176 genes was found in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The most primitive organism identified to have MS4A genes was spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthus). Tissue expression of MS4A genes in S. acanthias and D. rerio showed no evidence of expression restricted to the hematopoietic system.Our findings suggest that MS4A genes first appeared in cartilaginous fish with expression outside of the immune system, and have since diversified in many species into their modern forms with expression and function in both immune and nonimmune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038012795,"Background Cell membrane interactions rely on lipid bilayer constituents and molecules inserted within the membrane, including specific receptors. HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a tumoricidal complex of partially unfolded α-lactalbumin (HLA) and oleic acid that is internalized by tumor cells, suggesting that interactions with the phospholipid bilayer and/or specific receptors may be essential for the tumoricidal effect. This study examined whether HAMLET interacts with artificial membranes and alters membrane structure. Methodology/Principal Findings We show by surface plasmon resonance that HAMLET binds with high affinity to surface adherent, unilamellar vesicles of lipids with varying acyl chain composition and net charge. Fluorescence imaging revealed that HAMLET accumulates in membranes of vesicles and perturbs their structure, resulting in increased membrane fluidity. Furthermore, HAMLET disrupted membrane integrity at neutral pH and physiological conditions, as shown by fluorophore leakage experiments. These effects did not occur with either native HLA or a constitutively unfolded Cys-Ala HLA mutant (rHLAall-Ala). HAMLET also bound to plasma membrane vesicles formed from intact tumor cells, with accumulation in certain membrane areas, but the complex was not internalized by these vesicles or by the synthetic membrane vesicles. Conclusions/Significance The results illustrate the difference in membrane affinity between the fatty acid bound and fatty acid free forms of partially unfolded HLA and suggest that HAMLET engages membranes by a mechanism requiring both the protein and the fatty acid. Furthermore, HAMLET binding alters the morphology of the membrane and compromises its integrity, suggesting that membrane perturbation could be an initial step in inducing cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2018714368,"Initiation of a cell cycle in an adult neuron leads to cell death, placing great importance on the mechanisms that normally suppress the neuronal cell cycle. We have previously shown that the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk5 is an important part of this process, but only when it is present in the nucleus. We report here that Cdk5 nuclear localization relies on its binding to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Cdk5 has no intrinsic nuclear localization signal; in the absence of p27, two weak nuclear export signals that bind CRM1 cause it to shuttle to the cytoplasm. When a neuron is subjected to stress, such as exposure to β-amyloid, the Cdk5-p27 interaction is lost, reducing Cdk5 levels in the nucleus and depriving the neuron of a major cell cycle suppression mechanism. Caspase-3 is activated within hours, but death is not immediate; elevated levels of cytoplasmic Cdk5 appear to retard neuronal death by a mechanism that may involve Bcl2.

IntroductionThe Cdks are the catalytic subunits of a family of nine serine/threonine protein kinases: Cdk1–Cdk9. Among all Cdks, Cdk5 is atypical in several ways. First, its activity does not rely on binding to regular cyclins. Instead, Cdk5 is activated by two specific proteins, p35 and p39, that are structurally similar to cyclins yet share no homology at the amino acid level (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Second, the actions of Cdk5 are not required for cell cycle progression (2van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar); rather, they are critical for neuronal development, migration, and cortical lamination (3Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although Cdk5 does not drive the cell cycle forward, it does hold the cycle in check. As a consequence, the loss of Cdk5 leads to a failure of cell cycle suppression and subsequent neuronal cell death. This is most evident in Cdk5−/− embryonic mouse neocortical neurons, both in vivo and in vitro (4Cicero S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Cdk5 is normally located in both nucleus and cytoplasm (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This distribution changes in neurons that have been shown to re-enter a cell cycle. For example, in the E2f1−/− mouse brain, many neurons in the cerebral cortex have replicated their DNA and continue to express proteins normally found only in cycling cells (7Wang L. Wang R. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12555-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar cell cycle events are found in neurons at risk for death in Alzheimer disease (8O'Hare M.J.

Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both of these situations, the “cycling” neurons have lost their nuclear Cdk5 but retain cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data suggest that nuclear/cytoplasmic transport is important to the cell cycle suppressor function of Cdk5 and stimulated our interest in the mechanisms that control Cdk5 localization in the neuron.We explore here the role of Cdk5 as a nucleocytoplasmic protein. We show that its nuclear localization is dependent on its binding with p27, whereas its cytoplasmic localization is achieved through the NES-CRM-1 nuclear export mechanism. We show that Cdk5 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the cell cycle. In postmitotic neurons in culture, Cdk5 nuclear export is required for cell cycle re-entry, but once in the cytoplasm, Cdk5 may protect against rapid neuronal death. Thus Cdk5 serves a dual protective function in the highly differentiated postmitotic neuron.DISCUSSIONThere is now a substantial literature documenting the fact that cell cycle re-entrance by postmitotic central nervous system neurons is tightly correlated with neuronal degeneration (13Yang Y.

If developing central nervous system neurons are forced to enter a cell cycle by expression of an oncogene, they will pass into the S phase and synthesize DNA, but rather than divide they will die (18Feddersen R.M.

Critically, blocking the cell cycle in these neurons (either pharmacologically or genetically) prevents the cell death (21Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Di Giovanni S.

Despite the frequent correlation of cell cycle and cell death in the same neuronal populations, the mechanistic pathway neurons use to suppress their cell cycle during adult life remains largely undefined. The data presented here begin to address this gap in our knowledge. We have found that cell cycle or cell death stimulation changes the Cdk5 nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and that this shuttling can actively regulate both the cell cycle and the initiation of the cell death process. This marks the control of Cdk5 transport as a critical part of the maintenance of a normal neuronal homeostasis.Nucleocytoplasmic proteins usually have both an NLS and an NES signal. During typical nuclear import, an importin family member binds to the NLS of its cargo and moves the importin-cargo complex into the nucleus (24Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Although there is a potential NLS located in amino acids 33–36 of Cdk5 (KRVR), our results show that the N31 truncation mutation containing the KRVR residues nonetheless localizes to the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S1). In support of this, Fu et al. (25Fu X. Choi Y.K. Qu D. Yu Y. Cheung N.S. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) could not find any significant binding between Cdk5 and any of several different importins. Phosphorylation can also play a role in nuclear localization (26Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Indeed we located several potential phosphorylation sites on Cdk5 with the use of the NetPhos web-based program. Mutation of these sites, however, did not change Cdk5 localization (supplemental Fig. S6). Instead, our data show that it is its interaction with p27 that localizes Cdk5 to the nucleus.As with most nucleocytoplasmic proteins, its subcellular location is also regulated by its ability to bind CRM1, a key mediator of nuclear export (27Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 28Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 29Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Truncation mutation studies indicate that the export of Cdk5 relies on two atypical NES motifs, located between amino acids 64 and 83 and amino acids 128 and 147. Their atypical form may help to explain why the 1–83 construct is only partially localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus unlike its nuclear import, which relies on a second protein (p27), nuclear export of Cdk5 is directed by its endogenous NES signals.Our cell cycle data illustrate that there are important functional consequences to the loss of the Cdk5-p27 interaction. First, in the absence of p27, the localization of Cdk5 becomes cytoplasmic. Second, this translocation relieves the Cdk5-dependent suppression of the cell cycle. We find it intriguing that if Cdk5 cannot bind p27, even if it is forced into the nucleus with an independent NLS, it cannot suppress the cell cycle. Exactly how the interaction of p27 and Cdk5 serves to arrest the cell cycle is unclear. Further work will be needed to answer this question. The consequences of Cdk5 nuclear export extend beyond the loss of cell cycle suppression. Our caspase-3 data illustrate that cytoplasmic but not nuclear Cdk5 slows the time course of β-amyloid toxicity. Taken together our results suggest that Cdk5 plays a protective function in a nerve cell during the process of cell cycle-related neuronal death. Cdk5 in the nucleus suppresses the cell cycle, whereas Cdk5 in the cytoplasm delays caspase-3 activation and Bcl2 degradation.Ours is not the only evidence that Cdk5 may have a protective function in neurons. Cdk5 has been shown to protect against excitotoxic death in cerebellar granule neurons (8O'Hare M.J. Kushwaha N. Zhang Y. Aleyasin H. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Albert P.R. Vincent I. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8954-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and to prevent neuronal apoptosis by negative regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other reports, including our own, have demonstrated that Cdk5-deficient neurons or cells are more, rather than less, vulnerable to Aβ-induced death than wild type cells (4Cicero S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Turner N.C. Lord C.J. Iorns E. Brough R. Swift S. Elliott R. Rayter S. Tutt A.N. Ashworth A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The present work broadens this evidence by showing that (i) in our conditions the nuclear and cytoplasmic portions of Cdk5 both contribute to its protective effect and (ii) the cytoplasmic action is independent of its effects on the cell cycle. Questions remain unanswered as to how cytoplasmic Cdk5 serves to protect the neuron. One potential mechanism, suggested by the data in Fig. 5, is that Cdk5 contributes to the stabilization of Bcl-2, which is localized mainly in the cytoplasm. This suggestion is consistent with previous models (32Wang C.X. Song J.H. Song D.K. Yong V.W. Shuaib A. Hao C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Cheung Z.H. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well, although other actions may contribute.This is a complex area of neurobiology because there are numerous reports that excess Cdk5 activity is neurotoxic rather than neuroprotective. For example, Mao and co-workers (34Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Tang X. Wang X. Gong X. Tong M. Park D. Xia Z. Mao Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4823-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) report that nuclear Cdk5 phosphorylates and destabilizes the anti-apoptotic factor, MEF2, thus contributing to the excitotoxic cell death of cultured neurons. In addition, several labs have argued that the hyperactivation of Cdk5 through the calpain cleavage of p35 to p25 is also responsible for neuronal cell death (36Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 37Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 38Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The integration of these disparate findings is crucial to our full understanding of the action of Cdk5 in neurons.We find that the movement of Cdk5 precedes or is contemporaneous with cell cycle initiation and precedes caspase cleavage. If this is correct, then part of the linkage between cycle and death might occur through Cdk5 itself. Our current model is diagrammed in Fig. 9. When a postmitotic neuron is subjected to cell cycle or cell death stimulation (such as in Alzheimer disease), the physical interaction between Cdk5 and p27 is lost. When this happens, Cdk5 and p27 are both transported into the cytoplasm by CRM1 (Fig. 7, B and C). The reduction in nuclear Cdk5 and p27 deprives the neuron of its cell cycle suppression activity. The stressed neuron re-enters the cell cycle, but with the enhanced levels of cytoplasmic Cdk5, the neurons are temporarily protected from cell death.An important remaining challenge is to link this model to the situation in the Alzheimer disease brain. Cdk5 protein levels are much higher in adult brain than in developing brain (39Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and higher still in the affected regions of the Alzheimer brain (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We are encouraged that the model shown in Fig. 9 has relevance to AD because, where it has been quantified, death by cell cycle in AD neurons is a slow process (9Busser J. Geldmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Mufson E.J. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that cytoplasmic Cdk5 contributes to this delayed cell death in Alzheimer disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases. IntroductionThe Cdks are the catalytic subunits of a family of nine serine/threonine protein kinases: Cdk1–Cdk9. Among all Cdks, Cdk5 is atypical in several ways. First, its activity does not rely on binding to regular cyclins. Instead, Cdk5 is activated by two specific proteins, p35 and p39, that are structurally similar to cyclins yet share no homology at the amino acid level (1Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Second, the actions of Cdk5 are not required for cell cycle progression (2van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar); rather, they are critical for neuronal development, migration, and cortical lamination (3Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although Cdk5 does not drive the cell cycle forward, it does hold the cycle in check. As a consequence, the loss of Cdk5 leads to a failure of cell cycle suppression and subsequent neuronal cell death. This is most evident in Cdk5−/− embryonic mouse neocortical neurons, both in vivo and in vitro (4Cicero S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Cdk5 is normally located in both nucleus and cytoplasm (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This distribution changes in neurons that have been shown to re-enter a cell cycle. For example, in the E2f1−/− mouse brain, many neurons in the cerebral cortex have replicated their DNA and continue to express proteins normally found only in cycling cells (7Wang L. Wang R. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12555-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar cell cycle events are found in neurons at risk for death in Alzheimer disease (8O'Hare M.J. Kushwaha N. Zhang Y. Aleyasin H. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Albert P.R. Vincent I. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8954-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Busser J. Geldmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both of these situations, the “cycling” neurons have lost their nuclear Cdk5 but retain cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data suggest that nuclear/cytoplasmic transport is important to the cell cycle suppressor function of Cdk5 and stimulated our interest in the mechanisms that control Cdk5 localization in the neuron.We explore here the role of Cdk5 as a nucleocytoplasmic protein. We show that its nuclear localization is dependent on its binding with p27, whereas its cytoplasmic localization is achieved through the NES-CRM-1 nuclear export mechanism. We show that Cdk5 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during the cell cycle. In postmitotic neurons in culture, Cdk5 nuclear export is required for cell cycle re-entry, but once in the cytoplasm, Cdk5 may protect against rapid neuronal death. Thus Cdk5 serves a dual protective function in the highly differentiated postmitotic neuron. The Cdks are the catalytic subunits of a family of nine serine/threonine protein kinases: Cdk1–Cdk9. Among all Cdks, Cdk5 is atypical in several ways. First, its activity does not rely on binding to regular cyclins.

DISCUSSIONThere is now a substantial literature documenting the fact that cell cycle re-entrance by postmitotic central nervous system neurons is tightly correlated with neuronal degeneration (13Yang Y.

For example, Mao and co-workers (34Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Tang X. Wang X. Gong X. Tong M. Park D. Xia Z. Mao Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4823-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) report that nuclear Cdk5 phosphorylates and destabilizes the anti-apoptotic factor, MEF2, thus contributing to the excitotoxic cell death of cultured neurons. In addition, several labs have argued that the hyperactivation of Cdk5 through the calpain cleavage of p35 to p25 is also responsible for neuronal cell death (36Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 37Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The integration of these disparate findings is crucial to our full understanding of the action of Cdk5 in neurons.We find that the movement of Cdk5 precedes or is contemporaneous with cell cycle initiation and precedes caspase cleavage. If this is correct, then part of the linkage between cycle and death might occur through Cdk5 itself. Our current model is diagrammed in Fig. 9. When a postmitotic neuron is subjected to cell cycle or cell death stimulation (such as in Alzheimer disease), the physical interaction between Cdk5 and p27 is lost. When this happens, Cdk5 and p27 are both transported into the cytoplasm by CRM1 (Fig. 7, B and C). The reduction in nuclear Cdk5 and p27 deprives the neuron of its cell cycle suppression activity. The stressed neuron re-enters the cell cycle, but with the enhanced levels of cytoplasmic Cdk5, the neurons are temporarily protected from cell death.An important remaining challenge is to link this model to the situation in the Alzheimer disease brain. Cdk5 protein levels are much higher in adult brain than in developing brain (39Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and higher still in the affected regions of the Alzheimer brain (5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We are encouraged that the model shown in Fig. 9 has relevance to AD because, where it has been quantified, death by cell cycle in AD neurons is a slow process (9Busser J. Geldmacher D.S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Mufson E.J. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that cytoplasmic Cdk5 contributes to this delayed cell death in Alzheimer disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases. There is now a substantial literature documenting the fact that cell cycle re-entrance by postmitotic central nervous system neurons is tightly correlated with neuronal degeneration (13Yang Y. Mufson E.J. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Höglinger G.U. Breunig J.J. Depboylu C. Rouaux C. Michel P.P. Alvarez-Fischer D. Boutillier A.L. Degregori J.

It has been observed in human diseases ranging from ataxia-telangiectasia to Parkinson disease to Alzheimer disease (15Vincent I. Rosado M. Davies P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M.

If developing central nervous system neurons are forced to enter a cell cycle by expression of an oncogene, they will pass into the S phase and synthesize DNA, but rather than divide they will die (18Feddersen R.M. Clark H.B. Yunis W.S. Orr H.T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Feddersen R.M. Ehlenfeldt R. Yunis W.S. Clark H.B. Orr H.T.

Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 42-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Critically, blocking the cell cycle in these neurons (either pharmacologically or genetically) prevents the cell death (21Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Di Giovanni S.

Despite the frequent correlation of cell cycle and cell death in the same neuronal populations, the mechanistic pathway neurons use to suppress their cell cycle during adult life remains largely undefined. The data presented here begin to address this gap in our knowledge. We have found that cell cycle or cell death stimulation changes the Cdk5 nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and that this shuttling can actively regulate both the cell cycle and the initiation of the cell death process. This marks the control of Cdk5 transport as a critical part of the maintenance of a normal neuronal homeostasis. Nucleocytoplasmic proteins usually have both an NLS and an NES signal. During typical nuclear import, an importin family member binds to the NLS of its cargo and moves the importin-cargo complex into the nucleus (24Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Although there is a potential NLS located in amino acids 33–36 of Cdk5 (KRVR), our results show that the N31 truncation mutation containing the KRVR residues nonetheless localizes to the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S1). In support of this, Fu et al. (25Fu X. Choi Y.K. Qu D. Yu Y. Cheung N.S. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) could not find any significant binding between Cdk5 and any of several different importins. Phosphorylation can also play a role in nuclear localization (26Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Indeed we located several potential phosphorylation sites on Cdk5 with the use of the NetPhos web-based program. Mutation of these sites, however, did not change Cdk5 localization (supplemental Fig. S6). Instead, our data show that it is its interaction with p27 that localizes Cdk5 to the nucleus. As with most nucleocytoplasmic proteins, its subcellular location is also regulated by its ability to bind CRM1, a key mediator of nuclear export (27Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 28Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 29Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Truncation mutation studies indicate that the export of Cdk5 relies on two atypical NES motifs, located between amino acids 64 and 83 and amino acids 128 and 147. Their atypical form may help to explain why the 1–83 construct is only partially localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus unlike its nuclear import, which relies on a second protein (p27), nuclear export of Cdk5 is directed by its endogenous NES signals. Our cell cycle data illustrate that there are important functional consequences to the loss of the Cdk5-p27 interaction. First, in the absence of p27, the localization of Cdk5 becomes cytoplasmic. Second, this translocation relieves the Cdk5-dependent suppression of the cell cycle. We find it intriguing that if Cdk5 cannot bind p27, even if it is forced into the nucleus with an independent NLS, it cannot suppress the cell cycle. Exactly how the interaction of p27 and Cdk5 serves to arrest the cell cycle is unclear. Further work will be needed to answer this question. The consequences of Cdk5 nuclear export extend beyond the loss of cell cycle suppression. Our caspase-3 data illustrate that cytoplasmic but not nuclear Cdk5 slows the time course of β-amyloid toxicity. Taken together our results suggest that Cdk5 plays a protective function in a nerve cell during the process of cell cycle-related neuronal death. Cdk5 in the nucleus suppresses the cell cycle, whereas Cdk5 in the cytoplasm delays caspase-3 activation and Bcl2 degradation. Ours is not the only evidence that Cdk5 may have a protective function in neurons. Cdk5 has been shown to protect against excitotoxic death in cerebellar granule neurons (8O'Hare M.J. Kushwaha N. Zhang Y. Aleyasin H. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Albert P.R. Vincent I. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8954-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and to prevent neuronal apoptosis by negative regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other reports, including our own, have demonstrated that Cdk5-deficient neurons or cells are more, rather than less, vulnerable to Aβ-induced death than wild type cells (4Cicero S. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The present work broadens this evidence by showing that (i) in our conditions the nuclear and cytoplasmic portions of Cdk5 both contribute to its protective effect and (ii) the cytoplasmic action is independent of its effects on the cell cycle. Questions remain unanswered as to how cytoplasmic Cdk5 serves to protect the neuron. One potential mechanism, suggested by the data in Fig. 5, is that Cdk5 contributes to the stabilization of Bcl-2, which is localized mainly in the cytoplasm. This suggestion is consistent with previous models (32Wang C.X. Song J.H. Song D.K. Yong V.W. Shuaib A. Hao C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Cheung Z.H. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J.

https://openalex.org/W2009747545,"Cellular cholesterol balance induces changes in the inflammatory status of macrophages, and low grade chronic inflammation is increasingly being recognized as one of the key steps in the development of atherosclerosis as well as insulin resistance. Cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of intracellular stored cholesteryl esters (CEs) and thereby enhances free cholesterol efflux and reduces cellular CE content. We have earlier reported reduced atherosclerosis and lesion necrosis in macrophage-specific CEH transgenic mice on a Ldlr(-/-) background. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that reduced intracellular accumulation of CE in macrophages from CEH transgenic mice will attenuate expression of proinflammatory mediators, thereby reducing infiltration into adipose tissue, alleviating inflammation, and resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. Western diet fed Ldlr(-/-)CEH transgenic mice showed improved insulin sensitivity as assessed by glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Macrophages from CEH transgenic mice expressed significantly lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6) and chemokine (MCP-1; monocyte chemoattractant protein). Attenuation of NF-kappaB- and AP-1-driven gene expression was determined to be the underlying mechanism. Infiltration of macrophages into the adipose tissue that increases inflammation and impairs insulin signaling was also significantly reduced in Ldlr(-/-)CEH transgenic mice. In the OP-9 adipocyte peritoneal macrophage co-culture system, macrophages from CEH transgenic mice had a significantly reduced effect on insulin signaling as measured by Akt phosphorylation compared with nontransgenic macrophages. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that macrophage-specific overexpression of CEH decreases expression of proinflammatory mediators and attenuates macrophage infiltration into the adipose tissue, resulting in decreased circulating cytokines and improved insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2010888041,"In HEK cells stably expressing type 1 receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH causes a sensitization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R) to IP(3) that is entirely mediated by cAMP and requires cAMP to pass directly from type 6 adenylyl cyclase (AC6) to IP(3)R2. Using DT40 cells expressing single subtypes of mammalian IP(3)R, we demonstrate that high concentrations of cAMP similarly sensitize all IP(3)R isoforms to IP(3) by a mechanism that does not require cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). IP(3) binding to IP(3)R2 is unaffected by cAMP, and sensitization is not mediated by the site through which ATP potentiates responses to IP(3). In single channel recordings from excised nuclear patches of cells expressing IP(3)R2, cAMP alone had no effect, but it increased the open probability of IP(3)R2 activated by a submaximal concentration of IP(3) alone or in combination with a maximally effective concentration of ATP. These results establish that cAMP itself increases the sensitivity of all IP(3)R subtypes to IP(3). For IP(3)R2, this sensitization results from cAMP binding to a novel site that increases the efficacy of IP(3). Using stably expressed short hairpin RNA to reduce expression of the G-protein, G alpha(s), we demonstrate that attenuation of AC activity by loss of G alpha(s) more substantially reduces sensitization of IP(3)R by PTH than does comparable direct inhibition of AC. This suggests that G alpha(s) may also specifically associate with each AC x IP(3)R complex. We conclude that all three subtypes of IP(3)R are regulated by cAMP independent of PKA. In HEK cells, where IP(3)R2 selectively associates with AC6, G alpha(s) also associates with the AC x IP(3)R signaling junction."

Monovalent vaccines have undergone preclinical and clinical development prior to initiation of mass immunization campaigns. We have carried out a series of immunogenicity and protection studies following active immunization of mice, which indicate that a whole virus, nonadjuvanted vaccine is immunogenic at low doses and protects against live virus challenge. The immunogenicity in this model was comparable to that of a whole virus H5N1 vaccine, which had previously been demonstrated to induce high levels of seroprotection in clinical studies. The efficacy of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine in protecting against live virus challenge was also seen to be equivalent to that of the H5N1 vaccine. The protective efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine was also confirmed using a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. It was demonstrated that mouse and guinea pig immune sera elicited following active H1N1 vaccination resulted in 100% protection of SCID mice following passive transfer of immune sera and lethal challenge. The immune responses to a whole virus pandemic H1N1 and a split seasonal H1N1 vaccine were also compared in this study. It was demonstrated that the whole virus vaccine induced a balanced Th-1 and Th-2 response in mice, whereas the split vaccine induced mainly a Th-2 response and only minimal levels of Th-1 responses. These data supported the initiation of clinical studies with the same low doses of whole virus vaccine that had previously been demonstrated to be immunogenic in clinical studies with a whole virus H5N1 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2000236879,"Vastly divergent sequences populate a majority of protein folds. In the quest to identify features that are conserved within protein domains belonging to the same fold, we set out to examine the entire protein universe on a fold-by-fold basis. We report that the atomic interaction network in the solvent-unexposed core of protein domains are fold-conserved, extraordinary sequence divergence notwithstanding. Further, we find that this feature, termed protein core atomic interaction network (or PCAIN) is significantly distinguishable across different folds, thus appearing to be “signature” of a domain's native fold. As part of this study, we computed the PCAINs for 8698 representative protein domains from families across the 1018 known protein folds to construct our seed database and an automated framework was developed for PCAIN-based characterization of the protein fold universe. A test set of randomly selected domains that are not in the seed database was classified with over 97% accuracy, independent of sequence divergence. As an application of this novel fold signature, a PCAIN-based scoring scheme was developed for comparative (homology-based) structure prediction, with 1–2 angstroms (mean 1.61A) Cα RMSD generally observed between computed structures and reference crystal structures. Our results are consistent across the full spectrum of test domains including those from recent CASP experiments and most notably in the ‘twilight’ and ‘midnight’ zones wherein <30% and <10% target-template sequence identity prevails (mean twilight RMSD of 1.69A). We further demonstrate the utility of the PCAIN protocol to derive biological insight into protein structure-function relationships, by modeling the structure of the YopM effector novel E3 ligase (NEL) domain from plague-causative bacterium Yersinia Pestis and discussing its implications for host adaptive and innate immune modulation by the pathogen. Considering the several high-throughput, sequence-identity-independent applications demonstrated in this work, we suggest that the PCAIN is a fundamental fold feature that could be a valuable addition to the arsenal of protein modeling and analysis tools."
https://openalex.org/W2017214527,"Recent work has led to the identification of novel endocytic compartments with functional roles in both protein trafficking and growth factor signal transduction. The phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding, FYVE domain-containing protein WDFY2 is localized to a distinct subset of early endosomes, which are localized close to the plasma membrane. Here, we find that the serine/threonine kinase Akt interacts with these endosomes in an isoform-specific manner. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy we demonstrate specific co-localization of WDFY2 with endogenous Akt2, but not Akt1. Moreover, depletion of WDFY2 leads to impaired phosphorylation of Akt in response to insulin due to isoform specific reduction of Akt2, but not Akt1, protein levels, and to a marked reduction in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of numerous Akt substrates. This is accompanied by an impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and, after prolonged silencing, a reduction in the level of expression of adipogenic genes. We propose that WDFY2-enriched endosomes serve as a scaffold that enables specificity of insulin signaling through Akt2."
https://openalex.org/W2009654808,"Transcription factor IID (TFIID) plays a key role in regulating eukaryotic gene expression by directly binding promoters and enhancer-bound transactivator proteins. However, the precise mechanisms and outcomes of transactivator-TFIID interaction remain unclear. Transcription of yeast ribosomal protein genes requires TFIID and the DNA-binding transactivator Rap1. We have previously shown that Rap1 directly binds to the TFIID complex through interaction with its TATA-binding protein-associated factor (Taf) subunits Taf4, -5, and -12. Here, we identify and characterize the Rap1 binding domains (RBDs) of Taf4 and Taf5. These RBDs are essential for viability but dispensable for Taf-Taf interactions and TFIID stability. Cells expressing altered Rap1 binding domains exhibit conditional growth, synthetic phenotypes when expressed in combination or with altered Rap1, and are selectively defective in ribosomal protein gene transcription. Taf4 and Taf5 proteins with altered RBDs bind Rap1 with reduced affinity. We propose that collectively the Taf4, Taf5, and Taf12 subunits of TFIID represent the physical and functional targets for Rap1 interaction and, furthermore, that these interactions drive ribosomal protein gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1975810807,"The Src family kinases (SFKs) have been proposed to play stimulatory and inhibitory roles in platelet activation. The mechanisms for these apparently contradictory roles are unclear. Here we show that SFK, mainly Lyn, is important in stimulating a common signaling pathway leading to secretion of platelet granules. Lyn knock-out or an isoform-nonselective SFK inhibitor, PP2, inhibited platelet secretion of both dense and alpha granules and the secretion-dependent platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, collagen, and thromboxane A(2). The inhibitory effect of Lyn knock-out on platelet aggregation was reversed by supplementing granule content ADP, indicating that the primary role of Lyn is to stimulate granule secretion. Inhibitory effect of PP2 on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin and thromboxane A(2) were also reversed by supplementing ADP. Furthermore, PP2 treatment or Lyn knock-out diminished agonist-induced Akt activation and cyclic GMP production. The inhibitory effect of PP2 or Lyn knock-out on platelet response can be corrected by supplementing cyclic GMP. These data indicate that Lyn stimulates platelet secretion by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP pathway and also provide an explanation why Lyn can both stimulate and inhibit platelet activation."

We recently demonstrated that the F1BGFP reporter could be used to isolate NSPCs with self-renewal and multipotent capacities from human glioblastoma tissues in developing (E11.5, E14.5, E17.5, and P1) or adult mouse brains (27Hsu Y.C.

Furthermore, we showed that F1BGFP-selected NSPCs from mouse brains were able to repair the damaged sciatic nerve of paraplegic rats (38Lin Y.L. Jen J.C. Hsu S.H. Chiu I.M. Surg.

The regulatory factor protein of the X-box (RFX) family is characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and consists of seven members in mammals (RFX1–7) (40Aftab S. Semenec L. Chu J.S. Chen N. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The RFX family is conserved throughout the evolution in eukaryotic species and contains one member each from yeast (41Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (daf-19) (42Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol.

These RFX proteins feature a characteristic 76-amino acid DBD with a wing-helix structure (46Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The function of RFX1, the prototype of the RFX family, is not yet clear. RFX1 is expressed in various tissues, with especially high amounts in mammalian brain (40Aftab S. Semenec L. Chu J.S. Chen N. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RFX1 is expressed in the neurons of rat brain and contributes to the regulation of the expression of the neuron specifically expressed glutamate transporter type 3 (47Ma K. Zheng S. Zuo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21250-21255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results suggest a role of RFX1 in the nervous system. Knock-out of Rfx homologue in C. elegans leads to severe sensory defects (42Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, the Drosophila RFX homologue is necessary for ciliated sensory neuron differentiation (45Dubruille R. Laurençon A. Vandaele C. Shishido E. Coulon-Bublex M. Swoboda P. Couble P. Kernan M. Durand B. Development. 2002; 129: 5487-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that transcription factor RFX1 could bind the 18-bp cis-elements (−484 to −467) of the F1B promoter, modulate F1BGFP and FGF1 expression levels, and further regulate the self-renewal ability of GBM-SCs. Overexpression of RFX1 could down-regulate FGF-1B mRNA expression and neurosphere formation, whereas RNAi knockdown of RFX1 demonstrated the opposite effects. Our findings provide insights into FGF1 gene regulation and suggest the role of RFX1 in the maintenance of GBM-SCs. RFX1 may negatively regulate the self-renewal of GBM-SCs through modulating FGF-1B and FGF1 expression levels by binding the 18-bp cis-elements of the FGF-1B promoter. FGF-1A promoter (−826 to +77), FGF-1B promoter (−540 to +31), FGF-1C promoter (−1601 to +88), and FGF-1D promoter (−985 to +40) sequences (3Chiu I.M. Touhalisky K. Baran C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 155-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed using the MatInspector program (48Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) with matrix library 6.3 in the matrix group of vertebrates. To test the DNA-binding ability of the DNA-binding domain of RFX1 (amino acids 441–512), we generated a target reporter construct for library screening (49Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four tandem repeats of the 18-bp (−484 to −467) sequences were ligated and subcloned into the upstream region of the minimal promoter of either pHISi-1 or placZi reporter plasmids. The resultant plasmids were then transformed and integrated into the yeast genome of YM4271 to generate a dual reporter yeast strain designated YM4271/p1B18H1/p1B18Z. The cDNA of RFX1 DBD, which is highly homologous to other RFX proteins, was inserted in sense or antisense orientation behind the activation domain of pGAD10, with these designated pGAD10-RFX1-DBD(+) and pGAD10-RFX1-DBD(−), respectively. Subsequently, these plasmids were transformed into YM4271/p1B18H1/p1B18Z, and the transformants were selected in SD/−Leu/−His medium with 45 mm 3-aminotriazole. In this experiment, pGAD10 and pGAD10-RFX1-DBD(−) were used as negative controls. The process of yeast one-hybrid was according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Nucleotides −540 to +31 of the 1B promoter of the human FGF1 gene (4Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.M. J. Biol.

We also cloned the nucleotides −540 to +31 of the human FGF-1B promoter into the pEGFP1 (Clontech) vectors to construct the pF1BGFP reporter (27Hsu Y.C. Lee D.C. Chen S.L. Liao W.C. Lin J.W.

On day 2, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pF1BGFP using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck). Percentage of F1BGFP-positive cells was analyzed by using flow cytometry according to the procedures described elsewhere (27Hsu Y.C. Lee D.C. Chen S.L. Liao W.C. Lin J.W. Chiu W.T. Chiu I.M. Dev.

A total of 1 × 104 cells were gated on a dot plot forward side scatter on the x axis and side scatter on the y axis. The gated cells were evaluated on a histogram displaying FL1 (GFP) on the x axis and side scatter on the y axis. Human glioblastoma cells, U-1240 MG, were cultured in minimal essential media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C as described previously (4Myers R.L.

U-1240 MG/F1BGFP cells were further cultured in culture medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. KT98 cells were derived from brain tumors of transgenic mice that expressed the large T-antigen driven by the F1B promoter (8Chiu I.M. Touhalisky K. Liu Y. Yates A. Frostholm A.

KT98 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C.

Cells were transfected with pHA-RFX1-wt using the GeneJuice transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ChIP assay was performed using the EZ ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's description. Briefly, U-1240 MG cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in the medium for 5 min at room temperature, and this reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Subsequently, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted at 700 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and lysed in SDS/lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1). DNA was fragmented into around 200-bp pieces using the sonicator (Sonicor, Deer Park, NY). Sheared chromatin was diluted 10 times and precleared with protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. After pelleting the protein G-agarose at 4000 × g for 1 min, 10 μl of the supernatant was removed as 1% input group and saved until the reverse cross-linking step. Each reaction mixture was reacted with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-RFX1 (I-19X) and anti-RFX1 (D-19X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies, an anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Upstate, 06-599B) antibody for positive control, and nonspecific rabbit IgG (PP64B) (Upstate) as a negative control. The immunoprecipitated products were washed sequentially with low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and twice with TE buffer. The chromatin was eluted from the agarose by incubating with elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3), and the DNA-protein complexes were reversely cross-linked by high salt solution containing 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C for at least 5 h. To eliminate contaminations of proteins and RNAs, the mixture was treated with 10 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and then treated with protease K for 2 h at 45 °C. Finally, the precipitated DNA was recovered using the spin column provided in the ChIP kit and eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer. PCR was conducted using TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). 2 μl of the precipitated DNA was used as template. The sequences of the primers used in the ChIP assay were as follows: amplicon A, 5′-ACAGGGTTTCACAACTGGACATAA-3′ and 5′-CCAGATTCCCCCCCTCCTA-3′ with the amplicon size of 186 bp; amplicon B, 5′-GCAGGGATGCCAGATGACA-3′ and (5′-TGTGTGAGCCGAATGGACTTC-3′ with the amplicon size of 166 bp; amplicon C, 5′-TCAGGGTTTTGGTAGGGTGGTA-3′ and (5′-GATGTGGGTGTGGATAGTGTATGTG-3′ with the amplicon size of 177 bp; GAPDH, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′ with the amplicon size of 166 bp. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were trypsinized, followed by lysing in 100 μl of CERI buffer. After the lysates were vortexed for 15 s and incubated on ice for 10 min, 5.5 μl of CERII was added. The lysates were vortexed for 5 s, incubated on ice for 1 min, and vortexed again for 5 s. The nuclei were pelleted at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the cytoplasmic extracts were removed. Nuclei were resuspended in 25 μl of nuclear extraction buffer and vortexed for 15 s. The nuclei were extracted on ice and vortexed for 15 s every 10 min, for a total of 40 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad). Binding reaction containing 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 10 μg of nuclear extracts, 200-fold excess of cold competitors, and 20 fmol of 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes) was added sequentially and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixture was separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel at 50 V for 8–10 h. The resolved probes were transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membrane, RPN303B, Amersham Biosciences) at 600 mA for 2.5 h. Biotin-labeled probe on the membranes was detected using the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the chemiluminescent substrate provided in the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions; subsequently, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film. For EMSA supershift assay, 2 μg of anti-RFX1 (I-19X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal antibodies were added after adding the nuclear extracts and incubated for 15 min. Finally, the probe was added and incubated further for 15 min. The sequences of probes and cold competitors used in the EMSA experiment were as follows: 26 bp, 5′-ACGACCTGCTGTTTCCCTGGCAACTC-3′) AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; 18 bp, 5′-CTGTTTCCCTGGCAACTC-3′; 18-bp mut, 5′-CTTTTTCCCTTTCAACTC-3′; MAP1A, 5′-CGGCGTTGCCATGGAGACAACTCCG-3′; PyEP, 5′-GGCCAGTTGCCTAGCAACTAATAC-3′; m26 bp, 5′-ACAACCAGTTGTTTCCCTGGTGACAG-3′; and m18 bp, 5′-TTGTTTCCCTGGTGACAG-3′ (Protech Technology, Taipei, Taiwan). The above oligonucleotides were incubated with respective complementary oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, reaction buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, and then the temperature was decreased by 1 °C/s to 4 °C to anneal the complementary oligonucleotides. For expression analysis of human and mouse FGF-1B transcripts, RNA extracted from the U-1240 MG and KT98 cells was primed with oligo(dT) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptII reverse transcription (Invitrogen). Each cDNA transcribed from 500 ng of RNA was amplified using specific primer pairs with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) under the conditions of initial denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s and extension at 60 °C for 30 s, and finally extension at 60 °C for 1 min for completing the polymerization. The primer used in the PCR were as follows: human FGF-1B, 5′-TGAGCGAGTGTGGAGAGAGGTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTGAAGGTGGTGATTTCC-3′ with amplicon size of 114 bp; and mouse Fgf-1B, 5′-CCGTCTTGTGATAAAGTGGAGTGA-3′ and 5′-CAGCAAGCAGCGGTGGTA-3′ with amplicon size of 81 bp. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using an ABI prism 7500 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). We used the SYBR Green method to analyze the expression levels of RFX1, FGF-1B, and FGF1. The RFX1 primers are 5′-AGACCGGCGTTCCTACTCA-3′ and 5′-GGGGCACTTGGATGTTGGT-3′)with amplicon size of 129 bp. The FGF1 primers are 5′-ACAAGGGACAGGAGCGAC-3′ and 5′-TCCAGCCTTTCCAGGAACA-3′ with amplicon size of 63 bp. Ten micrograms of nuclear protein fraction was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a transfer buffer (6.2 mm boric acid, pH 8.0). Blots were incubated initially with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature and then with specific primary antibodies against GFP, hemagglutinin, and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies had been diluted (1:200) with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide. After antibody incubation, the blots were washed with TBS-T for 1 h and incubated with anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the secondary antibodies (1:2000) with TBS-T, immunodetection was performed, using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit for Western blot detection (Amersham Biosciences).

In the present study, we show that PLD1, but not PLD2, is posttranslationally modified by multi-monoubiquitination. Intriguingly, suppression of lipase activity either by mutation of the HKD motif (PLD1 H896R, K898R, or D903A) or the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding motif (PLD1 R691G,R695G) or through use of PLD-selective inhibitors impaired the ubiquitination of PLD1, although stimulation of lipase activity by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not enhance its ubiquitination. A palmitoylation-deficient mutant PLD1 allele, which exhibits altered patterns of vesicular trafficking, had significantly lower levels of monoubiquitination. In addition, the expression of ubiquitin-fused PLD1 induced aberrantly enlarged vesicles partially co-localized with the Golgi complex but not with early endosomes. The altered localization was reduced by the K898R mutation, suggesting a role of multi-monoubiquitination in PLD1 subcellular localization. Surprisingly, the degradation of PLD1, but not of PLD1 K898R or PLD2, was blocked by inhibitors of proteasomes but not by inhibitors of lysosomes or other proteases, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination in proteasomal degradation of PLD1. In summary, our studies show that PLD1, but not PLD2, is multi-monoubiquitinated.

https://openalex.org/W2036754324,"Autism is associated with high rates of genomic aberrations, including chromosomal rearrangements and de novo copy-number variations. These observations are reminiscent of cancer, a disease where genomic rearrangements also play a role. We undertook a correlative epidemiological study to explore the possibility that shared risk factors might exist for autism and specific types of cancer.To determine if significant correlations exist between the prevalence of autism and the incidence of cancer, we obtained and analyzed state-wide data reported by age and gender throughout the United States. Autism data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Education via the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (2000-2007, reported annually by age group) and cancer incidence data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1999-2005). IDEA data were further subdivided depending on the method used to diagnose autism (DSM IV or the Code of Federal Regulations, using strict or expanded criteria). Spearman rank correlations were calculated for all possible pairwise combinations of annual autism rates and the incidence of specific cancers. Following this, Bonferroni's correction was applied to significance values. Two independent methods for determining an overall combined p-value based on dependent correlations were obtained for each set of calculations. High correlations were found between autism rates and the incidence of in situ breast cancer (p < or = 10(-10), modified inverse chi square, n = 16) using data from states that adhere strictly to the Code of Federal Regulations for diagnosing autism. By contrast, few significant correlations were observed between autism prevalence and the incidence of 23 other female and 22 male cancers.These findings suggest that there may be an association between autism and specific forms of cancer."

However, the effects of genetic background and tissue types on DNA methylation at the genome-wide level have not been characterized extensively. To study the effect of genetic background and tissue types on global DNA methylation, we performed DNA methylation analysis using the Affymetrix 500K SNP array on tumor, adjacent normal tissue, and blood DNA from 30 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The use of multiple tissues from 30 individuals allowed us to evaluate variation of DNA methylation states across tissues and individuals. Our results demonstrate that blood and esophageal tissues shared similar DNA methylation patterns within the same individual, suggesting an influence of genetic background on DNA methylation. Furthermore, we showed that tissue types are important contributors of DNA methylation states."
https://openalex.org/W2089973243,"Drosophila body wall muscles are multinucleated syncytia formed by successive fusions between a founder myoblast and several fusion competent myoblasts. Initial fusion gives rise to a bi/trinucleate precursor followed by more fusion cycles forming a mature muscle. This process requires the functions of various molecules including the transmembrane myoblast attractants Dumbfounded (Duf) and its paralogue Roughest (Rst), a scaffold protein Rolling pebbles (Rols) and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor Loner. Fusion completely fails in a duf, rst mutant, and is blocked at the bi/trinucleate stage in rols and loner single mutants. We analysed the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Duf, by mutating conserved putative signaling sites and serially deleting the intracellular domain. These were tested for their ability to translocate and interact with Rols and Loner and to rescue the fusion defect in duf, rst mutant embryos. Studying combinations of double mutants, further tested the function of Rols, Loner and other fusion molecules. Here we show that serial truncations of the Duf intracellular domain successively compromise its function to translocate and interact with Rols and Loner in addition to affecting myoblast fusion efficiency in embryos. Putative phosphorylation sites function additively while the extreme C terminus including a PDZ binding domain is dispensable for its function. We also show that fusion is completely blocked in a rols, loner double mutant and is compromised in other double mutants. These results suggest an additive function of the intracellular domain of Duf and an early function of Rols and Loner which is independent of Duf."
https://openalex.org/W2040011040,"Background Since the dawn of genetics, additive and dominant gene action in diploids have been defined by comparison of heterozygote and homozygote phenotypes. However, these definitions provide little insight into the underlying intralocus allelic functional dependency and thus cannot serve directly as a mediator between genetics theory and regulatory biology, a link that is sorely needed. Methodology/Principal Findings We provide such a link by distinguishing between positive, negative and zero allele interaction at the genotype level. First, these distinctions disclose that a biallelic locus can display 18 qualitatively different allele interaction sign motifs (triplets of +, – and 0). Second, we show that for a single locus, Mendelian dominance is not related to heterozygote allele interaction alone, but is actually a function of the degrees of allele interaction in all the three genotypes. Third, we demonstrate how the allele interaction in each genotype is directly quantifiable in gene regulatory models, and that there is a unique, one-to-one correspondence between the sign of autoregulatory feedback loops and the sign of the allele interactions. Conclusion/Significance The concept of allele interaction refines single locus genetics substantially, and it provides a direct link between classical models of gene action and gene regulatory biology. Together with available empirical data, our results indicate that allele interaction can be exploited experimentally to identify and explain intricate intra- and inter-locus feedback relationships in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2001311229,"Increasing evidence has revealed important roles for complex glycans as mediators of normal and pathological processes. Glycosaminoglycans are a class of glycans that bind and regulate the function of a wide array of proteins at the cell-extracellular matrix interface. The specific sequence and chemical organization of these polymers likely define function; however, identification of the structure-function relationships of glycosaminoglycans has been met with challenges associated with the unique level of complexity and the nontemplate-driven biosynthesis of these biopolymers.To address these challenges, we have devised a computational approach to predict fine structure and patterns of domain organization of the specific glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate (HS). Using chemical composition data obtained after complete and partial digestion of mixtures of HS chains with specific degradative enzymes, the computational analysis produces populations of theoretical HS chains with structures that meet both biosynthesis and enzyme degradation rules. The model performs these operations through a modular format consisting of input/output sections and three routines called chainmaker, chainbreaker, and chainsorter. We applied this methodology to analyze HS preparations isolated from pulmonary fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Significant differences in the general organization of these two HS preparations were observed, with HS from epithelial cells having a greater frequency of highly sulfated domains. Epithelial HS also showed a higher density of specific HS domains that have been associated with inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Experimental analysis of elastase inhibition was consistent with the model predictions and demonstrated that HS from epithelial cells had greater inhibitory activity than HS from fibroblasts.This model establishes the conceptual framework for a new class of computational tools to use to assess patterns of domain organization within glycosaminoglycans. These tools will provide a means to consider high-level chain organization in deciphering the structure-function relationships of polysaccharides in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2016645971,"Prenatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is essential for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. However, false-positive results of screening testing are a concern as they may cause unnecessary emotional stress to pregnant women waiting for confirmatory test results. In regions with an extremely low prevalence, the positive predictive values of screening are unacceptably low rate. Here, we propose a HIV screening algorithm consisting of serial two fourth-generation enzyme immunoassays to reduce the number of false-positive screening results.When 6461 pregnant women presenting to two maternity hospitals located in the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan from September, 2004 to January, 2006 were tested using Enzygnost HIV Integral as a first screening test, 27 showed positive reactions. When these positive reaction samples were tested using VIDAS HIV DUO Quick as a second screening test, only one of them had a positive reaction, and the remaining 26 were nonreactive. Confirmatory Western blots and nucleic acid amplification test also showed that one was positive and the remaining 26 were negative; the subject who was positive with the confirmatory tests was identical to the subject who was positive with the second screening test. Thus, by adding the second screening test, the false-positive rate was improved from 0.4% to 0%, and the positive predictive value from 3.7% to 100%, compared with the single screening test.By applying our serial screening algorithm to HIV testing in maternity hospitals, many uninfected pregnant women would not need to receive confirmatory tests and be subjected to emotional turmoil while waiting for their confirmatory test results. This algorithm would be suitable for HIV testing of pregnant women living in low prevalence regions such as Japan."

CD4(+) counts, HIV RNA, and HIV progression events were collected monthly.A total of 267 participants were randomized. At week 32, the mean CD4(+) count was 134 cells greater in the IL-2 alone group (p<0.001), and 133 cells greater in the IL-2 plus ART group (p<0.001) compared to the no therapy group. Twelve participants in the IL-2 groups compared to 1 participant in the group assigned to no therapy experienced an opportunistic event or died (HR 5.84, CI: 0.59 to 43.57; p = 0.009).IL-2 alone or with peri-cycle HAART increases CD4(+) counts but was associated with a greater number of opportunistic events or deaths compared to no therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2025301787,"In gambling situations, we found a paradoxical reinforcing effect of high-risk decision-making after repeated big monetary losses. The computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 2000), which contained six big loss cards in deck B', was conducted on normal healthy college students. The results indicated that the total number of selections from deck A' and deck B' decreased across trials. However, there was no decrease in selections from deck B'. Detailed analysis of the card selections revealed that some people persisted in selecting from the “risky” deck B' as the number of big losses increased. This tendency was prominent in self-rated deliberative people. However, they were implicitly impulsive, as revealed by the matching familiar figure test. These results suggest that the gap between explicit deliberation and implicit impulsivity drew them into pathological gambling."
https://openalex.org/W2080204826,"Obesity has become a serious worldwide public health problem. Although neural degeneration in specific brain regions has been suggested to contribute to obesity phenotype in humans, a causal relationship between these two conditions has not been demonstrated experimentally. We now show that E4B (also known as UFD2a), a mammalian ubiquitin chain elongation factor (E4), induces the formation of intracellular aggregates positive for ubiquitin and the adaptor protein p62 when overexpressed in cultured cells or the brain. Mice transgenic for E4B manifested neural degeneration in association with aggregate formation, and they exhibited functional impairment specifically in a subset of hypothalamic neurons that regulate food intake and energy expenditure, resulting in development of hyperphagic obesity and related metabolic abnormalities. The neural pathology of E4B transgenic mice was similar to that of human neurodegenerative diseases associated with the formation of intracellular ubiquitin-positive deposits, indicating the existence of a link between such diseases and obesity and related metabolic disorders. Our findings thus provide experimental evidence for a role of hypothalamic neurodegeneration in obesity, and the E4B transgenic mouse should prove to be a useful animal model for studies of the relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and obesity."

All persons reporting violence and DSH related injury to the police station, the public hospital's ED, or both in Rawalpindi city from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 were included. In Rawalpindi city, 1016 intentional injury victims reported to police whereas 3012 reported to ED. Comparing violence related fatality estimates (N = 56, 95% CI: 46-64), police reported 75.0% and ED reported 42.8% of them. Comparing violence related injury estimates (N = 7990, 95% CI: 7322-8565), police reported 12.1% and ED reported 33.2% of them.

https://openalex.org/W2064429529,"The initial presentation of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) featured cross-validation to mitigate over-fitting, computationally efficient searches of the epistatic model space, and variable construction with constructive induction to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. However, the method was unable to differentiate association signals arising from true interactions from those due to independent main effects at individual loci. This issue leads to problems in inference and interpretability for the results from MDR and the family-based compliment the MDR-pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT). A suggestion from previous work was to fit regression models post hoc to specifically evaluate the null hypothesis of no interaction for MDR or MDR-PDT models. We demonstrate with simulation that fitting a regression model on the same data as that analyzed by MDR or MDR-PDT is not a valid test of interaction. This is likely to be true for any other procedure that searches for models, and then performs an uncorrected test for interaction. We also show with simulation that when strong main effects are present and the null hypothesis of no interaction is true, that MDR and MDR-PDT reject at far greater than the nominal rate. We also provide a valid regression-based permutation test procedure that specifically tests the null hypothesis of no interaction, and does not reject the null when only main effects are present. The regression-based permutation test implemented here conducts a valid test of interaction after a search for multilocus models, and can be applied to any method that conducts a search to find a multilocus model representing an interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2084659278,"State diagrams (stategraphs) are suitable for describing the behavior of dynamic systems. However, when they are used to model large and complex systems, determining the states and transitions among them can be overwhelming, due to their flat, unstratified structure. In this article, we present the use of statecharts as a novel way of modeling complex gene networks. Statecharts extend conventional state diagrams with features such as nested hierarchy, recursion, and concurrency. These features are commonly utilized in engineering for designing complex systems and can enable us to model complex gene networks in an efficient and systematic way. We modeled five key gene network motifs, simple regulation, autoregulation, feed-forward loop, single-input module, and dense overlapping regulon, using statecharts. Specifically, utilizing nested hierarchy and recursion, we were able to model a complex interlocked feed-forward loop network in a highly structured way, demonstrating the potential of our approach for modeling large and complex gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W2059263822,"Dictyostelium, an amoeboid motile cell, harbors several paralogous Sec7 genes that encode members of three distinct subfamilies of the Sec7 superfamily of Guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Among them are proteins of the GBF/BIG family present in all eukaryotes. The third subfamily represented with three members in D. discoideum is the cytohesin family that has been thought to be metazoan specific. Cytohesins are characterized by a Sec7 PH tandem domain and have roles in cell adhesion and migration.Dictyostelium SecG exhibits highest homologies to the cytohesins. It harbors at its amino terminus several ankyrin repeats that are followed by the Sec7 PH tandem domain. Mutants lacking SecG show reduced cell-substratum adhesion whereas cell-cell adhesion that is important for development is not affected. Accordingly, multicellular development proceeds normally in the mutant. During chemotaxis secG(-) cells elongate and migrate in a directed fashion towards cAMP, however speed is moderately reduced.The data indicate that SecG is a relevant factor for cell-substrate adhesion and reveal the basic function of a cytohesin in a lower eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W2050309285,"The Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinase (DDK) is required for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Another protein, Claspin, mediates the activation of a cellular checkpoint response to stalled replication forks and is also a regulator of replication. In this study, we found that DDK phosphorylates Claspin in vitro and forms a nuclear complex containing Cdc7, Drf1, and Claspin in Xenopus egg extracts. In addition, purified Claspin and DDK are capable of a direct in vitro interaction. We identified a conserved binding site on Claspin required for its interaction with DDK. This site corresponds to the first of two sequence repeats in the Chk1-binding domain of Claspin. Furthermore, we have established that two amino acids in this motif, Asp(861) and Gln(866), are essential for the interaction between Claspin and DDK. We found that mutant forms of Claspin incapable of interacting with DDK are still able to associate with and activate Chk1 in response to DNA replication blockages. However, Claspin-depleted egg extracts that have been reconstituted with these mutants of Claspin undergo DNA replication more slowly. These findings suggest that the interaction of DDK with Claspin mediates a checkpoint-independent function of Claspin related to DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1979160790,"Background Comprehensive analyses have recently been performed on many human cancer tissues, leading to the identification of a number of mutated genes but providing no information on the variety of mutations present in each of them. This information is of interest to understand the possible origin of gene mutations that cause tumors. Methodology/Principal Findings We have analyzed the sequence heterogeneity of the transcripts of the human HPRT and G6PD single copy genes that are not considered tumor markers. Analyses have been performed on different colon cancers and on the nearby histologically normal tissues of two male patients. Several copies of each cDNA, which were produced by cloning the RT-PCR-amplified fragments of the specific mRNA, have been sequenced. Similar analyses have been performed on blood samples of two ostensibly healthy males as reference controls. The sequence heterogeneity of the HPRT and G6PD genes was also determined on DNA from tumor tissues. The employed analytical approach revealed the presence of low-frequency mutations not detectable by other procedures. The results show that genetic heterogeneity is detectable in HPRT and G6PD transcripts in both tumors and nearby healthy tissues of the two studied colon tumors. Similar frequencies of mutations are observed in patient genomic DNA, indicating that mutations have a somatic origin. HPRT transcripts show genetic heterogeneity also in healthy individuals, in agreement with previous results on human T-cells, while G6PD transcript heterogeneity is a characteristic of the patient tissues. Interestingly, data on TP53 show little, if any, heterogeneity in the same tissues. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that genetic heterogeneity is a peculiarity not only of cancer cells but also of the normal tissue where a tumor arises."
