TREM2 senses lipids and mediates myelin phagocytosis, but its role in microglial lipid metabolism is unknown. Combining chronic demyelination paradigms and cell sorting with RNA sequencing and lipidomics, we find that wild-type microglia acquire a disease-associated transcriptional state, while TREM2-deficient microglia remain largely homeostatic, leading to neuronal damage. TREM2-deficient microglia phagocytose myelin debris but fail to clear myelin cholesterol, resulting in cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation. CE increase is also observed in APOE-deficient glial cells, reflecting impaired brain cholesterol transport. This finding replicates in myelin-treated TREM2-deficient murine macrophages and human iPSC-derived microglia, where it is rescued by an ACAT1 inhibitor and LXR agonist. Our studies identify TREM2 as a key transcriptional regulator of cholesterol transport and metabolism under conditions of chronic myelin phagocytic activity, as TREM2 LOF causes pathogenic lipid accumulation in microglia.

Microglia constantly surveil the brain parenchyma to eliminate dead cells, dysfunctional synapses, and other cellular debris (Deczkowska et al., 2018Deczkowska A. Amit I. Schwartz M.

With aging or in pathological conditions, parenchyma damage can facilitate the transition of microglia from homeostatic into reactive states. This transition profoundly alters the microglial transcriptome, leading to morphological changes, increased phagocytic activity, expression of various immune receptors, and enhanced cytokine secretion (Deczkowska et al., 2018Deczkowska A. Amit I. Schwartz M. Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Hammond et al., 2018Hammond T.R. Robinton D. Stevens B.

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed multiple states of microglia. These studies suggest that functional sub-populations of microglia co-exist within the brain in various mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, including homeostatic and disease-associated microglia (DAM), the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD), and activated response microglia (ARM) (Deczkowska et al., 2018Deczkowska A.

Collectively, we refer to responsive microglial states as damage-associated microglia, because different disease or aging models show significant overlap but distinct transcriptional profiles. Whether transition to damage-associated microglia states is beneficial or deleterious remains unclear and likely depends on the disease type, stage, and inherent pathology. Identifying the molecular and cellular basis underlying microglial states in healthy and disease conditions may facilitate the development of immune therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial dysfunction appears central to the etiology of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), as large-scale genetic studies have uncovered variants in LOAD risk-associated genes that are highly expressed in microglia (Carmona et al., 2018Carmona S.

Late onset Alzheimer’s disease genetics implicates microglial pathways in disease risk.Mol. Neurodegener. 2017; 12: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). One of the LOAD genes encodes triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a single-pass transmembrane immune receptor selectively expressed in microglia within the CNS. Individuals carrying rare heterozygous variants of TREM2, such as R47H, have higher LOAD risk (average odds ratio [OR] ∼4.5) (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M.

The immunoglobulin-like ectodomain (ECD) of TREM2 binds various ligands, including lipids, and the AD variant R47H has reduced affinity for apolipoproteins (e.g., APOE) or lipid ligands, suggesting that the increased LOAD risk reflects a partial loss of function (LOF) in lipid recognition and/or lipid-induced signaling (Atagi et al., 2015Atagi Y.

Trem2 overexpression reduces amyloid burden and neuritic dystrophy in an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model (Lee et al., 2018Lee C.Y.D. Daggett A. Gu X. Jiang L.L. Langfelder P. Li X. Wang N.

Rare homozygous TREM2 LOF mutations cause Nasu-Hakola disease, a syndrome with recurrent bone fractures, myelin loss, neurodegeneration, and early-onset dementia, likely resulting from microglial dysfunction (Paloneva et al., 2002Paloneva J.

Consistent with a role in microglia proliferation and survival, TREM2 signals via receptor tyrosine kinases DNAX-activation protein 10 (DAP10) and DAP12 to modulate proliferation, survival, immune response, calcium mobilization, cytoskeletal dynamics, mTOR signaling, autophagy, and energy metabolism (Ulland and Colonna, 2018Ulland T.K.

Hansen D.V. Sheng M. TREM2, microglia, and neurodegenerative diseases.Trends Mol. Med. 2017; 23: 512-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A proposed function of TREM2 is to mediate microglial response and transition to a damage-associated microglia state via control of gene expression (Deczkowska et al., 2018Deczkowska A. Amit I. Schwartz M. Microglial immune checkpoint mechanisms.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Ulland and Colonna, 2018Ulland T.K. Colonna M. TREM2—a key player in microglial biology and Alzheimer disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). scRNA-seq analyses of TREM2-deficient 5XFAD microglia revealed the inability to acquire a late-stage DAM profile (DAM stage 2), instead halting at an intermediate DAM state (DAM stage 1) (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H.

Other studies showed a key role for TREM2 and APOE in the transition to damage-associated microglia states (Krasemann et al., 2017Krasemann S. Madore C. Cialic R. Baufeld C. Calcagno N. El Fatimy R.

Winkelmann J. et al.Opposite microglial activation stages upon loss of PGRN or TREM2 result in reduced cerebral glucose metabolism.EMBO Mol. Med. 2019; 11: e9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microarray studies in Trem2–/– mice subjected to a demyelinating cuprizone (CPZ) diet also showed that TREM2 controls expression of many microglial genes controlling lipid transport (Apoe) or catabolism (Lpl) (Poliani et al., 2015Poliani P.L. Wang Y. Fontana E. Robinette M.L. Yamanishi Y. Gilfillan S. Colonna M. TREM2 sustains microglial expansion during aging and response to demyelination.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 2161-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Trem2–/– mice showed normal demyelination in the acute phase but partial remyelination during the recovery phase, suggesting that TREM2 may bind to myelin debris for engulfment and clearance, a process required for proper remyelination (Cantoni et al., 2015Cantoni C. Bollman B. Licastro D. Xie M. Mikesell R. Schmidt R. Yuede C.M. Galimberti D. Olivecrona G.

Invest. 2015; 125: 2161-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, whether TREM2 mediates myelin lipid processing in microglia is unknown. We sought to assess the physiological role of TREM2 in microglial lipid metabolism by subjecting mice to a demyelinating CPZ diet (Praet et al., 2014Praet J. Guglielmetti C. Berneman Z. Van der Linden A. Ponsaerts P. Cellular and molecular neuropathology of the cuprizone mouse model: clinical relevance for multiple sclerosis.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2014; 47: 485-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Myelin contains the majority (>80%) of the brain’s free cholesterol (Martín et al., 2014Martín M.G. Pfrieger F. Dotti C.G. Cholesterol in brain disease: sometimes determinant and frequently implicated.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 1036-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), allowing the assessment of microglial response to a chronic and extensive cholesterol challenge that is selective to the brain and independent of peripheral lipid metabolism. CPZ triggered the TREM2-dependent transition from a homeostatic to damage-associated microglia state with upregulation of genes controlling lipid transport and metabolism. Chronic myelin phagocytosis caused accumulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) and oxidized CE (oxCE) in Trem2–/– brain. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based lipidomic techniques revealed elevation of CE in Trem2–/– microglia, a phenotype also observed in Apoe–/– microglia after CPZ diet. This could be reproduced in vitro, where CE accumulation occurs in Trem2–/– bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia subjected to myelin challenge. CE accumulation was rescued by inhibition of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), which converts cholesterol to CE, and by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, suggesting that TREM2 LOF causes an impairment in cholesterol efflux. Our results establish a key role for TREM2 in the control of microglial gene expression and cholesterol transport upon chronic myelin phagocytosis. Failure to properly execute this program results in extensive neuronal damage in the brain. Because CE is known to accumulate in AD patient brain and AD mouse models (Astarita et al., 2011Astarita G.

TREM2—a key player in microglial biology and Alzheimer disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), our study strongly suggests that enhancing TREM2 function may be beneficial in AD, in part by facilitating lipid clearance in microglia. To characterize the effects of acute and chronic demyelination on TREM2-dependent gene expression in microglia, Trem2+/+, Trem2+/–, and Trem2–/– mice were fed a 0.2% CPZ diet for 5 or 12 weeks. CD11b+ microglia were isolated from hemibrain using FACS (Figures S1A–S1E). CPZ induced transcriptional changes in Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– microglia, whereas CPZ-challenged Trem2–/– microglia clustered with those of untreated mice (principal-component analysis [PCA]; Figure 1A). Few genotype-dependent differences were found under normal diet conditions (Figure 1B), but CPZ caused significant changes in hundreds of genes after 5 and 12 weeks (Figures 1B and 1C; absolute log2 fold change [FC] > 0.5, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.2; Data S1). These changes were restricted primarily to Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– microglia, while Trem2–/– microglia largely failed to respond to CPZ (Figures 1B and 1C). Analysis of gene sets from the Reactome database (Fabregat et al., 2018Fabregat A. Jupe S. Matthews L. Sidiropoulos K. Gillespie M. Garapati P. Haw R. Jassal B. Korninger F. May B. et al.The Reactome Pathway Knowledgebase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D649-D655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) revealed Trem2-dependent upregulation of genes involved in lysosome and phagosome function, AD, oxidative phosphorylation, and cholesterol metabolism. Key lysosome cathepsin genes, such as Ctse and Ctsl, were upregulated 2-fold upon chronic demyelination in Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– microglia (FDR < 0.05) but unchanged in Trem2–/– microglia (Figure 1D; Data S1; interaction p < 0.05). Previous microarray studies reported a failure of Trem2–/– microglia to upregulate genes involved in phagocytosis and lipid metabolism (Poliani et al., 2015Poliani P.L. Wang Y. Fontana E. Robinette M.L. Yamanishi Y. Gilfillan S. Colonna M. TREM2 sustains microglial expansion during aging and response to demyelination.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 2161-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We confirmed these results and expanded the list of lipid metabolism-related genes (Figure 1E). Importantly, several Trem2-dependent genes control cholesterol transport and metabolism, including Apoe, Apoc1, Ch25h, Lipa, Nceh1, Npc2, and Soat1. Gene set enrichment analysis also showed that DAM genes (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A. Matcovitch-Natan O. Dvir-Szternfeld R. Ulland T.K. David E. Baruch K.

This suggests that chronic demyelination induces expression changes related to those observed in 5XFAD and SOD1 microglia (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A.

We compared our TREM2 CPZ dataset with published homeostatic, DAM 1, and DAM 2 gene profiles. Homeostatic genes P2ry12 and Tmem119 were significantly downregulated in Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– (FDR < 0.01) but not Trem2–/– microglia in response to CPZ (Figure 1G; genotype-diet interaction p < 0.05; Data S1). Although described as a TREM2-independent phenomenon in an AD model, we observed reduced induction of DAM 1 genes such as Apoe (interaction p < 0.001) and Fth1 (interaction p < 0.005) in Trem2–/– compared with Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– microglia following CPZ treatment (Figure 1H). Apoe expression was 8-fold higher with CPZ treatment of Trem2+/+ and Trem2+/– mice after 12 weeks but was attenuated in Trem2–/– mice, similar to DAM 2 genes, such as Axl (interaction p < 0.05) and Cd9 (interaction p < 0.001) (Figure 1I; Data S1). Our data indicate a role of TREM2 in endolysosomal function and lipid metabolism, with a clear implication of cholesterol transport and metabolism. Additionally, they suggest that CPZ elicits a damage-associated microglia state that fails to be initiated in Trem2–/– microglia. Microglial dysfunction is a hallmark of the aging brain, as cells accumulate excessive myelin debris and acquire a DAM transcriptional state (Mecca et al., 2018Mecca C. Giambanco I. Donato R.

We sorted microglia derived from young (2-month-old) and aged (15- to 17-month-old) wild-type and Trem2–/– mice to assess whether aged Trem2–/– microglia exhibit a DAM-like state. Aged wild-type microglia downregulated a number of homeostatic genes and upregulated DAM 1 and DAM 2 genes compared to young microglia, albeit to a lesser degree than modulation in the CPZ model (Figures S1G and S1H). As with CPZ, activation of the DAM 2 gene set was attenuated in aged Trem2–/– microglia compared with aged controls (Figures S1G and S1H). This effect was most striking for Lpl and Spp1, consistent with the Trem2 dependency of the DAM 2 profile exhibited in 5XFAD microglia (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A. Matcovitch-Natan O. Dvir-Szternfeld R. Ulland T.K. David E. Baruch K. Lara-Astaiso D.

Unlike with CPZ, microglia from aged mice only showed a mild increase in expression of cholesterol metabolism-related genes compared with young mice, suggesting that aged microglia face only a minor cholesterol burden. Thus, gene expression changes in microglia derived from CPZ-challenged Trem2–/– mice are also present in aged Trem2–/– microglia, although the latter are less striking. To determine if the population-based CPZ-induced transcriptional changes observed were homogeneous across microglia, we conducted scRNA-seq on CD11b+/CD45low microglia isolated from CPZ-treated mice (Figures S2A–S2D). We used a graph-based clustering approach (Xu and Su, 2015Xu C. Su Z.

The molecular mechanism of how cohesin and CTCF structure the 3D genome has remained unclear. Here we show that a segment within the CTCF N terminus interacts with the SA2-SCC1 subunits of human cohesin. We report a crystal structure of SA2-SCC1 in complex with CTCF at a resolution of 2.7 Å, which reveals the molecular basis of the interaction. We demonstrate that this interaction is specifically required for CTCF-anchored loops and contributes to the positioning of cohesin at CTCF binding sites. A similar motif is present in a number of established and newly identified cohesin ligands, including the cohesin release factor WAPL2,3. Our data suggest that CTCF enables the formation of chromatin loops by protecting cohesin against loop release. These results provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanism that enables the dynamic regulation of chromatin folding by cohesin and CTCF."

To identify aspects of tumor heterogeneity that may illuminate drivers of tumor invasion, we created a glioblastoma tumor cell atlas with single-cell transcriptomics of cancer cells mapped onto a reference framework of the developing and adult human brain. We find that multiple GSC subtypes exist within a single tumor. Within these GSCs, we identify an invasive cell population similar to outer radial glia (oRG), a fetal cell type that expands the stem cell niche in normal human cortex. Using live time-lapse imaging of primary resected tumors, we discover that tumor-derived oRG-like cells undergo characteristic mitotic somal translocation behavior previously only observed in human development, suggesting a reactivation of developmental programs. In addition, we show that PTPRZ1 mediates both mitotic somal translocation and glioblastoma tumor invasion. These data suggest that the presence of heterogeneous GSCs may underlie glioblastoma's rapid progression and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2997000088,"Summary The molecular mechanisms that govern the maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells remain unclear. Emerging studies have shown that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most common internal RNA modification of mammalian mRNA, plays a critical role in various developmental processes. Here, we demonstrate that oligodendrocyte lineage progression is accompanied by dynamic changes in m6A modification on numerous transcripts. In vivo conditional inactivation of an essential m6A writer component, METTL14, results in decreased oligodendrocyte numbers and CNS hypomyelination, although oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) numbers are normal. In vitro Mettl14 ablation disrupts postmitotic oligodendrocyte maturation and has distinct effects on OPC and oligodendrocyte transcriptomes. Moreover, the loss of Mettl14 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells causes aberrant splicing of myriad RNA transcripts, including those that encode the essential paranodal component neurofascin 155 (NF155). Together, our findings indicate that dynamic RNA methylation plays an important regulatory role in oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination."

Orthogonal hetero-specific protein–protein interaction domains may facilitate better control of engineered biological systems. Here, we report a tunable de novo designed set of orthogonal coiled-coil (CC) peptide heterodimers (called the NICP set) and its application for the regulation of diverse cellular processes, from cellular localization to transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate the application of CC pairs for multiplex localization in single cells and exploit the interaction strength and variable stoichiometry of CC peptides for tuning of gene transcription strength. A concatenated CC peptide tag (CCC-tag) was used to construct highly potent CRISPR–dCas9-based transcriptional activators and to amplify the response of light and small molecule-inducible transcription in cell culture as well as in vivo. The NICP set and its implementations represent a valuable toolbox of minimally disruptive modules for the recruitment of versatile functional domains and regulation of cellular processes for synthetic biology. A set of orthogonal coiled-coil peptide heterodimers were developed to enable control of protein localization as well as transcriptional regulation by enhancing effector recruitment to TALE and CRISPR–dCas9 systems in mammalian cells and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2997151107,"As a low-end computed tomography (CT) system, translational CT (TCT) is in urgent demand in developing countries. Under some circumstances, in order to reduce the scan time, decrease the X-ray radiation or scan long objects, furthermore, to avoid the inconsistency of the detector for the large angle scanning, we use the limited-angle TCT scanning mode to scan an object within a limited angular range. However, this scanning mode introduces some additional noise and limited-angle artifacts that seriously degrade the imaging quality and affect the diagnosis accuracy. To reconstruct a high-quality image for the limited-angle TCT scanning mode, we develop a limited-angle TCT image reconstruction algorithm based on a U-net convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we use the SART method to the limited-angle TCT projection data, then we import the image reconstructed by SART method to a well-trained CNN which can suppress the artifacts and preserve the structures to obtain a better reconstructed image. Some simulation experiments are implemented to demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm for the limited-angle TCT scanning mode. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the developed algorithm can effectively suppress the noise and the limited-angle artifacts while preserving the image structures."
https://openalex.org/W2997022521,"BEAS-2B was originally established as an immortalized but non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line from human bronchial epithelium. Because of general recognition for its bronchial epithelial origin, the BEAS-2B cell line has been widely used as an in vitro cell model in a large variety of studies associated with respiratory diseases including lung carcinogenesis. However, very few studies have discussed non-epithelial features of BEAS-2B cells, especially the features associated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which represent a group of fibroblast-like cells with limited self-renewal and differentiation potential to various cell lineages. In this study, we compared BEAS-2B with a human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hMSCs) cell line, hMSC1, which served as a representative of hMSCs in terms of expressing common features of hMSCs. It was observed that both BEAS-2B and hMSC1 shared the same expression profile of surface markers of hMSCs and exhibited similar osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential. In addition, like hMSC1, the BEAS-2B cell line exhibited suppressive activities on proliferation of mitogen-activated total T lymphocytes as well as Th1 lymphocytes, and IFNγ-induced expression of IDO1, all thus demonstrating that BEAS-2B cells exhibited an almost identical characteristic profile with hMSCs, even though, there was a clear difference between BEAS-2B and hMSCs in the effects on type 2 macrophage polarization. Most importantly, the hMSCs features of BEAS-2B were unlikely a consequence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Therefore, this study provided a set of evidence to provoke reconsideration of epithelial origin of BEAS-2B."
https://openalex.org/W2997240459,"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is an imperative phytohormone for plant growth and development. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) are able to produce IAA.

This study aimed to investigate the IAA biosynthesis pathway of six ECM cultures including Astraeus odoratus, Gyrodon suthepensis, Phlebopus portentosus, Pisolithus albus, Pisolithus orientalis and Scleroderma suthepense. The results showed that all ECM fungi produced IAA in liquid medium that had been supplemented with L-tryptophan. Notably, fungal IAA levels vary for different fungal species. The detection of indole-3-lactic acid and indole-3-ethanol in the crude culture extracts of all ECM fungi indicated an enzymatic reduction of indole-3-pyruvic acid and indole-3-acetaldehyde, respectively in the IAA biosynthesis via the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway. Moreover, the tryptophan aminotransferase activity confirmed that all ECM fungi synthesize IAA through the indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway. Additionally, the elongation of rice and oat coleoptiles was stimulated by crude culture extract. This is the first report of the biosynthesis pathway of IAA in the tested ECM fungi."

Herein we report the intracellular macrophage potency of nine diverse ITA analogs with MIC values ranging from 0.0625–2.5 μM and mono-drug resistant potency ranging from 0.0017 to 7 μM. The in vitro ADME properties (protein binding, CaCo-2, human microsomal stability and CYP450 inhibition) were determined for an outstanding compound of the series, ND-11543. ND-11543 was tolerable at >500 mg/kg in mice and at a dose of 200 mg/kg displayed good drug exposure in mice with an AUC(0-24h) >11,700 ng·hr/mL and a >24 hr half-life. Consistent with the phenotype observed with other QcrB inhibitors, compound ND-11543 showed efficacy in a chronic murine TB infection model when dosed at 200 mg/kg for 4 weeks. The efficacy was not dependent upon exposure, as pre-treatment with a known CYP450-inhibitor did not substantially improve efficacy. The ITAs are an interesting scaffold for the development of new anti-TB drugs especially in combination therapy based on their favorable properties and novel mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2997255191,"DNA fragmentation is a fundamental step during library preparation in hybridization capture-based, short-read sequencing. Ultra-sonication has been used thus far to prepare DNA of an appropriate size, but this method is associated with a considerable loss of DNA sample. More recently, studies have employed library preparation methods that rely on enzymatic fragmentation with DNA endonucleases to minimize DNA loss, particularly in nano-quantity samples. Yet, despite their wide use, the effect of enzymatic fragmentation on the resultant sequences has not been carefully assessed. Here, we used pairwise comparisons of somatic variants of the same tumor DNA samples prepared using ultrasonic and enzymatic fragmentation methods. Our analysis revealed a substantially larger number of recurrent artifactual SNVs/indels in endonuclease-treated libraries as compared with those created through ultrasonication. These artifacts were marked by palindromic structure in the genomic context, positional bias in sequenced reads, and multi-nucleotide substitutions. Taking advantage of these distinctive features, we developed a filtering algorithm to distinguish genuine somatic mutations from artifactual noise with high specificity and sensitivity. Noise cancelling recovered the composition of the mutational signatures in the tumor samples. Thus, we provide an informatics algorithm as a solution to the sequencing errors produced as a consequence of endonuclease-mediated fragmentation, highlighted for the first time in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2997399728,"The most abundant member of the collagen protein family, collagen I (also known as type I collagen; COL1), is composed of one unique (chain B) and two similar (chain A) polypeptides that self-assemble with one amino acid offset into a heterotrimeric triple helix. Given the offset, chain B can occupy either the leading (BAA), middle (ABA) or trailing (AAB) position of the triple helix, yielding three isomeric biomacromolecules with different protein recognition properties. Despite five decades of intensive research, there is no consensus on the position of chain B in COL1. Here, three triple-helical heterotrimers that each contain a putative von Willebrand factor (VWF) and discoidin domain receptor (DDR) recognition sequence from COL1 were designed with chain B permutated in all three positions. AAB demonstrated a strong preference for both VWF and DDR, and also induced higher levels of cellular DDR phosphorylation. Thus, we resolve this long-standing mystery and show that COL1 adopts an AAB register. Designed heterotrimers of collagen I, locked in three possible chain registers, enable structural and functional characterization of each permutation, leading to identification of the AAB heterotrimer as the most active and therefore likely to occur biologically."
https://openalex.org/W2997260021,"A common idea in the discussion of soil carbon processes is that litter decomposition rates and soil carbon stocks are inversely related. To test this overall hypothesis, simultaneous studies were conducted of the relationship of environmental gradients to leaf and wood decomposition, buried cloth decomposition and percent soil organic matter in Taxodium distichum swamps across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MRAV) and northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) of the US. Decomposition of leaf tissue was 6.2 to 10.9 times faster than wood tissue. Both precipitation and flooding gradients were negatively related to leaf and wood litter decomposition rates based on models developed using Stepwise General Model Selection (MRAV vs. GOM, respectively). Cotton cloth should not be used as a proxy for plant litter without prior testing because cloth responded differently than plant litter to regional environmental gradients in T. distichum swamps. The overall hypothesis was supported in the MRAV because environments with higher precipitation (climate normal) had lower rates of decomposition and higher percent soil organic matter. In the MRAV, higher levels of percent soil organic matter were related to increased 30-year climate normals (30 year averages of precipitation and air temperature comprising southward increasing PrinComp1). Soil organic carbon % in inland vs. coastal T. distichum forests of the MRAV were comparable (range = 1.5% to 26.9% vs. 9.8 to 31.5%, respectively). GOM swamps had lower rates of litter decomposition in more flooded environments. Woody T. distichum detritus had a half-life of up to 300 years in the MRAV, which points to its likely role in the maintenance of inland ""teal"" soil organic carbon. This unique study can contribute to the discussion of approaches to maintain environments conducive to soil carbon stock maximization."

However, the structural changes in NOTCH3 involved in CADASIL etiology are unclear. Here, we discovered site-specific fragmentation of NOTCH3 protein in pathologically affected vessels of human CADASIL-affected brains. EM-based experiments to pinpoint NOTCH3 localization in these brains indicated accumulation of NOTCH3 fragmentation products in the basement membrane, collagen fibers, and granular osmiophilic material within the cerebrovasculature. Using antibodies generated against a disease-linked neo-epitope found in degenerating vascular medium of CADASIL brains, we mapped the site of fragmentation to the NOTCH3 N terminus at the peptide bond joining Asp80 and Pro81. Cleavage at this site was predicted to separate the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain from the remainder of the protein. We found that the cleavage product from this fragmentation event is released into the conditioned medium of cells expressing recombinant NOTCH3 fragments. Mutagenesis of Pro81 abolished the fragmentation, and low pH and reducing conditions enhanced NOTCH3 proteolysis. Furthermore, substitution of multiple cysteine residues of the NOTCH3 N terminus activated proteolytic release of the first EGF-like repeat, suggesting that the elimination of multiple disulfide bonds in NOTCH3 accelerates its fragmentation. These characteristics link the signature molecular genetic alterations present in individuals with CADASIL to a post-translational protein alteration in degenerating brain arteries. The cellular consequences of these pathological NOTCH3 fragments are an important area for future investigation.

Methods The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bacterial concentration (MBC) of the extracts against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853) and against bacteria that were isolated from cultures of vaginal secretions and urine from menopausal women with a diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) were determined by broth microdilution. Results The MIC values of the three extracts against Gram-positive and Gram-negative standard bacterial strains ranged from 7.81 to 125.00 mg ml-1, and the MBC values ranged from 7.81 to 500.00 mg ml-1. However, B. sulphurea was more efficient. In the urine samples, the three extracts inhibited the growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and the B. pilosa was the most active extract against E. coli compared with the other ones. For the vaginal secretion samples, no significant differences in the inhibition of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and P. mirabilis were found among the extracts. T. vulgare and B. sulphurea were more effective in inhibiting coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. compared with B. pilosa. E. coli was more susceptible to the B. sulphurea extract compared with the B. pilosa and T. vulgare extracts. Conclusion The present results suggested the potential medicinal use of Asteraceae species, especially B. sulphurea, as therapeutic agents against rUTI-related bacteria."

Still, little is known about whether there is any difference in depressive symptoms between sexual minority men and heterosexual men in China. This study investigated the differences in depressive symptoms and social support between 302 Chinese sexual minority men and 249 heterosexual men. The association between depressive symptoms, social support and sexual orientation was also explored. Our results indicated that Chinese sexual minority men have more depressive symptoms and perceived lower social support than heterosexual men. Overall, sexual orientation and social support both predicted depressive symptoms. Different from previous Western studies, in our results, social support fully mediates but does not moderate the relationship between sexual orientation and depressive symptoms in Chinese men. The current findings suggest that social support has a significant impact on depressive symptoms among Chinese sexual minority men, highlighting the unique role of social support in understanding depressive symptoms among Chinese sexual minority men. Providing more social support, as well as promoting accepting and positive environments, may lead to better adjustment in this population in China."
https://openalex.org/W2996795440,"Bioluminescent detection has become a powerful method that is used extensively in numerous areas in life science research. Given that fluorescence detection in plant cells is difficult owing to the autofluorescence of chlorophyll, the use of a luciferin-luciferase system should be effective in plant biology. However, the suitable optical window for a luminescence system in plants remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to determine the optical window and optimal luciferase reporter system for terrestrial plant analyses using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. We compared six different luciferase systems and found the green enhanced Nano-lantern (GeNL)-furimazine combination to be the optimal luciferase reporter. Spectral measurements of GeNL-furimazine showed that its luminescence peak falls within the range of optical transparency for chlorophyll and, therefore, enables greater penetration through a layer of cultured A. thaliana cells. Moreover, A. thaliana plants expressing GeNL with furimazine emitted strong luminescence, which could be detected even with the naked eye. Thus, the GeNL-furimazine combination should facilitate biological analyses of genes and cellular functions in A. thaliana and all other terrestrial plants."

Data was collected through patient interview and medical charts review. DTPs were identified based on the standard treatment guidelines and Micromedex® was used as drug interaction checker. Cipolle DTPs classification was used to classify the DTPs and Treatment Satisfaction with Medicine Questionnaire (SATMED-Q) was used to assess treatment satisfaction. Binary logistic regressions were utilized to identify the associated factors.Phenobarbital 195 (67%) and phenytoin 97 (33.3%) were the most frequently prescribed antiepileptic medications as monotherapy or combination therapy. Only 54 (18.6%) of the study participants had controlled seizure. DTP was found in 205(70.4%) of the study participants. From 352 DTPs identified, adverse drug reaction 146 (41.5%) was the leading DTPs followed by ineffective drugs 98 (27.8%) drug interaction 45 (12.8%) and inappropriate dose 42(11.9%). Headache, depression and epigastric pain were frequently reported adverse drug reaction. Among the study participants 167 (57.3%) were adherent to their medications. The number of medications taken by the patients had significant association with occurrence of DTPs, whereas source of medication and seizure free periods were found to have significant association with poor adherence. The global patient satisfaction was (67.4%) and lower satisfaction rate was found with regard to impact on daily activities (62.0%), treatment effectiveness (64.7%) and medical care (65.9%).Prevalence of DTPs among ambulatory epileptic patients was high and about half of the patients were nona-dherent for their medication.

To understand the regulatory mechanisms of these traits, it is crucial to clarify which genes or pathways participate in the regulation of these processes. However, little information is available on seed dormancy and germination in peanut. In this study, seeds of the variety Luhua No.14, which undergoes nondeep dormancy, were selected, and their transcriptional changes at three different developmental stages, the freshly harvested seed (FS), the after-ripening seed (DS) and the newly germinated seed (GS) stages, were investigated by comparative transcriptomic analysis. The results showed that genes with increased transcription in the DS vs FS comparison were overrepresented for oxidative phosphorylation, the glycolysis pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, suggesting that after a period of dry storage, the intermediates stored in the dry seeds were rapidly mobilized by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, etc.; the electron transport chain accompanied by respiration was reactivated to provide ATP for the mobilization of other reserves and for seed germination. In the GS vs DS pairwise comparison, dozens of the upregulated genes were related to plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, including the majority of components involved in the auxin signal pathway, brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signal transduction as well as some GA and ABA signal transduction genes. During seed germination, the expression of some EXPANSIN and XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLYCOSYLASE genes was also significantly enhanced. To investigate the effects of different hormones during seed germination, the contents and differential distribution of ABA, GAs, BRs and IAA in the cotyledons, hypocotyls and radicles, and plumules of three seed sections at different developmental stages were also investigated. Combined with previous data in other species, it was suggested that the coordination of multiple hormone signal transduction nets plays a key role in radicle protrusion and seed germination."

Using PCR, we screened the same 300 individual mosquitoes and found just a single positive sample (1/300, 0.33%). Phylogenetic analysis of the hepacivirus NS5B protein places Jogalong virus within the genus Hepacivirus but on a distinct and deeply rooted monophyletic branch shared with duck hepacivirus, suggesting a notably different evolutionary history. Vertebrate barcoding PCR targeting two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b, indicated that the Jogalong virus-positive mosquito had recently fed on the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides), although it is currently unknown whether this bird species contributes to the natural ecology of this virus."

Although multiple mechanisms of apoA-I cross-linking have been demonstrated in vitro, the in vivo mechanisms of cross-linking are not well-established. We have recently demonstrated the highly selective and efficient modification of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apoproteins by endogenous oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs), including γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids. In the current study, we report that γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids effectively cross-link apoproteins in HDL. We further demonstrate that cross-linking impairs the cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I or HDL3 in vitro and in vivo. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we analyzed the pattern of apoprotein cross-linking in isolated human HDL either by synthetic γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids or by oxPLs generated during HDL oxidation in plasma by the physiologically relevant MPO-H2O2-NO2− system. We found that five histidine residues in helices 5–8 of apoA-I are preferably cross-linked by oxPLs, forming stable pyrrole adducts with lysine residues in the helices 3–4 of another apoA-I or in the central domain of apoA-II. We also identified cross-links of apoA-I and apoA-II with two minor HDL apoproteins, apoA-IV and apoE. We detected a similar pattern of apoprotein cross-linking in oxidized murine HDL. We further detected oxPL cross-link adducts of HDL apoproteins in plasma and aorta of hyperlipidemic LDLR−/− mice, including cross-link adducts of apoA-I His-165–apoA-I Lys-93, apoA-I His-154–apoA-I Lys-105, apoA-I His-154–apoA-IV Lys-149, and apoA-II Lys-30–apoE His-227.

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts: Infectious Disease Clinic at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the US Military HIV Natural History Study and Infectious Disease Program of the Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia. Two-stage modeling and joint model (JM) approaches were used to evaluate the association between CD4 (or CD4/CD8 ratio) slope within two years since ART initiation and a composite endpoint (AIDS, serious non-AIDS events and death) after two years of ART. We compared the predictive capacity of four CD4 count metrics (estimated CD4 slope, estimated CD4/CD8 ratio slope during two years following ART initiation and CD4 at 1 and 2 years following ART initiation) using Cox regression models. Results We included 2,422 patients. Mean CD4 slope (±standard error) during two years of ART was 102 ± 2 cells/μl/year (95% confidence interval: 98–106 cells/μl/year), this increase was uniform among the three cohorts (p = 0.80). There were 267 composite events after two years on ART. Using the JM approach, a CD4 slope ≥100 cells/μL/year or CD4/CD8 ratio slope >0.1 higher rate per year were associated with lower composite endpoint rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, p = 0.04 and HR = 0.75 p<0.01, respectively). All four CD4 metrics showed modest predictive capacity. Conclusions Using a complex JM approach, CD4 slope and CD4/CD8 ratio slope the first two years after ART initiation were associated with lower rates of the composite outcome. Moreover, the uniformity observed in the mean CD4 slope regardless of the cohort suggests a common CD4 response pattern independent of age or CD4 nadir. Given the consistency observed with CD4 slope, availability and ease of interpretation, this study provides strong rationale for using CD4 gains <100 cells/μl/year to identify patients at risk for adverse events."

Methods A total of 1078 patients with acute cerebral infarction were enrolled, all patients were divided into carotid plaque group (n = 702) and non-carotid plaque group (n = 376). Meanwhile, all patients were divided into mild group (n = 624) and moderate to severe group (n = 454). The difference of the incidence of carotid plaque between the mild and moderate to severe group was analyzed. Results In the 1078 patients with cerebral infarction, the NIHSS score in the carotid plaque group was significantly higher than that in the non-carotid plaque group (P<0.05). The number of mild cases without carotid artery plaque group was larger than that of plaque group (P<0.05), and the number of moderate to severe cases in carotid plaque group was larger than that in non-plaque group (P<0.05). In patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaque, the risk of moderate to severe cerebral infarction was 2.11 times higher than that without carotid artery plaque. Lastly, patients with single plaques were 1.82 times more likely to develop moderate to severe cerebral infarction than those without carotid plaque, while patients with multiple carotid plaques were 2.41 times higher to get moderate or severe cerebral infarction than those without carotid plaque. Conclusions The incidence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques may be related to neurological deficits in patients with acute cerebral infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2965643513,"The assessment of task-independent functional connectivity (FC) after a lesion causing hemianopia remains an uncovered topic and represents a crucial point to better understand the neural basis of blindsight (i.e. unconscious visually triggered behavior) and visual awareness. In this light, we evaluated functional connectivity (FC) in 10 hemianopic patients and 10 healthy controls in a resting state paradigm. The main aim of this study is twofold: first of all we focused on the description and assessment of density and intensity of functional connectivity and network topology with and without a lesion affecting the visual pathway, and then we extracted and statistically compared network metrics, focusing on functional segregation, integration and specialization. Moreover, a study of 3-cycle triangles with prominent connectivity was conducted to analyze functional segregation calculated as the area of each triangle created connecting three neighboring nodes. To achieve these purposes we applied a graph theory-based approach, starting from Pearson correlation coefficients extracted from pairs of regions of interest. In these analyses we focused on the FC extracted by the whole brain as well as by four resting state networks: The Visual (VN), Salience (SN), Attention (AN) and Default Mode Network (DMN), to assess brain functional reorganization following the injury. The results showed a general decrease in density and intensity of functional connections, that leads to a less compact structure characterized by decrease in functional integration, segregation and in the number of interconnected hubs in both the Visual Network and the whole brain, despite an increase in long-range inter-modules connections (occipito-frontal connections). Indeed, the VN was the most affected network, characterized by a decrease in intra- and inter-network connections and by a less compact topology, with less interconnected nodes. Surprisingly, we observed a higher functional integration in the DMN and in the AN regardless of the lesion extent, that may indicate a functional reorganization of the brain following the injury, trying to compensate for the general reduced connectivity. Finally we observed an increase in functional specialization (lower between-network connectivity) and in inter-networks functional segregation, which is reflected in a less compact network topology, highly organized in functional clusters. These descriptive findings provide new insight on the spontaneous brain activity in hemianopic patients by showing an alteration in the intrinsic architecture of a large-scale brain system that goes beyond the impairment of a single RSN."
https://openalex.org/W2996949085,"The aim of this study was to determine whether there are meaningful subgroups with different types of sexual risk behaviors among youth experiencing homelessness and examine the associations between potential classes and other risk variables. A latent class analysis was used to identify classes of youth according to sexual risk behaviors and sexual assault. A two-class solution was found to be the best fit for the data–Lower and Higher Risk groups. The Higher Risk class had significantly higher levels of synthetic marijuana and alcohol use, mental health diagnoses, and were more likely to have been tested for HIV than the Lower Risk group. Youth were more likely to be in the Higher Risk group if they were cisgender female or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning (LGBQ). Nearly all youth (10/11) who reported having HIV infection were in the Higher Risk group. The Lower Risk group were sexually active but had lower rates of risk behaviors and sexual assault. Youth who were not sexually active had the lowest rates of marijuana and alcohol use as well as HIV testing. Health and social service providers should be aware of the added risks for stress, mental distress, mental health diagnoses, and substance use among youth who also report higher risk sexual behaviors and treat as needed."
https://openalex.org/W2998430411,"We present a link-centric approach to study variation in the mobile phone communication patterns of individuals. Unlike most previous research on call detail records that focused on the variation of phone usage across individual users, we examine how the calling and texting patterns obtained from call detail records vary among pairs of users and how these patterns are affected by the nature of relationships between users. To demonstrate this link-centric perspective, we extract factors that contribute to the variation in the mobile phone communication patterns and predict demographics-related quantities for pairs of users. The time of day and the channel of communication (calls or texts) are found to explain most of the variance among pairs that frequently call each other. Furthermore, we find that this variation can be used to predict the relationship between the pairs of users, as inferred from their age and gender, as well as the age of the younger user in a pair. From the classifier performance across different age and gender groups as well as the inherent class overlap suggested by the estimate of the bounds of the Bayes error, we gain insights into the similarity and differences of communication patterns across different relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2998456481,"The pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens has caused recurrent brown tide blooms along the northeast coast of the United States since the mid-1980’s, and more recently spread to other regions of the globe. These blooms, due to the high cell densities, are associated with severe light attenuation that destroys the sea grass beds which provide the basis for many fisheries. Data collected by transmission electron microscopy, PCR, and metatranscriptomic studies of the blooms, support the hypothesis that large dsDNA viruses play a role in bloom dynamics. While a large (~140 nm) icosahedral virus, with a 371 kbp genome, was first isolated more than a decade ago, the constraints imposed by environmental parameters on bloom infection dynamics by Aureococcus anophagefferens Virus, (AaV) remain unknown. To investigate the role light plays in infection by this virus, we acclimated A. anophagefferens to light intensities of 30 (low), 60 (medium) or 90 μmol photons m-2 s-1 (high) and infected cultures at these irradiance levels. Moreover, we completed light shift experiments where acclimated cultures were exposed to even lower light intensities (0, 5, and 15 μmol photons m-2 s-1) consistent with irradiance found during the peak of the bloom when cell concentrations are highest. The abundance of viruses produced per lytic event (burst size) was lower in the low irradiance acclimated cultures compared to the medium and high acclimated cultures. Transferring infected cultures to more-limiting light availabilities further decreased burst size and increased the length of time it took for cultures to lyse, regardless of acclimation irradiance level. A hypothetical mechanism for the reduced efficiency of the infection cycle in low light due to ribosome biogenesis was predicted from pre-existing transcriptomes. Overall, these studies provide a framework for understanding light effects on infection dynamics over the course of the summer months when A. anophagefferens blooms occur."
https://openalex.org/W2997867177,"The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to clarify the effects of sport expertise and shot results on the action anticipation of basketball players. Eighty-eight male subjects participated in this study, namely, 30 collegiate basketball players, 28 recreational basketball players and 30 non-athletes. Each participant performed a shot anticipation task in which he watched the shooting phase, rising phase, high point and falling phase of a free throw and predicted the fate of the ball. The results showed that the collegiate players and recreational players demonstrated higher accuracy than the non-athletes for the falling phase but not for the other temporal conditions. Analysis of the shot results demonstrated that for made shots, the collegiate players and recreational players provided more accurate predictions than the non-athletes. These results suggested that the experienced players required a sufficient amount of information to be able to make accurate judgements and demonstrated that the experts’ judgement bias for made shots was independent of the temporal condition."
https://openalex.org/W2998181547,"Oxidative stress is a major factor responsible for minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), which occurs most commonly in children. However, the influence of oxidative stress localized to mitochondria remains unclear. We examined the effect of a mitochondrion-targeting antioxidant, MitoTEMPO, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced MCNS to clarify the degree to which mitochondrial oxidative stress affects MCNS.Thirty Wistar rats were divided into three groups: normal saline group (n = 7), PAN group (n = 12), and PAN + MitoTEMPO group (n = 11). Rats in the PAN and PAN + MitoTEMPO groups received PAN on day 1, and those in the PAN + MitoTEMPO group received MitoTEMPO on days 0 to 9. Whole-day urine samples were collected on days 3 and 9, and samples of glomeruli and blood were taken for measurement of lipid peroxidation products. We also estimated the mitochondrial damage score in podocytes in all 3 groups using electron microscopy.Urinary protein excretion on day 9 and the levels of lipid peroxidation products in urine, glomeruli, and blood were significantly lower in the PAN + MitoTEMPO group than in the PAN group (p = 0.0019, p = 0.011, p = 0.039, p = 0.030). The mitochondrial damage score in podocytes was significantly lower in the PAN + MitoTEMPO group than in the PAN group (p <0.0001).This mitochondrion-targeting agent was shown to reduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in a MCNS model. A radical scavenger targeting mitochondria could be a promising drug for treatment of MCNS."
https://openalex.org/W2999977412,"This paper explores the significance of narrative in collaborative reasoning using a qualitative case study of two teams of intelligence analysts who took part in an exercise using an online collaborative platform. Digital ethnographic methods were used to analyze the chat transcripts of analysts as they reasoned with evidence provided in a difficult, fictional intelligence-type problem and produced a final intelligence report. These chat transcripts provided a powerful “microscope” into the reasoning processes and interactions involved in complex, collaborative reasoning. We found that Individuals and teams used narrative to solve the kinds of complex problems organizations and intelligence agencies face daily. We observed that team members generated what we term “micro-narratives”, which provided a means for testing, assessing and weighing alternative hypotheses through mental simulation in the context of collaborative reasoning. The creation of micro-narratives assisted in the teams’ reasoning with evidence, an integral part of collaborative reasoning and intelligence analysis. Micro-narratives were combined into, and compared with, an ideal or ‘virtual’ narrative which informed the judgements the team came to in their final intelligence report. The case study developed in this paper provides evidence that narrative thought processes play an important role in complex collaborative problem-solving, reasoning with evidence and problem-solving. This is contrary to a widespread perception that narrative thinking is fundamentally distinct from formal, logical reasoning."
https://openalex.org/W2996997829,"Many dizzy patients express a hypersensitivity to visual motion and clutter. This study aims to investigate how exposure to rotating visual clutter affects ocular torsion, vertical skewing, body-sway, the autonomic pupillary response, and the subjective feeling of discomfort to the stimulation. Sixteen healthy subjects were exposed to 20 seconds rotational visual stimulation (72 deg/s; 50 deg visual field). Visual stimuli were comprised of black lines on a white background, presented at low and high intensity levels of visual clutter, holding 19 lines and 38 lines respectively. Ocular torsion and vertical skewing were recorded using the Chronos Eye Tracker, which also measured pupil size as a reflection of the autonomic response. Postural control was evaluated by measuring body-sway area on the Wii Balance Board. Values were compared to data retrieved 20 seconds before and after the optokinetic stimulation, as subjects viewed the stationary visual scene. The high intensity stimulus resulted in significantly higher torsional velocities. Subjects who were exposed to low intensity first exhibited higher velocities for both intensities. Both pupil size and body sway increased for the higher intensity to both the moving and stationary visual scene, and were positively correlated to torsional velocity. In conclusion, exposure to visual clutter was reflected in the eye movement response, changes in postural control, and the autonomic response. This response may hold clinical utility when assessing patients suffering from visual motion hypersensitivity, while also providing some context as to why some healthy people feel discomfort in visually cluttered surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2998534989,"The emergence of creatine as a potential cognitive enhancement supplement for humans prompted an investigation as to whether supplemental creatine could enhance spatial memory in young swine. We assessed memory performance and brain concentrations of creatine and its precursor guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) in 14-16-week-old male Yucatan miniature pigs supplemented for 2 weeks with either 200 mg/kg∙d creatine (+Cr; n = 7) or equimolar GAA (157 mg/kg∙d) (+GAA; n = 8) compared to controls (n = 14). Spatial memory tests had pigs explore distinct sets of objects for 5 min. Objects were spatially controlled, and we assessed exploration times of previously viewed objects relative to novel objects in familiar or novel locations. There was no effect of either supplementation on memory performance, but pigs successfully identified novel objects after 10 (p < 0.01) and 20 min (p < 0.01) retention intervals. Moreover, pigs recognized spatial transfers after 65 min (p < 0.05). Regression analyses identified associations between the ability to identify novel objects in memory tests and concentrations of creatine and GAA in cerebellum, and GAA in prefrontal cortex (p < 0.05). The concentration of creatine in brain regions was not influenced by creatine supplementation, but GAA supplementation increased GAA concentration in cerebellum (p < 0.05), and the prefrontal cortex of +GAA pigs had more creatine/g and less GAA/g compared to +Cr pigs (p < 0.05). Creatine kinase activity and maximal reaction velocity were also higher with GAA supplementation in prefrontal cortex (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there appears to be a relationship between memory performance and guanidino compounds in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, but the effects were unrelated to dietary supplementation. The cerebellum is identified as a target site for GAA accretion."
https://openalex.org/W2999158491,"Twelve human THAP proteins share the THAP domain, an evolutionary conserved zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. Studies of different THAP proteins have indicated roles in gene transcription, cell proliferation and development. We have analyzed this protein family, focusing on THAP7 and THAP11. We show that human THAP proteins possess differing homo- and heterodimer formation properties and interaction abilities with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1. HEK-293 cells lacking THAP7 were viable but proliferated more slowly. In contrast, HEK-293 cells were very sensitive to THAP11 alteration. Nevertheless, HEK-293 cells bearing a THAP11 mutation identified in a patient suffering from cobalamin disorder (THAP11F80L) were viable although proliferated more slowly. Cobalamin disorder is an inborn vitamin deficiency characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, most often owing to biallelic mutations in the MMACHC gene, whose gene product MMACHC is a key enzyme in the cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolic pathway. We show that THAP11F80L selectively affected promoter binding by THAP11, having more deleterious effects on a subset of THAP11 targets, and resulting in altered patterns of gene expression. In particular, THAP11F80L exhibited a strong effect on association with the MMACHC promoter and led to a decrease in MMACHC gene transcription, suggesting that the THAP11F80L mutation is directly responsible for the observed cobalamin disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2999425907,"A case-control study was conducted in which we evaluated the association between genetic variability of DNA repair proteins belonging to the Rad51 family and breast cancer (BrC) risk. In the study, 132 female BrC cases and 189 healthy control females were genotyped for a total of 14 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Rad51 and Xrcc3. Moreover, our previously reported Rad51C genetic data were involved to explore the nonlinear interactions among SNPs within the three genes and effect of such interactions on BrC risk. The rare rs5030789 genotype (-4601AA) in Rad51 was found to significantly decrease the BrC risk (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–1.0, p<0.05). An interaction between this SNP, rs2619679 and rs2928140 (both in Rad51), was found to result in a two three-locus genotypes -4719AA/-4601AA/2972CG and -4719AT/-4601GA/2972CC, both of which were found to increase the risk of BrC (OR = 8.4, 95% CI: 1.8–38.6, p<0.0001), instead. Furthermore, rare Rad51 rs1801320 (135CC) and heterozygous Xrcc3 rs3212057 (10343GA) genotypes were found to respectively increase (OR = 10.6, 95% CI: 1.9–198, p<0.02) and decrease (OR = 0.0, 95% CI: 0.0-NA, p<0.05) the risk of BrC. Associations between these SNPs and BrC risk were further supported by outcomes of employed machine learning analyses. In Xrcc3, the 4541A/9685A haplotype was found to be significantly associated with reduced BrC risk (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3–0.9; p<0.05). Concluding, our study indicates a complex role of SNPs within Rad51 (especially rs5030789) and Xrcc3 in BrC, although their significance with respect to the disease needs to be further clarified."

We describe the HCV genotype (G) profiles by geographic region, gender, age and HIV co-infection.We assessed 29,071 genotypes collected from HCV-infected individuals from March 2016 to March 2018 (Abbott Real-Time HCV Genotype). We randomly selected 12,336 samples for HIV co-infection testing using an EIA rapid test kit (TR DPP HIV 1/2 Bio-Manguinhos). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using R.Overall, HCV genotype distribution was 40.9% G1A, 30.2% G1B, 23.8% G3, 3.8% G2, 0.7% G4, 0.1% G5 and 0.6% with multiples genotypes. G1A prevalence was 44.4% among males and 35.8% among females. G1B and G2 were more prevalent in older individuals than G1A and G3. G3 was more prevalent in the South region. Of samples tested for HIV co-infection, 15% were HIV+. Median age among HCV/HIV co-infected individuals was 50 years old compared to 57 years old among mono-infected individuals. Distinct HCV genotype prevalence between HCV/HIV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals were respectively: G1A 60.6% versus 37.8%, G1B 15.2% versus 32.9%, and G3 18.9% versus 24.7%. G4 was detected among co-infected young men (3.5% versus 0.2% among mono-infected).The increasing prevalence of G3, as inferred by the younger ages of the HCV-infected individuals, poses an extra challenge with regards to disease progression. Distinct genotypical profiles between HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV co-infection warrant future research in order to better understand and help mitigate HCV chains of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2996758774,"When immobile or neuropathic patients are supported by beds or chairs, their soft tissues undergo deformations that can cause pressure ulcers. Current support surfaces that redistribute under-body pressures at vulnerable body sites have not succeeded in reducing pressure ulcer prevalence. Here we show that adding a supporting lateral pressure can counter-act the deformations induced by under-body pressure, and that this ‘pressure equalisation’ approach is a more effective way to reduce ulcer-inducing deformations than current approaches based on redistributing under-body pressure. A finite element model of the seated pelvis predicts that applying a lateral pressure to the soft tissue reduces peak von Mises stress in the deep tissue by a factor of 2.4 relative to a standard cushion (from 113 kPa to 47 kPa)—a greater effect than that achieved by using a more conformable cushion, which reduced von Mises stress to 75 kPa. Combining both a conformable cushion and lateral pressure reduced peak von Mises stresses to 25 kPa. The ratio of peak lateral pressure to peak under-body pressure was shown to regulate deep tissue stress better than under-body pressure alone. By optimising the magnitude and position of lateral pressure, tissue deformations can be reduced to that induced when suspended in a fluid. Our results explain the lack of efficacy in current support surfaces and suggest a new approach to designing and evaluating support surfaces: ensuring sufficient lateral pressure is applied to counter-act under-body pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2996845246,"To date, there is insufficient insight into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated stress, recognized disability, and contact with the social care system. We aimed to assess these parameters in IBD patients and a non-IBD control group, who were invited to participate in an online survey developed specifically for this study (www.soscisurvey.de) with the help of IBD patients. 505 IBD patients and 166 volunteers (i.e., control group) participated in the survey. IBD patients reported significantly increased levels of stress within the last six months and five years (p<0.0001) and were more likely to have a recognized disability (p<0.0001). A low academic status was the strongest indicator of a disability (p = 0.006). Only 153 IBD patients (30.3%) reported contact with the social care system, and a disability was the strongest indicator for this (p<0.0001). Our study provides data on stress and disability in a large unselected German IBD cohort. We showed that patients with IBD suffer more often from emotional stress and more often have a recognized disability. As only about 1/3 of the patients had come into contact with the social care system and the corresponding support, this patient group is undersupplied in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2996976931,"Radiotherapy (RT) is commonly applied for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Following the planning target volume (PTV) definition procedure standardized in guidelines, a 20% risk of missing non-local recurrences is present. Purpose of this study was to evaluate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber tracking may be beneficial for PTV definition taking into account the prediction of distant recurrences. 56 GBM patients were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DTI performed before RT after resection of the primary tumor. Follow-up MRIs were acquired in three month intervals. For the seven patients with a distant recurrence, fiber tracking was performed with three algorithms and it was evaluated whether connections existed from the primary tumor region to the distant recurrence. It depended strongly on the used tracking algorithm and the used tracking parameters whether a connection was observed. Most of the connections were weak and thus not usable for PTV definition. Only in one of the seven patients with a recurring tumor, a clear connection was present. It seems unlikely that DTI-based fiber tracking can be beneficial for predicting distant recurrences in the planning of PTVs for glioblastoma multiforme."
https://openalex.org/W2998852505,"Objective There exist conflicting data regarding the accuracy of ICU nurses accurately assessing patient sleep using validated questionnaires. Using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RSQ), we hypothesize that patient factors might influence nursing perception of their sleep. Methods Patients in the ICU who met the inclusion criteria were asked to complete the sleep questionnaire, as were their nurses and intraclass correlation analysis was done. Results 38 paired patient-nurse surveys were included for analysis. The mean difference in total average score of the RSQ was not significantly different between patients and nurses. There was fair intraclass correlation by patient age, black race, and admission for respiratory illnesses. A good intraclass correlation existed for non-blacks and admission for non-respiratory reasons. Most striking was the intraclass correlation by sex, with poor intraclass correlation for women compared to an excellent correlation for men. Conclusion The results of our study confirm that patients in our ICU have poor sleep with a fair intraclass correlation. When examined by patient related factor, the greatest divergence between patient and nursing perception of sleep in the ICU using the RCSQ was patient female sex. More research is needed in this area to better understand the divergence and improve sleep in the ICU."
https://openalex.org/W2998925174,"A key feature of the brain’s ability to tell time and generate complex temporal patterns is its capacity to produce similar temporal patterns at different speeds. For example, humans can tie a shoe, type, or play an instrument at different speeds or tempi—a phenomenon referred to as temporal scaling. While it is well established that training improves timing precision and accuracy, it is not known whether expertise improves temporal scaling, and if so, whether it generalizes across skill domains. We quantified temporal scaling and timing precision in musicians and non-musicians as they learned to tap a Morse code sequence. We found that non-musicians improved significantly over the course of days of training at the standard speed. In contrast, musicians exhibited a high level of temporal precision on the first day, which did not improve significantly with training. Although there was no significant difference in performance at the end of training at the standard speed, musicians were significantly better at temporal scaling—i.e., at reproducing the learned Morse code pattern at faster and slower speeds. Interestingly, both musicians and non-musicians exhibited a Weber-speed effect, where temporal precision at the same absolute time was higher when producing patterns at the faster speed. These results are the first to establish that the ability to generate the same motor patterns at different speeds improves with extensive training and generalizes to non-musical domains."

In Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), IPs are constantly implemented to maintain excellence in academic and administrative processes. In this study, we propose a model for IP implementation that is based on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program (BPEP). As a part of the model, we propose a series of research hypotheses to be tested. The data used to test the hypotheses were gathered from a questionnaire that was developed after an extensive literature review. The survey was administered to Mexican public HEIs, and more than 700 responses were collected. The data were assessed in terms of convergent and discriminant validity, obtaining satisfactory results. To test the proposed relationships between the model constructs, we utilized Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using the software IBM SPSS Amos. The analysis confirmed the statistical validity of both the model and the hypotheses. In conclusion, our model for IP implementation is a useful tool for HEIs that seek to attain excellence in their processes through IPs."
https://openalex.org/W2998472634,"Objectives Prospective registration of animal studies has been suggested as a new measure to increase value and reduce waste in biomedical research. We sought to further explore and quantify animal researchers’ attitudes and preferences regarding animal study registries (ASRs). Design Cross-sectional online survey. Setting and participants We conducted a survey with three different samples representing animal researchers: i) corresponding authors from journals with high Eigenfactor, ii) a random Pubmed sample and iii) members of the CAMARADES network. Main outcome measures Perceived level of importance of different aspects of publication bias, the effect of ASRs on different aspects of research as well as the importance of different research types for being registered. Results The survey yielded responses from 413 animal researchers (response rate 7%). The respondents indicated, that some aspects of ASRs can increase administrative burden but could be outweighed by other aspects decreasing this burden. Animal researchers found it more important to register studies that involved animal species with higher levels of cognitive capabilities. The time frame for making registry entries publicly available revealed a strong heterogeneity among respondents, with the largest proportion voting for “access only after consent by the principal investigator” and the second largest proportion voting for “access immediately after registration”. Conclusions The fact that the more senior and experienced animal researchers participating in this survey clearly indicated the practical importance of publication bias and the importance of ASRs underscores the problem awareness across animal researchers and the willingness to actively engage in study registration if effective safeguards for the potential weaknesses of ASRs are put into place. To overcome the first-mover dilemma international consensus statements on how to deal with prospective registration of animal studies might be necessary for all relevant stakeholder groups including animal researchers, academic institutions, private companies, funders, regulatory agencies, and journals."

The factors associated with multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae carriage in the gestational period are not well documented. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors associated with 3GCR-EB isolation in gestational urine cultures. The study was designed as retrospective cohort based on centralized electronic health records database. Women delivered in Clalit Health Services hospitals in Israel in 2009-2013 and provided urine culture(s) during pregnancy were included. Multivariable analysis using the Generalized Estimating Equations model was used to assess risk factors for 3GCR-EB isolation in gestational urine cultures. The study included 15,282 pregnant women with urine cultures yielding Enterobacteriaceae (EB). The proportion of 3GCR-EB in EB isolates was 3.9% (n = 603). The following risk factors were associated with 3GCR-EB isolation: multiple hospital admissions during the year before delivery (OR,1.47;95% CI,1.21-1.79), assisted fertilization procedure (OR,1.53; 95% CI,1.12-2.10), Arab ethnicity (OR,1.22; 95% CI,1.03-1.45), multiple antibiotic courses (OR,1.76; 95% CI,1.29-2.40), specifically, cephalosporins (OR,1.56; 95% CI,1.26-1.95), fluoroquinolones (OR,1.34; 95% CI,1.04-1.74), or nitrofurantoin (OR,1.29; 95% CI,1.02-1.64). The risk factors identified by this study for 3GCR-EB in gestation, can be easily generalized for pregnant women in the Israeli population. Moreover, these risk factors, other than ethnicity, are applicable to pregnant women worldwide. The information of previous antibiotic treatments, hospitalization in the last year and assisted fertilization procedure can be easily accessed and used for appropriate infection control practices and antimicrobial therapy."

Heparin has proven effective in central venous catheters, although its use in PVCs remains controversial. Our hypothesis was that saline locks are as effective as heparin locks in preventing problems with PVCs. The objective of the present study was to compare phlebitis and catheter tip colonization rates between PVCs locked with saline and those locked with heparin in patients admitted to an internal medicine department (IMD).We performed a 19-month prospective, controlled, open-label, randomized clinical study of patients with at least 1 PVC admitted to the IMD of our hospital. The patients were randomized to receive saline solution (PosiFlush®, group A) or heparin (Fibrilin®, group B) for daily maintenance of the PVC. Clinical and microbiological data were monitored to investigate the frequency of phlebitis, catheter tip colonization, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (C-RBSI), as well as crude mortality, days of hospital stay, and days of antimicrobial treatment.We assessed 339 PVCs (241 patients), of which 192 (56.6%) were locked with saline (group A) and 147 (43.4%) with heparin (group B). The main demographic characteristics of the patients were distributed equally between the 2 study groups. The median (IQR) catheter days was 5 (3-8) for both groups (p = 0.64). The frequency of phlebitis was 17.7% for group A and 13.3% for group B (p = 0.30). The frequency of colonization of PVC tips was 14.6% and 12.2% in groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.63). Only 2 episodes of C-RBSI were detected (1 patient in group A). Saline lock was not an independent factor for phlebitis or catheter colonization.Our study revealed no statistically significant differences in the frequency of phlebitis and catheter tip colonization between PVCs locked with saline and PVCs locked with heparin. We suggest that PVC can be maintained with saline solution, as it is safer and cheaper than heparin."

However, little is known at the metabolic level about amino acid turnover and the specific alterations of demand caused by high intensity exercise. During exercise, certain amino acids are required in greater quantities due to disproportionate losses via excretory systems and usage in biosynthetic pathways. This investigation has built a theoretical computer model in an attempt to bring together the published rates of protein intake and utilisation to try to understand how some amino acids might be in higher demand than others. The model indicated that after evaluation of the daily amino acid turnover, glutamine/glutamic acid (Glx), serine and ornithine were in negative nitrogen balance which identified these amino acids as critical limiting factors for anabolism. Adjustment of the modelling conditions to cater for high intensity training indicated that an additional demand was placed on eight amino acids, including GLx, valine, lysine, histidine and phenylalanine which could thus become limiting under these conditions. The modelling results indicated that an amino acid supplement with the correct amino acids to match demand could theoretically be beneficial to a 500Kg horse in quantities of 20-80g/day. These results open new avenues of research for specifically tailoring amino acid supplementation to meet demands for sports horses in heavy training and improving general well-being, especially in hotter climates."
https://openalex.org/W2997746739,"Non-windfall approaches to sharing demonstrate pre-schoolers' sensitivity to merit-based distributions of resources. However, such studies have not considered (1) whether epistemic aspects of task performance, such as the relative accuracy of a co-worker, influences pre-schoolers' rates of sharing; and (2) how children's emerging social understanding may impact resource allocations in high- and low-merit situations. These issues are of theoretical importance as they may provide new information about the scope of pre-schooler's merit-based sharing behaviours. Moreover, as social understanding has been related to both increases and decreases in pre-schoolers' levels of sharing, providing a merit-based assessment of this relationship would allow for a concurrent assessment of recent conflicting findings. In this study, three- and four-year-olds (N = 131) participated in an unexpected transfer task which was followed by a resource generation picture card naming task with a reliable or unreliable (high- or low-merit) co-worker (a hand puppet). The results showed that children engage in more generous rates of sharing with a high-merit co-worker. This suggests that merit-based sharing is apparent in young children and extends to epistemic aspects of task performance. However, such sharing was constrained by a self-serving bias. Finally, we were not able to detect an effect of children's performance on the false belief task on sharing behaviours in the high- or low-merit trials, suggesting that these behaviours may not be modulated by social understanding during early childhood."

Given the role of ICT in changing society, this research explores the responses and attitudes to change over time from ICT professionals and ICT academics in dealing with the potentially far reaching political challenge triggered by the UK’s 2016 European Union Referendum and its decision to leave the European Union (Brexit). Whilst the vote was a UK based decision its ramifications have global implications and as such the research was not confined to the UK. This article presents the second phase of the research at the mid-point in the UK/European Union (EU) Brexit process, thus complementing the findings gathered immediately after the Referendum decision. The fundamental question being researched was: What are ICT professionals’ personal and professional perspectives on the change triggered by Brexit in terms of opportunities and threats? Methods and findings Data was collected through a survey launched in March 2018, one year on from the UK’s triggering of Article 50 and marking the mid-point in the two-year Brexit process. The survey replicated the one delivered at the point of the Referendum decision in 2016 with some developments. In addition, two appreciative inquiry focus groups were conducted. The research sought to understand any shifting perspectives on the opportunities and threats that would exist post-Brexit for ICT professionals and academics. 59% of survey participants were negative regarding the Brexit decision. Participants noted the position post-Brexit for the UK, and the remaining 27 EU Member States (EU27), was still very uncertain at this stage. They observed that planned change versus uncertainty provides for very different responses. In spite of the uncertainty, the participants were able to consider and advocate for potential opportunities although these were framed from national perspectives. The opportunities identified within the appreciative inquiry focus groups aligned to those recorded by survey participants with similar themes highlighted. However, the optimum conditions for change have yet to be reached as there is still not an informed position, message and clear leadership with detailed information for the ICT context. Further data will be gathered after the UK exit from the EU, assuming this occurs."
