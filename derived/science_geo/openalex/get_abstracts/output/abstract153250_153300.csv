https://openalex.org/W2028151158,"p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is activated and involved in cleavage of caspase-3 during apoptosis induced by a number of stimuli. However, the signaling events triggered by p38 that result in caspase-3 activation are still unknown. In human leukemia cells, two reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), selectively stimulated the phosphorylation of p38. Preincubation of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, dose dependently inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by singlet oxygen but not by H2O2. Protection from apoptosis by SB203580 correlated with inhibition of caspase-3, and several events that are associated with caspase-3 activation, including Bid cleavage, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas caspase-8 cleavage was not affected by this inhibitor. In contrast, blockade of caspase-8 with Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone is sufficient to prevent formation of DNA fragments and to inhibit all the above signaling events, with exception of p38 phosphorylation, in both singlet oxygen- and H2O2-treated cells. These data suggest that caspase-3 activation is regulated through redundant signaling pathways that involve p38 and caspase-8 acting upstream of Bid during singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis, whereas the activation of caspase-3 by H2O2 is only governed by a caspase-8-mediated apoptotic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2149678875,"New strategies are required to identify the most important targets of protective immunity in complex eukaryotic pathogens. Natural selection maintains allelic variation in some antigens of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Analysis of allele frequency distributions could identify the loci under most intense selection. The merozoite surface protein 1 (Msp1) is the most-abundant surface component on the erythrocyte-invading stage of P. falciparum. Immunization with whole Msp1 has protected monkeys completely against homologous and partially against non-homologous parasite strains. The single-copy msp1 gene, of about 5 kilobases, has highly divergent alleles with stable frequencies in endemic populations. To identify the region of msp1 under strongest selection to maintain alleles within populations, we studied multiple intragenic sequence loci in populations in different regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. On both continents, the locus with the lowest inter-population variance in allele frequencies was block 2, indicating selection in this part of the gene. To test the hypothesis of immune selection, we undertook a large prospective longitudinal cohort study. This demonstrated that serum IgG antibodies against each of the two most frequent allelic types of block 2 of the protein were strongly associated with protection from P. falciparum malaria."

Recently, fragments of collagen molecules have been identified to possess anti-angiogenic activity. Tumstatin (α3(IV)NC1 domain) is one such novel molecule with distinct anti-tumor properties and possesses an N-terminal (amino acids 54–132) anti-angiogenic and a C-terminal (amino acids 185–203) anti-tumor cell activity (Maeshima, Y., et al.2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 21340–21348). Previous studies have identified the 185–203 amino acid sequence as a ligand for αvβ3integrin (Shahan, T. A., et al.(1999) Cancer Res. 59, 4584–4590). In the present study, we found distinct additional RGD-independent αvβ3 integrin binding site within 54–132 amino acids of tumstatin. This site is not essential for inhibition of tumor cell proliferation but necessary for the anti-angiogenic activity. A fragment of tumstatin containing 54–132 amino acid (tum-2) binds both endothelial cells and melanoma cells but only inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells, with no effect on tumor cell proliferation. A similar experiment with fragment of tumstatin containing the 185–203 amino acid (tum-4) demonstrates that it binds both endothelial cells and melanoma cells but only inhibits the proliferation of melanoma cells. The presence of cyclic RGD peptides did not affect the αvβ3integrin-mediated activity of tumstatin, although significant inhibition of endothelial cell binding to vitronectin was observed. The two distinct RGD-independent binding sites on tumstatin suggest unique αvβ3 integrin-mediated mechanisms governing the two distinct anti-tumor properties of tumstatin."

https://openalex.org/W2162248539,"The Bcl-2 family protein BAD promotes apoptosis by binding through its BH3 domain to Bcl-xL and related cell death suppressors. When BAD is phosphorylated on either Ser112 or Ser136, it forms a complex with 14-3-3 in the cytosol and no longer interacts with Bcl-xLat the mitochondria. Here we show that phosphorylation of a distinct site Ser155, which is at the center of the BAD BH3 domain, directly suppressed the pro-apoptotic function of BAD by eliminating its affinity for Bcl-xL. Protein kinase A functioned as a BAD Ser155 kinase both in vitro and in cells. BAD Ser155 was found to be a major site of phosphorylation induced following stimulation by growth factors and prevented by protein kinase A inhibitors but not by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Growth factors inhibited BAD-induced apoptosis in both a Ser112/Ser136- and a Ser155-dependent fashion. Thus, growth factors engage an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that inactivates BAD by direct modification of its BH3 cell death effector domain."
https://openalex.org/W2131799247,"We have been studying protein components that function in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway and the overlapping process of macroautophagy. The Vac8 and Apg13 proteins are required for the import of aminopeptidase I (API) through the Cvt pathway. We have identified a protein-protein interaction between Vac8p and Apg13p by both two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Subcellular fractionation of API indicates that Vac8p and Apg13p are involved in the vesicle formation step of the Cvt pathway. Kinetic analysis of the Cvt pathway and autophagy indicates that, although Vac8p is essential for Cvt transport, it is less important for autophagy. In vivo phosphorylation experiments demonstrate that both Vac8p and Apg13p are phosphorylated proteins, and Apg13p phosphorylation is regulated by changing nutrient conditions. Although Apg13p interacts with the serine/threonine kinase Apg1p, this protein is not required for phosphorylation of either Vac8p or Apg13p. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that Apg13p and a fraction of Apg1p are membrane-associated. Vac8p and Apg13p may be part of a larger protein complex that includes Apg1p and additional interacting proteins. Together, these components may form a protein complex that regulates the conversion between Cvt transport and autophagy in response to changing nutrient conditions.

In order to compartmentalize these reactions, substrates as well as degradative enzymes must be faithfully delivered to this organelle. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins are known to be delivered to the vacuole for degradation by several different pathways (1Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For example, cell surface proteins are transported by endocytosis; the cytosolic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is targeted to the vacuole by the vacuolar import and degradation pathway when changing nutrient conditions necessitate down-regulation; and during periods of starvation, bulk cytosol is packaged into vesicles and delivered to the vacuole by macroautophagy. Vacuole resident proteins are delivered by four characterized pathways. In the carboxypeptidase Y pathway, proteins travel through the secretory pathway and are diverted from the late Golgi to the vacuole via an endosomal intermediate or prevacuolar compartment (PVC).1 The multivesicular body sorting pathway also utilizes the PVC, but in this case proteins enter vesicles resulting from invagination of the organelle's limiting membrane. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) pathway utilizes the early secretory compartments, but the proteins are transported from the late Golgi to the vacuole without passing through the PVC. In the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, cargo is packaged into cytosolic vesicles that are delivered to the vacuole. Under vegetative conditions the yeast vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I (API) is targeted to the vacuole by the Cvt pathway. API is synthesized as a precursor in the cytosol where it rapidly oligomerizes into dodecamers (2Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Multiple API dodecamers then assemble into a membrane-bound complex called a Cvt complex (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Double membrane structures surround the Cvt complex resulting in the formation of Cvt vesicles. The outer membrane of these vesicles fuses with the vacuole resulting in the release of a still intact vesicle, called a Cvt body, into the vacuole lumen. These structures are broken down by resident hydrolases, and the released precursor API (prAPI) is processed to its mature size. Yeast mutants have been isolated that are defective in the Cvt pathway (4Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Analysis of these mutants revealed that many are allelic to mutants in macroautophagy (apg and aut; Refs.5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 6Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A.

This was a surprising finding because the transport of prAPI is selective and constitutive, while delivery of soluble cytosolic proteins to the vacuole by macroautophagy is nonselective and is induced by stress conditions such as starvation (5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that under certain conditions macroautophagy may be a selective process. For example, peroxisomes can be selectively degraded by a macroautophagic process in response to changing nutrient conditions (reviewed in Ref. 9Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Biochemical and morphological studies confirm that the basic properties of targeting by the Cvt pathway are similar to those of macroautophagy (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both pathways involve formation of double membrane vesicles that engulf cytosolic cargo and deliver it to the vacuole by fusion of the outer membrane with the vacuole surface. When cells are growing in rich media, the primary mode of prAPI delivery is via Cvt vesicles (3Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These vesicles are approximately 150 nm in diameter, relatively rare, and contain concentrated cargo that appears different than bulk cytosol. In contrast, in starvation conditions, the majority of prAPI appears to be targeted to the vacuole by autophagosomes. Compared with Cvt vesicles, autophagosomes are larger (approximately 300–900 nm), more abundant, and appear to contain bulk cytosolic components in addition to Cvt complexes. The mechanisms by which environmental changes are transduced to signal alterations in vesicle morphology and selectivity are not known. Recent cloning of the genes that complement mutants defective in the autophagy and Cvt pathways indicates that the majority of the molecular components involved in these pathways are shared (reviewed in Ref. 9Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, several mutants have been identified that appear to be defective primarily in one or the other of these pathways. These include aut4 (6Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J.

J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The vac8 mutant was identified through a screen for strains defective in vacuole inheritance (13Wang Y.X. Zhao H. Harding T.M. Gomes de Mesquita D.S. Woldringh C.L. Klionsky D.J. Munn A.L. Weisman L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in the migration of vacuoles from the mother to the bud during cell division, Vac8p is required for Cvt transport. Analysis of vac8mutants by a vesicle test that monitors the accumulation of subvacuolar vesicles under starvation conditions, however, provided preliminary evidence that this protein is not necessary for autophagy (12Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The majority of Vac8p consists of 11 armadillo repeats. These domains are contained within the Drosophila armadillo protein and the mammalian homologues β-catenin and plakoglobin. The armadillo domains in β-catenin and plakoglobin serve to link regions of the plasma membrane to actin, and Vac8p co-sediments with actin filaments in vitro (12Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Localization experiments indicate that Vac8p is found primarily on the vacuole membrane (12Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Fleckenstein D. Rohde M. Klionsky D.J. Rüdiger M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3109-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pan X. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Vac8p is both myristoylated and palmitoylated, and mutational analysis indicates that acylation is required both for vacuole localization of Vac8p and for vacuole inheritance. Interestingly, vac8 mutants defective in acylation are not defective in Cvt transport, suggesting that different cellular pools of Vac8p are utilized for inheritance and Cvt transport (12Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with Vac8p, we have performed a two-hybrid screen using this protein as bait. We identified Apg13p as a Vac8p-interacting protein. Apg13p is predicted to be an 83-kDa protein, with no significant homology to other known proteins (16Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Overexpression of APG1 suppresses the autophagy defect in the apg13–1 mutant, suggesting that these two proteins also interact (16Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mutants in APG13 are defective in both the Cvt and autophagy pathways (5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We propose that these proteins are part of a large protein complex that functions in the vesicle formation step that is required for sequestration of cargo during import from the cytoplasm to the vacuole.

The resulting strain PJ69-4A + pYW31 was transformed with the two-hybrid yeast library pool Y2HL-C1 (21James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 280,000 transformants were screened. The transformants were plated onto SC-His-Leu-Trp + 3 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and incubated at 24 °C for 14 days. These plates were replica plated onto SC-Ade-Leu-Trp and incubated at 24 °C for 5 days. Colonies were picked and tested for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmids were isolated from the yeast strain and retransformed into PJ69-4A + pYW31. Plasmids that showed positive responses after retransformation were sequenced and identified by comparison with the Saccharomyces Genome Data base. Two identical clones of APG13 that coded for amino acids 567–738 were isolated. Plasmid pTrcHisBAPG13 was digested with PstI and HindIII. The 2.2-kb APG13 fragment was cloned intoPstI-HindIII-cut pBlueScript SK to create pJN21. The following plasmids were generated by digesting pJN21 with the indicated enzymes, isolating DNA of the size noted, and ligating into pGAD-C (1Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Curr. Opin.

Control plasmids for the two-hybrid analysis were pSE1111 containingSNF4 fused to the GAL4 activation domain in pACT and pSE1112 containing SNF1 fused to the GAL4binding domain in pAS1 (22Bai C. Elledge S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown to anA 600 = 0.8–1, and converted to spheroplasts as described (23Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). vac8Δ cells were grown in SMD, andapg13Δ cells were grown in YPD. Spheroplasts were washed in PS1000 (20 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 msorbitol), and subjected to osmotic lysis (23Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by pipetting up and down 10 times in PS200 with MgCl2 (20 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2) at a cell concentration of 20 A 600/ml. The supernatant and pellet fractions were collected after centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. A flotation analysis was carried out as described previously (23Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The pellet fraction was resuspended in 100 μl of 15% Ficoll, and then overlaid with 1 ml of 13% Ficoll and 300 μl of 2% Ficoll. The resulting step gradients were subjected to centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 × gfor 10 min. The float fraction was collected from the 2% Ficoll/13% Ficoll interface. Proteinase K treatment was with 50 μg of proteinase K for 15 min on ice with a concentration of osmotically lysed spheroplasts equivalent to 20 A 600/ml. All fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblotting as described (4Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Fractionation of Apg13p and Apg1p was as above except that the isolated spheroplasts were washed with PS1000 with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture before lysis and then lysed in PS200 with 5 mm MgCl2 and protease inhibitors. The pellet fraction was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. Pulse labeling experiments were as described (5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in SMD medium to anA 600 = 0.8–1, pelleted, and then pulse-labeled at 30 °C in fresh SMD with 11 μCi/A 600Expre35S35S label. Chase reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μm cysteine and 20 μm methionine. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended at a concentration of 1 A 600/ml in either SMD or SD-N for the duration of the chase reaction. API was immunoprecipitated as described (24Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Indicated yeast strains were grown in YPD to an A 600 = 1, harvested, washed, incubated in SD-N for 4 h, and fixed with 1.5% KMnO4 as described (25Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.5–1 in NPM. 4A 600 units of cells were harvested and labeled for 30 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of fresh NPM with 25 μCi of [33P]orthophosphate. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (24Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), except that single precipitation reactions were performed. BJ2168 cells harboring pYW10 and YEp351(APG13) were grown in 100 ml of YPD, collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and resuspended in 50 ml of Z buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 m sorbitol, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% glucose) containing 0.5 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T. The suspension was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking to generate spheroplasts. The resultant spheroplasts were washed once with Z buffer, resuspended in 50 ml of Z buffer, and divided into two 25-ml aliquots. Rapamycin (0.4 μg/ml, prepared in 90% ethanol, 10% Triton X-100) was added to one aliquot, and the spheroplasts were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking. The spheroplasts were collected and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m sorbitol, and lysed by suspending in 1 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm KF, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Tween 20). The cell lysate was further incubated on ice for 5 min, and spun down at 6,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The resultant supernatant was collected and incubated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% suspension) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The cell lysate was spun down, and the supernatant (two 500-μl aliquots) was incubated with or without 2 μl of anti-Vac8p serum for 1.5 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% suspension) was added to the lysate/antiserum mixture, followed by further incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer, and the resulting immunocomplex was subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Apg13p antibody (1:5,000 dilution) or anti-Vac8p antibody (1:5,000 dilution). For secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antibody (1:10,000) was used. Immunodetection was carried out with the ECL system. The vac8 mutant was identified in a screen for strains defective in vacuolar inheritance (13Wang Y.X. Zhao H. Harding T.M. Gomes de Mesquita D.S. Woldringh C.L. Klionsky D.J. Munn A.L. Weisman L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Vac8p is unusual among those proteins involved in organelle segregation in that it was also found to be required for the import of the resident vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I through the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway. To gain further information on the role of Vac8p in the Cvt pathway, a two-hybrid screen was used to identify proteins that interact with Vac8p. The VAC8 gene was cloned into a two-hybrid vector containing a DNA-binding domain. A his3 ade2 strain was transformed with the resulting pBD-VAC8 plasmid and a plasmid library that had been cloned into the transcriptional activating domain vector. Transformants were screened for growth on His-free plates, and then growth on Ade-free plates and finally for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids were recovered from cells that were positive by all three criteria and were subjected to DNA sequencing. One of the genes that was identified from the screen was found to contain part of the open reading frame corresponding toAPG13 (Fig. 1 A). The APG13 gene was identified as being required for macroautophagy (16Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to be needed for import of prAPI (5Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

To determine the domain of Apg13p that interacts with Vac8p, a series of deletions was constructed in the APG13 gene that was used as the prey plasmid for the two-hybrid intera"

NifS/IscS has been shown to catalyze the formation of elemental sulfur from cysteine to provide the inorganic sulfur necessary for in vivo formation of the iron-sulfur cluster (4Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under certain experimental conditions NifS alone has been reported to catalyze the formation of the iron-sulfur cluster in vitro (5Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this reaction required a significantly higher concentration of ferrous ion. Moreover, because NifS was found to catalyze cysteine cleavage both in the absence and the presence of acceptor apoprotein, the participation of additional factor(s) in in vivo iron-sulfur cluster formation has been proposed. In contrast, the precise role of NifU/IscU during iron-sulfur cluster formation remains unknown. Recently, several reports concerning the possible involvement of yeast NifU/IscU homologs in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly and iron metabolism have been published (13Schilke B.

Originally identified Azotobacter vinelandii NifU encoded in the nif gene cluster, which has been known to be involved in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase, is 242 amino acids long and has been proposed to consist of three distinct domains (17Ouzounis C. Bork P. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 199-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain, which shows high sequence identity to the bacterial IscU proteins (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and also to the yeast Isu proteins (10Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T.

Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), contains three evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues. The middle domain of Azotobacter NifU shows significant sequence similarity to internal domains of nitrate reductases and nitrite reductases (17Ouzounis C. Bork P. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 199-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain contains the conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif. Although bacterialisc (iron-sulfur cluster formation) operons encode IscU proteins that correspond only to the amino-terminal domain of Azotobacter NifU, some bacteria and some eukaryotes seem to possess other NifU-related proteins, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of A. vinelandii NifU, in addition to or instead of, such IscU proteins (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship among those NifU-related proteins of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is fairly complex. Interestingly, A. vinelandii NifU was shown to be a homodimer containing two permanent [2Fe-2S] clusters, and the [2Fe-2S] cluster-coordinating ligands were provided by four cysteine residues of the middle domain (18Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13455-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, Dean and co-workers (19Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) reported recently that the three conserved cysteines in the amino-terminal domain comprised a transient [2Fe-2S] cluster binding. To elucidate a role of NifU-like protein on iron-sulfur cluster assembly in detail, we chose a NifU homolog of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC6803 for biochemical characterization, since the entire genome of this organism was determined and was found to contain only one nifU-like gene (ssl2667) (20Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterial NifU homolog shares high sequence homology with the carboxyl-terminal domain of A. vinelandii NifU. In the present study, the NifU homolog of Synechocystis PCC6803 has been shown to possess the ability to transfer its [2Fe-2S] cluster to an apoferredoxin without the aid of other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous factor(s). From these observations, we propose that NifU functions as an intermediate site for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly and delivery. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and a vector pET-21d (Novagen, Inc., Madison) were used for the overexpression of SyNifU and SyNifU-h6. SyNifU-h6 contained an additional Leu-Glu sequence plus hexahistidine at the carboxyl terminus of SyNifU. The expression of SyNifU and SyNifU-h6 was induced by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to exponentially growing cells in LB medium at 23 °C. Cells were harvested after overnight induction and broken by sonication in the buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. After removal of the membrane pellets and any insoluble materials by centrifugation, the soluble supernatants were used for further purification. SyNifU-h6 was purified by successive column chromatography with a TALON affinity column (CLONTECH), a hydroxyapatite column, and an anion-exchange Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). By contrast, SyNifU in the supernatant was first precipitated with 10–30% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitates were then solubilized and separated by butyl-Toyopearl hydrophobic column chromatography. The elute was then desalted through a Sephadex G-50 column, and the resulting protein fraction was further purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography followed by anion-exchange Resource Q column chromatography. Finally, the buffers of purified protein fractions were exchanged with 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0) and 25 mm NaCl by Fast-desalting column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apo-form of SyNifU-h6 was purified by the same procedure as described above from overexpressor cells grown at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. A cyanobacterial Fdx (slr0148 gene product of SynechocystisPCC6803) and a yeast mitochondrial adrenodoxin homolog (mtAd) were also purified to homogeneity from corresponding overexpressor E. coli cells. Both purified proteins showed typical UV/visible absorption spectra characteristic for [2Fe-2S]-containing proteins (data not shown). Apoferredoxin was prepared by boiling purified holoferredoxin in the presence of 100 mmEDTA and 500 mm dithiothreitol to trap iron atoms liberated from the holoproteins and ensure that the side chains of the four cysteines previously participating in [2Fe-2S] cluster ligation were reduced to free sulfhydryl groups. After boiling, apoferredoxin was purified by gel filtration column chromatography using a Fast-desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0) and 25 mm NaCl. Typically, apoferredoxin (40 μg) was incubated with either the purified SyNifU (200 μg) or SyNifU-h6 (80 μg) for 1 h at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0) and 25 mmKCl. Because of the higher content of the apo-form in purified SyNifU than in SyNifU-h6, the former was used in 2.5-fold excess of the latter. Samples were separated by 20% nondenaturing PAGE1 as described previously (21Nishio K. Nakai M. Hase T. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1999: 3155-3158Google Scholar). The appearance of the gel before staining, after iron-staining (22Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and after further staining with CBB was recorded by two-dimensional color image scanning. The amount of newly formed holoferredoxin and the corresponding decrease of holo-SyNifU(-h6) were densitometrically quantified. After incubating apoferredoxin (40 μg) with SyNifU-h6 (80 μg) as described above, electron transfer activity of the reconstituted holoferredoxin was assayed by measuring the rate of cytochromec reduction. The reaction mixture contained 0.25 mm NADPH, 40 nm FNR (pea ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase), 0.1 mm horse heart cytochrome c, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), and 100 mm NaCl. The reaction was initiated by addition of the reconstituted ferredoxin solution, which contained ferredoxin polypeptide equivalent to 10 μg of the initially added apoferredoxin, and reduction of cytochrome c was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 550 nm. As a control, activity of purified SyNifU-h6 (20 μg) and apoferredoxin (10 μg) was also separately analyzed, and activities were compared with those of the holoferredoxin (10 or 5 μg). The cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 contains only one nifU-like gene (ssl2667) (20Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The 76-amino acid translation product shows significant sequence homology to the carboxyl-terminal domain of NifU encoded in the nif gene cluster of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and possesses the conserved -Cys-X-X-Cys- motif. Recombinant proteins, either with (SyNifU-h6) or without (SyNifU) a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine peptide tag, were overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified (Fig. 1 A). UV/visible absorption spectrum of the purified SyNifU-h6 showed a characteristic spectrum with peak maxima at 330, 420, and 460 nm, suggesting the presence of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig. 1 B). Although SyNifU showed essentially similar absorption spectrum, the ratio of absorbances at 330 versus 280 nm was smaller in SyNifU than in SyNifU-h6, indicating a higher content of the apo-form in the purified SyNifU protein fraction. Interestingly, based on gel filtration, the SyNifU-h6 fraction also contained a considerable amount of the apo-form. It seemed most likely the apo-form existed as a monomer, and the cluster-containing holo-form of both proteins existed as an oligomer (data not shown). Apo- and holo-forms were also observed in the purified SyNifU-h6 under nondenaturing PAGE conditions (21Nishio K. Nakai M. Hase T. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1999: 3155-3158Google Scholar); the purified SyNifU-h6 clearly forming two distinct bands detected by CBB staining as shown in Fig. 1 C. The slower migrating band seemed to correspond to the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing holo-form and the faster migrating band to the monomeric apo-form, because only the former showed the pink-red color characteristic of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing protein in the unstained gel and was detected by iron staining (Fig. 1 C). Because SyNifU contains two evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues, we speculate that the oligomeric holo-SyNifU(-h6) carries one [2Fe-2S] cluster between two identical monomers. The presence of a considerable amount of the apo-form in purified SyNifU(-h6) fractions was probably due to limited formation of the iron-sulfur cluster of SyNifU(-h6) in the overexpressor cells. It is also possible that instability of the iron-sulfur cluster, during the prolonged purification procedure necessary for SyNifU, caused the higher content of the apo-form. Because the holo- and apo-SyNifU(-h6) showed similar behavior through various chromatographic separations, complete removal of the apo-form proved difficult. The labile property of the [2Fe-2S] cluster contained in the holo-SyNifU-h6 was demonstrated by a significant decay in its characteristic UV/visible absorption spectrum upon exposure to the iron-chelating reagent EDTA (Fig. 1 D). Such EDTA-induced destruction of an iron-sulfur cluster was not observed in typical [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing proteins such as ferredoxin (data not shown), suggesting that the iron-sulfur cluster of the holo-SyNifU(-h6) is abnormally exposed to solvent. The presence of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in purified SyNifU(-h6) lead us to analyze the ability of purified SyNifU(-h6) to transfer its iron-sulfur cluster to another substrate apoprotein. To examine this, a [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing photosynthetic ferredoxin of Synechocystis PCC6803, a petF(ssl0020) gene product, was chosen as a model substrate protein (20Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ferredoxin was first purified from E. colioverexpressor cells as the holo-form (21Nishio K. Nakai M. Hase T. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1999: 3155-3158Google Scholar) and converted to the apo-form by boiling in the presence of EDTA and dithiothreitol. Apoferredoxin was further purified by desalting to remove low molecular weight molecules such as sulfur, iron, or their derivatives liberated from the ferredoxin polypeptide by denaturation, and also to remove any excess EDTA and dithiothreitol. As shown in Fig.2 A (left and middle panels), the prepared holo- and apoferredoxins were easily separated during nondenaturing PAGE (21Nishio K. Nakai M. Hase T. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1999: 3155-3158Google Scholar); the holoferredoxin migrated much faster than the apo-form and retained its characteristic pink-red color during electrophoresis, whereas color loss in the apo-form was complete. The absence of the iron atom in the prepared apoferredoxin polypeptides was confirmed by iron-staining after nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 2 A, right panel) (22Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The prepared apoferredoxin showed no absorption in the visible and near-ultraviolet region as shown in Fig. 2 B. Moreover, sulfide analysis (23Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) of the prepared apoferredoxin indicated that more than 97% of labile sulfide, which had been originally contained in the holo-ferredoxin, was successfully removed. Purified SyNifU(-h6) was incubated with apoferredoxin to investigate iron-sulfur cluster transfer at a simple level. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 3 A, a fairly efficient formation of the holoferredoxin could be observed, while a corresponding amount of SyNifU(-h6) lost its cluster. Essentially no difference could be observed between the result obtained with SyNifU and that obtained with SyNifU-h6. More than 50% of the added apoferredoxin seemed to be converted to its holo-form, based on the color intensity of the bands corresponding to reconstituted holoferredoxin and authentic holoferredoxin in the unstained gel. Without the addition of apoferredoxin, SyNifU(-h6) remained intact as the holo-form during the incubation. Holoferredoxin formation by SyNifU-h6 was shown to be temperature-dependent (Fig.3 B), and pre-heat denaturation of SyNifU(-h6) completely abolished cluster formation ability (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the presence of the reduced free sulfhydryl groups of four cysteines in the apoferredoxin participating in the [2Fe-2S] cluster ligation was prerequisite for SyNifU(-h6)-dependent holoferredoxin formation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 C, a relatively low level of reconstitution of apoferredoxin (∼5% as compared with that by holo-SyNifU-h6) by simple addition of ferrous ion and Na2S was observed. Such chemical reconstitution was not enhanced by the presence of apo-SyNifU-h6 in the reaction mixture, suggesting that the observed efficient holoferredoxin formation by holo-SyNifU(-h6) was caused by the direct transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster from the holo-SyNifU(-h6) to the apoferredoxin. As shown in Fig. 3 D, upon incubation with SyNifU-h6, approximately 50% of the added apoferredoxin seemed to regain the electron transfer activity comparable with that of the authentic holoferredoxin. This percentage of the recovered electron transfer activity was in good agreement with that of the reconstituted holoferredoxin observed under nondenaturing PAGE as shown in Fig.3 A. Moreover, the ferredoxin purified from the reconstitution assay mixture showed typical UV/visible absorption spectra characteristic for the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fig.3 E). These results indicate that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SyNifU-h6 was transferred and assembled accurately into the apoferredoxin polypeptide to form the biochemically active holoferredoxin. Such cluster transfer was not observed when other [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing proteins such as a cyanobacterial Fdx or an adrenodoxin homolog of yeast mitochondria (mtAd) were used as donors in place of SyNifU(-h6) (Fig. 3 F). In conclusion, holoferredoxin can be formed in vitro by transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster from the holo-SyNifU protein to the apoferredoxin polypeptide. From these results, we propose that the SyNifU-mediated delivery of the iron-sulfur cluster could be a key step in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins in the cell. NifU encoded in the nif gene cluster, originally identified in A. vinelandii, has been proposed to consist of three distinct domains (17Ouzounis C. Bork P. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 199-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13455-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain shows a high sequence identity to bacterial IscU proteins encoded in the isc(iron-sulfur cluster formation) operon and also to the yeast mitochondrial Isu proteins (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 13Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to, or instead of, such IscU/Isu proteins, some bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria seem to possess additional SyNifU-like NifU-related proteins with identity to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Azotobacter NifU (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly,Azotobacter NifU was shown to be a homodimer containing two permanent [2Fe-2S] clusters in the middle domain and one transient [2Fe-2S] cluster in the amino-terminal IscU/Isu domain (18Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13455-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Azotobacter NifU, which shares high sequence similarity to SyNifU, remained as apo-form when prepared. This means that a [2Fe-2S] cluster might be present also in the carboxyl-terminal domain in vivo but it might be too unstable to be detected, or it might be transferred rapidly to other iron-sulfur cluster acceptor proteins or domains (e.g. the amino-terminal or middle domains of Azotobacter NifU itself). However, most recently, two cysteine residues contained in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Azotobacter NifU were found to be unnecessary for the full physiological function (24Agar J.N. Yuvaniyama P. Jack R.F. Cash V.L. Smith A.D. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The proposed function of the transient [2Fe-2S] cluster is to provide the Fe-S cores of the nitrogenase metalloclusters (19Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the IscU/Isu domain/proteins and the SyNifU-like proteins perform somewhat similar or otherwise overlapped functions in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in the cell. A more detailed molecular mechanism that is involved in the transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster from holo-SyNifU to apoferredoxin remains to be elucidated on the basis of both chemical and structural points of view. Because the donor and the acceptor proteins in the in vitro[2Fe-2S] cluster transfer reaction used in this study are rather small and even soluble, this system should be a useful and powerful model to understand this key reaction of the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters into proteins. It has yet to be elucidated how the iron-sulfur cluster of SyNifU itself is formed in vivo. NifS/IscS, NifA/IscA, and/or Fdx might participate in this process (6Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H.

The key structural features that are shared among all members of this family of enzymes are found in its largest subunit, subunit I. Subunit I is an integral membrane protein with 12–14 membrane-spanning helical segments that provide binding sites for two heme A moieties, known as cytochrome a and cytochromea 3, and one copper center, CuB. Cytochrome a 3 sits in close proximity to CuB, and together they form a binuclear site that is responsible for binding oxygen and its partially reduced states, which arise transiently in the course of catalysis. Cytochrome ais a low spin heme that functions to deliver electrons to cytochromea 3-CuB (1Michel H. Behr J. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 329-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar).The nature of the electron input site reflects a division in the cytochrome oxidase family of enzymes into two groups. In cytochromec oxidases, such as the enzyme found in the mitochondrial inner membrane of eukaryotes, reducing equivalents are delivered from the soluble protein ferrocytochrome c. The cytochromec interaction site on the oxidase is predominantly defined by subunit II (2Millett F. de Jong C. Paulson L. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Taha T.S. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9090-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subunit II has two transmembrane helices that anchor a solvent-exposed domain, which provides the inner sphere ligands for the dinuclear CuA center. Although there is no direct structural information on a cytochromec-cytochrome c oxidase complex, kinetic (4Hill B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38051-38060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) studies indicate that cytochromec binds at a site near the CuA center to allow for efficient electron transfer from cytochrome c to CuA. Thus, electrons enter cytochrome c oxidase via CuA and are transferred to the cytochromea 3-CuB center through cytochromea (9Hill B.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The second group within the cytochrome oxidase family is the quinol oxidases, which receive reducing equivalents from a lipid-soluble quinol. The best known of this group is the ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli (10Gennis R.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Even though the quinol oxidases do not oxidize cytochrome c they do have a subunit II that has overall homology with the subunit II of the cytochromec oxidases. The major difference in subunit II of the quinol oxidase is the lack of the amino acid ligands for the CuA center. The lack of CuA accounts for the lack of reactivity of the quinol oxidases with cytochromec.Copper is an element that is used in proteins to fulfill specific catalytic and structural roles. However, copper is also a potential danger in biological systems due to its ability to catalyze oxidative damage of many cellular components. A new class of proteins, metallochaperones, have been identified that mediate the incorporation of copper into a variety of specific binding sites (11Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As outlined above, the integral membrane enzyme cytochrome c oxidase has two biochemically and physically distinct copper centers. The CuA center is composed of two copper ions that are held by a set of amino acid ligands such that the coppers are within bonding distance from one another (12Blackburn N.J. Barr M.E. Woodruff W.H. van der Oost J. de Vries S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10401-10407Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The second copper center of cytochromec oxidases is known as CuB and is physically associated with cytochrome a 3. CuAis contained in the extra-membranous domain of subunit II, whereas CuB is found in the membrane-embedded domain of subunit I (13Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 14Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). There is much known about the role of these copper centers in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, but relatively little is known about the mechanism of their assembly.A number of protein factors have been proposed to have a role in the assembly of complex integral membrane proteins such as cytochromec oxidase (15Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the last few years some of these assembly factors have been more specifically defined. A pathway for the import of copper into mitochondria and its assembly into the copper centers of cytochrome c oxidase has been proposed from studies in yeast (16Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A pair of copper transporters, CTR1 (17Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CTR3 (18Knight S.A. Labbe S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), have been found in the plasma membrane that are responsible for the specific, high affinity uptake of copper. Copper is then passed to a set of soluble binding proteins, one of which is Cox17. Cox17 binds copper in the cytoplasm and moves to the mitochondrial intermembrane space by an as yet unknown mechanism. Another protein Sco1, which is an integral component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, has been implicated in copper delivery to cytochrome c oxidase because yeast strains made deficient in Cox17 are rescued by overexpression of Sco1 (19Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Whether Cox17 passes copper to cytochrome c oxidase, or to Sco1, is not known. Sco1 may play a direct role in the transfer of copper to cytochrome c oxidase perhaps acting to facilitate the transfer of copper from Cox17 to cytochrome coxidase. Alternatively, the role of Sco1 may be indirect, perhaps serving as a means of copper accumulation in mitochondria (20Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In order to address questions concerning the specific requirements for the assembly of the CuA and CuB centers in cytochrome c oxidase, we chose to look at their assembly in the respiratory chain of the aerobic bacterium Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis expresses a cytochrome c oxidase that, like the canonical mitochondrial enzyme, has both CuA and CuB centers within homologs of subunit II and subunit I, respectively. The cytochrome c oxidase of B. subtilis has the added feature of having a cytochrome cdomain fused to its subunit II, and this places it among the cytochromecaa 3 subclass of the cytochrome oxidase family. In addition, B. subtilis expresses a menaquinol oxidase that contains cytochrome a, cytochrome a 3, and CuB within a subunit I that is homologous (47.6% identical, 76.9% similar) to subunit I of cytochromecaa 3. The menaquinol oxidase does not, however, have a CuA center, but subunit II of menaquinol oxidase is homologous (62% similar) to subunit II of cytochromecaa 3. The particular amino acids used to form the CuA site are absent in the sequence of B. subtilis menaquinol oxidase (21Santana M. Kunst F. Hullo M.F. Rapoport G. Danchin A. Glaser P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10225-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these two related members of the cytochrome oxidase family with distinct copper requirements make B. subtilis a good organism for studying the requirements of copper center assembly.A search of the B. subtilis chromosome reveals a potential homolog of the yeast mitochondrial protein Sco1 but does not identify a homolog of Cox17. Here, we show that disruption of the expression ofypmQ results in cytochrome c oxidase-deficientB. subtilis. In contrast, the expression of menaquinol oxidase is unaffected in the same strains. We show that the absence ofypmQ from the genome can be overcome by supplementing the growth medium with copper or by expressing ypmQ from a plasmid. We have made site-directed changes to two conserved cysteine residues and one histidine within the sequence of YpmQ that support a role for these residues as potential copper-binding ligands. It is proposed that YpmQ is involved in the assembly of the CuAcenter but is not involved in the assembly of the CuBcenter.RESULTSA Blast2 (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z.

The same approach does not identify a homolog of the yeast copper chaperone Cox17 in the B. subtilis genome. Analysis of theypmQ gene finds two potential promoters, ςA and ςH (34Haldenwang W.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ςH promoter is probably the most efficient as it has perfect consensus for promoters of this type. Also, ςH is produced late in growth, which correlates well with the appearance of cytochromec oxidase (35Lauraeus M. Haltia T. Saraste M. Wikstrom M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). YpmQ is predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 21.5 kDa and, from hydropathy analysis (36Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), to contain a single amino-terminal transmembrane-spanning helix, suggesting that it is a membrane-bound protein. Further examination of the predicted transmembrane helix shows that it also contains the sequence of amino acids that specify the covalent attachment of lipid (37Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The alignment of the solvent exposed domains of YpmQ and Sco1 shows 27% identity and 48% similarity (Fig. 1 B). This alignment identifies a CXXXC sequence and a histidine in YpmQ that are conserved elements compared with Sco1.The ypmQ gene was cloned from the chromosome of B. subtilis using PCR to yield pNM87. A Nm antibiotic resistance cassette was used to replace most of the ypmQ gene in pNM87 to make pNM209. Since this construct was made using pBR322, which does not replicate independently in B. subtilis, transformation of B. subtilis with pNM209 requires homologous recombination with ypmQ on the chromosome to rescue the Nm cassette. Strain BH144 is Nm-resistant and ΔypmQ. A plate assay based on the production of the intensely colored Wurster's blue radical that results from TMPD oxidation by cytochrome coxidase was used to test B. subtilis colonies for the presence of cytochrome c oxidase activity (31Mueller J.P. Taber H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that TMPD is a poor electron donor to menaquinol oxidase, the other heme A-based terminal oxidase present in membrane extracts of B. subtilis (38Hill B.C. Vo L. Albanese J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the color that develops in this assay with a number of B. subtilis strains. A strong purple color develops in wild type B. subtilis 168 and is completely absent in strain BH170 in which the expression of cytochromec oxidase is disrupted directly by insertional inactivation of the cytochrome c oxidase operon (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). The strain of B. subtilis in which ypmQ is deleted (i.e.BH144) is also unable to oxidize TMPD (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). When ypmQ is supplied to strain BH144 on plasmid pNM171 (i.e. BH149) the ability to oxidize TMPD is restored (Fig.2 A, lane 4). In order to demonstrate that the ability of BH149 to oxidize TMPD is not simply due to an overexpression ofypmQ, we expressed ypmQ in a background deficient in cytochrome c oxidase. This strain, BH191, is unable to oxidize TMPD (Fig. 2 A, lane 5) implying that, as expected, this activity is coupled to the functional expression of cytochromec oxidase. Another manipulation illustrated in Fig. 2 is the effect of the addition of a 6-histidine tag on the functional expression of ypmQ (BH150). The histidine-tagged version ofypmQ is equal to the wild type protein in its ability to complement ΔypmQ (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and3).Since ypmQ was identified by its sequence similarity to Sco1 from yeast, and Sco1 is implicated in copper delivery to cytochromec oxidase, we decided to test whether the deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase that occurs when ypmQ is deleted can be overcome by supplementing the growth medium with copper. We prepared membrane extracts from wild type B. subtilis, BH144 (ΔypmQ), in which ypmQ is deleted, and BH150 (ΔypmQ[ypmQ +]), in which the ypmQ deletion is complemented by expression ofypmQ from a plasmid. These three strains were grown under conditions of low copper and are compared with BH144 grown in medium containing high copper (Figs. 3 and4 and TableIII). Our super-rich medium used for routine culturing of wild type B. subtilis contains 0.8 μm copper supplied in a micro-nutrient supplement. In the low copper growth condition copper was excluded from the micro-nutrient solution, and the medium was supplemented with 20 nm of the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate. In high copper conditions the low copper medium was supplemented with 50 μmCuCl2, which in separate experiments was shown not to affect the growth of wild type B. subtilis or strain BH150. The steady-state activities for membrane extracts from wild type, BH144, and BH150 grown with low copper are compared with BH144 grown with high copper (Fig. 3). In this assay the steady-state absorption at 444–460 nm versus time is a measure of both the enzyme activity and the amount of cytochromes a anda 3. In each trace the oxidized level of the sample was measured prior to addition of the reductants, ascorbate and TMPD, which produce a steady-state level of reduction until the dissolved O2 is completely consumed at which time the absorption increases rapidly to full reduction. We have shown previously that aerobic cultures of B. subtilis contain two components that are reduced in this assay, namely cytochromec oxidase and menaquinol oxidase (38Hill B.C. Vo L. Albanese J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than 90% of the flux from ascorbate plus TMPD is carried by cytochromec oxidase. The steady-state cytochrome c oxidase activity of the wild type extract is similar to that reported previously (38Hill B.C. Vo L. Albanese J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The apparent activity of BH144 grown on low copper media is reduced 25-fold relative to the wild type extract (Table III). This residual activity of BH144 is presumably due to slow turnover of the menaquinol oxidase. The activity of BH150 is about 60% of the wild type activity. The addition of extra copper to the growth medium of BH144 stimulates the activity more than 7-fold over the same strain grown with low copper, which brings it to a level about 25% that seen with the wild type preparation.Figure 3Steady-state activity profiles for membrane extracts of different strains of B. subtilis. Each assay contains 5 mm sodium ascorbate and 200 μmTMPD and was performed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Traces are as follows: trace a is from wild type B. subtilis grown with low copper; trace b is from BH144 (ΔypmQ) grown with low copper; trace c is from BH150 (ΔypmQ [ypmQ +]) grown with low copper; and trace d is from BH144 (ΔypmQ) grown with high copper.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Western blot of membrane extracts for cytochrome caa 3 subunit content.Membrane extracts were prepared, run on SDS-PAGE, electrophoresed to PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-cytochromecaa 3 antibodies.

In BH144 (ΔypmQ) grown with low copper the cytochromeaa 3 content in the extract is reduced to about one-half that seen in the wild type extract. The remaining cytochromeaa 3 content is due to the presence of menaquinol oxidase. This change is in keeping with our previous estimate of the cytochrome c oxidase and menaquinol oxidase contents in wild type cells (38Hill B.C. Vo L. Albanese J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and the loss of cytochrome c oxidase in BH144 (ΔypmQ). When the growth medium is supplemented with copper the cytochrome caa 3 content of BH144 is increased to 21% that of wild type. In strain BH150 the level of cytochrome caa 3 indicates a recovery to 50% of the wild type level. These cytochrome levels are consistent with the apparent activities, which indicates that to a first approximation the cytochrome c oxidase assembled under these different conditions has close to the same molecular activity. We have also found that the menaquinol oxidase activity is the same in these membrane extracts implying that the lack of YpmQ does not affect its assembly.In BH144 (ΔypmQ) grown with low copper the spectral properties and activity of the cytochrome c oxidase are absent. Fig. 4 shows the results of an experiment in which antibodies to a highly purified two-subunit form of the cytochromecaa 3 complex were used to determine whether the subunits of the enzyme can be detected in this strain. Membrane extracts from wild type B. subtilis, strain BH144 (ΔypmQ), and from BH150 (ΔypmQ [ypmQ +]) were run on an SDS gel and transferred to PVDF for Western blotting. The two major subunits, I and II, are clearly observed in the wild type extracts and are both depressed in strain BH144 grown with low copper. Our antibody to cytochromecaa 3 has better reactivity with subunit II, and Table III reports the integrated intensity of the subunit II band corrected for the small variation in the amount of membrane protein loaded in each lane of Fig. 4. The level of subunit II is more than 10-fold lower than wild type in BH144 and recovers to more than 80% of wild type levels in BH150 grown with low copper. In BH144 grown with excess copper the subunit II level is 21% of the intensity observed with wild type. The values for subunit II levels are consistent with the cytochrome content and activity levels of these strains (TableIII).A key feature of ypmQ is a set of highly conserved residues that are proposed to function in binding copper. In YpmQ, the cysteines at positions 64 and 68 and histidine at 154 are conserved when compared with the sequence of Sco1 from yeast (39Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I. Sadlock J.E. Krishna S. Walker W. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Coster R.V. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. De V.D. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We expressed ypmQfrom a plasmid with amino acids Cys-64 and Cys-68 replaced by serine both individually and together and His-154 changed to alanine. These strains (i.e. BH193, BH183, BH148, and BH180) are not able to oxidize TMPD (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–7) and have a phenotype equivalent to the cytochrome c oxidase disrupted strain (i.e. BH170, Fig. 2B lane 2). Fig.5 compares the cytochrome content of aB. subtilis strain expressing wild type YpmQ to a strain expressing an inactive mutant of YpmQ (BH180 and H154A). The strain expressing wild type YpmQ has an absorption maximum at 602 nm that is a composite of contributions from the two heme A-containing oxidases (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the strain expressing an inactive mutant of YpmQ has an absorption maximum at 600 nm, which is characteristic of the menaquinol oxidase. Furthermore, the difference spectrum between the membrane extract of the wild type strain minus the mutant strain shows a deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 5 B). The double difference spectrum has a set of bands at 416, 520, and 550 nm due to the cytochrome c domain of subunit II and at 444 and 604 nm due to cytochromes a anda 3, which are signatures of B. subtilis cytochrome c oxidase. There is also a difference in the level of cytochrome b in the two strains as evidenced by the peak at 560 nm in the double difference spectrum.Figure 5Absorption difference spectra of B. subtilis membrane extracts expressing active and inactive forms of YpmQ. A shows the dithionite reduced-air oxidized difference spectra of B. subtilis strain BH149 expressing wild type YpmQ (—) and BH180 expressing the H154A mutant of YpmQ (− − −). B is the difference between the two spectra in A (i.e. BH149-BH180). The yaxis scale on the left applies to the region from 380 to 480 nm, and the scale on the right applies from 380 to 700 nm. The extraction volumes were scaled to the cell wet weight obtained from the culture of each strain. The reduced state for each sample was generated by the addition of a grain of solid sodium dithionite.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The lack of functional cytochrome c oxidase in the strains expressing site-specific mutants of YpmQ (see Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–7) could be due to poor expression or improper folding of the mutant forms of YpmQ. To address this question, we have taken advantage of the histidine tag on each of these constructs and used an anti-histidine tag antibody to detect YpmQ. A Western blot of membrane extracts separated by SDS-PAGE shows that histidine-tagged, native YpmQ and His-tagged, mutant YpmQ proteins are present at similar levels in these different strains (Fig. 6). Since the mutants are expressed to a similar level as wild type and are present in the plasma membrane, it is unlikely that the cysteine to serine or the histidine to alanine changes have compromised the proper expression and folding of these mutant YpmQ proteins.Figure 6Western blot of membrane extracts of strains of B. subtilis expressing different forms ofypmQ. Membrane proteins were extracted in Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted to a PVDF membrane. YpmQ was detected on the PVDF membrane by using an anti-histidine antibody. Inlane 1, membrane proteins (105 μg of total protein loaded) from BH149, including YpmQ, do not contain histidine tags and therefore do not develop bands on the blot. Strains BH150 (100 μg), BH148 (108 μg), and BH180 (123 μg)in lanes 2-4 all show a single band at about 22,000 Da, which correlates with the size of YpmQ. The position of standard molecular weight markers is indicated at the left side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effect of ypmQ's deletion on menaquinol oxidase function can also be tested by growth and antibiotic sensitivity. It has been shown that a deficiency in menaquinol oxidase leads to a small colony morphology and confers streptomycin resistance to B. subtilis (21Santana M. Kunst F. Hullo M.F. Rapoport G. Danchin A. Glaser P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10225-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that a Δqoxstrain (BH101) in which the menaquinol oxidase operon is deleted is resistant to streptomycin, whereas the wild type strain and BH144 (ΔypmQ) fail to grow in the presence of streptomycin. We have also observed that BH144 (ΔypmQ) has a colony morphology that is similar to the wild type strain 168 when both are compared with the small colony phenotype observed for BH101 (Δqox) (data not shown). Spectral evidence, kinetic activity, and growth phenotype support the conclusion that deletion ofypmQ does not affect the expression of menaquinol oxidase.DISCUSSIONStudy of the assembly of copper centers in a number of copper-containing proteins has resulted in the identification of specific accessory proteins that aid the assembly process. In some cases transfer of copper from the assembly protein to an apoprotein target has been demonstrated, and these proteins are identified as copper chaperones. This new class of proteins functions to deliver copper and avoids the potential deleterious side effects that could arise from redox reactions initiated by free copper. For example, the copper center in copper, zinc, superoxide dismutase in yeast and humans is assembled with the aid of the copper chaperone protein, CCS (41Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J.

The N-terminal domain of DFF45 is required for its chaperone function by associating with the N-terminal region of DFF40 (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A novel family of cell death-inducingDFF45-like effectors (CIDEs) was identified by its high homology with both of the N-terminal domains of DFF40 and DFF45 (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 17Inohara N. Nunez G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 823-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CIDE proteins can be divided into the N-terminal CIDE-N domain, which shares homology with DFF40/45, and the C-terminal CIDE-C domain, which shares homology within CIDE proteins only (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although this class of proteins shares homology with DFF45/40 at the N-terminal region, their functions differ significantly. Unlike DFF45, over-expression of CIDEs in mammalian cells shows strong cell death-inducing activity with the C-terminal domain (CIDE-C) being sufficient for its cell death activity (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We have recently participated in solving the structure of the N-terminal domain of CIDE-B (or CIDE-N) (18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our structural analyses suggested that CIDE-N domains interact with each other with low affinity and that the binding surface has a novel bipolar property consisting of two oppositely charged regions. This novel homophilic association strongly suggests that CIDE-N domain is a weak interaction interface functioning as a regulatory domain for CIDE-B protein (18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which CIDE-B induces apoptosis, we characterized its subcellular localization. We observed that CIDE-B proteins are mitochondrially localized and form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members. Systematic deletion analysis showed that the C-terminal region of CIDE-B is responsible for its mitochondria localization and dimerization. Our data also suggest that both mitochondria localization and high affinity interaction are required for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis. Therefore, CIDE proteins form a novel family of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins that require dimerization to function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo characterize the subcellular localization of CIDE-B, the GFP coding region was fused to the N-terminal ATG of human CIDE-B and transiently transfected into COS-1 cells to determine its localization. GFP fusion proteins of full-length CIDE-B were present in punctate structures in cytoplasm. Co-staining these cells with MitoTracker showed a pattern similar to GFP-CIDE-B, and merging of the two images showed almost completely overlapping patterns (Fig.1). Co-staining of CIDE-B with Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum-specific markers showed no overlapping staining (data not shown). This specific localization was not due to over-expression of GFP, as GFP alone showed a diffused distribution in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with higher levels in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Immunocytochemical staining with HA- and Flag-tagged CIDE-B also showed overlapping expression patterns with MitoTracker (data not show). Therefore, our data strongly indicate that CIDE-B is localized to the mitochondria.The region(s) that is responsible for CIDE-B mitochondria localization was further defined by generating GFP fusion proteins containing truncated forms of CIDE-B (Fig.2 A). GFP fusion proteins containing the N-terminal region of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔC) showed a diffused pattern in both nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, GFP fused to the C-terminal region of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔN) was found as spherically shaped granules and was localized predominantly to mitochondria (Fig. 1). Therefore, the mitochondria localization signal appears to reside in the C-terminal region of CIDE-B. GFP fusion proteins with a deletion of 30 residues from the N-terminal end of this C-terminal domain (CIDE-B-(148–219)) were still localized to mitochondria. However, deletion of the C-terminal 39 residues from the C-terminal domain (CIDE-B-(118–180)) disrupted the mitochondria localization of GFP fusion proteins, suggesting that C-terminal is required for mitochondria localization. Surprisingly, GFP fusion proteins containing the C-terminal 39 residues of CIDE-B alone (CIDE-B-(181–219)) were expressed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and were not localized to any organelle-like structure. GFP fusion proteins containing CIDE-B regions from 118 to 148 (CIDE-B-(118–148)) or 148 to 180 (CIDE-B-(148–180)) did not show typical mitochondria localization either. To explore the possibility that disruption around amino acid 180 may result in abolishing the mitochondria localization signal, we generated constructs that span the region near amino acid 180. Indeed, GFP fusion proteins containing regions from residue 166–219 (CIDE-B-(166–219)) or 148–195 (CIDE-B-(148–195)) all displayed mitochondria localization. The minimal region tested that showed mitochondria localization by GFP analysis consists of amino acid 166–195 (CIDE-B166–195, Fig. 1), indicating that residues 166–195 at the C-terminal domain of CIDE-B are necessary and sufficient to target CIDE-B to mitochondria. Computer analysis of the minimal mitochondria localization signal revealed that it contains a long stretch of α-helical structure that may help CIDE-B to insert into the mitochondria membrane.Cell death stimuli such as staurosporine and etoposide did not induce GFP-CIDE-B translocation from mitochondria to the nuclei or cytosol (data not shown), suggesting that CIDE-B exerts its cell death function by localization to mitochondria. By localizing to mitochondria, CIDE-B may interact directly with Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to chelate anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby inducing apoptosis. It is also possible that CIDE-B may directly induce mitochondria change such as disruption of mitochondria membrane potential, induction of the production of reactive oxygen species, and the release of apoptosis-inducing factors.Our previous biochemical and structural analyses suggested that the N-terminal region of CIDEs acts as a weak interaction interface through homophilic interaction, whereas synergistic and high affinity binding requires the contribution of other domains (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that CIDE proteins also contain multiple interaction domains, Flag-tagged CIDE-B was co-expressed with HA-tagged CIDE-B or CIDE-A in 293T cells. Flag-CIDE-B was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against Flag epitope, and the co-precipitating protein was detected with HA antibodies. HA-CIDE-B was co-precipitated with Flag-CIDE-B but not with control proteins (Fig. 2 B), indicating a strong interaction of CIDE-B with itself. Although we cannot exclude formation of high order oligomers, we assume and will refer to this interaction as dimerization. The HA-tagged C-terminal region of CIDE-B (HA-CIDE-BΔN) but not the N-terminal region (HA-CIDE-BΔC) was co-precipitated with Flag-CIDE-B, indicating that the C-terminal region of CIDE-B mediates stable dimer formation. This result was further confirmed by cotransfecting HA-CIDE-BΔN with Flag-CIDE-BΔN and Flag-CIDE-BΔC, respectively. HA-CIDE-BΔN was co-immunoprecipitated only with Flag-CIDE-BΔN and not with Flag-CIDE-BΔC (Fig. 2 C). Reciprocal experiments using HA antibodies to immunoprecipitate the complex and detecting the co-precipitated product with Flag antibodies yielded the same results (data not shown). Similar experiments conducted between HA-CIDE-B and Flag-CIDE-A suggested that CIDE-B also interacts with CIDE-A (Fig.2 D), mediated by the C-terminal region. Consistent with our previous data, CIDE-BΔC/CIDE-BΔC interaction (Fig. 2 C) was weak and not detectable by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Flag antibody-immunoprecipitated products were probed using GFP antibodies to detect the co-precipitated proteins. In agreement with the results shown above, the CIDE-BΔN domain was found bound to CIDE-B proteins (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Deletion of the N-terminal 30 amino acids of the CIDE-BΔN domain had little effect on the homodimeric interaction, suggesting that amino acid residues 148–219 contain the dimerization interface (Fig.3 A, lane 3). Deletion of the C-terminal 39 amino acids almost completely abolished the homodimeric interaction (Fig.3 A, lane 4), suggesting that this region is important in mediating the CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction. GFP fusion proteins containing the C-terminal 39 amino acids of CIDE-BΔN alone, the middle region (residue 148–180), or the N-terminal region (residue 118–148) alone showed no binding activity to CIDE-B (Fig.3 A, lanes 5-7). To explore the possibility that disruption at residue 180 may disrupt the interaction interface, we tested the ability of GFP fusion proteins containing residues 166–219, 148–195, and 166–195 of CIDE-C domain to co-immunoprecipitate with flag-CIDE-B. Indeed, GFP fusion proteins containing these regions all showed weak binding activity to CIDE-B (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8-10). These results (Fig. 3 A) suggest that the minimal region required for CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction is from residues 166–195 in the C-terminal region of CIDE-B. Quantitative analysis suggested that CIDE-BΔN and CIDE-B-(148–219) showed much higher binding affinity to CIDE-B (27- or 20-fold higher amounts co-immunoprecipitated, respectively) compared with CIDE-B-(166–195) (minimal region required for the interaction, Fig. 3 B). These data also suggested that residues upstream or downstream of residues 166–195 are required for high affinity CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction. Interestingly, the dimerization interface coincides with the mitochondria localization signal. Dimerization (or higher order oligomerization) of CIDE-B may increase the local concentration of this protein and help it to target to mitochondria and effectively induce cell death.Figure 3Serial deletion analyses to show the CIDE-B homodimeric interaction interface. A, the homodimeric interaction interface is located at the C terminus of CIDE-B (residues 166–195). The GFP fusion proteins of CIDE-ΔN and its truncations were co-transfected with Flag-CIDE-B. The co-immunoprecipitated products (IP) were detected with GFP antibodies.IB, immunoblot. B, the relative binding affinity between CIDE-ΔN and its truncations. The intensity of Flag-CIDE-B protein and co-immunoprecipitated products for each mutant was measured by densitometer scan (Bio-Rad) and normalized to deduce the fold difference between CIDE-ΔN and the minimal region required for interaction (CIDE-B166–195).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As mitochondria are the major organelles mediating cell death signals and activating the cell death machinery and dimerization is critical for the function of many cell death proteins, we tested whether mitochondria localization and dimerization of CIDE-B are required for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis. The N-terminal domain of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔC) showed no cell death effect, whereas the C-terminal domain (CIDE-BΔN) alone showed a level of cell death comparable to full-length CIDE-B (70 and 65%, respectively). A deletion of the N-terminal end of the CIDE-BΔN (CIDE-B-(148–219)) that showed mitochondria localization and high affinity interaction was still effective in inducing apoptosis (55%). CIDE-B with a deletion of the C-terminal 39 residues (CIDE-B-(118–180)), which neither localized to mitochondria nor dimerized with itself, showed no apoptotic activity (20%). Truncations of CIDE-B protein (CIDE-B-(118–148), -(148–180), and -(181–219)), which showed no mitochondria localization, all showed no activity in triggering apoptosis. CIDE-B deletions that showed mitochondria localization but had low affinity interaction (CIDE-B-(166–219), -(148–195), and -(166–195)) all demonstrated weak apoptotic activity slightly higher than the vector but significantly lower than that of CIDE-BΔN domain and CIDE-B-(148–219). The differences in cell death effect is not due to protein expression levels, as CIDE-B and its truncation mutants all showed a similar level of expression (Fig.4, inset). Our data thus suggest that the C-terminal domain of CIDE-B plays an important role for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis by directly targeting CIDE-B to mitochondria, mediating CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction, and inducing apoptosis. It is very interesting to identify the 30 amino acids (from 166 to 195) at the C-terminal region of CIDE-B as both the mitochondria localization signal and the interaction interface. Single-point mutations at this region that abolish one of the activities would be useful in distinguishing these roles.Figure 4Apoptosis induced by hCIDE-B and its deletion mutants. 3 μg of indicated plasmids and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase were transfected into CHO cells.

Mutational analyses have revealed that the conserved BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax plays an important role in mediating homo- or heterodimerization (6Gross A.G.

Cell (1997). 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar) consists of two subunits, a nuclease (CAD/DFF40) and its inhibitor (DFF45/ICAD). The N-terminal domain of DFF45 is required for its chaperone function by associating with the N-terminal region of DFF40 (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A novel family of cell death-inducingDFF45-like effectors (CIDEs) was identified by its high homology with both of the N-terminal domains of DFF40 and DFF45 (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 17Inohara N. Nunez G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 823-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CIDE proteins can be divided into the N-terminal CIDE-N domain, which shares homology with DFF40/45, and the C-terminal CIDE-C domain, which shares homology within CIDE proteins only (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although this class of proteins shares homology with DFF45/40 at the N-terminal region, their functions differ significantly. Unlike DFF45, over-expression of CIDEs in mammalian cells shows strong cell death-inducing activity with the C-terminal domain (CIDE-C) being sufficient for its cell death activity (16Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We have recently participated in solving the structure of the N-terminal domain of CIDE-B (or CIDE-N) (18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our structural analyses suggested that CIDE-N domains interact with each other with low affinity and that the binding surface has a novel bipolar property consisting of two oppositely charged regions. This novel homophilic association strongly suggests that CIDE-N domain is a weak interaction interface functioning as a regulatory domain for CIDE-B protein (18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which CIDE-B induces apoptosis, we characterized its subcellular localization. We observed that CIDE-B proteins are mitochondrially localized and form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members. Systematic deletion analysis showed that the C-terminal region of CIDE-B is responsible for its mitochondria localization and dimerization. Our data also suggest that both mitochondria localization and high affinity interaction are required for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis. Therefore, CIDE proteins form a novel family of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins that require dimerization to function. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo characterize the subcellular localization of CIDE-B, the GFP coding region was fused to the N-terminal ATG of human CIDE-B and transiently transfected into COS-1 cells to determine its localization. GFP fusion proteins of full-length CIDE-B were present in punctate structures in cytoplasm. Co-staining these cells with MitoTracker showed a pattern similar to GFP-CIDE-B, and merging of the two images showed almost completely overlapping patterns (Fig.1). Co-staining of CIDE-B with Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum-specific markers showed no overlapping staining (data not shown). This specific localization was not due to over-expression of GFP, as GFP alone showed a diffused distribution in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with higher levels in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Immunocytochemical staining with HA- and Flag-tagged CIDE-B also showed overlapping expression patterns with MitoTracker (data not show). Therefore, our data strongly indicate that CIDE-B is localized to the mitochondria.The region(s) that is responsible for CIDE-B mitochondria localization was further defined by generating GFP fusion proteins containing truncated forms of CIDE-B (Fig.2 A). GFP fusion proteins containing the N-terminal region of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔC) showed a diffused pattern in both nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, GFP fused to the C-terminal region of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔN) was found as spherically shaped granules and was localized predominantly to mitochondria (Fig. 1). Therefore, the mitochondria localization signal appears to reside in the C-terminal region of CIDE-B. GFP fusion proteins with a deletion of 30 residues from the N-terminal end of this C-terminal domain (CIDE-B-(148–219)) were still localized to mitochondria. However, deletion of the C-terminal 39 residues from the C-terminal domain (CIDE-B-(118–180)) disrupted the mitochondria localization of GFP fusion proteins, suggesting that C-terminal is required for mitochondria localization. Surprisingly, GFP fusion proteins containing the C-terminal 39 residues of CIDE-B alone (CIDE-B-(181–219)) were expressed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus and were not localized to any organelle-like structure. GFP fusion proteins containing CIDE-B regions from 118 to 148 (CIDE-B-(118–148)) or 148 to 180 (CIDE-B-(148–180)) did not show typical mitochondria localization either. To explore the possibility that disruption around amino acid 180 may result in abolishing the mitochondria localization signal, we generated constructs that span the region near amino acid 180. Indeed, GFP fusion proteins containing regions from residue 166–219 (CIDE-B-(166–219)) or 148–195 (CIDE-B-(148–195)) all displayed mitochondria localization. The minimal region tested that showed mitochondria localization by GFP analysis consists of amino acid 166–195 (CIDE-B166–195, Fig. 1), indicating that residues 166–195 at the C-terminal domain of CIDE-B are necessary and sufficient to target CIDE-B to mitochondria. Computer analysis of the minimal mitochondria localization signal revealed that it contains a long stretch of α-helical structure that may help CIDE-B to insert into the mitochondria membrane.Cell death stimuli such as staurosporine and etoposide did not induce GFP-CIDE-B translocation from mitochondria to the nuclei or cytosol (data not shown), suggesting that CIDE-B exerts its cell death function by localization to mitochondria. By localizing to mitochondria, CIDE-B may interact directly with Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to chelate anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby inducing apoptosis. It is also possible that CIDE-B may directly induce mitochondria change such as disruption of mitochondria membrane potential, induction of the production of reactive oxygen species, and the release of apoptosis-inducing factors.Our previous biochemical and structural analyses suggested that the N-terminal region of CIDEs acts as a weak interaction interface through homophilic interaction, whereas synergistic and high affinity binding requires the contribution of other domains (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G.

To explore the possibility that CIDE proteins also contain multiple interaction domains, Flag-tagged CIDE-B was co-expressed with HA-tagged CIDE-B or CIDE-A in 293T cells. Flag-CIDE-B was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against Flag epitope, and the co-precipitating protein was detected with HA antibodies. HA-CIDE-B was co-precipitated with Flag-CIDE-B but not with control proteins (Fig. 2 B), indicating a strong interaction of CIDE-B with itself. Although we cannot exclude formation of high order oligomers, we assume and will refer to this interaction as dimerization.

Similar experiments conducted between HA-CIDE-B and Flag-CIDE-A suggested that CIDE-B also interacts with CIDE-A (Fig.2 D), mediated by the C-terminal region. Consistent with our previous data, CIDE-BΔC/CIDE-BΔC interaction (Fig. 2 C) was weak and not detectable by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is also possible that CIDE-B may directly induce mitochondria change such as disruption of mitochondria membrane potential, induction of the production of reactive oxygen species, and the release of apoptosis-inducing factors. Our previous biochemical and structural analyses suggested that the N-terminal region of CIDEs acts as a weak interaction interface through homophilic interaction, whereas synergistic and high affinity binding requires the contribution of other domains (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that CIDE proteins also contain multiple interaction domains, Flag-tagged CIDE-B was co-expressed with HA-tagged CIDE-B or CIDE-A in 293T cells. Flag-CIDE-B was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against Flag epitope, and the co-precipitating protein was detected with HA antibodies. HA-CIDE-B was co-precipitated with Flag-CIDE-B but not with control proteins (Fig. 2 B), indicating a strong interaction of CIDE-B with itself. Although we cannot exclude formation of high order oligomers, we assume and will refer to this interaction as dimerization. The HA-tagged C-terminal region of CIDE-B (HA-CIDE-BΔN) but not the N-terminal region (HA-CIDE-BΔC) was co-precipitated with Flag-CIDE-B, indicating that the C-terminal region of CIDE-B mediates stable dimer formation. This result was further confirmed by cotransfecting HA-CIDE-BΔN with Flag-CIDE-BΔN and Flag-CIDE-BΔC, respectively. HA-CIDE-BΔN was co-immunoprecipitated only with Flag-CIDE-BΔN and not with Flag-CIDE-BΔC (Fig. 2 C). Reciprocal experiments using HA antibodies to immunoprecipitate the complex and detecting the co-precipitated product with Flag antibodies yielded the same results (data not shown). Similar experiments conducted between HA-CIDE-B and Flag-CIDE-A suggested that CIDE-B also interacts with CIDE-A (Fig.2 D), mediated by the C-terminal region. Consistent with our previous data, CIDE-BΔC/CIDE-BΔC interaction (Fig. 2 C) was weak and not detectable by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (14McCarty J.S. Toh S.Y. Li P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,18Lugovskoy A.A. Zhou P. Chou J.J. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 99: 747-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further delineate regions within the C-terminal domain of CIDE-B that are required for dimerization, we cotransfected the GFP-tagged CIDE-C domain and various truncated forms with Flag-tagged CIDE-B into 293T cells. The Flag antibody-immunoprecipitated products were probed using GFP antibodies to detect the co-precipitated proteins. In agreement with the results shown above, the CIDE-BΔN domain was found bound to CIDE-B proteins (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Deletion of the N-terminal 30 amino acids of the CIDE-BΔN domain had little effect on the homodimeric interaction, suggesting that amino acid residues 148–219 contain the dimerization interface (Fig.3 A, lane 3). Deletion of the C-terminal 39 amino acids almost completely abolished the homodimeric interaction (Fig.3 A, lane 4), suggesting that this region is important in mediating the CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction. GFP fusion proteins containing the C-terminal 39 amino acids of CIDE-BΔN alone, the middle region (residue 148–180), or the N-terminal region (residue 118–148) alone showed no binding activity to CIDE-B (Fig.3 A, lanes 5-7). To explore the possibility that disruption at residue 180 may disrupt the interaction interface, we tested the ability of GFP fusion proteins containing residues 166–219, 148–195, and 166–195 of CIDE-C domain to co-immunoprecipitate with flag-CIDE-B. Indeed, GFP fusion proteins containing these regions all showed weak binding activity to CIDE-B (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8-10). These results (Fig. 3 A) suggest that the minimal region required for CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction is from residues 166–195 in the C-terminal region of CIDE-B. Quantitative analysis suggested that CIDE-BΔN and CIDE-B-(148–219) showed much higher binding affinity to CIDE-B (27- or 20-fold higher amounts co-immunoprecipitated, respectively) compared with CIDE-B-(166–195) (minimal region required for the interaction, Fig. 3 B). These data also suggested that residues upstream or downstream of residues 166–195 are required for high affinity CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction. Interestingly, the dimerization interface coincides with the mitochondria localization signal. Dimerization (or higher order oligomerization) of CIDE-B may increase the local concentration of this protein and help it to target to mitochondria and effectively induce cell death. As mitochondria are the major organelles mediating cell death signals and activating the cell death machinery and dimerization is critical for the function of many cell death proteins, we tested whether mitochondria localization and dimerization of CIDE-B are required for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis. The N-terminal domain of CIDE-B (CIDE-BΔC) showed no cell death effect, whereas the C-terminal domain (CIDE-BΔN) alone showed a level of cell death comparable to full-length CIDE-B (70 and 65%, respectively). A deletion of the N-terminal end of the CIDE-BΔN (CIDE-B-(148–219)) that showed mitochondria localization and high affinity interaction was still effective in inducing apoptosis (55%). CIDE-B with a deletion of the C-terminal 39 residues (CIDE-B-(118–180)), which neither localized to mitochondria nor dimerized with itself, showed no apoptotic activity (20%). Truncations of CIDE-B protein (CIDE-B-(118–148), -(148–180), and -(181–219)), which showed no mitochondria localization, all showed no activity in triggering apoptosis. CIDE-B deletions that showed mitochondria localization but had low affinity interaction (CIDE-B-(166–219), -(148–195), and -(166–195)) all demonstrated weak apoptotic activity slightly higher than the vector but significantly lower than that of CIDE-BΔN domain and CIDE-B-(148–219). The differences in cell death effect is not due to protein expression levels, as CIDE-B and its truncation mutants all showed a similar level of expression (Fig.4, inset). Our data thus suggest that the C-terminal domain of CIDE-B plays an important role for CIDE-B-induced apoptosis by directly targeting CIDE-B to mitochondria, mediating CIDE-B/CIDE-B interaction, and inducing apoptosis. It is very interesting to identify the 30 amino acids (from 166 to 195) at the C-terminal region of CIDE-B as both the mitochondria localization signal and the interaction interface. Single-point mutations at this region that abolish one of the activities would be useful in distinguishing these roles.

This process encompasses a series of highly regulated events, including cargo selection and vesicle budding at the donor membrane, followed by transport, docking, and fusion of the transport vesicle with the target organelle. We previously identified a cytosolic factor, GATE-16, which participates in intra-Golgi transport (3Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the yeast homologue of GATE-16, Aut7p, was recently shown to participate in autophagy (5Lang T. Schaeffeler E.

In this study, we have questioned whether Aut7p plays a role in constitutive protein transport, in addition to its involvement in autophagy.Vesicular transport between the ER1 and the Golgi apparatus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied. The first step in this process, vesicle budding, involves the assembly of the COPII coat, composed of the Sec13p·Sec31p complex (7Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N.

Docking of an ER-derived COPII vesicle with the cis-Golgi compartment takes place just after, or concurrently with, a tethering event mediated by Uso1p (14Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C.

This complex binds the yeast SNAP (Sec17p) and NSF (Sec18p), which in turn catalyze its disassembly (19Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhaousen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.

Like many membrane trafficking processes, it is mediated by a number of membrane and soluble factors, including Vam3p (a t-SNARE), Nyv1p (a v-SNARE), Ypt7p (a Rab protein), Sec17p, Sec18p, and a low molecular weight factor, LMA1 (24Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A.

Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Vacuolar homotypic fusion has been divided into the following three distinct subset reactions: priming, docking, and fusion. Priming of SNARE molecules for a new fusion event is mediated by Sec17p, Sec18p, and LMA1 (22Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 29Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on a cell-free system reconstituting vacuolar homotypic fusion, it appears that the formation of the SNARE complex is only an intermediate step in the overall fusion reaction (30Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Accordingly, SNARE molecules are involved in docking between donor and acceptor membranes, whereas another set of proteins participates in subsequent stages of the fusion process. This model for the course of events is supported by Peters and Mayer (31Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), who have suggested that calmodulin and other yet-unidentified factors are involved in mediating late stages of vacuolar fusion.The yeast vacuole takes in membrane-bound traffic through at least the following five different transport pathways: the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) pathway, the alkaline phosphatase I pathway, the endocytic pathway, autophagy, and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway (32Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these pathways has different cargo, transport intermediates, and genetic requirements. Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process by which cytoplasmic components, including organelles, become enclosed in double membrane structures (autophagosomes), which are then delivered to the vacuole for degradation (33Dunn W.A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that the autophagic process in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is similar to that of higher eukaryotes (34Baba M. Osumi M. Ohsumi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 36Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Autophagy in yeast may be dissected into the following series of subreactions: starvation signaling, formation of autophagosomes, targeting of autophagosomes to the vacuole, docking and fusion with the vacuolar membrane, and degradation of the autophagosome body within the vacuole (37Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 38Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Transport of autophagosomes to lysosomes or vacuoles should therefore be regarded as a membrane traffic process. The Cvt pathway is a constitutive biosynthetic process that shares many common transport components with autophagy (39Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 40Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Both Cvt and the autophagy pathways involve at least two membrane fusion events, which are dependent on Sec18p and on the vacuolar t-SNARE Vam3p; the latter acts as a multispecific receptor for heterotypic membrane docking and fusion reactions (24Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tlg2p, a member of the syntaxin family of t-SNARE proteins, and Vps45p, a Sec1p homologue, are reported to be required for the constitutive Cvt pathway (41Abeliovich H. Darsow T. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6005-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that Aut7p can largely replace GATE-16 activity in vitro, indicating that the two proteins share a similar, conserved function. Aut7p is a peripheral membrane protein localized predominantly on the Golgi complex and vacuolar membrane. It interacts genetically and physically with Bet1p, a v-SNARE involved in ER to Golgi protein transport. Aut7p also interacts physically with the vacuolar v-SNARE Nyv1p. We hypothesize that Aut7p participates in several transport steps by interacting with the docking and fusion machinery.DISCUSSIONAut7p, previously identified as an autophagic factor (5Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), is shown here to take part in multiple intracellular membrane trafficking processes. We have demonstrated that Aut7p specifically interacts with different v-SNARE molecules involved in ER to Golgi transport and in vacuolar fusion. Our findings imply that in addition to its involvement in transport to the vacuole, Aut7p also participates in membrane fusion events that take place in the early secretory pathway.That Aut7p is essential for autophagocytosis (5Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) is consistent with the notion that it participates in membrane traffic. Lang et al. (5Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) proposed that Aut7p and Aut2p are involved in the delivery of autophagosomes to the vacuole along microtubules. Kirisako et al. (6Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) suggested that Aut7p plays an important role in autophagosome formation. We propose that the formation of autophagosomes and/or their fusion with the vacuolar membrane are SNARE-dependent and that Aut7p is essential for the fusion process. The t-SNARE Vam3p, a protein known to participate along with other vacuolar protein sorting gene products in directing endosomes to vacuole transport, has also been shown to be involved in autophagy (24Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Vam3p interacts primarily with Nyv1p, the vacuolar v-SNARE involved in homotypic fusion (25Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). As we show here, Aut7p and Nyv1p form a complex, suggesting that Aut7p may play a role in the fusion between autophagosomes and vacuoles by interacting with the docking/fusion machinery. It was reported that Nyv1p is not involved in transport of AP1 to the vacuole; in contrast, Vti1p, a v-SNARE found in Golgi-derived vesicles and known to be involved in many transport events, is required for this transport step (52von Mollard G.F. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-17232Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, Tlg2p, a member of the syntaxin family of t-SNARE proteins, and Vps45p, a Sec1p homologue, are required in the constitutive Cvt pathway but not in inducible macroautophagy (41Abeliovich H. Darsow T. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6005-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that Aut7p may interact with an as yet unidentified related v-SNARE molecule that mediates fusion between autophagosomes and the vacuole. Defining the origin of the donor membrane required for the formation of autophagic vesicle, and isolation of these vesicles using Aut7p as a marker, will allow a better understanding of the roles of the various proteins involved in this pathway.It appears that Aut7p interacts with v-SNAREs and thereby affects their activity. Several regulatory proteins that interact with SNAREs have been reported. Sec1p in yeast and its homologues nSec1p, Munc18, and unc18 in higher eukaryotes have been shown to regulate exocytosis (53Aalto M.K. Ruohonen L. Hosono K. Keranen S.

Sec1p also inhibits the assembly of a v·t-SNARE complexin vitro and dissociates from syntaxin upon formation of the v·t-complex (54Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, experiments in vivoin Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans showed that overexpression of Sec1p homologues inhibits neurotransmitter release (62Harrison S.D. Broadie K. van de Goor J.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that these proteins act as negative regulators of fusion. Vsm1p, another factor that interacts with v-SNARE (Snc2p), was recently suggested to regulate Snc2p entry to the SNARE complex (64Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4480-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, LMA1, a low molecular weight heterodimer composed of thioredoxin and the protease B inhibitor IB2, originally identified as a protein required for in vitro vacuolar homotypic fusion (28Xu Z. Mayer A. Muller E. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 65Xu Z. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as well as for ER to Golgi transport (14Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 66Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was shown to interact with the vacuolar t-SNARE Vam3p in a Sec18p-dependent manner (67Xu Z. Sato K. Wickner W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Possibly, Aut7p acts on v-SNAREs in a similar manner to that by which LMA1 acts on the t-SNARE Vam3p.Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sec22p, three v-SNAREs, have been implicated in transport between the ER and the Golgi. It has been recently proposed that Bos1p participates exclusively in anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi; Sec22p is involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, whereas Bet1p acts in both directions (68Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We show here that Aut7p specifically interacts with Bet1p but not with Bos1p, suggesting that it is not involved in anterograde transport but rather in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER. This is supported by the suppression effect of AUT7on the retrograde mutant sec22–2. The viability of theaut7 null strain and the lack of a detectable transport defect in this strain suggest that Aut7p plays a regulatory role in this process or that other factors may substitute its function. Because under starvation conditions Aut7p is essential for autophagy, we speculate that Bet1p or Sec22p may participate in the formation of the autophagic membrane or that under starvation Aut7p interacts with other SNARE molecules mediating autophagy.We have recently found that GATE-16, the mammalian homologue of Aut7p, interacts specifically with a Golgi v-SNARE in an NSF- and SNAP-dependent manner (4Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism for the function of Aut7p in membrane traffic is uncertain, we propose that it may act as a positive regulator of v-SNAREs. The data presented in the present study support the notion that the function of Aut7p is closely related to the activity of SNAREs.Our findings are summarized by the model described in Fig.6. Accordingly, under normal growth conditions Aut7p functions in early steps of the secretory pathway by interacting with v-SNARE molecules such as Bet1p. This Aut7p activity can probably be replaced by other unidentified factor(s). Under constitutive steady-state conditions, Aut7p is essential for the Cvt pathway. Upon nitrogen starvation, Aut7p expression levels are significantly increased, and it becomes involved in autophagy. Based on the fact that Aut7p interacts with the vacuolar v-SNARE, Nyv1p, we propose that Aut7p may be involved in vacuolar fusion or that Nyv1p is involved in autophagy triggered upon nitrogen starvation. Further experiments are required to resolve this issue. Membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process that is essential for secretion of macromolecules, as well as for the maintenance of distinct subcellular compartments (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). This process encompasses a series of highly regulated events, including cargo selection and vesicle budding at the donor membrane, followed by transport, docking, and fusion of the transport vesicle with the target organelle. We previously identified a cytosolic factor, GATE-16, which participates in intra-Golgi transport (3Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the yeast homologue of GATE-16, Aut7p, was recently shown to participate in autophagy (5Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In this study, we have questioned whether Aut7p plays a role in constitutive protein transport, in addition to its involvement in autophagy. Vesicular transport between the ER1 and the Golgi apparatus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively studied. The first step in this process, vesicle budding, involves the assembly of the COPII coat, composed of the Sec13p·Sec31p complex (7Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N.

Docking of an ER-derived COPII vesicle with the cis-Golgi compartment takes place just after, or concurrently with, a tethering event mediated by Uso1p (14Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the yeast homologue of p115 (15Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been further suggested that docking involves the interaction of ER to Golgi v-SNAREs, Bet1p, Bos1p, Sec22p, and Ykt6p (17Newman A.P. Groesch M.E. Ferro-Novick S.

This complex binds the yeast SNAP (Sec17p) and NSF (Sec18p), which in turn catalyze its disassembly (19Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhaousen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.

Like many membrane trafficking processes, it is mediated by a number of membrane and soluble factors, including Vam3p (a t-SNARE), Nyv1p (a v-SNARE), Ypt7p (a Rab protein), Sec17p, Sec18p, and a low molecular weight factor, LMA1 (24Darsow T.

Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Vacuolar homotypic fusion has been divided into the following three distinct subset reactions: priming, docking, and fusion. Priming of SNARE molecules for a new fusion event is mediated by Sec17p, Sec18p, and LMA1 (22Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 29Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on a cell-free system reconstituting vacuolar homotypic fusion, it appears that the formation of the SNARE complex is only an intermediate step in the overall fusion reaction (30Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Accordingly, SNARE molecules are involved in docking between donor and acceptor membranes, whereas another set of proteins participates in subsequent stages of the fusion process. This model for the course of events is supported by Peters and Mayer (31Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), who have suggested that calmodulin and other yet-unidentified factors are involved in mediating late stages of vacuolar fusion. The yeast vacuole takes in membrane-bound traffic through at least the following five different transport pathways: the carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) pathway, the alkaline phosphatase I pa"

Such animals, naturally dependent on a diet of fresh blood, have evolved a variety of mechanisms that interfere with the coagulation process of the blood donor. Normally a nociceptive stress due to being bitten will lead to an inflammatory response with leukocyte accumulation. Leeches, for example, avoid this in their own intestines by releasing (1Salzet, M., Capron, A., and Stefano, G. B. (1999)Parasitol. Today, in press.Google Scholar) blood-degrading enzymes from leukocytes during the months used to digest the blood meal. Thus, the challenge for leeches while feeding is to block the victim's peripheral nociception, local inflammation, and coagulation (1Salzet, M., Capron, A., and Stefano, G. B. (1999)Parasitol.

One is related to the specific inhibitors of proteases that interfere with the activation of blood clotting processes. These include thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin (6Markwardt F.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Among the different anticoagulant molecules, hirudin was first described in 1884 by Haycraft (16Haycraft J.B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1884; 36: 478-487Crossref Google Scholar), who discovered it in salivary glands of the leech Hirudo medicinalis. In 1927, Shionoya (17Shionoya T. J. Exp. Med. 1927; 49: 19-26Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) investigated its involvement as a potent antithrombosis drug. Its definitive structure was determined in 1957 by Markwardt and Leberecht (18Markwardt F. Schafer G. Topfer H. Walsmann P. Pharmazie. 1967; 22: 239-241Google Scholar). Hirudin is a natural single-chain peptide of 65 residues with three intra-chain disulfide bridges and a sulfated tyrosine residue (19Markwardt F. Walsmann P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1967; 348: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Markwardt F. Walsmann P. Pharmazie. 1981; 36: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar, 21Walsmann P. Markwardt F. Thromb.

DNA ( N Y ). 1986; 5: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal part is globular and very tightly clustered because of the presence of the three disulfide bridges. By contrast, its C-terminal part is rather light, with numerous negatively charged amino acid residues. Over 100 years after its discovery, its cDNA was cloned, and the recombinant hirudin has been obtained in Escherichia coli (23Chang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22159-22166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (24Talbot M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1989; 15: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and recently Acremonium chrysogenum (24Talbot M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1989; 15: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The commercial development, pre-clinical evaluation, and introduction into clinical trials of the recombinant and analog forms of hirudin were achieved only 10 years ago (25Verstraete M. Zoldhelyi P. Drugs. 1995; 49: 856-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,26De Filippis V. Vindigni A. Altichieri L. Fontana A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9552-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Compared with heparin, hirudin is a strict thrombin inhibitor that does not need a co-factor for its activity. Hirudin makes an irreversible tight bond to thrombin. The complex formed by hirudin and thrombin is very close and extends to a large area around the active site (27Topol E.J. Fuster V. Harrington R.A. Califf R.M. Kleiman N.S. Kereiakes D.J. Cohen M. Chapekis A. Gold H.K. Tannenbaum M.A. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The last 10 amino acid residues of the C-terminal region (residues 55–65) react with the anionic site of thrombin, an important region for fibrinogen binding. Residues 1–48 of the N-terminal part are also important for the action of hirudin on thrombin (25Verstraete M. Zoldhelyi P. Drugs. 1995; 49: 856-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Beijering R.J.R. ten Cate H. ten Cate J.W. Ann. Hematol. 1996; 72: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), because they interact with the catalytic site. In this context, amino acid residues 46–48 are extremely important for the link between hirudin and thrombin. These types of interactions explain why hirudin only binds to thrombin and not to other serine proteases. Up to now, only two other less potent thrombin inhibitors, haemadin (7Strube K-H. Kröger B. Biolojan S. Otte M. Dodt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8590-8595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bufrudin (30Electricwala A. Sawyer R.T. Powell Jones C. Atkinson T. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 2: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), have been isolated, both from jawed leeches. Here we present a new highly potent thrombin inhibitor isolated from a gut leech, Theromyzon tessulatum. Starved T. tessulatum leeches were maintained in our laboratory as described elsewhere in detail (31Malecha J. Verger-Bocquet M. Leprêtre A. Tramu G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1989; 309: 127-130Google Scholar). Chromogenic substrates S-2765, S-2238, and S-2586 were purchased from Kabi Diagnostica. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)1-grade acetonitrile was obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. Trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce. Porcine pancreatic elastase (EC3.4.21.36), chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1), trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), cathepsin G (EC 3.4.21.20), thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5), and chromogenic substrates (benzoyl-arginine p-nitroanilide,N-succinyl Ala-Ala-Ala p-nitroanilide, andN-succinyl Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide) were obtained from Sigma. Molecular weight calibration markers for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of analytical grade. After anesthetizing the animals in 0.01% chloretone, the heads of T. tessulatum individuals were excised, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Four-gram aliquots were placed in 25 ml of Tris/NaCl buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.4) and homogenized at 4 °C with a polytron in Tris/NaCl buffer (five 15-s bursts on setting 9). After centrifugation (30 min at 12,000 × g on a Sigma 2K15 centrifuge at 4 °C), the pellet was extracted 6-fold with Tris/NaCl. Supernatants were combined and filtered on nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pore size, Millipore). The extract was applied onto a fast performance liquid chromatographic column (Superdex G75, 16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (equilibrated with Tris/NaCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and eluted with the same buffer. The column effluent was monitored by light absorbance at 280 nm. All column fractions (1 ml) were assayed for protease inhibitor activity against thrombin. Pooled active fractions were concentrated 20-fold in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant) before being loaded onto a Mono Q fast performance liquid chromatography column (HR 5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a discontinuous linear gradient of 0.2–1.5m NaCl for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing putative theromin were applied to a C8 Lichrosphere Rp100 column (125 × 4.6 mm, Merck) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile at 3.3%/min in water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions were then purified on the same column with a shallower gradient (1%/min). All HPLC purifications were performed with a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array detector (Beckman 168). To follow the theromin at each step of purification, chromogenic assays were performed. These were carried out at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates. The color developed from the hydrolysis of peptide-nitroanilide substrates was monitored at 405 nm on a Dynatec MR-250 microtiter reader. The concentration of thrombin was given by Bradford's procedure (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using γ globulin as standard and confirmed by amino acid analysis. Typically, the assay included 3 μm proteolytic enzyme in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.4), 0.2 m NaCl and an aliquot of selected column fractions in a total volume of 100 μl. After 15 min of incubation, the assay was started with the addition of the chromogenic substrate. The released nitroaniline was monitored photometrically at 405 nm for 3.5 min using a Dynatec MR-5000 photometer at room temperature. A control reaction, in the absence of theromin, was carried out under identical conditions. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 50% glacial acetic acid. One unit of protease inhibitory activity is defined as 1 μg of protease inhibited, and specific activity is defined as units/mg protease inhibited (33Goldstein A.M. Murer E.H. Weinbaum G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 84: 117-124Google Scholar). Purification was performed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic analysis of reduced and denatured proteins was performed in 10–25% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Before microsequencing the theromin, the purity of the peptide was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. Samples (2 nl) were injected under vacuum into a 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a fused silica capillary (length, 72 cm). Separation from anode to cathode was carried out in 20 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.5) with a voltage of 20 kV at 30 °C. Capillary effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 200 nm. Moreover, to perform Edman degradation, the peptide was reduced and alkylated. Ten microliters of inhibitor (50 pm) was dissolved in 40 μl of 0.5 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) and 2 mm EDTA containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, to which 2 μl of 2 m dithiothreitol were added in the dark. The sample was flushed with nitrogen and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. Freshly distilled 4-vinylpyridine (2 μl) was added and incubated for 10 min at 45 °C in the dark. The pyridylethylated peptide was separated by reverse-phase HPLC before microsequencing. Automated Edman degradation of both native and pyridylethylated peptides and detection of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were performed on a pulse-liquid automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems 473A). Enzymatic digestion allowed for complete sequence determination. An aliquot of theS-β-pyridylethylated theromin was treated with trypsin (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated, Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) at a ratio of 25% (w/w). The material was digested according to the manufacturer's directions (37 °C, 16 h). The reaction was stopped by acidification, and the peptide fragments were separated on an RP100 C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Merck) equilibrated with acidified water. Fractions were eluted with a linear gradient (0–80%) of acetonitrile in acidified water over 80 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Emerging peaks were freeze-dried (Speed-Vac, Savant) before sequencing. The mass of theromin was obtained by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). Aliquots of purified theromin (1 μl) were deposited on a thin water layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid crystals made by fast evaporation of a saturated solution in acetone. The droplet was allowed to dry under a gentle vacuum before introduction into the mass spectrometer. MALDI MS measurement was performed in a Bruker BIFLEXTM spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) operating in the positive linear mode. Ions were formed by a pulsed ultraviolet laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm). Mass spectra were obtained by averaging 50–100 laser shots. External mass calibration was provided by the [M + H]+ ion of angiotensin II (1047.20 Da), ACTH (18–39) (2466.73 Da), and bovine insulin (5734.56 Da) and/or by using matrix peaks [M + H]+ (190.05 Da) and [2M + H]+ (379.09 Da). To determine the specificity of theromin, its inhibitory activity toward different serine proteases was compared using established chromogenic assays. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i) for the complexes of theromin with individual proteases were determined essentially as described by Henderson (35Henderson P. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and as simplified by Bieth (36Bieth J.G. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1980; 16: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing amounts of theromin were incubated with a constant amount of protease in Tris/NaCl buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, and the remaining protease activity was measured by the addition of chromogenic substrate. The remaining protease activity was monitored by absorbance at 405 nm as described above. Graphical analysis yielded an apparent K i using the equation [I]/(1 − a) = K iapp(1/a) + [P], where [I] and [P] are the initial concentrations of inhibitor and protease, respectively, and a is the remaining fractional protease activity (100% control activity equals fractional activity of 1.0). This is the remaining fractional protease activity (100% control activity equals a fractional activity of 1.0) (37Pratt C.W. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2855-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were separated by a standard Ficoll-Hypaque method as described elsewhere in detail (40Magazine H.I. Liu Y. Bilfinger T.V. Fricchione G.L. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4845-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 41Chopin V. Bilfinger T.V. Stefano G.B. Matias I. Salzet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). They were washed three times in RPMI medium (RPMI, 25 mm Hepes, Grand Island Biological Co., New York, NY). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were obtained from Sigma. In this assay, immunocytes were analyzed for their ability to change shape in response to LPS. Both granulocytes and monocytes were diluted (406 ± 13 cells/100 μl) and exposed to LPS at a previously determined effective dose (1 unit/ml) on pre-coated (1% bovine serum albumin) glass slides. Changes in cell shape were monitored using computer-assisted microscopic image analysis (Image Analytics, Inc., Hauppauge, NY) over a 60-min period. After activation by LPS, the cells were co-incubated with aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, and tessulin (42Chopin V. Stefano G.B. Salzet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 662-668Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), therin (43Chopin V. Matias I. Stefano G.B. Salzet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or theromin. The analysis of immunocyte activation was determined as reported elsewhere (40Magazine H.I. Liu Y. Bilfinger T.V. Fricchione G.L. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4845-4850PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells with or without the various agents were analyzed using the computer-assisted microscopic image analysis. About 45–51 activated cells (amoeboid and exhibiting form factors below 0.5) were observed for each 400-μm viewing diameter, and four additional viewing diameters were observed for each slide to calculate a single mean value. The entire process was repeated three times, and the resulting mean of the mean (% immunocyte activation ± S.E.) was plotted against time. The variation for individual readings was between 5 and 9%. Human immunocytes were analyzed every 15 min following initial exposure to the various agents. Changes in cellular conformation ranging from inactive rounded to active amoeboid were determined by measurements of cellular area and perimeter and were expressed mathematically using the shape factor formula (4 × p × area/perimeter2). The proportion of activated cells was determined as described elsewhere (40Magazine H.I. Liu Y. Bilfinger T.V. Fricchione G.L. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4845-4850PubMed Google Scholar). Activated cells not only change their conformation in response to a pharmacological stimulus, but also become mobile and capable of phagocytosis and secrete various signaling molecules (40Magazine H.I. Liu Y. Bilfinger T.V. Fricchione G.L. Stefano G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4845-4850PubMed Google Scholar, 41Chopin V. Bilfinger T.V. Stefano G.B. Matias I. Salzet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using the Student'st test to compare controls with LPS-stimulated cells and those stimulated with LPS in the presence of tessulin, therin, theromin, and/or aprotinin. Each experimental sample was compared with its own control to reduce variability due to spontaneous activation. Proteins extracted from the head preparations of T. tessulatum displayed thrombin-inhibiting activities (Table I). A single zone exhibiting thrombin inhibition activity was detected at a retention time between 21 and 23 min after gel permeation chromatography (Fig.1 a). This corresponded to proteins with a molecular mass less than 20 kDa (Fig.2, lane b). This material was then purified by anion exchange chromatography as described above. The identified material eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of 0.38–0.4 m (Fig. 1 b). SDS-PAGE controls revealed several protein bands at a molecular mass of less than 20 kDa (Fig. 2, lane c). The peptide was finally purified by two successive reverse-phase HPLC procedures. Several peaks eluted from the column at retention times of 15–18 min, corresponding to 53.28–59.94% of acetonitrile in the first HPLC procedure (Fig.1 c). In the second HPLC procedure, a single peak exhibiting the activity was obtained at a retention time of 36.7 min, corresponding to 36.76% of acetonitrile (data not shown). After the final reverse-phase HPLC, the purity of the material was verified by capillary zone electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane d). A single band at a molecular mass of about 15 kDa was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, confirming its purity.Table IPurification of therominStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgIUIU/mg%-foldLeech extract400120031001Superdex G7540100025838Mono Q fast protein liquid chromotography1.74252503583Reverse phase HPLC20.0061051758295860Four grams of leech extract was used as the starting material.

Open table in a new tab S-β-pyridylethylated peptides generated by trypsin digestion were resolved by reverse phase HPLC and subjected to Edman degradation and MALDI-time of flight MS measurement. This inhibitor is composed of 67 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 7214.69 Da. By contrast, the molecular mass measured by MALDI MS of the native molecule had a mass of 14,491 Da, which is in agreement with that found by SDS-PAGE. However, after reduction andS-β-pyridylethylation of the molecule, the mass measured shifted to a lower value of 8911 Da (data not shown). This measured mass is in agreement with the monoisotopic molecular mass of theromin calculated from the amino acid sequence with 16 cysteines (7214.69 Da). Taken together, the data demonstrate that theromin is a homodimer of about 14.5 kDa. Sequence comparisons between theromin and all other known thrombin inhibitors like hirudin (2Nieto-Fernandez F.E. Mattoks D. Cavani F. Salzet M. Stefano G.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 123: 295-299Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and haemadin (6Markwardt F. Pharmazie. 1994; 49: 313-316PubMed Google Scholar) revealed no sequence homology, confirming that theromin is a novel thrombin inhibitor. Similarly, this molecule exhibits no significant sequence identity with leech inhibitors of the antistasin-type family, namely antistasin (3Stefano G.B. Salzet-Raveillon B. Salzet M. Brain Res. 1997; 753: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ghilanten (4Stefano G.B. Scharrer B. Smith E.M. Hughes T.K. Magazine H.I. Bilfinger T.V. Hartman A.R. Fricchione G.L. Liu Y.

Vieau D. Stefano G.B. Immunol. Today. 1999; 12: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we checked its specificity. Theromin, like hirudin, has no activity toward trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, cathepsin G, plasmin, or factor Xa (EC3.4.21.6). By contrast, under the same conditions as hirudin, theromin demonstrated activity on the S-2238 chromogenic substrate with approximately 17,500 inhibition units/mg of protein (Table I) and a K i value of 12 ± 5 fm. This value is higher than that obtained with hirudin (21 fm) (6Markwardt F. Pharmazie. 1994; 49: 313-316PubMed Google Scholar) and haemadin (100 fm) (7Strube K-H. Kröger B. Biolojan S. Otte M.

https://openalex.org/W2118442804,"Stimulation of T cells by antigens or mitogens triggers multiple signaling pathways leading to activation of genes encoding interleukin-2 and other growth-regulatory cytokines. The same stimuli also activate the gene encoding an apoptosis-inducing molecule, Fas ligand (FasL), which contributes to activation-induced cell death. It has been proposed that the signaling pathways involved in cytokine gene induction also contribute to activation-induced FasL expression; however, genetic evidence for this proposal is lacking. In the present study, the role of the NF-κB signaling pathway in FasL gene expression was examined using a mutant T cell line deficient in an essential NF-κB signaling component, IκB kinase γ. These mutant cells have a blockade in signal-induced activation of NF-κB but remained normal in the activation of NF-AT and AP-1 transcription factors. Interestingly, the NF-κB signaling defect has no effect on mitogen-stimulated FasL gene expression, although it completely blocks the interleukin-2 gene induction. We further demonstrate that NF-κB activation is required for protecting T cells from apoptosis induction by mitogens and an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. These genetic results suggest that the NF-κB signaling pathway is not required for activation-induced FasL expression but rather mediates cell growth and protection from activation-induced cell death.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). FasL specifically interacts with its cognate receptor, Fas, thereby triggering a cascade of proteolytic events resulting in the death of Fas-expressing cells (10Nagata S.

The importance of Fas-mediated apoptosis is evidenced by studies using the lpr andgld mice that harbor inactivating mutations in the Fas and FasL genes, respectively (12Watanabe-Fukunaga R.

These mice suffer a severe lymphoproliferative disorder and die shortly after birth because of an excessive accumulation of lymphocytes in addition to autoimmune diseases. In T cells and many other cell types, expression of FasL is subject to strict regulation whereas expression of Fas is largely constitutive (9Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S.

Therefore, a large effort has been made to the understanding of how the FasL gene is activated by T cell activation signals. Sequence analysis of the upstream region of FasL gene has revealed potential binding sites for a number of transcription factors known to participate in IL-2 gene regulation. These include the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) (16Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol.

Consistently, germ line inactivation of the NF-ATp gene in mice largely blocked FasL gene induction by TCR signals (24Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. de la Braousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H.

Promoter truncation studies reveal that removal of the promoter distal region of FasL gene, which contains the binding sites for AP-1 and NF-κB, has no effect on the inducibility of the FasL promoter (16Latinis K.M.

In contrast, other studies using promoter mutation and NF-κB overexpression approaches suggest that NF-κB plays a critical role in FasL promoter induction by T cell activation agents (20Kasibhatla S.

These latter findings suggest a proapoptotic role of NF-κB in AICD, as opposed to its well known antiapoptotic function in many other systems (28Van Antwerp D. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R.

However, genetic evidence for a role of NF-κB in the induction of either FasL gene expression or AICD is currently lacking. NF-κB represents a family of transcription factors that regulate a large variety of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses (35Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One of the well studied NF-κB target genes in T cells is IL-2 (36Hoyos B. Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E. Siekevitz M. Greene W.C. Science. 1989; 244: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which plays a critical role in the clonal expansion of antigen-stimulated T cells. In unstimulated T cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitors, including IκBα, IκBβ, and related proteins (37Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). T cell activation agents and inflammatory cytokines stimulate site-specific phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis of IκBs, which allows the released NF-κB to move to the nucleus and transactivate its target genes (38Verma I.M. Stevenon J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Recently, the protein kinase mediating signal-induced IκB phosphorylation has been identified and named IκB kinase (IKK) (39Karin M.

By somatic mutagenesis, we have isolated a T cell line that lacks IKKγ and is, therefore, completely defective in NF-κB signaling (52Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using this NF-κB-defective T cell line, we investigated the role of NF-κB in the FasL gene induction and activation-induced apoptosis. We show that the NF-κB signaling defect has no appreciable effect on mitogen-stimulated expression of FasL mRNA or activation of the FasL promoter. In sharp contrast, the NF-κB signaling defect is associated with a blockade of signal-induced IL-2 gene expression. We further show that activation of NF-κB is not required for AICD but rather confers protection of T cells from undergoing apoptosis. SVT35 is a Jurkat cell line stably transfected with a CD14 reporter gene driven by eight copies of κB enhancers (kindly provided by Dr. Brian Seed; Ref. 53Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). JM4.5.2 is a mutant form of SVT35 generated by somatic mutagenesis (52Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The JM4.5.2 cells lack expression of IKKγ and, therefore, are defective in NF-κB activation. JM4.5.2-IKKγ #8 and JM4.5.2-IKKγ #10 are stable cell lines created by retroviral-mediated gene transfer of IKKγ into JM4.5.2 cells. JM4.5.2-GFP is a control cell line created by infection of JM4.5.2 cells with a retroviral vector encoding the GFP. These Jurkat T cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg of streptomycin. The GFP- and IKKγ-expressing stable cell clones were periodically cultured for 2-week intervals in the RPMI medium containing 1.0 mg/ml G418 for selection of the transgene. Human 293 embryonic kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma and used at concentrations of 10 ng/ml and 1 μm, respectively. The monoclonal antibody for human CD28 (anti-CD28) was kindly provided by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and used at a 1:10,000 dilution. The anti-Fas antibody (CH11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-IκBα antiserum was described previously (54Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The anti-IKKγ antibody (F1–419) and the FITC-conjugated annexin V (annexin-FITC) were purchased from Santa Cruz, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The luciferase reporter driven by 1.2 kilobases of the human FasL gene promoter (FasL-Luc) was provided by Dr. Douglas R. Green (18Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar).

Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pCLXSN-GFP was created by subcloning jellyfish GFP to the pCLXSN vector. To generate pCLXSN-IKKγ, the human IKKγ cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Jurkat cells, fused with one copy of the hemaglutinin (HA) epitope tag, and inserted into the pCLXSN vector. Human 293 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish. The next day, cells were transfected using Fugene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg of the retroviral packaging plasmid pCL-Ampho together with 1 μg of either pCLXSN-IKKγ or pCLXSN-GFP. 48 h post-transfection, the viral supernatants were collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm polysulfone filter, and used to infect JM4.5.2 cells. Briefly, 1 × 106 JM4.5.2 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of viral supernatant in 8 μg/ml polybrene, placed in a 6-well plate, and spun in a microtiter rotor at 1800 rpm for 45 min at room temperature. 48 h post-infection, the infected cells were placed under limiting dilution in a 96-well dish and selected for stable transduction using 1 mg/ml G418. Individual JM4.5.2-IKKγ clones were identified by immunoblotting analysis of HA-IKKγ and NF-κB activation assays. JM4.5.2-GFP clones were identified by immuoblotting and microscopic assays for the presence of GFP. Approximately 2 × 106cells were treated with PMA and ionomycin or with PMA and anti-CD28 for the indicated time periods. After treatment, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.1% Igepal, 10 mm NaF, 50 μmZnCl2, 10 μm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell protein lysates (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Approximately 2.5 × 106 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter constructs using the DEAE-dextran protocol (96Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At 40 h post-transfection, the recipient cells were divided into three equal volumes that were either left untreated or treated for 8 h with PMA plus ionomycin or PMA plus ionomycin and anti-CD28. After treatment, cell extracts were isolated using a reporter lysis buffer (Promega) at about 200 μl/106 cells. Luciferase activity was detected by mixing 7 μl of extract with 20 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and measured in an FB12 luminometer (Zylux, Maryville, TN). The luciferase activity was normalized based on extract protein concentration. Fold induction was calculated by dividing the treated samples by the nontreated control for each reporter construct. SVT35 parental and derivative cell lines were either left untreated or treated for 2 h with the indicated inducers. Nuclear extracts were then prepared (58Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) and subjected to EMSA analysis (59Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were incubated with the following32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes: NF-κB, CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCTCCTT; NF-AT, GGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATA; AP-1, TAGTGATGAGTCAGCCG; and Oct1, TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC CTC TCC TT. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on native 4% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. SVT35 parental and derivative cell lines were treated as indicated and harvested for total RNA isolation using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). For RT-PCR analysis, 2.5 μg of RNA was used for first strand RT reaction using the Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the resulting cDNAs were subjected to 23 PCR cycles in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP using the following primers: FasL, forward, ATGCAGCAGCCCTTCAATTACC, and reverse, CCAGTAGTGCAGTAGCTCATC; IL-2, forward, ATGTACAGGATGCAACTCCTG, and reverse, CAAGTTAGTGTTGAGATGATGC; and GAPDH, forward, CTCATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC, and reverse, CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC. 5 μl of the amplified DNA samples were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide/1× TBE gel, dried, and exposed to autoradiogram. RNase protection assays (RPA) were performed using the RiboQuant Multi-probe RPA System (hAPO-3 template set, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed using a standard protocol. Briefly, 15 μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in Express Hyb Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and then hybridized for 18 h at 60 °C to 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Following standard washing steps, the membranes were subjected to autoradiography. Apoptosis was analyzed by annexin staining based on the translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer layer during the early stages of apoptosis (60Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded on a 24-well plate and treated for 24 h with the indicated T cell mitogens or 16 h with anti-Fas (100 ng/ml). Cells were then sedimented, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl) containing FITC-labeled annexin V (annexin V-FITC) and propidium iodide (PI; 50 μg/ml). Cells were incubated in this solution by shaking at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were then diluted in buffer and subjected immediately to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using a FACS Scan II flow cytometer. The early and late stage apoptotic cells are stained with annexin V and annexin V/PI, respectively, whereas the live cells are double negative. 2.5 × 106 cells were treated as indicated, and cell lysates were subjected to ELISA using a FasL ELISA kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stimulation of TCR with an agonistic anti-CD3 antibody triggers the protein kinase C and calcium signals (61Weiss A. Paul W.E. 3rd Ed. Fundamental Immunology. 13. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 467-504Google Scholar). These two signals can also be elicited by the mitogen PMA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, respectively (61Weiss A. Paul W.E. 3rd Ed. Fundamental Immunology. 13. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 467-504Google Scholar). In synergy with the CD28 costimulatory signal, the protein kinase C stimulator PMA potently activates NF-κB through enhanced phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitors IκBα and IκBβ (62Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By somatic mutagenesis, we have recently isolated a Jurkat T cell line, JM4.5.2, that is defective in PMA/CD28-mediated NF-κB activation (52Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G.-T. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera I. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1386-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of this cell line revealed that it lacked expression of the essential NF-κB signaling component IKKγ. As shown in Fig.1, IKKγ was readily detected by immunobloting in the parental Jurkat cells (SVT35, lane 1) but not in the JM4.5.2 cells (lane 2). To confirm that the lack of IKKγ contributed to the NF-κB signaling defect in the mutant cells, an expression vector encoding HA-tagged IKKγ (HA-IKKγ) was stably introduced to the JM4.5.2 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. As control, the JM4.5.2 cells were transduced with a GFP expression vector. The exogenous HA-IKKγ was readily detected in two individual IKKγ stable cell clones (JM4.5.2-IKKγ #8 and #10, lanes 4 and 5) but not in the GFP-transduced cell clone (JM4.5.2-GFP, lane 3). To examine the effect of exogenous IKKγ on NF-κB signaling, the different cell lines were stimulated with mitogens followed by analysis of the inducible degradation of IκBα and activation of NF-κB. As expected, IκBα was completely degraded when the parental SVT35 cells were stimulated with PMA together with anti-CD28 (Fig.2 A, lane 3). A similar result was obtained by cellular stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin (lane 2). However, these mitogenic stimuli failed to induce IκBα degradation in the mutant JM4.5.2 cells (lanes 4–6). More importantly, the defect in IκBα degradation was largely rescued in the mutant cell clones stably expressing exogenous IKKγ (lanes 10–15). This rescuing effect was specific because it was not detected in the JM4.5.2-GFP cells (lanes 7–9). Parallel EMSA revealed that the IκBα degradation was associated with activation of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (Fig.2 B). Thus, genetic reconstitution of the IKKγ gene in JM4.5.2 cells is sufficient to restore NF-κB signaling. We next determined whether the signaling defect observed in JM4.5.2 cells affected the activation of other transcription factors known to respond to T cell activation signals. These included NF-AT and AP-1, both known to be critical for cytokine gene induction upon T cell stimulation (3Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1054-1083Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Because NF-AT and AP-1 have also been implicated in FasL gene regulation, analysis of these parallel pathways in the IKKγ-deficient cells is important for assessing the role of NF-κB in activation-induced FasL expression. For these studies EMSA was performed to detect the DNA binding activity of NF-AT, AP-1, and NF-κB in the parental, mutant, and IKKγ-reconstituted mutant Jurkat cells (Fig.3 A). As expected, JM4.5.2 cells failed to show inducible NF-κB DNA binding activity, and this defect was rescued in the IKKγ-stable cell clones. In contrast to that seen with NF-κB, induction of n"

Further characterization indicated that the recombinant β3GalT-V enzyme expressed in Sf9 insect cells also utilized the glycolipid Lc3Cer as an efficient acceptor. Surprisingly, we also found that β3GalT-V catalyzes the transfer of Gal to the terminal GalNAc unit of the globoside Gb4, thereby synthesizing the glycolipid Gb5, also known as the stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3). The SSEA-3 synthase activity of β3GalT-V was confirmed in vivo by stable expression of the human β3GalT-V gene in F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells, as detected with the monoclonal antibody MC-631 by flow cytometry analysis and immunostaining of extracted glycolipids. The biological relation between SSEA-3 formation and β3GalT-V was further documented by showing that F9 cells treated with the differentiation-inducing agent retinoic acid induced the expression of both the SSEA-3 epitope and the endogenous mouse β3GalT-V gene.

In most cases, a single glycosyltransferase enables the transfer of one type of carbohydrate donor to one type of carbohydrate acceptor, although some exceptions have been reported. The lgtA glycosyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis represents such an exception, as it can transfer two donors, GlcNAc and GalNAc, to Gal-based acceptors (1Blixt O. van Die I.

During the course of our investigation, we have found that one member of this family, the β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3GalT)1-V enzyme that normally act on GlcNAc-based acceptors, can catalyze the transfer of galactose to GalNAc presented in the context of the Gb4 globoside structure. The resulting product, the Gb5 globoside, is also known as the stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-3 (11Kannagi R. Cochran N.A. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Andrews P.W. Knowles B.B. Solter D. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2355-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), which is found in the 4–8 cell stage mouse embryo as well as some adult tissues. We have established the SSEA-3 synthase activity of β3GalT-V both in vitro and in vivo in F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells as a model system.RESULTSDuring our investigation of the donor and acceptor substrate specificity of the β3GalT-V enzyme, we have found that this enzyme exhibited a preference for GlcNAc-based acceptors (10Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, when assaying glycolipid acceptors, the β3GalT-V enzyme showed activity toward the lacto-series glycolipid Lc3Cer and toward the globoside Gb4 (Fig. 1). The latter activity was surprising as the β3GalT-V enzyme displayed no activity toward the monosaccharide GalNAc(α/β-O-benzyl) acceptors (10Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, the Gb5 synthase activity of β3GalT-V did not require any modifier protein, since a FLAG-tagged soluble form of the β3GalT-V enzyme was capable of catalyzing the formation of Gb5 when affinity-purified on anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Fig. 2). By comparison, the β3GalT-I, -II, -III enzymes characterized previously (4Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol.

This cell line is known to express the Gb4 globoside but lacks the Gb5 synthase activity (16Krupnick J.G. Damjanov I. Damjanov A. Zhu Z.M. Fenderson B.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). F9 cells stably expressing the human β3GalT-V gene were first analyzed for the presence of the Gb5 product by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.3 A, F9 cells expressing the human β3GalT-V gene showed increased levels of the SSEA-3 epitope at their surface when compared with F9 cells transfected with a mock vector. For a comparison, the human teratocarcinoma cell line NCCIT showed a high level of SSEA-3 expression as reported earlier (16Krupnick J.G. Damjanov I. Damjanov A. Zhu Z.M. Fenderson B.A. Int. J.

Immunostaining of glycolipids extracted from β3GalT-V-transfected F9 cells also clearly indicated the synthesis of Gb5 structure in vivo (Fig. 3 B). The globo-series ganglioside GL7, also termed SSEA-4, was also detected in the upper Folch fraction of the glycolipid extract in the transfected cells by immunostaining with MC-631 antibody (data not shown), thus indicating that the Gb5 product was further sialylated in F9 cells.Figure 3SSEA-3 biosynthesis in F9 cells overexpressing β3GalT-V.

Treatment of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid is known to promote cell differentiation and to induce the expression of the SSEA-3 epitope (17Andrews P.W. Casper J. Damjanov I. Duggan-Keen M. Giwercman A. Hata J. von Keitz A. Looijenga L.H. Millan J.L. Oosterhuis J.W. Pera M. Sawada M. Schmoll H.J. Skakkebaek N.E. van Putten W. Stern P. Int. J.

To determine whether the increase in SSEA-3 levels is paralleled by the induction of β3GalT-V gene transcription, we first cloned and expressed the mouse β3GalT-V (GenBankTM accession number AF254738). The mouse protein is 308 amino acid long and shows 71% identity to the human β3GalT-V at the amino acid level. The mouse β3GalT-V enzyme exhibited a galactosyltransferase activity when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The presence of β3GalT-V mRNA in F9 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, F9 cells treated with retinoic acid for 10 days were positive for β3GalT-V transcript, whereas untreated F9 cells remained negative. As a comparison, human β3GalT-V mRNA was also detected in NCCIT cells, which constitutively express SSEA-3 at their surface (see Fig.3 A). This experiment demonstrated that the expression of the β3GalT-V gene correlates with the induction of the SSEA-3 epitope.Figure 4SSEA-3 and β3GalT-V induction in differentiating F9 cells.

Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This represents one of the few glycosyltransferases reported to date, which are capable of transferring a donor sugar molecule to different terminal monosaccharide acceptors. The best documented case is the β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I enzyme, which is able to use both GlcNAc and Glc as substrates (2Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 3Brodbeck U. Denton W.L. Tanahashi N. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas the β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I enzyme must interact with another modifier molecule, α-lactalbumin, to switch the substrate specificity from GlcNAc to Glc, the β3GalT-V enzyme does not require any additional modifier to switch from one acceptor substrate to the other.β3GalT-V is the first member of the recently cloned β3GalT family that utilizes Gb4 as an acceptor. While the tissue distribution pattern of the SSEA-3 epitope and its biochemical nature have been characterized for many years, a distinct β3GalT enzyme with SSEA-3 synthase activity has yet to be cloned. It remains unclear whether β3GalT-V is the only enzyme that can perform this rolein vivo. Also, it must be established whether the SSEA-3 synthase activities from human teratocarcinoma cells (18Chen C. Fenderson B.A. Andrews P.W. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and from mouse kidney (19Koul O. Prada-Maluf M. McCluer R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2227-2234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) represent orthologous proteins.The human and mouse β3GalT-V genes displayed differences in their tissue expression patterns. The human β3GalT-V gene was mainly expressed in small intestine, pancreas, and testis (10Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and mouse β3GalT-V transcripts were mainly detected in brain and kidney but not in testis (data not shown). Noteworthy, expression of SSEA-3 has been reported to be confined to the kidneys in adult mice (20Shevinsky L.H. Knowles B.B. Damjanov I. Solter D. Cell. 1982; 30: 697-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to relate the pattern of expression of the β3GalT-V gene with the distribution of SSEA-3 among tissues, since additional factors, such as the availability of the Gb4 acceptor, will also affect the presence or absence of the antigen on specific cell types.The parallel induction of SSEA-3 and β3GalT-V expressions in F9 cells treated with retinoic acid supports the concept of a direct relation between both events. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the existence of other β3GalT enzymes, which may participate to the formation of SSEA-3 in vivo. On the other hand, it is also possible that the SSEA-3 synthase activity indeed represents a second activity of the type-1 chain synthase β3GalT-V enzyme. In this case, the enzyme may function either way depending on the levels of the respective acceptor available in cells. The targeted inactivation of the mouse β3GalT-V gene will provide answers to this question and may represent a valuable model to address the biological functions associated to SSEA-3 during embryonic development. Glycosyltransferase enzymes mediate the synthesis of glycosylated structures by catalyzing the transfer of sugar units to various acceptor molecules utilizing nucleotide-activated sugars as donor substrates. In most cases, a single glycosyltransferase enables the transfer of one type of carbohydrate donor to one type of carbohydrate acceptor, although some exceptions have been reported. The lgtA glycosyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis represents such an exception, as it can transfer two donors, GlcNAc and GalNAc, to Gal-based acceptors (1Blixt O. van Die I. Norberg T. van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Another notable exception is represented by the β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I enzyme, which is able to change its acceptor substrate specificity from GlcNAc to Glc by interacting with α-lactalbumin (2Brew K.

For a comparison, the human teratocarcinoma cell line NCCIT showed a high level of SSEA-3 expression as reported earlier (16Krupnick J.G. Damjanov I. Damjanov A. Zhu Z.M. Fenderson B.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of glycolipids extracted from β3GalT-V-transfected F9 cells also clearly indicated the synthesis of Gb5 structure in vivo (Fig. 3 B). The globo-series ganglioside GL7, also termed SSEA-4, was also detected in the upper Folch fraction of the glycolipid extract in the transfected cells by immunostaining with MC-631 antibody (data not shown), thus indicating that the Gb5 product was further sialylated in F9 cells. The relation between β3GalT-V and the induction of SSEA-3 was further investigated in wild-type F9 cells. Treatment of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid is known to promote cell differentiation and to induce the expression of the SSEA-3 epitope (17Andrews P.W. Casper J. Damjanov I. Duggan-Keen M. Giwercman A. Hata J. von Keitz A. Looijenga L.H. Millan J.L. Oosterhuis J.W. Pera M. Sawada M. Schmoll H.J. Skakkebaek N.E. van Putten W. Stern P. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). To determine whether the increase in SSEA-3 levels is paralleled by the induction of β3GalT-V gene transcription, we first cloned and expressed the mouse β3GalT-V (GenBankTM accession number AF254738). The mouse protein is 308 amino acid long and shows 71% identity to the human β3GalT-V at the amino acid level. The mouse β3GalT-V enzyme exhibited a galactosyltransferase activity when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The presence of β3GalT-V mRNA in F9 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, F9 cells treated with retinoic acid for 10 days were positive for β3GalT-V transcript, whereas untreated F9 cells remained negative. As a comparison, human β3GalT-V mRNA was also detected in NCCIT cells, which constitutively express SSEA-3 at their surface (see Fig.3 A). This experiment demonstrated that the expression of the β3GalT-V gene correlates with the induction of the SSEA-3 epitope. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we report a dual acceptor specificity for the β3GalT-V enzyme by establishing its ability to transfer Gal to the terminal GalNAc residue of Gb4 in addition to its activity toward GlcNAc-based acceptors (9Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol.

This represents one of the few glycosyltransferases reported to date, which are capable of transferring a donor sugar molecule to different terminal monosaccharide acceptors. The best documented case is the β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I enzyme, which is able to use both GlcNAc and Glc as substrates (2Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 3Brodbeck U. Denton W.L. Tanahashi N. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas the β1,4-galactosyltransferase-I enzyme must interact with another modifier molecule, α-lactalbumin, to switch the substrate specificity from GlcNAc to Glc, the β3GalT-V enzyme does not require any additional modifier to switch from one acceptor substrate to the other.β3GalT-V is the first member of the recently cloned β3GalT family that utilizes Gb4 as an acceptor. While the tissue distribution pattern of the SSEA-3 epitope and its biochemical nature have been characterized for many years, a distinct β3GalT enzyme with SSEA-3 synthase activity has yet to be cloned. It remains unclear whether β3GalT-V is the only enzyme that can perform this rolein vivo. Also, it must be established whether the SSEA-3 synthase activities from human teratocarcinoma cells (18Chen C. Fenderson B.A. Andrews P.W. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and from mouse kidney (19Koul O. Prada-Maluf M. McCluer R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2227-2234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) represent orthologous proteins.The human and mouse β3GalT-V genes displayed differences in their tissue expression patterns. The human β3GalT-V gene was mainly expressed in small intestine, pancreas, and testis (10Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and mouse β3GalT-V transcripts were mainly detected in brain and kidney but not in testis (data not shown). Noteworthy, expression of SSEA-3 has been reported to be confined to the kidneys in adult mice (20Shevinsky L.H. Knowles B.B. Damjanov I. Solter D. Cell. 1982; 30: 697-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to relate the pattern of expression of the β3GalT-V gene with the distribution of SSEA-3 among tissues, since additional factors, such as the availability of the Gb4 acceptor, will also affect the presence or absence of the antigen on specific cell types.The parallel induction of SSEA-3 and β3GalT-V expressions in F9 cells treated with retinoic acid supports the concept of a direct relation between both events. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the existence of other β3GalT enzymes, which may participate to the formation of SSEA-3 in vivo. On the other hand, it is also possible that the SSEA-3 synthase activity indeed represents a second activity of the type-1 chain synthase β3GalT-V enzyme. In this case, the enzyme may function either way depending on the levels of the respective acceptor available in cells. The targeted inactivation of the mouse β3GalT-V gene will provide answers to this question and may represent a valuable model to address the biological functions associated to SSEA-3 during embryonic development.

Although both αEβ7 and α4β7utilize the β7 chain, they have distinct binding specificities for E-cadherin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), respectively. We found that mutation of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the αE A-domain (D190A) abolished E-cadherin binding, as did mutation F298A on the A-domain surface near the MIDAS cleft. A docking model of the A-domain with E-cadherin domain 1 indicates that coordination of the αE MIDAS metal ion by E-cadherin Glu31 and a novel projection of Phe298 into a hydrophobic pocket on E-cadherin provide the basis for the interaction. The location of the binding site on the αE A-domain resembles that on other integrins, but its structure appears distinctive and particularly adapted to recognize the tip of E-cadherin, a unique integrin ligand. Additionally, mutation of the β7 MIDAS motif (D140A) abolished αEβ7 binding to E-cadherin and α4β7-mediated adhesion to MAdCAM-1, and α4 chain mutations that abrogated binding of α4β1 to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin similarly reduced α4β7interaction with MAdCAM-1. Thus, although specificity can be determined by the integrin α or β chain, common structural features of both subunits are required for recognition of dissimilar ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2021780753,"Rab GTPases play an important regulatory role in early endocytosis. We recently demonstrated that epitope-tagged Rab15 (HArab15) co-localizes with Rab4, -5, and -11 on early endosomal membranes in CHO cells (Zuk, P. A., and Elferink, L. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 22303-22312). To characterize the role of Rab15 in endocytosis, we prepared functional mutants of HArab15 and examined their effects on early endocytic trafficking. Wild-type HArab15 and its constitutively active, GTP-bound mutant (Q67L) reduce fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis without affecting the rate of recycling from early endosomal compartments. Inhibition of early endocytosis appears to be due to a reduction in the rate of homotypic early endosome fusion. Conversely, mutations that constitutively inactivate HArab15 stimulate early endocytosis and the homotypic fusion of early endosomes in vitro. Unlike active forms of HArab15, constitutively inactive HArab15 mutants also affect recycling from early endosomal compartments. Moreover, the two constitutively inactive mutants, GDP-bound HArab15-T22N and the non-nucleotide binding mutant HArab15-N121I, differentially regulate the transit of fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytic tracers through early/sorting endosomes. Together, these data suggest that HArab15 may counteract the reported stimulatory effect of Rab5 on early endocytosis. Consistent with this, overexpression of constitutively active HArab15-Q67L attenuates Rab5-stimulated endocytosis, whereas Rab5-stimulated endocytosis is augmented in cells overexpressing a constitutively inactive HArab15 mutant defective in guanine nucleotide binding (N121I). Our data indicate that HArab15 differentially regulates distinct steps in membrane trafficking through early/sorting and pericentriolar recycling endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1578229516,"Abstract The N-terminal fragment 1–34 of parathyroid hormone (PTH), administered intermittently, results in increased bone formation in patients with osteoporosis. PTH and a related molecule, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), act on cells via a common PTH/PTHrP receptor. To define more precisely the ligand-receptor interactions, we have crystallized human PTH (hPTH)-(1–34) and determined the structure to 0.9-A resolution. hPTH-(1–34) crystallizes as a slightly bent, long helical dimer. Analysis reveals that the extended helical conformation of hPTH-(1–34) is the likely bioactive conformation. We have developed molecular models for the interaction of hPTH-(1–34) and hPTHrP-(1–34) with the PTH/PTHrP receptor. A receptor binding pocket for the N terminus of hPTH-(1–34) and a hydrophobic interface with the receptor for the C terminus of hPTH-(1–34) are proposed."

The structural features of apoB100 that are required for its noncovalent interaction with apo(a) have not been fully defined. To analyze that initial interaction, we tested whether apo(a) could bind noncovalently to two apoB proteins that lack cysteine 4326: mouse apoB100 and human apoB100-C4326G. Our experiments demonstrated that both mouse apoB and the human apoB100-C4326G bind noncovalently to apo(a). We next sought to gain insights into the apoB amino acid sequences required for the interaction between apoB100 and apo(a). Previous studies of truncated human apoB proteins indicated that the carboxyl terminus of human apoB100 (amino acids 4330–4397) is important for Lp(a) assembly. To determine whether the carboxyl terminus of mouse apoB100 can interact with apo(a), transgenic mice were produced with a mutant human apoB gene construct in which human apoB100 amino acids 4279–4536 were replaced with the corresponding mouse apoB100 sequences and tyrosine 4326 was changed to a cysteine. The mutant apoB100 bound to apo(a) and formed bona fide disulfide-linked Lp(a), but Lp(a) assembly was less efficient than with wild-type human apoB100. The fact that Lp(a) assembly was less efficient with the mouse apoB sequences provides additional support for the notion that sequences in the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 are important for Lp(a) assembly.

Lp(a) is found only in a relatively small group of mammals that synthesize apo(a), notably humans, old-world monkeys, and the hedgehog (3Makino K. Abe A. Maeda S. Noma A. Kawade M. Takenaka O.

In addition, many mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, and pig) synthesize an apoB100 molecule that cannot form a disulfide linkage with human apo(a) (6Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The development and analysis of human apo(a) transgenic mice illustrated the latter point (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse apoB100 in the plasma of apo(a) transgenic mice did not form a covalent linkage with apo(a), and biochemical assays suggested that the apo(a) circulated free of the apoB-containing lipoproteins in the plasma (7Chiesa G.

During the past 5 years, we have sought to define the structural features of apoB100 that are important for Lp(a) assembly. In 1995, we produced human apoB transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of human apoB in which cysteine-4326 was replaced by a glycine (human apoB100-C4326G) (8McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mutant human apoB could not form Lp(a) inin vitro assays of Lp(a) assembly or in vivo in the plasma of transgenic mice, establishing that cysteine 4326 was crucial for the disulfide linkage with apo(a). Callow and collaborators (9Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) made similar observations. Of note, cysteine 4326 is not present in the apoB100 of mouse, rat, or pig (8McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which likely explains why LDL from those species do not form a disulfide linkage with human apo(a). The identification of human apoB cysteine 4326 as the critical residue for Lp(a) formation represented a significant advance in understanding Lp(a) assembly. However, it seemed obvious that the association of apoB with apo(a) must rely on more than a single free cysteine. A two-step model for Lp(a) assembly has been proposed (10Brunner C. Kraft H.-G. Utermann G. Muller H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) whereby certain domains within the apoB molecule initially associate with apo(a) in a noncovalent fashion, bringing the molecules into close approximation so that the disulfide bond can form. The nature of the initial noncovalent interaction between apoB and apo(a) and the structural features of apoB that are involved in that interaction are incompletely understood. However, several clues exist. First, lysine residues within apoB are likely to be important for the association with apo(a). Lysine analogues such as ε-aminocaproic acid block the binding of apoB to apo(a) (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the deletion of lysine-binding domains from apo(a) interferes with the assembly of Lp(a) (12Ernst A. Helmhold M.

Hammer R.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23616-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have suggested that amino acid residues 4330–4397 are important for the interaction of apoB with apo(a). In these studies, two truncated human apoB proteins (apoB95 and apoB97) were tested for their ability to interact with apo(a) and form Lp(a). ApoB95 (4330 amino acids) bound to apo(a) very slowly and inefficiently, whereas apoB97 (4397 amino acids) bound to apo(a) almost as well as the full-length apoB100. Interestingly, the region spanning amino acids 4330 to 4397 contains multiple lysines, including a cluster of four lysines between residues 4372 and 4392. Some of the sequences downstream from cysteine 4326 are highly conserved between human and mouse apoB (15McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Cham C.M. Taylor S. Marcovina S.M. Segrest J.P. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23616-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). If these sequences were important for the initial interaction of apoB with apo(a), one might predict that apoB proteins lacking cysteine 4326 (e.g., mouse apoB) would retain the ability to bind noncovalentlyto apo(a), despite being unable to form bona fide Lp(a). The possibility that nonhuman LDLs might conceivably bind to apo(a) was raised by the work of Trieu and McConathy (6Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), who reported that fully assembled human Lp(a) was capable of binding to several nonhuman LDLs. The current study was designed to further characterize the noncovalent interaction between apoB100 and apo(a). Our first goal was to document the existence of a noncovalent association between apo(a) and apoB by analyzing the capacity of apo(a) to stably associate with two apoBs that lack cysteine-4326: mouse apoB100 and human apoB100-C4326G. A second goal was to test whether the carboxyl-terminal sequences of mouse apoB100 would support the formation of bona fide,disulfide-linked Lp(a) if the mouse apoB100 sequences were supplied with a cysteine at residue 4326. Human apo(a) transgenic mice (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol.

They were housed in a barrier facility and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Lipoproteins in the plasma (200 μl) of apo(a) transgenic mice and human apoB100-C4326G/apo(a) transgenic mice were size-fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (16Linton M.F.

Antibody binding was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FPLC fractionation studies were also used to assess the distribution of apo(a), mouse apoB, and human apoB within the plasma of human apoB100-C4326G/apo(a) transgenic mice.

In parallel, FPLC was used to determine the distribution of free apo(a) in the d > 1.21 g/ml fraction of apo(a)/apoB100-C4326G transgenic mouse plasma. As a control, we assessed the elution profile of ferritin, a plasma protein with a molecular mass (440 kDa) similar to that of the apo(a) isoform expressed in the apo(a) transgenic mice (7Chiesa G.

We assessed the capacity of mouse apoB100 and human apoB100-C4326G to inhibit the formation of a disulfide bond between wild-type human apoB100 and apo(a).

The apolipoprotein content of the sample was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad).

Aliquots from these mixtures were size-fractionated on SDS-4% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by Western blotting with the apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibody IgG-a5 (19Marcovina S.M. Albers J.J. Gabel B. Koschinsky M.L. Gaur V.P. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. We previously reported a “pop-in, pop-out” gene-targeting system for introducing mutations into a 100-kilobase (kb) yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) spanning the human apoB gene (8McCormick S.P.A.

Using that system, we generated a human apoB gene construct in which the sequences encoding human apoB100 amino acids 4279–4536 were replaced with the corresponding mouse apoB sequences. The human/mouse hybrid gene-targeting vector was constructed with the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure (23Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). An 0.6-kb PCR fragment from exon 29 of the human apoB gene (encoding human apoB100 amino acids 4078–4278) was amplified with a human apoB exon 29 primer, HM1 (5′-GAGAAGAAATCTAGAGAACAATGCTG-3′; XbaI site is underlined) and a human/mouse hybrid primer, HM2 (5′-cttctatgatgtctaaaacGAATTGTAAAAGATCTTGAAGATTACG-3′). The mouse sequence in HM2 is shown in lowercase, and a BglII site (to facilitate the formation of the human/mouse hybrid) is underlined. A 1.0-kb PCR fragment from mouse exon 29 (encoding mouse apoB amino acids 4279–4536) was amplified with HM3 (5′-CGTAATCTTCAAGATCTTTTACAATTCgttttagacatcatagaag-3′; mouse sequence lowercase, BglII site underlined) and a mouse-specific exon 29 primer, HM4 (5′-CAAATAATCCTATCTAGATATTATCCC-3′; XbaI site underlined). The two PCR products were annealed, and a 1.6-kb chimeric human/mouse hybrid fragment was amplified with HM1 and HM4. That fragment was cleaved with XbaI and cloned into the polylinker XbaI site of pRS406 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Next, site-directed mutagenesis with the oligonucleotide 5′-AAGAGAAGACGCATGCTTTGTCCTCGGTGAG-3′ was used to change tyrosine 4326 in the mouse sequence to cysteine and to create a newSphI site (underlined). Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human/mouse hybrid gene-targeting vector was linearized at the unique EcoRI site in exon 29 and introduced into yeast spheroplasts containing a YAC spanning the human apoB gene (8McCormick S.P.A.

Transformants were selected on plates containing uracil and later on plates lacking uracil, tryptophan, and lysine. To confirm that the gene targeting was successful, a 304-base pair fragment from exon 29 of the mouse apoB gene was amplified with the mouse apoB-specific primers M1 (5′-CCTAAAGGACAATGAATC-3′) and M2 (5′-GACATCCCTAAAGGAAAC-3′), and the PCR product was digested withSphI. The human/mouse hybrid YAC DNA fragment was purified from a pulsed-field agarose gel (24Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl.

In addition, Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to detect the human/mouse hybrid apoB100.

Briefly, plasma from a human apo(a) transgenic mouse (1.5 μl) was mixed with plasma (2.0 μl) from a transgenic mouse expressing wild-type human apoB100 (16Linton M.F. Farese R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S.

The mixtures were then brought to a total volume of 20 μl with 0.15 m NaCl and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Samples were size-fractionated on an SDS-4% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions, and a Western blot was performed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG-a5. In separate experiments, we compared the time course of Lp(a) formation with wild-type human apoB100, human apoB95, and the human/mouse hybrid apoB100. In these experiments, the total volume of the incubations was 40 μl, including 3 μl of human apo(a) transgenic mouse plasma and variable amounts (3.0–9.0 μl) of human apoB transgenic mouse plasma. Each incubation mixture contained exactly the same amount of human apoB or human/mouse hybrid apoB, as judged by a monoclonal antibody-based radioimmunoassay and Western blot analyses. In the time course experiments, 5.0-μl aliquots of the incubation mixtures were removed after 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and added to 1% SDS nonreducing sample buffer. These samples were immediately heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then stored at −20 °C and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with antibody IgG-a5. The human/mouse hybrid apoB100 transgenic mice were bred with human apo(a) transgenic mice. Offspring that expressed the human/mouse hybrid apoB100 transgene only, the apo(a) transgene only, or both transgenes were identified with Western blots. To assess the amount of apo(a) covalently linked to the human/mouse hybrid apoB, plasma samples were size-fractionated on an SDS-4% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions, and a Western blot was performed with IgG-a5. To test whether apo(a) in the plasma of apo(a) transgenic mice is associated with apoB, we examined the distribution of apo(a) in the different lipoprotein fractions with gel filtration chromatography. The fractionation was successful, as judged by the characteristic distribution of cholesterol in the very low density lipoprotein-sized, LDL, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions (Figs.1 A and B). As expected, most of the mouse apoB in the apo(a) transgenic mouse plasma was in the LDL (Fig. 1 D). Of note, a large fraction of the apo(a) was also located in the LDL fractions, with some trailing into the HDL fractions. This finding strongly suggested that a significant fraction of the apo(a) in the plasma was associated with the mouse apoB-containing lipoproteins. To exclude the possibility that free apo(a) and LDL particles normally elute into the same fractions despite large differences in molecular weights, we performed FPLC-fractionation experiments with free apo(a). Free apo(a) was prepared from the plasma of human apo(a)/apoB100-C4326G transgenic mice by density ultracentrifugation. Density ultracentrifugation disrupts the noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB100-C4326G, releasing apo(a), which can be recovered in the lipoprotein-depleted plasma (i.e. d > 1.21 g/ml fraction). In contrast to the results with whole plasma, the apo(a) in the d > 1.21 g/ml fraction (Fig.1 C) eluted almost exclusively into the HDL fractions (i.e. HDL particles and free apo(a) have a similar size, ∼500 kDa). Control experiments revealed that ferritin, a protein with a similar molecular mass, also eluted in the HDL fractions (data not shown). Thus, the presence of apo(a) in the LDL fraction of mouse plasma indicates that apo(a) must be associated with the apoB-containing lipoproteins. Fractionation of the lipoproteins in the plasma of the apo(a)/human apoB100-C4326G transgenic mice (Fig.1 E) showed that human apoB100, mouse apoB100, and apo(a) were located almost exclusively in the LDL fractions, again indicating that the apo(a) was associated with the apoB-containing lipoproteins. To further document a noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and mouse apoB, we compared the abilities of mouse apoB and human apoB100-C4326G to compete with wild-type human apoB100 for binding to apo(a) (Fig.2). Increasing amounts of either human apoB100-C4326G (Fig. 2 A) or mouse apoB (Fig. 2 B) were incubated with fixed amounts of apo(a) and wild-type human apoB100. Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that when apo(a) and wild-type human apoB were incubated together, all of the apo(a) became covalently linked to the human apoB to form Lp(a). Thisin vitro assembly of Lp(a) was inhibited by both human apoB100-C4326G and mouse apoB as indicated by the appearance of free apo(a) in the incubations containing 0.25 μg of human apoB100-C4326G or 0.25 μg of mouse apoB. Moreover, Lp(a) formation was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5 μg of either apoB. These data suggest that the noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and mouse apoB (or human apoB100-C4326G) prevents the initialnoncovalent interaction between apo(a) and wild-type human apoB100 and thereby prevents the subsequent formation of the disulfide bond. These results also indicate that mouse apoB and human apoB100-C4326G are approximately equal in their ability to inhibit Lp(a) formation. To test whether the carboxyl terminus of mouse apoB can interact with apo(a) and contribute to Lp(a) formation, we produced transgenic mice that expressed a human/mouse hybrid apoB100 construct in which amino acids 1–4278 were specified by human apoB sequences and amino acids 4279–4536 by mouse apoB sequences (Fig. 3 A). In addition, tyrosine 4326 in the mouse apoB sequence was changed to cysteine. To achieve this goal, we constructed a gene-targeting vector designed to introduce mouse apoB sequences into the human apoB gene of a 108-kb YAC (Fig. 3 B). Successful gene-targeting events were confirmed by pulsed-field gel and PCR analysis. YAC DNA was purified from pulsed-field gels and microinjected into F2 C57BL/6 × SJL fertilized mouse eggs, generating three founders. The human/mouse hybrid apoB100 was identical in size to wild-type human apoB100 (Fig. 4 A). As expected, human apoB-specific monoclonal antibodies with epitopes in the extreme carboxyl terminus of human apoB100 (antibodies BSol2, 605, and BSol22) did not bind to the human/mouse hybrid apoB100 (Fig. 4,B–D). To assess whether lipoproteins containing the human/mouse hybrid apoB100 could bind apo(a) and form Lp(a), we used an in vitro assay of Lp(a) formation. Plasma from a human/mouse hybrid apoB100 transgenic mouse was incubated with the plasma from an apo(a) transgenic mouse, and Lp(a) formation was assessed by Western blot analysis. The human/mouse hybrid apoB100 formed Lp(a) (Fig.5), but the amount was less than that formed in a control incubation containing wild-type human apoB100. As expected, human apoB100-C4326G did not form Lp(a). To compare the efficiency of Lp(a) formation with wild-type human apoB100 and the human/mouse hybrid apoB100, we assessed the time course of Lp(a) assembly with the in vitro Lp(a) assembly assay (Fig. 6). In incubations containing wild-type human apoB100, most of the apo(a) was covalently bound to the apoB at 10 min, and Lp(a) assembly was complete by 30 min. In contrast, when an equal amount of the human/mouse hybrid apoB100 was included in the incubation, very little Lp(a) formation could even be detected until 60 min, with the amount of Lp(a) gradually increasing at 120 and 240 min. A similar result was obtained with the human apoB95. Once again, no Lp(a) was detected with human apoB100-C4326G. To further assess the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly with the human/mouse hybrid apoB100, we assessed the amount of Lp(a) in the plasma of transgenic mice expressing both the human/mouse hybrid apoB100 and apo(a) (Fig. 7). Significant amounts of Lp(a) were found in the plasma of these mice, again showing that the hybrid apoB100 could form Lp(a). However, small amounts of free apo(a) were also detectable in the plasma. The assembly of Lp(a) is postulated to be two-step process, the first step being the noncovalent association between apo(a) and apoB100, and the second step being the formation of a disulfide bond between apo(a) cysteine 4057 and apoB100 cysteine 4326 (8McCormick S.P.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One of the goals of the current study was to provide experimental evidence for the initial noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB100. ApoB100-C4326G and mouse apoB100 are ideal vehicles for studying the noncovalent interaction because both lack cysteine 4326 and thus cannot form the disulfide linkage. Our experiments have provided two lines of evidence for a noncovalent interaction between apoB and apo(a). First, size fractionation of the plasma lipoproteins from apo(a) transgenic mice revealed that the most of the apo(a) was in the same fractions that contained LDL. When FPLC fractionation experiments were performed with the plasma of apoB100-C4326G/apo(a) transgenic mice, this finding was even more striking, probably reflecting the higher plasma levels of apoB in those animals. Second, by virtue of their ability to bind to apo(a), both purified mouse LDL and apoB100-C4326G LDL were competitive inhibitors of disulfide bond formation between wild-type human apoB100 and apo(a). Together, these results provide experimental evidence for the existence of the initial noncovalent step of Lp(a) assembly. Our studies challenge a widely held view, that the apo(a) in the plasma of apo(a) transgenic mice is not associated with the lipoproteins. The notion that apo(a) is “free” in the plasma of the apo(a) transgenic mice originated with the initial characterization of those animals (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been bolstered further by subsequent studies (8McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This conclusion stemmed from two types of experiments. First, when the plasma of apo(a) transgenic mice is subjected to ultracentrifugation in high concentrations of salt, none of the apo(a) floats with the lipoproteins (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of SDS, none of the apo(a) migrates with mouse apoB100 (7Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It appears that density ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis effectively strip apo(a) from the apoB-containing lipoproteins and therefore cannot detect a noncovalent association between apo(a) and apoB100. Milder techniques, such as the FPLC fractionation studies used in this study, preserve the noncovalent association. The existence of a strong noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and mouse apoB helps to make sense of several earlier observations. Lawn and co-workers (28Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) noted the co-localization of apo(a) and mouse apoB in atherosclerotic lesions in apo(a) transgenic mice. This co-localization likely reflects the retention of apo(a)-apoB complexes within the arterial wall. Also, Hobbs and colleagues (29Mancini F.P. Mooser V. Murata J. Newland D. Hammer R.E. Sanan D.A. Hobbs H.H. Woodford F.P. Davignon J. Sniderman A. Atherosclerosis X. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1995: 884-887Google Scholar) reported that the plasma levels of apo(a) in human apo(a) transgenic mice were doubled by LDL receptor deficiency, suggesting that a defect in the removal of apoB100-containing lipoproteins also affected the removal of apo(a). This linkage of apo(a) and apoB100 metabolism is quite consistent with our demonstration that apo(a) and apoB100 exist as a complex in the plasma. Our findings may also make sense of the observation that mouse LDL can bind human Lp(a) (6Trieu V.N. McConathy W.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although it remains somewhat unclear whether the association of mouse LDL and Lp(a) is identical to that of mouse LDL and apo(a). Another aim of our study was to further elucidate the apoB sequences important for the noncovalent binding to apo(a). Our finding that apo(a) binds noncovalently to mouse apoB100, together with our previous work (15McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Cham C.M. Taylor S. Marcovina S.M. Segrest J.P. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23616-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) implicating the carboxyl terminus of human apoB in apo(a) binding, naturally evoked a simple question: would the carboxyl terminus of mouse apoB100 support the formation ofbona fide disulfide-linked Lp(a) if the critical cysteine were inserted into the mouse apoB sequences? To address that issue, we used gene targeting to insert the carboxyl terminus of mouse apoB, along with cysteine 4326, into a full-length human apoB YAC clone and then used the YAC DNA to produce transgenic mice expressing the hybrid human/mouse apoB100. The in vitro experiments revealed that the hybrid apoB100 was quite capable of forming Lp(a) but with significantly reduced efficiency. The in vivo experiments yielded consistent results. Transgenic mice expressing both apo(a) and the human/mouse hybrid apoB contained small amounts of free apo(a) in their plasma. Previously, we showed that in transgenic mice expressing both apo(a) and wild-type human apoB100, all of the apo(a) was covalently linked to apoB100 and none was free (16Linton M.F. Farese R.V.

The lower efficiency of Lp(a) assembly with the mouse apoB carboxyl terminus than with the human apoB carboxyl terminus suggests that subtle changes in the apoB sequence or conformation in this region affects the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly. Previously we reported that human apoB97 but not apoB95 formed Lp(a) efficiently (15McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Cham C.M. Taylor S. Marcovina S.M. Segrest J.P. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23616-23622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), emphasizing that the ∼75 amino acids downstream from residue 4326 are likely important in the initial association of apoB with apo(a). The sequences downstream from the carboxyl terminus of apoB95 are fairly well conserved in several mammalian species and are predicted to contain several amphipathic α-helices with multiple lysine residues (30Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Pierotti V.P. Young S.G. Boren J. Innerarity T.L. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 85-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, one of the predicted α-helices (residues 4365–4396) contains lysines at positions 4372, 4379, 4385, and 4392. We have recently shown that a synthetic apoB peptide spanning amino acids 4372 to 4392 is a potent inhibitor of Lp(a) assembly in vitro(31Sharp, R. J., Pollock, R. C., Bowron, M. E., and McCormick, S. P. A. (1999) Circulation100, I-109Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of the four lysines between amino acids 4372 and 4392 are missing from the mouse apoB sequence. In future studies, it would be of interest to delete one or more of those lysines from the human sequence and assess the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly. Our studies to date support the hypothesis that nearby carboxyl-terminal sequences mediate both the noncovalent and covalent interactions of apoB and apo(a). This hypothesis is attractive in that it falls in line with Ockham's razor. However, the current studies cannot exclude the possibility that remote sequences might also contribute to the noncovalent association between apo(a) and apoB. For example, Trieu et al. (32Trieu V.N. Olsson U. McConathy W.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) proposed that amino acids 3304–3317 might be important for the noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB, whereas Gabel et al. (33Gabel B.R. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) suggested that sequences at the amino terminus of apoB could play a role in the binding of apo(a). We believe that more experiments will be required for a complete understanding of the apoB sequences governing the assembly of Lp(a). Gene targeting in YACs, followed by transgenic mouse expression studies, is an approach that is well suited for mutating many different regions of the apoB molecule. This approach could potentially be used to define additional sequences that are important for Lp(a) assembly. We thank H. Hobbs and R. Hammer for the human apo(a) transgenic mice, R.

https://openalex.org/W1570492626,"Abstract The reactions of class A β-lactamases PC1 and TEM-1 with tazobactam (TZB), a potent penicillanic sulfone inhibitor for class A β-lactamases, were studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). Following inactivation of the β-lactamases by TZB, new abundant high mass components were observed including three with molecular masses of 52, 70, and 88 Da greater than PC1 and TEM-1, respectively, and a component with a molecular mass of 300 Da greater than PC1. In addition, three TZB reaction products with molecular masses of 248, 264, and 280 Da were observed. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ESI/MS analysis of the TZB-PC1 adduct digested with Glu-C revealed three new components with masses 52, 70, and 88 Da greater than that of the peptide composed of amino acid residues 58–82 and one new component with a mass 70 Da greater than that of the peptide composed of amino acid residues 125–141. HPLC/ESI/MS/MS analysis of the two digested peptides whose masses increased by 70 Da indicated that Ser-70 and Ser-130 were the most likely TZB-modified amino acid residues. Based on these data, a mechanism for the inactivation of the class A β-lactamases by TZB is proposed. In this scheme, initial acylation of Ser-70 by TZB and opening of the lactam ring are followed by one of several different events: (1) the rapid decomposition of TZB with loss of the enamine moiety to form the propiolylated enzyme, (2) an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the imine or enamine moiety by Ser-130 to form a cross-linked vinyl ether, and (3) hydrolysis of the imine or enamines to form a Ser-70-linked aldehyde."

In this report, we utilize a mutant of GroEL (GroEL T89W) whose domain movements have been drastically restricted, producing a chaperonin that is incapable of utilizing the conventional cyclic mechanism of chaperonin action. This mutant was, however, still capable of improving the refolding yield of lactate dehydrogenase in the absence of both GroES and ATP hydrolysis. A very rapid interconversion of conformations was detected in the mutant immediately after ATP binding, and this interconversion was inferred to form part of the target release mechanism in this mutant. The possibility exists that some target proteins, although dependent on GroEL for improved refolding yields, are capable of refolding successfully by utilizing only portions of the entire mechanism provided by the chaperonins.

ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate this process by modulation of domain movements in GroEL, which result in changes in binding affinities for target protein and GroES (7Rye H.S. Burston S.G.

Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Most of the aspects of the above mechanism have been elucidated using target proteins such as rhodanese (9Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and Rubisco (10Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), which, in initial studies, showed little or no spontaneous refolding, and absolutely required both the GroEL and GroES proteins and the hydrolysis of ATP in order to attain maximum refolding yields. Such proteins have conventionally been termed “stringent” target proteins (7Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 8Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L.

In contrast, “non-stringent” targets are released from GroEL in the absence of one or more of the accessorial factors such as the participation of GroES or ATP hydrolysis (12Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13629-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P. Clarke A.R.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, further studies regarding the concept of stringency revealed that for each stringent protein target, refolding conditions could be altered so that the requirement of various components could be relaxed (17Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concept of “permissiveness” was then coined to explain this phenomenon; under “non-permissive” conditions, target proteins were capable of refolding successfully only in the presence of all three components of the chaperonin mechanism, whereas under “permissive” conditions, ATP hydrolysis and/or the presence of GroES could be omitted. Although this term explains the behavior of a broader fraction of target proteins reported to date compared with the term “stringency,” the behavior of a small subset of the non-stringent proteins are still not readily explained. Specifically, although a number of non-stringent proteins are capable of folding spontaneously with high yields, and only interact transiently with GroEL during folding without displaying any differences in the overall refolding yield (14Kubo T. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a small number,e.g. tryptophanase (15Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutamine synthetase (18Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), display a very low spontaneous yield which improves dramatically in the presence of GroEL and various nucleotides. In the case of tryptophanase, the participation of GroES and ATP hydrolysis are both unnecessary for an improved yield (15Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, a unified mechanism that describes the behavior of GroEL toward all target proteins reported to date is far from completion. An important problem arises from the concept of permissive and non-permissive protein folding reactions vis à vis the specific mechanistic steps of the chaperonin cycle that accommodate these reactions. Specifically, for a given target protein, is the conventional cyclic mechanism important under permissive conditions as well as for non-permissive conditions? If so, what is the specific sequence of events that lead to an orderly release of protein molecules from GroEL, especially in the absence of GroES? These questions must be answered for a complete understanding of the mechanism of chaperonin-facilitated protein folding, encompassing both permissive and non-permissive refolding conditions. We, among many other research groups, have been attempting to clarify the mechanism of chaperonin-facilitated protein folding by characterizing the numerous conformations that GroEL is presumed to form during this process. A popular experimental method in these studies is to insert a specific mutation into GroEL that is targeted to affect a specific aspect of the mechanism and to characterize the consequences of this mutation (1Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 4Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A.

In a previous study, we have addressed the phenomenon of inter-domain communication within the GroEL subunit by using three GroEL mutants (T89W, C138W, and Y203C) (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each of these mutants is located in a different domain of the GroEL subunit as follows: Thr-89, equatorial domain; Cys-138, intermediate domain; Tyr-203, apical domain. By using these three mutants, we were able to demonstrate the presence of interdomain communications that were important for the functional mechanism of GroEL (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GroEL T89W was engineered to disrupt specifically the ATPase activity of GroEL by replacing Thr-89, which is located in the vicinity of the γ-phosphate-binding region of the ATP-binding site of GroEL, with a bulky tryptophan residue. As expected, this mutant was characterized by a total lack of ATPase activity and also by an inability to bind the co-chaperonin GroES. However, this mutant was able to bind ATP, as detected by changes in the fluorescence intensity of the inserted tryptophan residue. The binding abilities of the mutant GroEL with regard to the target protein enolase were altered, so that GroEL T89W was able to bind only a fraction of the refolding intermediates recognized by the wild-type protein. Interestingly, however, GroEL T89W could also improve the refolding yield of Staphylococcus sp. LDH1 relative to spontaneous yields in an ATP-dependent manner, indicating that chaperonin function was partially retained in this mutant. In this report we describe in greater detail the structural and functional characteristics of GroEL T89W. When we analyzed the conformational changes that occurred during ATP binding to GroEL T89W by labeling the mutant chaperonin with a fluorescent labelN-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide and monitoring the changes in pyrenyl-derived fluorescence, we found that, unlike the wild-type chaperonin, GroEL T89W underwent almost no conformational changes upon ATP binding which were detectable by the fluorophore. By utilizing the presence of the tryptophan residue in the nucleotide-binding site, we characterized an extremely rapid conformational change by stopped-flow fluorescence. We propose that this extremely rapid interconversion of conformations observed for GroEL T89W upon nucleotide binding may act as part of a mechanism to release proteins that refold under permissive conditions from GroEL, in the process producing a passive chaperoning effect by reduction of aggregates. The results obtained with the present mutant demonstrate that in the case of certain target proteins, a net improvement in refolding yield may be achieved via a “minimal” mechanism that requires neither GroES binding nor ATP hydrolysis. Gdn-HCl (specially purified grade) was obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). ATP and ADP were purchased from Sigma and were used after checking the purity (14Kubo T. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. Wild-type GroEL protein was expressed in E. coli DH-1/pKY206 and purified according to published protocols (14Kubo T. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GroEL T89W was prepared as reported in a previous study (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purification of the mutant protein was accomplished by using the method for the wild-type protein (22Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of GroEL T89W was determined with a protein dye reagent (Protein Assay Kit; Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). Refolding assays of yeast enolase and Staphylococcus LDH were performed as previously reported (14Kubo T. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kawata Y. Nosaka K. Hongo K. Mizobata T. Nagai J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentrations of enzyme and Gdn-HCl during the refolding reaction were 18 μg/ml and 80 mm for enolase and 2 μg/ml and 50 mm for LDH, respectively. Refolding assays of bovine rhodanese were performed under two differing conditions (25Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as follows: permissive refolding conditions outlined by Mendoza et al. (26Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to monitor recovery of activities and non-permissive refolding conditions according to Martin et al. (9Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) to monitor the aggregation of prematurely released protein species. The concentration of rhodanese during refolding was 0.5 μm. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Equilibrium binding of nucleotides to GroEL T89W was measured in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 20 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 25 °C by monitoring the changes in tryptophan-derived fluorescence at 340 nm (excitation, 295 nm). ATP was mixed in various concentrations with 50 μg/ml GroEL T89W, and the spectra were subsequently measured. The raw data were corrected for buffer effects by subtraction of a reference spectrum containing an identical concentration of nucleotide and analyzed according to the Hill equation to obtain the theoretical traces shown in Fig. 7. Mathematical fits to all data points in this and subsequent figures were performed by non-linear least squares fitting using the program Igor (WaveMetrics) on an Apple Power Macintosh computer. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments of ATP binding to GroEL T89W were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Experiments were performed in Buffer B (50 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl and 20 mmMgCl2). GroEL T89W (1.0 mg/ml, 17.4 μmsubunit) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with stock solutions of ATP in various concentrations, and a cutoff filter was used to monitor the amount of fluorescence emitted at wavelengths greater than 320 nm. Data corresponding to five runs were collected and averaged to obtain each trace shown in Fig. 8 a. All traces were obtained at a constant photomultiplier voltage (750 V) and corrected for offset by simple subtraction of the offset voltage differences between each averaged run (typical offset voltages were between 3 and 4.5 V). A nonresponsive interval of about 2 ms was confirmed for the instrument by using the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol byl-ascorbic acid at pH 2.0 (27Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as a model reaction. Data that were collected in the first 2 ms of each session were therefore omitted from this analysis. Wild-type GroEL and GroEL T89W were labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide according to previously published protocols (28Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 29Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with some changes. Specifically, the concentrations of GroEL subunit and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide were changed to 150 and 11.2 μm, respectively, and after labeling was completed, the ammonium sulfate precipitation was omitted, and the samples (1 ml) were immediately dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer B containing 0.5 mg/ml acid-washed charcoal. The amount of pyrenyl groups incorporated was estimated by absorbance spectroscopy of the resultant samples; by using an ε value of 34,000m−1 cm−1at 343 nm for 2-mercaptoethanol adducts ofN-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (30Betcher-Lange S.L. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3757-3760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a value of one pyrenyl group incorporated for every 13.6 subunits was obtained for wild-type GroEL and one pyrenyl group incorporated for every 10.7 subunits was obtained for GroEL T89W. The concentration of protein used in the determination of pyrenyl groups was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar), using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). To confirm that the pyrenyl label was incorporated in a similar manner in both the wild-type and mutant chaperonins, samples of the pyrenyl-labeled proteins were extensively digested with Achromobacter lyticus lysyl endopeptidase and analyzed using reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, using a Cosmosil C18 reversed phase chromatography column (Nacalai Tesque). The pattern of labeled peptide for GroEL T89W was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type chaperonin as monitored by absorbance at 340 nm and fluorescence at 380 nm (excitation, 340 nm, data not shown), indicating that the labeling of GroEL byN-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide was the same regardless of the presence or absence of a mutation at Thr-89. Fluorescence spectra of the labeled chaperonins were measured in Buffer B at 25 °C, at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. The concentration of labeled chaperonin was 50 μg/ml. Spectra in the presence of 1 mmATP were measured 10 min after addition of the nucleotide. Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments of pyrenyl-labeled GroEL were performed in Buffer B at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Emission was monitored through a 360 nm cutoff filter to reduce scattered light. The experimental temperature was 25 °C. Fig.1 shows the position of threonine 89 relative to the closed (nucleotide-less) conformation and the open (nucleotide-bound) form of the GroEL subunit. Thr-89 is located within the “phosphate binding loop” of the nucleotide-binding site, which is postulated to interact with the β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATP (31Boisvert D.C. Wang J. Otwinowski Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Upon binding of ATP and GroES, a long helix element (the M-helix; Fig. 1, gray/magenta) is reoriented to cover the nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 1, gold/green). Thr-89 is located in close proximity to this dynamic conformational change. Additionally, Thr-89 is located at the N-terminal of the “D-helix” of GroEL. This helix, which extends through the equatorial domain to interact with GroEL subunits located on the opposite ring, is implicated in the transmission of conformational changes between the two GroEL rings (32Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Therefore, Thr-89 is in a unique position to affect both the various conformational perturbations of individual GroEL subunits and also to influence inter-ring communications transmitted via the D-helix. As described in a previous study (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), expression and purification of GroEL T89W were straightforward, and the static structural aspects of the mutant were, with the exceptions of the fluorescence spectra and near-UV CD spectra, indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. Regarding the functional aspects of GroEL T89W, we determined that GroEL T89W completely lacks ATPase activity (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, ATP binding to the mutant could be observed by an increase in tryptophan-derived fluorescence which was dependent on the ATP concentration. Fig.2 shows the refolding profiles of yeast enolase and Staphylococcus sp. LDH in the presence of GroEL T89W. As reported in a previous study (21Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), GroEL T89W was capable of binding to and arresting the folding of a small fraction of enolase refolding molecules and subsequently releasing them upon addition of ATP. The fraction of protein molecules that are bound is about 30%, under the conditions used in Fig. 2 a. The fraction of molecules bound to GroEL T89W behaved subsequently in a manner indistinguishable from that in the presence of wild-type chaperonin. In contrast, the refolding of LDH was arrested completely in the presence of GroEL T89W. Addition of ATP resulted in the partial recovery of LDH activity (Fig. 2 b), which was significantly higher than the yield recovered spontaneously (Fig. 2 b,solid line). Delaying the addition of the nucleotide for up to 6 h after the initial formation of the LDH·T89W complex resulted in almost no degradation of the final refolding yield of LDH, indicating that the LDH·T89W complex was stable for this length of time. The results in Fig. 2 indicate that, although reduced in potency, GroEL T89W retains partial chaperonin activity toward a subset of refolding target proteins; specifically, proteins such as LDH, which do not require the presence of the co-chaperonin GroES for significant refolding. The reduction in potency does not seem to be due to a reduction in stability of the GroEL·LDH complex, as this complex was demonstrated to be stable for at least 6 h (Fig.2 b). A further detailed look at the refolding profiles of these two target proteins revealed another interesting characteristic. In Fig.3, we assayed the ability of GroEL T89W to bind the refolding intermediates of enolase and LDH, by refolding these two proteins in the presence of various concentrations of GroEL and no nucleotide. The activity recovered under these conditions reflects the fraction of protein molecules that were able to escape interaction with GroEL. As seen in Fig. 3, the introduction of the mutation resulted in a decrease in the affinities for both of the protein targets. However, an important difference between the two protein targets was apparent. In the case of LDH, the mutation caused a decrease in the initial binding affinity between GroEL and target protein, such that an increased concentration of chaperonin was required to arrest completely the refolding of LDH. However, the refolding of LDH was completely suppressed under saturating concentrations of GroEL. In the case of enolase, although increasing concentrations of GroEL resulted in a decrease in the refolding yield, about 70% of the target was still capable of spontaneous refolding in the presence of a 20-fold excess of GroEL T89W oligomer, suggesting that more than half of the refolding enolase molecules could not be bound by GroEL T89W, even at saturating concentrations of chaperonin. The refolding reaction of rhodanese contrasted sharply with the results obtained for enolase and LDH. Fig. 4shows the recovery of unfolded bovine rhodanese in the presence of GroEL T89W, monitored by refolding yields and the extent of aggregation. Refolding yields were monitored under permissive conditions, whereas aggregation was monitored under non-permissive conditions, in order to detect the release of any rhodanese molecules with the highest sensitivity. As seen in the figure, in the presence of GroEL T89W and ATP, neither increases in refolding yield nor increases in aggregation were observed, suggesting that rhodanese remained stably bound throughout the assay. Release of rhodanese and recovery of activity was observed only in the presence of wild-type GroEL and the co-chaperonin GroES. In an attempt to monitor the differences between the conformational changes that occur in both types of GroEL subunit, wild-type GroEL and GroEL T89W were labeled withN-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (28Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 29Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the changes in pyrenyl fluorescence were monitored upon addition of ATP. Fig.5 shows the pyrenyl fluorescence spectra of GroEL wild-type and GroEL T89W in the presence and absence of 1 mm ATP. Prior to this experiment, we confirmed that both wild-type GroEL and GroEL T89W were labeled to a similar extent and in a virtually identical manner, as determined by UV spectra analysis (30Betcher-Lange S.L. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3757-3760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of samples digested with lysyl endopeptidase (data not shown). Also, the labeling of GroEL T89W by N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide resulted in negligible differences in both ATP binding ability, as monitored by tryptophan fluorescence, and the ability to bind and release enolase folding intermediates (data not shown). As shown in the figure, the addition of 1 mm ATP to pyrenyl-labeled wild-type GroEL resulted in a large increase in the fluorescence intensity of the pyrenyl group (Fig. 5 a). On the contrary, the addition of an identical concentration of ATP to pyrenyl-labeled GroEL T89W resulted in almost no changes in the fluorescence intensity (Fig.5 b). This tendency was also confirmed in kinetic experiments. Fig. 6 shows the changes in fluorescence intensity that are observed when ATP is added to pyrenyl-labeled GroEL (29Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When an equimolar concentration of ATP relative to GroEL subunit is added to pyrenyl-labeled GroEL wild-type (Fig. 6), the fluorescence intensity of the pyrenyl group displays an initial increase in fluorescence intensity due to ATP binding, followed by a gradual decrease in intensity as the bound ATP is hydrolyzed and the GroEL oligomer relaxes into its initial conformation (29Kad N.M. Ranson N.A. Cliff M.J. Clarke A.R. J. Mo"
