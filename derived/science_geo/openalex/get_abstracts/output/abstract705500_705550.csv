https://openalex.org/W4313453265,"Tobacco and alcohol use are heritable behaviours associated with 15% and 5.3% of worldwide deaths, respectively, due largely to broad increased risk for disease and injury1-4. These substances are used across the globe, yet genome-wide association studies have focused largely on individuals of European ancestries5. Here we leveraged global genetic diversity across 3.4 million individuals from four major clines of global ancestry (approximately 21% non-European) to power the discovery and fine-mapping of genomic loci associated with tobacco and alcohol use, to inform function of these loci via ancestry-aware transcriptome-wide association studies, and to evaluate the genetic architecture and predictive power of polygenic risk within and across populations. We found that increases in sample size and genetic diversity improved locus identification and fine-mapping resolution, and that a large majority of the 3,823 associated variants (from 2,143 loci) showed consistent effect sizes across ancestry dimensions. However, polygenic risk scores developed in one ancestry performed poorly in others, highlighting the continued need to increase sample sizes of diverse ancestries to realize any potential benefit of polygenic prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4312114039,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and several bat coronaviruses use dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor1-4. However, the receptor for NeoCoV-the closest known MERS-CoV relative found in bats-remains unclear5. Here, using a pseudotype virus entry assay, we found that NeoCoV and its close relative, PDF-2180, can efficiently bind to and use specific bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologues and, less favourably, human ACE2 as entry receptors through their receptor-binding domains (RBDs) on the spike (S) proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed an RBD-ACE2 binding interface involving protein-glycan interactions, distinct from those of other known ACE2-using coronaviruses. We identified residues 337-342 of human ACE2 as a molecular determinant restricting NeoCoV entry, whereas a NeoCoV S pseudotyped virus containing a T510F RBD mutation efficiently entered cells expressing human ACE2. Although polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or MERS-CoV RBD-specific nanobodies did not cross-neutralize NeoCoV or PDF-2180, an ACE2-specific antibody and two broadly neutralizing betacoronavirus antibodies efficiently inhibited these two pseudotyped viruses. We describe MERS-CoV-related viruses that use ACE2 as an entry receptor, underscoring a promiscuity of receptor use and a potential zoonotic threat."
https://openalex.org/W4311461840,"Abstract Insufficient intracellular anabolism is a crucial factor involved in many pathological processes in the body 1,2 . The anabolism of intracellular substances requires the consumption of sufficient intracellular energy and the production of reducing equivalents. ATP acts as an ‘energy currency’ for biological processes in cells 3,4 , and the reduced form of NADPH is a key electron donor that provides reducing power for anabolism 5 . Under pathological conditions, it is difficult to correct impaired anabolism and to increase insufficient levels of ATP and NADPH to optimum concentrations 1,4,6–8 . Here we develop an independent and controllable nanosized plant-derived photosynthetic system based on nanothylakoid units (NTUs). To enable cross-species applications, we use a specific mature cell membrane (the chondrocyte membrane (CM)) for camouflage encapsulation. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that these CM-NTUs enter chondrocytes through membrane fusion, avoid lysosome degradation and achieve rapid penetration. Moreover, the CM-NTUs increase intracellular ATP and NADPH levels in situ following exposure to light and improve anabolism in degenerated chondrocytes. They can also systemically correct energy imbalance and restore cellular metabolism to improve cartilage homeostasis and protect against pathological progression of osteoarthritis. Our therapeutic strategy for degenerative diseases is based on a natural photosynthetic system that can controllably enhance cell anabolism by independently providing key energy and metabolic carriers. This study also provides an enhanced understanding of the preparation and application of bioorganisms and composite biomaterials for the treatment of disease."

https://openalex.org/W4311748029,"Sexual reproduction and meiotic sex are deeply rooted in the eukaryotic tree of life, but mechanisms determining sex or mating types are extremely varied and are only well characterized in a few model organisms1. In malaria parasites, sexual reproduction coincides with transmission to the vector host. Sex determination is non-genetic, with each haploid parasite capable of producing either a male or a female gametocyte in the human host2. The hierarchy of events and molecular mechanisms that trigger sex determination and maintenance of sexual identity are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that the male development 1 (md1) gene is both necessary and sufficient for male fate determination in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We show that Md1 has a dual function stemming from two separate domains: in sex determination through its N terminus and in male development from its conserved C-terminal LOTUS/OST-HTH domain. We further identify a bistable switch at the md1 locus, which is coupled with sex determination and ensures that the male-determining gene is not expressed in the female lineage. We describe one of only a few known non-genetic mechanisms of sex determination in a eukaryote and highlight Md1 as a potential target for interventions that block malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4312128887,"Abstract The ocean–atmosphere exchange of CO 2 largely depends on the balance between marine microbial photosynthesis and respiration. Despite vast taxonomic and metabolic diversity among marine planktonic bacteria and archaea (prokaryoplankton) 1–3 , their respiration usually is measured in bulk and treated as a ‘black box’ in global biogeochemical models 4 ; this limits the mechanistic understanding of the global carbon cycle. Here, using a technology for integrated phenotype analyses and genomic sequencing of individual microbial cells, we show that cell-specific respiration rates differ by more than 1,000× among prokaryoplankton genera. The majority of respiration was found to be performed by minority members of prokaryoplankton (including the Roseobacter cluster), whereas cells of the most prevalent lineages (including Pelagibacter and SAR86) had extremely low respiration rates. The decoupling of respiration rates from abundance among lineages, elevated counts of proteorhodopsin transcripts in Pelagibacter and SAR86 cells and elevated respiration of SAR86 at night indicate that proteorhodopsin-based phototrophy 3,5–7 probably constitutes an important source of energy to prokaryoplankton and may increase growth efficiency. These findings suggest that the dependence of prokaryoplankton on respiration and remineralization of phytoplankton-derived organic carbon into CO 2 for its energy demands and growth may be lower than commonly assumed and variable among lineages."

https://openalex.org/W4311587197,"Background Current media studies of COVID-19 devote asymmetrical attention to social media, in contrast, newspapers have received comparatively less attention. Newspapers are an integral source of current information—that are syndicated and amplified by social media to a wide global audience. This is the first-known study to investigate the impact of cultural values and pandemic severity on media attention towards COVID-19. Findings lay the groundwork for targeted public health communications that are culturally nuanced. Objective We investigated the impact of cultural values and pandemic severity on Media Attention towards COVID-19 across 18 countries. Methods We tracked the global volume of COVID-19 coverage (to measure media attention) over 8 months in a news media database of 12 billion words with 30 million articles from over 7,000 news media sites. Predictors of Media Attention towards COVID-19 came from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (incidence and mortality) and Hofstede’s Cultural Values. Results Media attention toward COVID-19 increased 55 times over 8 months. Higher rates of new cases and deaths predicted this exponential increase. Countries with higher power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation, were associated with increased media attention, controlling for covariates. Conclusions Cultural values play a significant role in the news media’s attention toward COVID-19, controlling for pandemic severity. We provided a framework to design targeted public health communications that are culturally nuanced."
https://openalex.org/W4310942637,"Multilocular adipocytes are a hallmark of thermogenic adipose tissue1,2, but the factors that enforce this cellular phenotype are largely unknown. Here, we show that an adipocyte-selective product of the Clstn3 locus (CLSTN3β) present in only placental mammals facilitates the efficient use of stored triglyceride by limiting lipid droplet (LD) expansion. CLSTN3β is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that localizes to ER–LD contact sites through a conserved hairpin-like domain. Mice lacking CLSTN3β have abnormal LD morphology and altered substrate use in brown adipose tissue, and are more susceptible to cold-induced hypothermia despite having no defect in adrenergic signalling. Conversely, forced expression of CLSTN3β is sufficient to enforce a multilocular LD phenotype in cultured cells and adipose tissue. CLSTN3β associates with cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector proteins and impairs their ability to transfer lipid between LDs, thereby restricting LD fusion and expansion. Functionally, increased LD surface area in CLSTN3β-expressing adipocytes promotes engagement of the lipolytic machinery and facilitates fatty acid oxidation. In human fat, CLSTN3B is a selective marker of multilocular adipocytes. These findings define a molecular mechanism that regulates LD form and function to facilitate lipid utilization in thermogenic adipocytes. An adipocyte-selective product of the Clstn3 locus (CLSTN3β) facilitates the use of stored triglyceride by limiting lipid droplet (LD) expansion, defining a molecular mechanism that regulates LD form and function to facilitate lipid utilization in thermogenic adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4311577979,"Differentiating between acute viral and bacterial infection is challenging due to the similarity in symptom presentation. Blood tests can assist in the diagnosis, but they reflect the immediate status and fail to consider the dynamics of an inflammatory response with time since symptom onset. We applied estimated C-reactive protein (CRP) velocity (eCRPv), as derived from the admission CRP level divided by time from symptom onset, in order to better distinguish between viral and bacterial infections.This cross-sectional study included patients admitted to the emergency department with a confirmed viral (n = 83) or bacterial (n = 181) infection. eCRPv was defined as the ratio between the absolute CRP level upon admission to time from symptom onset (in hours). Absolute CRP and eCRPv values were compared between the 3 groups.Bacterial patients presented with higher CRP levels (133 mg/L) upon admission compared to viral patients (23.31 mg/L) (P < 0.001). Their median value of eCRPv velocity was 4 times higher compared to the viral patients (1.1 mg/L/h compared 0.25 mg/L/h, P < 0.001). Moreover, in intermediate values of CRP (100-150 mg/L) upon admission, in which the differential diagnosis is controversial, high eCRPv is indicative of bacterial infection, eCRPv >4 mg/L/h represents only bacterial patients.During an acute febrile illness, the eCRPv value can be used for rapid differentiation between bacterial and viral infection, especially in patients with high CRP values. This capability can potentially expedite the provision of appropriate therapeutic management. Further research and validation may open new applications of the kinetics of inflammation for rapid diagnosis of an infectious vs. a viral source of fever."
https://openalex.org/W4311579376,"Breast cancer is heterogenous in development and cell population with prognoses being highly dependent on numerous factors from driving mutations, biomarker expression and variation in extracellular environment, all affecting response to therapies. Recently, much attention has been given to the role of metabolic alteration in cancers, expanding from the Warburg effect to highlight unique patterns in different cancer cell populations for improving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We recently reported on modulation of mannosylation of α-dystroglycan with the metabolite ribitol in breast cancer lines. Here we investigate the effects of pentose sugars ribitol, ribose, and xylitol media supplementation in breast cancer cells by metabolomics and differential gene expression profiling. This combined approach revealed distinctive patterns of alterations in metabolic pathways by ribitol, contrasted with the closely related pentose ribose and pentitol xylitol. Significantly, ribitol supplementation enhances utilization of glucose by glycolysis, whereas ribose improves oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid synthesis. Ribitol supplementation also increased levels of reduced glutathione (associated with a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis), where ribose supplementation elevated levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) indicating an increase in oxidative stress. Treatment with ribitol also enhanced nucleotide biosynthesis. The apparent TCA cycle dysregulation, with distinctive pattern in response to the individual pentitol and pentose, such as ribitol increasing succinate and fumarate while decreasing citrate, demonstrate the adaptive capability of cancer cells to nutritional environment. This metabolic reprogramming presents new avenues for developing targeted therapies to cancers with metabolites, especially in combination with other drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4311588194,"Background Suicidal behaviour is commonly associated with major depression (MD) and substance use disorders (SUDs). However, there is a paucity of research on risk for suicide ideation among individuals with comorbid SUDs and MD in the general population. Objectives This study investigated the associated risk of suicide ideation in comorbid SUDs—cannabis use disorder (CUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), drug use disorder (DUD) with major depressive episode (MDE) in a nationally representative sample. Methods Multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyze the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey- Mental Health (CCHS-MH) data. This is a cross-sectional survey of nationally representative samples of Canadians (n = 25,113) aged 15 years and older residing in the ten Canadian provinces between January and December 2012. Diagnoses of MDE, AUD, DUD, and CUD were based on a modified WHO-CIDI, derived from DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Results Comorbidity was found to be the strongest predictor of suicide ideation. Compared to those with no diagnosis of either a SUD or MDE, individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of AUD with MDE, CUD with MDE, or DUD with MDE were 9, 11 and 16 times more likely to have 12-month suicide ideation respectively. A diagnosis of MDE was a significant predictor of 12-month suicide ideation with about a 7-fold increased risk compared with individuals not diagnosed with either MDE or a SUD. Conclusion Suicide is a preventable public health issue. Our study found a significantly increased risk of suicide ideation among persons who have comorbid SUD with MD. Effective integration of mental health and addictions services could mitigate the risk of suicide and contribute to better outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4311828113,"Genetic testing for hereditary cancers can improve long-term health outcomes through identifying high-risk individuals and facilitating targeted prevention and screening/surveillance. The rising demand for genetic testing exceeds the clinical genetic workforce capacity. Therefore, non-genetic specialists need to be empowered to offer genetic testing. However, it is unknown whether patient outcomes differ depending on whether genetic testing is offered by a genetics specialist or a trained non-genetics clinician. This paper describes a protocol for upskilling non-genetics clinicians to provide genetic testing, randomise high-risk individuals to receive testing from a trained clinician or a genetic counsellor, and then determine whether patient outcomes differed depending on provider-type.An experiential training program to upskill dermatologically-trained clinicians to offer genetic testing for familial melanoma is being piloted on 10-15 clinicians, prior to wider implementation. Training involves a workshop, comprised of a didactic learning presentation, case studies, simulated sessions, and provision of supporting documentation. Clinicians later observe a genetic counsellor led consultation before being observed leading a consultation. Both sessions are followed by debriefing with a genetic counsellor. Thereafter, clinicians independently offer genetic testing in the clinical trial. Individuals with a strong personal and/or family history of melanoma are recruited to a parallel-group trial and allocated to receive pre- and post- genetic testing consultation from a genetic counsellor, or a dermatologically-trained clinician. A mixed method approach measures psychosocial and behavioural outcomes. Longitudinal online surveys are administered at five timepoints from baseline to one year post-test disclosure. Semi-structured interviews with both patients and clinicians are qualitatively analysed.This is the first program to upskill dermatologically-trained clinicians to provide genetic testing for familial melanoma. This protocol describes the first clinical trial to compare patient-reported outcomes of genetic testing based on provider type (genetic counsellors vs trained non-genetic clinicians)."
https://openalex.org/W4311844851,"The natural stone sector is an important driver of the Spanish and Italian economies, which underwent internationalization after the financial crisis of 2008 as part of a survival and development strategy. This article aims to study the financial and economic profitability of this sector in the two leading European production countries, as well as its determinants. For this purpose, the economic-financial data of a sample composed of 453 companies (203 Spanish and 250 Italian) from 2015–2019 were analyzed using the multiple linear regression methodology. To address the problems of possible endogeneity and omission of variables in the model, the dependent variable was used as a regressor with one and two lags, and panel data with fixed effects were considered after performing the Hausman test. The results show significant differences between the two countries, with higher profitability in Italy. Company size, company growth (measured as the change in assets), and the variation in the country’s GDP all positively affected profitability. At the same time, the level of indebtedness showed a negative relationship. The country’s inflation rate and gender diversity in top management were shown to be non-relevant variables. The research conducted indicates that, to increase profitability, Spanish and Italian companies in the natural stone sector should undergo mergers in order to grow in size, increase efficiency in the use of assets, reduce their dependence on external financing, and promote equity capital. In addition, Italian companies should reduce the average period of payment to suppliers to lower deferral costs, and boost exports to become less dependent on the country’s domestic economy."
https://openalex.org/W4311573315,"Unresolved sexual issues can have an impact on a person's wellbeing, social interactions, or even medication compliance. Given the enormous global demand to enhance and preserve sexual health, faculty members have a specific goal of developing nursing workforce who are truly prepared to work with clients who have sexual health issues. Hence, the study's purpose has been to evaluate the current state of attitude and belief of nursing students toward sexual healthcare and the factors that influence it in Southwest Ethiopia.An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Mizan-Tepi University involving 134 undergraduate nursing students from February 1 to March 10, 2022. The Sexual Attitude and Beliefs Scale (SABS) were used to assess the level of attitudes and beliefs regarding sexual care. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 26 was employed for data analysis. Multivariable linear regression analyses was conducted to identify predictors of attitudes and beliefs regarding sexual healthcare. The significance level was set at p<0.05.The mean age of the nursing students participating in this study was 28.47±5.2. In our study, mean SABS score of the nursing students was found as 42.3 ± 2.1. The mean score of the SABS items ranged from 1.68±0.93 to 4.37±1.48. Having receiving sexual health education (p<0.001) was significantly associated with attitude and beliefs regarding sexual healthcare.Ethiopian nursing students have been found to have a negative attitude and beliefs about sexual health care. Because comprehensive sex education is sorely lacking in nursing schools, this scrutiny prevents student nurses from receiving an adequate education. As there is a lack of appropriate sexual health subject matter, it is critical to standardize sexual health education in nursing programs so that nursing students can learn to provide comprehensive care to clients."
https://openalex.org/W4311576819,"Real-time data- and location-sharing using mesh networking radios paired with smartphones may improve situational awareness and safety in remote environments lacking communications infrastructure. Despite being increasingly used for wildland fire and public safety applications, there has been little formal evaluation of the network connectivity of these devices. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the connectivity of mesh networks in variable forest and topographic conditions; 2) evaluate the abilities of lidar and satellite remote sensing data to predict connectivity; and 3) assess the relative importance of the predictive metrics. A large field experiment was conducted to test the connectivity of a network of one mobile and five stationary goTenna Pro mesh radios on 24 Public Land Survey System sections approximately 260 ha in area in northern Idaho. Dirichlet regression was used to predict connectivity using 1) both lidar- and satellite-derived metrics (LIDSAT); 2) lidar-derived metrics only (LID); and 3) satellite-derived metrics only (SAT). On average the full network was connected only 32.6% of the time (range: 0% to 90.5%) and the mobile goTenna was disconnected from all other devices 18.2% of the time (range: 0% to 44.5%). RMSE for the six connectivity levels ranged from 0.101 to 0.314 for the LIDSAT model, from 0.103 to 0.310 for the LID model, and from 0.121 to 0.313 for the SAT model. Vegetation-related metrics affected connectivity more than topography. Developed models may be used to predict the connectivity of real-time mesh networks over large spatial extents using remote sensing data in order to forecast how well similar networks are expected to perform for wildland firefighting, forestry, and public safety applications. However, safety professionals should be aware of the impacts of vegetation on connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4311578416,"The Lower Yangtze River of China has been identified as an independent center of rice domestication, but tracing the earliest evidence for rice cultivation practices has been challenging. Here we report the first evidence for rice harvesting, based on use-wear and phytolith residue analyses of 52 flaked stone tools (10000-7000 BP) from the Shangshan and Hehuashan sites. The tools reflect two harvesting methods: reaping the panicles at the top and cutting the stalk near the base. Thus, our research provides a new method for investigating prehistoric cereal cultivation, and the data lend support to the evidence of rice domestication in the early Holocene. The results also show the complexity of rice harvesting strategies several millennia before the emergence of full-fledged agriculture in the Lower Yangtze."
https://openalex.org/W4311580029,"Predictions about others’ future actions are crucial during social interactions, in order to react optimally. Another way to assess such interactions is to define the social context of the situations explicitly and categorize them according to their affective content. Here we investigate how humans assess aggressive, playful and neutral interactions between members of three species: human children, dogs and macaques. We presented human participants with short video clips of real-life interactions of dyads of the three species and asked them either to categorize the context of the situation or to predict the outcome of the observed interaction. Participants performed above chance level in assessing social situations in humans, in dogs and in monkeys. How accurately participants predicted and categorized the situations depended both on the species and on the context. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants were not better at assessing aggressive situations than playful or neutral situations. Importantly, participants performed particularly poorly when assessing aggressive behaviour for dogs. Also, participants were not better at assessing social interactions of humans compared to those of other species. We discuss what mechanism humans use to assess social situations and to what extent this skill can also be found in other social species."
https://openalex.org/W4311586370,"Gene expression sample data, which usually contains massive expression profiles of genes, is commonly used for disease related gene analysis. The selection of relevant genes from huge amount of genes is always a fundamental process in applications of gene expression data. As more and more genes have been detected, the size of gene expression data becomes larger and larger; this challenges the computing efficiency for extracting the relevant and important genes from gene expression data. In this paper, we provide a novel Bi-dimensional Principal Feature Selection (BPFS) method for efficiently extracting critical genes from big gene expression data. It applies the principal component analysis (PCA) method on sample and gene domains successively, aiming at extracting the relevant gene features and reducing redundancies while losing less information. The experimental results on four real-world cancer gene expression datasets show that the proposed BPFS method greatly reduces the data size and achieves a nearly double processing speed compared to the counterpart methods, while maintaining better accuracy and effectiveness."

https://openalex.org/W4311675035,"Little is known about the role that B cells play in immune responses to infection with the intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Traditionally, the role of B cells has been constrained to their function as antibody-producing cells, however, antibodies are not thought to play a protective role in mycobacterial infections. The present study was designed to characterize B cell subpopulations as well as activation/maturation states in cattle with paratuberculosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from noninfected control cows (n = 8); as well cattle naturally infected with MAP in the subclinical (n = 8) and clinical (n = 7) stage of infection and stimulated with MAP antigen for 6 days. MAP infection resulted in greater numbers of total B cells for clinical cows compared to control noninfected cows. The major subpopulation in freshly isolated PBMCs in clinical cows was B-1a B cells, but this shifted to a composite of both B-1a and B-2 B cells upon stimulation of PBMCs with either MAP antigen or pokeweed mitogen, with higher numbers of B-2 B cells. Early B cells were observed to predominate the population of B cells in PBMCs, with lesser populations of germinal B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells. These subpopulations were elevated in clinical cows upon stimulation of PBMCs with MAP antigen, except for plasma cells which were lower compared to control noninfected cows. Increased numbers of B cells in clinical cows aligned with higher expression of B cell markers such as MAPK1/3, BTG1, Bcl2, CD79A and SWAP70, depending upon in vitro stimulation with either mitogen or antigen. This would indicate that the B cells were capable of activation but were anti-apoptotic in nature. The shift to B-2 B cells in the periphery of clinical cows seems to be indicative of an expansion of memory B cells, rather than plasma cells. This may be a last attempt by the host to control the rampant inflammatory state associated with advanced clinical disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311829817,"Although cataracts affect almost all people at advanced age and carry a risk of blindness, the mechanisms of cataract development remain incompletely understood. Oxidative stress, which is a causative factor in cataract, results in DNA breakage, which suggests that DNA damage could contribute to the formation of cataracts. We developed an ex vivo experimental system to study changes in gene expression during the formation of opacities in the lens by culturing explanted rat lenses with Methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) or Bleomycin, which induce DNA damage. Lenses cultured using this experimental system developed cortical opacity, which increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, we compared expression profiles at the whole gene level using microarray analysis of lenses subjected to MMS or Bleomycin stress. Microarray findings in MMS-induced opacity were validated and gene expression was measured from Days 1–4 using RT-qPCR. Altered genes were classified into four groups based on the days of peak gene expression: Group 1, in which expression peaked on Day 1; Group 2, in which expression peaked on Day 2; Group 3, in which expression progressively increased from Days 1–4 or were upregulated on Day 1 and sustained through Day 4; and Group 4, in which expression level oscillated from Days 1–4. Genes involved in lipid metabolism were restricted to Group 1. DNA repair- and cell cycle-related genes were restricted to Groups 1 and 2. Genes associated with oxidative stress and drug efflux were restricted to Group 2. These findings suggest that in temporal changes of MMS-induced opacity formation, the activated pathways could occur in the following order: lipid metabolism, DNA repair and cell cycle, and oxidative stress and drug efflux."
https://openalex.org/W3210515414,"The popularity of online shopping is steadily increasing. At the same time, fake product reviews are published widely and have the potential to affect consumer purchasing behavior. In response, previous work has developed automated methods utilizing natural language processing approaches to detect fake product reviews. However, studies vary considerably in how well they succeed in detecting deceptive reviews, and the reasons for such differences are unclear. A contributing factor may be the multitude of strategies used to collect data, introducing potential confounds which affect detection performance. Two possible confounds are data-origin (i.e., the dataset is composed of more than one source) and product ownership (i.e., reviews written by individuals who own or do not own the reviewed product). In the present study, we investigate the effect of both confounds for fake review detection. Using an experimental design, we manipulate data-origin, product ownership, review polarity, and veracity. Supervised learning analysis suggests that review veracity (60.26–69.87%) is somewhat detectable but reviews additionally confounded with product-ownership (66.19–74.17%), or with data-origin (84.44–86.94%) are easier to classify. Review veracity is most easily classified if confounded with product-ownership and data-origin combined (87.78–88.12%). These findings are moderated by review polarity. Overall, our findings suggest that detection accuracy may have been overestimated in previous studies, provide possible explanations as to why, and indicate how future studies might be designed to provide less biased estimates of detection accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3214167527,"Objective To evaluate efficacy of a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, AAV2/4- RS1 , for retinal rescue in the retinoschisin knockout ( Rs1 -KO) mouse model of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS). Brinzolamide (Azopt ® ), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, was tested for its ability to potentiate the effects of AAV2/4- RS1 . Methods AAV2/4- RS1 with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (2x10 12 viral genomes/mL) was delivered to Rs1 -KO mice via intravitreal (N = 5; 1μL) or subretinal (N = 21; 2μL) injections at postnatal day 60–90. Eleven mice treated with subretinal therapy also received topical Azopt ® twice a day. Serial full field electroretinography (ERG) was performed starting at day 50–60 post-injection. Mice were evaluated using a visually guided swim assay (VGSA) in light and dark conditions. The experimental groups were compared to untreated Rs1 -KO (N = 11), wild-type (N = 12), and Rs1 -KO mice receiving only Azopt ® (N = 5). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess RS1 protein expression following treatment. Results The ERG b/a ratio was significantly higher in the subretinal plus Azopt ® (p&lt;0.0001), subretinal without Azopt ® (p = 0.0002), and intravitreal (p = 0.01) treated eyes compared to untreated eyes. There was a highly significant subretinal treatment effect on ERG amplitudes collectively at 7–9 months post-injection (p = 0.0003). Cones showed more effect than rods. The subretinal group showed improved time to platform in the dark VGSA compared to untreated mice (p&lt;0.0001). RS1 protein expression was detected in the outer retina in subretinal treated mice and in the inner retina in intravitreal treated mice. Conclusions AAV2/4- RS1 shows promise for improving retinal phenotype in the Rs1 -KO mouse model. Subretinal delivery was superior to intravitreal. Topical brinzolamide did not improve efficacy. AAV2/4- RS1 may be considered as a potential treatment for XLRS patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311575277,"This paper analyzes user interactions on the public-access online forum of the Human Brain Project (HBP), a major European Union-funded neuroscience research initiative, to understand the utility of the Forum for collaborative problem solving. We construct novel data using discussion forum posts and detailed user profiles on the HBP Forum. We find that HBP Forum utilization is comparable to that of a leading general-interest coding platform, and that online usage metrics quickly recovered after an initial Covid-19-related dip. Regression results show that user interactions on the Forum are more active for questions on programming and in HBP core areas. Further, Cox proportional hazard analyses show that such problems are solved faster. Forum posts with users from different countries tend to be discussed more actively but solved slower. Higher shares of administrator support tend to solve problems faster. There are no clear patterns regarding gender and seniority. Our results suggest that building novel collaborative forums can support researchers working on complex topics in challenging times."

The current study interrogated this question among men and women aged 40-60 years in rural northern Ghana. This was a cross-sectional study in which data was collected on socio-demography, behaviour, health history, anthropometry and lipid levels. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association of various lipid metrics with CVD. All tests were considered statistically significant at P<0.05. Data were available for 1839 participants. The prevalence of self-reported CVD was 1.6% (n = 29). Non-HDL-C (median (interquartile range): 2.4 (1.9-3.0) vs 2.0 (1.6-2.5) mmol/L; P = 0.009), LDL-C/HDL-C (1.8 (1.4-2.4) vs 1.5 (1.1-2.6); P = 0.019) and TC/HDL-C (3.3 (2.9-3.9) vs 2.9 (2.4-3.5); P = 0.003) were all significantly higher in participants with self-reported CVD compared to those without. However, after adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES) and meals from vendors in a logistic regression model, only non-HDL-C (odds ratio [95% CIs]): (1.58 [1.05, 2.39]), P = 0.029 and LDL-C/HDL-C levels (odds ratio [95% CIs]): (1.26 [1.00, 1.59]), P = 0.045 remained significantly associated with self-reported CVD. While our findings suggest non-HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C measures may be appropriate biomarkers for assessing CVD risk in this population, further studies using established clinical endpoints are required to validate these findings in sub-Saharan Africans."

A total of 30 lambs (n = 10 lambs/treatment) were randomly assigned to three production systems that included rotational grazing (NG) and two different levels of concentrate (CON), one with medium (roughage/concentrate ratio 50:50% based on DM, MC) and one with high concentrate (roughage/concentrate ratio 30:70% based on DM, HC) during the 90-day fattening period. At the start of the experiment, all lambs averaged 90 ± 4 days of age (mean ± SD) and were slaughtered at an average of 180 ± 3 days (mean ± SD). CON-fed lambs had higher average daily gain and loin thickness than NG-fed lambs. The NG lambs spent more time eating, drinking, and standing, but less time resting and rumination than the CON-fed lambs. In addition, plasma lipid, β-hydroxybutyrate, and urea levels were higher, while phosphorus levels were lower in NG-fed lambs than in CON-fed lambs. CON-fed lambs had better carcass yield, but gastrointestinal tract and rumen weights were lower than NG lambs. CON-fed lambs had higher pH values 0 h post mortem than the NG lambs; however, there was no effect of treatment on pH 24 h post mortem. The post-mortem color of the LD muscle of NG lambs had a higher lightness and yellowness index and a lower redness index than that of the LD muscle of CON-fed lambs. The results of this study showed that lambs fed CON had better carcass yield than lambs fed NG, although feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), growth performance, carcass yield, and meat quality of lambs fed MC and HC were similar."

The primary objective of this study was the validation of Catquest-9SF in a Greek-speaking cataract population.The questionnaire was translated into Greek and translated back into English. A pre-final Greek version was formed and tested by 10 Greek-English bilingual participants and by the translation team, and the final version was produced. Patients scheduled for cataract surgery completed the questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively. Rasch analysis was performed for the assessment of the Catquest-9SF psychometric properties, including response category ordering, item fit statistics, principal components analysis, precision, differential item functioning and targeting for preoperative and postoperative data collectively.A total of 100 (55 men, 45 women, mean age = 71.94±6.63) cataract patients completed the Greek version of Catquest-9SF questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively. Rasch analysis showed a significant improvement in the median person Rasch score from -1.49 preoperatively to -4.71 logits postoperatively, while the effect size was 1.3. Unidimensionality was confirmed since infit and outfit mean square values varied between 0.66 and 1.37. Rasch analysis showed good precision and separation ability (Person Separation Index of 3.28, and Person Reliability of 0.92). Four response categories were found for all items. The item-person means difference was -1.83 logits. The difference between preoperative and postoperative Catquest-9SF logit score was positively correlated with preoperative Catquest-9SF logit score (coeff. = 0.798, p<0.0001) and negatively correlated with postoperative spherical equivalent (coeff. = -0.825, p = 0.011).The Greek version of Catquest-9SF proved to be reliable, valid, unidimensional and responsive to changes after cataract surgery presenting good psychometric properties for cataract patients. Some postoperative mistargeting was found indicating that the tasks were easily performed by respondents after cataract surgery.NCT05323526 -retrospectively registered."
https://openalex.org/W4311583445,"Fingolimod (FTY720) is a drug derived from the fungicidal compound myriocin. As it was unclear whether FTY720 has antifungal effects as well, we aimed to characterize its effect on Candida albicans in vitro and in a mouse candidiasis model. First, antifungal susceptibility testing was performed in vitro . Then, a randomized, six-arm, parallel, open-label trial was conducted on 48 mice receiving oral FTY720 (0.3 mg/kg/day), intraperitoneal C . albicans inoculation, or placebo with different combinations and chorological patterns. The outcome measures of the trial included serum concentrations of interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma, absolute lymphocyte counts, and fungal burden values in the mice’s livers, kidneys, and vaginas. Broth microdilution assay revealed FTY720’s minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC 99 ) to be 0.25 mg/mL for C . albicans . The infected mice treated with FTY720 showed lower fungal burden values than the ones not treated with FTY720 ( p &lt;0.05). As expected, the mice treated with FTY720 showed a less-inflammatory immune profile compared to the ones not treated with FTY720. We hypothesize that FTY720 synergizes the host’s innate immune functions by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Further studies are warranted to unveil the mechanistic explanations of our observations and clarify further aspects of repurposing FTY720 for clinical antifungal usage."
https://openalex.org/W4311583698,"While plastics have revolutionized our world, plastic waste has serious environmental and economic impacts. Polyhydroxyalkanoic acid (PHA) is a bacterial carbon and energy reserve shown to be both biodegradable and biocompatible and could potentially replace conventional plastics. However, cost-effective mass production remains elusive. Bacteria often accumulate PHA as cytoplasmic granules. PHA synthase creates the PHA polymer from acetoacyl-CoA monomers, while phasins are small multifunctional proteins that are found in abundance on the granule surface. The PHA synthase gene from a novel marine isolate, Vibrio B-18 (or B-18), was placed in the presence or absence of an upstream phasin gene in a runaway replication plasmid using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Plasmid gene expression may be induced chemically or thermally. Overexpression of the PHA genes was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis, and microscopy was used to detect PHA accumulation in three different enteric bacteria ( Escherichia coli , Klebsiella aerogenes , and Shigella flexneri ). While the B-18 genes were clearly overexpressed at 41°C, PHA accumulation occurred more readily at the lower (30°C) non-inducing temperature regardless of chemical induction if the phasin gene was present. A mutational analysis confirmed the identity of the start codon for the PHA synthase gene and provided evidence supporting the requirement for phasins to allow for PHA accumulation in the recombinant hosts. The findings described in this study confirm the conclusions obtained from related studies from other laboratories and lend support to the importance of including a phasin gene in addition to the basic genes needed for PHA synthesis and accumulation in recombinant enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella aerogenes , and Shigella flexneri ."
https://openalex.org/W4311584325,"Objectives Multiple intra- and inter-individual variabilities sculpt the experience of pain. However, integration of sex and gender has been under-explored in explanatory models of pain. This study aimed to examine the role of sex and traditionally genderized interpersonal-expressive traits, and their interactions in explaining the variability of pain ratings. Methods Data from 113 participants following acute non-catastrophic musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries were included. Participants completed the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Gender, Pain and Expectations Scale (GPES). An independent T-test was used to compare differences in BPI subscales between the sexes. Pearson correlations explored the associations between BPI and GPES subscale scores for the overall sample and also for the sample when disaggregated by sex. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the interaction of sex and gender traits in explaining the BPI scores. Results No differences were found between the sexes in mean BPI Severity and Interference. Across sexes, Relationship-oriented was positively associated with greater BPI Severity (r = 0.20) and Emotive was positively associated with BPI Interference (r = 0.24). In sex-disaggregated analyses, these associations were significant in females only. Goal-oriented was associated with neither BPI Severity nor Interference. In multivariate regression, only Emotive was a significant predictor of BPI Interference. Discussion The findings suggest that variances in pain-related interference are partially explained by scores on a scale measuring self-perceptions of Emotive qualities. Sex was not predictive of either pain outcome in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to consider both sex- and gender-based variables when interpreting patient pain reports."
https://openalex.org/W4311585690,"Background The World Health Organization recommended the Test, Treat and Track (T3) strategy for malaria control that, every suspected malaria case should be tested prior to treatment with Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and tracked. We assessed the performance and challenges in the implementation of T3 strategy among children under-five years in Volta and Oti Regions of Ghana. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried in 69 health facilities. Exit interviews were conducted for caregivers of children with fever using a semi-structured questionnaire. Clinicians were interviewed at the out-patient department in each facility. Descriptive statistics was conducted, Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to determine the associations between completion of T3 and independent variables. Results Most children, 818/900 (90.9%) were tested for malaria and 600/818 (73.4%) were positive for malaria parasitaemia using rapid diagnostic test. Of those testing positive for malaria, 530/600 (88.3%) received treatment with ACTs. Half, (109/218) of the children testing negative for malaria also received ACTs. Also, 67/82 (81.7%) of children not tested for malaria received ACTs. Only 408/900 (45.3%) children completed T3 with Community Health-based Planning Services (CHPS) compound having the highest completion rate 202/314 (64.3%). CHPS Compounds were 6.55 times more likely to complete T3 compared to the hospitals [(95% CI: 3.77, 11.35), p&lt;0.001]. Health facilities with laboratory services were 2.08 times more likely to complete T3 [(95% CI: 1.55, 2.79), p&lt;0.001] The main challenge identified was clinicians’ perception that RDTs do not give accurate results. Conclusion Testing fever cases for malaria before treatment and treating positive cases with ACTs was high. Treating negative cases and those not tested with ACTs was also high. Health facilities having laboratory services and facility being CHPS compounds were key predictors of completing T3. Clinician’s not trusting RDT results can affect the T3 strategy in malaria control. Periodic training/monitoring is required to sustain adherence to the strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4311585874,"Inspired by self-assembled biological growth, the Circuit Tile Assembly Model (cTAM) was developed to provide insights into signal propagation, information processing, and computation in bioelectric networks. The cTAM is an abstract model that produces a family of circuits of different sizes that is amenable to exact analysis. Here, the cTAM is extended to the Boolean Circuit Tile Assembly Model (bcTAM) that implements a computationally complete set of Boolean gates through self-assembled and self-controlled growth. The proposed model approximates axonal growth in neural networks and thus, investigates the computational capability of dynamic biological networks, for example, in growing networks of axons. Thus, the bcTAM models the effect of electrical activity on growth and shows how that growth might implement Boolean computations. In this sense, given a set of input voltages, the bcTAM is a system that is able to monitor and make decisions about its own growth."
https://openalex.org/W4311586314,"In this study, we investigate large-scale digital forensic investigation on Apache Spark using a Windows registry. Because the Windows registry depends on the system on which it operates, the existing forensic methods on the Windows registry have been targeted on the Windows registry in a single system. However, it is a critical issue to analyze large-scale registry data collected from several Windows systems because it allows us to detect suspiciously changed data by comparing the Windows registry in multiple systems. To this end, we devise distributed algorithms to analyze large-scale registry data collected from multiple Windows systems on the Apache Spark framework. First, we define three main scenarios in which we classify the existing registry forensic studies into them. Second, we propose an algorithm to load the Windows registry into the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) for subsequent forensics. Third, we propose a distributed algorithm for each defined forensic scenario using Apache Spark operations. Through extensive experiments using eight nodes in an actual distributed environment, we demonstrate that the proposed method can perform forensics efficiently on large-scale registry data. Specifically, we perform forensics on 1.52 GB of Windows registry data collected from four computers and show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the processing time by up to approximately 3.31 times, as we increase the number of CPUs from 1 to 8 and the number of worker nodes from 2 to 8. Because the distributed algorithms on Apache Spark require the inherent network and MapReduce overheads, this improvement of the processing performance verifies the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4311586385,"COVID-19 infection is a global pandemic health emergency. This contagious disease was caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus‑2 (SARS‑CoV-2) which is mutating over time. In 2021, the Delta variant became the most dominant transmissible form. During the crisis, human practice and knowledge were critical in the overall efforts to encompass the outbreak. A cross-sectional, web-based approach was conducted among adults in Jordan to quantify knowledge, attitude, and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant). This research was carried out between 15 th April and 15 th of May 2021. The study questionnaire consisted of four sections including the participant’s demographics, knowledge, practices and attitude. Comparative evaluation of responses was accomplished using a scoring system. Respondents who scored above the mean score (60%) on the item measured were categorized as knowledgeable, having a positive attitude, and good practices. Participants were allocated to one of the three groups; medical, non-medical and others (unemployed and housewives). Data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 software. A variance test to assess the statistical difference between groups was used. Pearson’s chi-squared test was applied to compare the variables and identify significant predictors. Of the participants, 308 (66%) were in the age group of 18-25yrs, 392 (84.1%) females, 120 (25.8%) employed and 346 (74.2%) unemployed. The principle source of knowledge was social media (291, 62.4%). Interestingly, participants had adequate overall knowledge. The mean knowledge score was 22.6 (± 0.19), 20.6 (± 0.19), and 21.3 (± 0.18) for the medical, the non-medical and the others group, respectively. Also, participants showed a positive attitude and good practices towards SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant). The mean practice score for medical, the non-medical and the others groups was 7.35 (± 0.25), 7.38 (± 0.24), 7.35 (± 0.24) and the mean attitude score was 10.8 (± 0.16), 9.4 (± 0.21), 9.5 (± 0.22), respectively. The studied groups generally had good knowledge, positive attitudes and good practices about SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant). This was expected due to the authorities’ successful management of the pandemic and the high educational level of the Jordanian society, bearing in mind the economic and social impact of COVID-19 disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311587289,"Facial appearance reveals clues about personality. Studies have found that facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) correlates with some personality traits, and mandibular morphology as a potential facial feature that might have correlation with personality traits. Therefore, a face recognition study was carried out to explore the personality traits' correlation to both fWHR and bilateral mandibular line angles. Specifically, face images of 904 college students in China were collected and measured, with the personality traits evaluated using the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire. Analyses revealed that the average bilateral mandibular line angle of the male were significantly more extensive than that of the female, while the fWHR of the female was significantly more extensive than that of the male. We found facial features (fWHR and average bilateral mandibular line angle) were correlated with 16PF in the canonical correlation analysis and the loadings of bilateral mandibular line angles were greater than that of fWHR. The fWHR was significantly negatively correlated with the scores of sensitivity and self-reliance in male but none of the factors related to fWHR in female. The bilateral mandibular line angles were significantly negatively correlated with the scores of social boldness in male, and were significantly negatively correlated with the scores of vigilance and apprehension in female. Over all, the correlations between fWHR, average bilateral mandibular line angle and certain 16PF factors in male and female tend to be different, suggesting that such correlations might vary with gender. In the future, mandibular morphology could be selected as a potential indicator in facial perception. The limitations of this study were the participants were limited to 18-30 years of age and the mandibular morphology was not measured with anthropometry, which could be further improved in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4311587719,"Dog owners are usually in close contact with dogs. Whether dogs can affect the gut microbiota of elderly dog owners is worth studying. Data from 54 elderly (over 65 years of age) dog owners were screened from the American Gut Project. Owning a dog did not affect the α-diversity of the gut microbiota of the dog owner. Dog ownership significantly modulated the composition of the gut microbiota of the dog owner. The abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly increased. The abundances of Bifidobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae were significantly increased, while the abundance of Moracellaceae was significantly suppressed. In general, dog ownership can regulate the composition of gut microbiota and has a more significant effect on elderly males."
https://openalex.org/W4311590060,"Objective The prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is related to its severity and cardiovascular risk factors in both sexes. In women, social isolation, marital stress, sedentary lifestyle and depression predicted CAD progression and outcome within 3 to 5 years. We hypothesised that these behavioral factors would still be associated with all-cause mortality in female patients after 26 years. Methods We examined 292 patients with CAD and 300 healthy controls (mean age of 56 ± 7 y) within the Fem-Cor-Risk-Study at baseline. Their cardiac, behavioral, and psychosocial risk profiles, exercise, smoking, and dietary habits were assessed using standardized procedures. Physiological characteristics included a full lipid profile, the coagulation cascade and autonomic dysfunction (heart rate variability, HRV). A new exploratory analysis using machine-learning algorithms compared the effects of social and behavioral mechanisms with standard risk factors. Results: All-cause mortality records were completed in 286 (97.9%) patients and 299 (99.7%) healthy women. During a median follow-up of 26 years, 158 (55.2%) patients and 101 (33.9%) matched healthy controls died. The annualized mortality rate was 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively. After controlling for all available confounders, behavioral predictors of survival in patients were social integration (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99–1.0) and physical activity (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.79). Smoking acted as a predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03–2.36). Among healthy women, moderate physical activity (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.74) and complete HRV recordings (≥50%) were found to be significant predictors of survival. Conclusions CAD patients with adequate social integration, who do not smoke and are physically active, have a favorable long-term prognosis. The exact survival times confirm that behavioral risk factors are associated with all-cause mortality in female CAD patients and healthy controls."

We begin the model development in a rather unorthodox fashion. Patterns of brain activation regions are identified, across participants, at different time instance of the decision-making process. Region-wise activation knowledge from previous studies is used to put together the entire process model like a cognitive jigsaw puzzle. We find that there are indeed a common dynamic set of activation patterns that are consistent across people and apps. That is to say that not only are there consistent patterns of activation there is a consistent change from one pattern to another across time as people make the app adoption decision. Moreover, this pattern is clearly different for decisions that end in adoption than for decisions that end with no adoption."

https://openalex.org/W4311679838,"Background Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) for predicting dementia risk have mostly been used in people of European ancestry with limited testing in other ancestry groups. Methods We conducted a logistic regression with all-cause dementia as the outcome and z-standardised GRS as the exposure across diverse ethnic groups. Findings There was variation in frequency of APOE alleles across ethnic groups. Per standard deviation (SD) increase in z-GRS including APOE, the odds ratio (OR) for dementia was 1.73 (95%CI 1.69–1.77). Z-GRS excluding APOE also increased dementia risk (OR 1.21 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.18–1.24) and there was no evidence that ethnicity modified this association. Prediction of secondary outcomes was less robust in those not of European ancestry when APOE was excluded from the GRS. Interpretation z-GRS derived from studies in people of European ancestry can be used to quantify genetic risk in people from more diverse ancestry groups. Urgent work is needed to include people from diverse ancestries in future genetic risk studies to make this field more inclusive."
