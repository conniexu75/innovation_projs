https://openalex.org/W2117802141,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neurogenic niche in the adult mammalian brain. We found that the brain-enriched microRNA miR-124 is an important regulator of the temporal progression of adult neurogenesis in mice. Knockdown of endogenous miR-124 maintained purified SVZ stem cells as dividing precursors, whereas ectopic expression led to precocious and increased neuron formation. Furthermore, blocking miR-124 function during regeneration led to hyperplasias, followed by a delayed burst of neurogenesis. We identified the SRY-box transcription factor Sox9 as being a physiological target of miR-124 at the transition from the transit amplifying cell to the neuroblast stage. Sox9 overexpression abolished neuronal differentiation, whereas Sox9 knockdown led to increased neuron formation. Thus miR-124-mediated repression of Sox9 is important for progression along the SVZ stem cell lineage to neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2096201131,"Stefan Schulte-Merker and colleagues report that ccbe1, a predicted secreted protein, is required for embryonic lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish. Ccbe1 acts at the same stage as Vegfc, and is required for lymphangioblast budding and angiogenic sprouting from the venous endothelium. Lymphatic vessels have important roles in fluid homeostasis, fat absorption, inflammation and cancer metastasis and develop in a dynamic process (called lymphangiogenesis) involving budding, migration and proliferation of lymphangioblasts. Using a genetic screen in zebrafish we identify ccbe1 (collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain-1) as indispensible for embryonic lymphangiogenesis. Ccbe1 acts at the same stage of development as Vegfc and is required for lymphangioblast budding and angiogenic sprouting from venous endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2091117089,"John Stamatoyannopoulos, Shamil Sunyaev and colleagues report a correlation between mutation rate and replication timing in the human genome, observing an increased mutation rate in later-replicating regions. Eukaryotic DNA replication is highly stratified, with different genomic regions shown to replicate at characteristic times during S phase. Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome. All classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage. This correlation between mutation rate and regionally stratified replication timing may have substantial evolutionary implications."
https://openalex.org/W2047897062,"Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of related conditions characterized by the overproduction of cells from one or more myeloid lineages. More than 95% of cases of polycythemia vera, and roughly half of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis acquire a unique somatic 1849G>T JAK2 mutation (encoding V617F) that is believed to be a critical driver of excess proliferation. We report here that JAK2(V617F)-associated disease is strongly associated with a specific constitutional JAK2 haplotype, designated 46/1, in all three disease entities compared to healthy controls (polycythemia vera, n = 192, P = 2.9 x 10(-16); essential thrombocythemia, n = 78, P = 8.2 x 10(-9) and myelofibrosis, n = 41, P = 8.0 x 10(-5)). Furthermore, JAK2(V617F) specifically arises on the 46/1 allele in most cases. The 46/1 JAK2 haplotype thus predisposes to the development of JAK2(V617F)-associated MPNs (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 3.1-4.3) and provides a model whereby a constitutional genetic factor is associated with an increased risk of acquiring a specific somatic mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2037959451,"Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) characterized by multilineage clonal hematopoiesis. Given that the identical somatic activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase gene (JAK2(V617F)) is observed in most individuals with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, there likely are additional genetic events that contribute to the pathogenesis of these phenotypically distinct disorders. Moreover, family members of individuals with MPN are at higher risk for the development of MPN, consistent with the existence of MPN predisposition loci. We hypothesized that germline variation contributes to MPN predisposition and phenotypic pleiotropy. Genome-wide analysis identified an allele in the JAK2 locus (rs10974944) that predisposes to the development of JAK2(V617F)-positive MPN, as well as three previously unknown MPN modifier loci. We found that JAK2(V617F) is preferentially acquired in cis with the predisposition allele. These data suggest that germline variation is an important contributor to MPN phenotype and predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2072840386,"A growing number of orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to be activated by lipid ligands, such as lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and cannabinoids, for which there are already well established receptors. These new ligand claims are controversial due to either lack of independent confirmations or conflicting reports. We used the beta-arrestin PathHunter assay system, a newly developed, generic GPCR assay format that measures beta-arrestin binding to GPCRs, to evaluate lipid receptor and ligand pairing. This assay eliminates interference from endogenous receptors on the parental cells because it measures a signal that is specifically generated by the tagged receptor and is immediately downstream of receptor activation. We screened a large number of newly ""deorphaned"" receptors (GPR23, GPR92, GPR55, G2A, GPR18, GPR3, GPR6, GPR12, and GPR63) and control receptors against a collection of approximately 400 lipid molecules to try to identify the receptor ligand in an unbiased fashion. GPR92 was confirmed to be a lysophosphatidic acid receptor with weaker responses to farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. The putative cannabinoid receptor GPR55 responded strongly to AM251, rimonabant, and lysophosphatidylinositol but only very weakly to endocannabinoids. G2A receptor was confirmed to be an oxidized free fatty acid receptor. In addition, we discovered that 3,3'-diindolylmethane, a dietary molecule from cruciferous vegetables, which has known anti-cancer properties, to be a CB(2) receptor partial agonist, with binding affinity around 1 microm. The anti-inflammatory effect of 3,3'-diindolylmethane in RAW264.7 cells was shown to be partially mediated by CB(2)."
https://openalex.org/W2029630756,"Axon degeneration is an active process. Miller and colleagues show in fly and mouse models that axon degeneration requires the kinase DLK and its downstream target JNK to proceed. Axon degeneration underlies many common neurological disorders, but the signaling pathways that orchestrate axon degeneration are unknown. We found that dual leucine kinase (DLK) promoted degeneration of severed axons in Drosophila and mice, and that its target, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, promoted degeneration locally in axons as they committed to degenerate. This pathway also promoted degeneration after chemotherapy exposure and may be a component of a general axon self-destruction program."
https://openalex.org/W2081592335,"Neurons that produce dopamine as a neurotransmitter control a broad variety of brain functions, including motor control, cognition, motivation and pleasure. How precursor cells converge onto the dopaminergic fate across the vast diversity of developmental lineages involved in those functions has been unclear. Nuria Flames and Oliver Hobert now report that the regulatory protein AST-1 is necessary and sufficient to drive and maintain the terminal differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in the nematode C. elegans. As the protein and its terminal differentiation function are strikingly conserved in mice, the results have direct implications for stem-cell replacement strategies in dopamine-related disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The authors reveal that the regulatory protein AST-1 is necessary and sufficient to drive and maintain the terminal differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in C. elegans. Because the protein and its terminal differentiation function are strikingly conserved in mice, the results have direct implications for stem-cell replacement strategies in numerous dopamine-related disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. Dopamine signalling regulates a variety of complex behaviours, and defects in dopamine neuron function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as Parkinson’s disease1. The common denominator of all dopamine neurons is the expression of dopamine pathway genes, which code for a set of phylogenetically conserved proteins involved in dopamine synthesis and transport. Gene regulatory mechanisms that result in the direct activation of dopamine pathway genes and thereby ultimately determine the identity of dopamine neurons are poorly understood in all systems studied so far2. Here we show that a simple cis-regulatory element, the dopamine (DA) motif, controls the expression of all dopamine pathway genes in all dopaminergic cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans. The DA motif is activated by the ETS transcription factor AST-1. Loss of ast-1 results in the failure of all distinct dopaminergic neuronal subtypes to terminally differentiate. Ectopic expression of ast-1 is sufficient to activate the dopamine pathway in some cellular contexts. Vertebrate dopamine pathway genes also contain phylogenetically conserved DA motifs that can be activated by the mouse ETS transcription factor Etv1 (also known as ER81), and a specific class of dopamine neurons fails to differentiate in mice lacking Etv1. Moreover, ectopic Etv1 expression induces dopaminergic fate marker expression in neuronal primary cultures. Mouse Etv1 can also functionally substitute for ast-1 in C. elegans. Our studies reveal a simple and apparently conserved regulatory logic of dopamine neuron terminal differentiation and may provide new entry points into the diagnosis or therapy of conditions in which dopamine neurons are defective."

Here we show that blocking either beta- or gamma-secretase, enzymes required for production of Abeta from amyloid precursor protein (APP), can ameliorate motor and cognitive deficits and reduce cell loss after experimental TBI in mice. Thus, APP secretases are promising targets for treatment of TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2017883800,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) contain transformed, self-maintaining, multipotent, tumour-initiating cancer stem cells, whose identification has radically changed our perspective on the physiology of these tumours. Currently, it is unknown whether multiple types of transformed precursors, which display alternative sets of the complement of properties of true cancer stem cells, can be found in a GBM. If different subsets of such cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) do exist, they might represent distinct cell targets, with a differential therapeutic importance, also depending on their characteristics and lineage relationship. Here, we report the presence of two types of CSCs within different regions of the same human GBM. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis shows that the two types of CSCs bear quite diverse tumorigenic potential and distinct genetic anomalies, and, yet, derive from common ancestor cells. This provides critical information to unravel the development of CSCs and the key molecular/genetic components underpinning tumorigenicity in human GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W1998674325,"Correlated network activity is important in the development of many neural circuits. Purkinje cells are among the first neurons to populate the cerebellar cortex, where they sprout exuberant axon collaterals. We used multiple patch-clamp recordings targeted with two-photon microscopy to characterize monosynaptic connections between the Purkinje cells of juvenile mice. We found that Purkinje cell axon collaterals projected asymmetrically in the sagittal plane, directed away from the lobule apex. On the basis of our anatomical and physiological characterization of this connection, we constructed a network model that robustly generated waves of activity that traveled along chains of connected Purkinje cells. Consistent with the model, we observed traveling waves of activity in Purkinje cells in sagittal slices from young mice that require GABA(A) receptor-mediated transmission and intact Purkinje cell axon collaterals. These traveling waves are absent in adult mice, suggesting they have a developmental role in wiring the cerebellar cortical microcircuit."
https://openalex.org/W1981969443,"The kinase DYRK2 regulates the assembly of a ubiquitin ligase complex in a phosphorylation-independent manner, while also phosphorylating the target for the ligase. Thus, ligase assembly and target ubiquitylation appear to be physically linked processes. Protein kinases have central functions in various cellular signal transduction pathways through their substrate phosphorylation. Here we show that a protein kinase, DYRK2, has unexpected role as a scaffold for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. DYRK2 associates with an E3 ligase complex containing EDD, DDB1 and VPRBP proteins (EDVP complex). Strikingly, DYRK2 serves as a scaffold for the EDVP complex, because small-interfering-RNA-mediated depletion of DYRK2 disrupts the formation of the EDD–DDB1–VPRBP complex. Although the kinase activity of DYRK2 is dispensable for its ability to mediate EDVP complex formation, it is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its downstream substrate, katanin p60. Collectively, our results reveal a new type of E3-ubiquitin ligase complex in humans that depends on a protein kinase for complex formation as well as for the subsequent phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and degradation of their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2021728577,"Animals are remarkably efficient in absorbing dietary fat and assimilating this energy-dense nutrient into the white adipose tissue (WAT) for storage. Although this metabolic efficiency may confer an advantage in times of calorie deprivation, it contributes to obesity and associated metabolic disorders when dietary fat is abundant. Here we show that the intestinal lipid synthesis enzyme acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2) has a crucial role in the assimilation of dietary fat and the accretion of body fat in mice. Mice lacking MGAT2 have a normal phenotype on a low-fat diet. However, on a high-fat diet, MGAT2-deficient mice are protected against developing obesity, glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia and fatty livers. Caloric intake is normal in MGAT2-deficient mice, and dietary fat is absorbed fully. However, entry of dietary fat into the circulation occurs at a reduced rate. This altered kinetics of fat absorption apparently results in more partitioning of dietary fat toward energy dissipation rather than toward storage in the WAT. Thus, our studies identify MGAT2 as a key determinant of energy metabolism in response to dietary fat and suggest that the inhibition of this enzyme may prove to be a useful strategy for treating obesity and other metabolic diseases associated with excessive fat intake."

Deimination is critical for the degradation of filaggrin into free amino acids. In this study, we tried to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the cleavage of deiminated filaggrin in vitro. First, we investigated citrulline aminopeptidase activity in the extract of newborn rat epidermis by double layer fluorescent zymography and detected strong activity at neutral pH. Monitoring the citrulline-releasing activity, we purified an enzyme of 280 kDa, comprised of six identical subunits of 48 kDa. The NH2 terminus of representative tryptic peptides perfectly matched the sequence of rat bleomycin hydrolase (BH). The enzyme released various amino acids except Pro from β-naphthylamide derivatives and hydrolyzed citrulline-β-naphthylamide most effectively. Thus, to break down deiminated filaggrin, another protease would be required. Among proteases tested, calpain I degraded the deiminated filaggrin effectively into many peptides of different mass on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrum. We confirmed that various amino acids including citrulline were released by BH from those peptides. On the other hand, caspase 14 degraded deiminated filaggrin into a few peptides of limited mass. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human skin revealed co-localization of BH and filaggrin in the granular layer.

Each individual filaggrin repeat is completely removed by proteolysis to generate the mature filaggrin monomer (a molecular mass of 37 kDa in human). Then, filaggrin is completely degraded in the uppermost layer of the stratum corneum to produce a mixture of free and modified hygroscopic amino acids that are important for maintaining epidermal hydration (2Rawlings A.V.

In this study, we have purified a novel aminopeptidase using a deiminated substrate from rat skin homogenate and identified it as a neutral cysteine protease, bleomycin hydrolase (BH). Furthermore, we investigated the processing of the deiminated filaggrin by calpain I or caspase 14. Based on these results, we proposed that calpain I participated preferentially in the processing of deiminated filaggrin into peptides and then BH appeared essential for the breakdown of the peptides into amino acids.

Purification of an Enzyme with Citrulline Aminopeptidase Activity from Newborn Rat Skin—Newborn rat skin (2 days old, Sprague-Dawley rats) was homogenized first with 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm EDTA (buffer A) in a POLY-TRON system PT2100 (KINEMATICA AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) and then a second time in a glass homogenizer. The supernatant was fractionated by precipitation with 45–55% saturated ammonium sulfate. After the removal of insoluble materials, the clear solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.5 × 90 cm). After dialysis of the active fraction from the column developed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B), the sample was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 30 cm), and the column was washed with buffer B. The proteins were fractionated with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 350 mm in buffer B. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against buffer B. The dialysate was applied to a Mono Q column-equipped HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with the same buffer. Enzyme activity was specifically detected by measuring aminopeptidase activity using 2 mm Cit-β-NA during the course of preparation. The purified enzyme showed a single band of molecular mass 48 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Deimination of Filaggrin by mPAD3—Filaggrin (8.39 μm) was incubated with mPAD3 (0.17 μm) at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:50 at 37 °C for different periods in a buffer of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm DTT. After deimination for different periods, filaggrin (5.95 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with trypsin (0.03 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm CaCl2. The digestion was performed at a trypsin:filaggrin molar ratio of 1:200. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE according to the methods of Laemmli (55Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) using 12.5% gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB R-250). Degradation of Deiminated Filaggrin with Calpain I or Caspase 14—Filaggrin (8.39 μm) was deiminated at 37 °C overnight at mPAD3 (0.17 μm):filaggrin molar ratio of 1:50. The degradation of unmodified and deiminated filaggrin was performed at an enzyme:filaggrin molar ratio of 1:20 for all digests. Calpain I (0.32 μm) was incubated at 30 °C with filaggrin (6.31 μm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm DTT, whereas caspase 14 (0.32 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with filaggrin (6.31 μm) in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 60 mm NaCl, 0.01% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, and 1.1 m sodium citrate as a kosmotropic buffer. After incubation for an optimum period, the degradation product in the reaction mixture was detected by SDS-PAGE. A densitometric analysis of scanned gel images was performed by using the NIH ImageJ program on a Windows XP computer. The digests (1 μl) were mixed with the matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and applied to the sample target for MALDI-TOF MS. After air drying, MALDI-TOF MS was conducted using a Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in reflector mode. Analyses of Free Amino Acids Released from Peptides Treated with Calpain I or Caspase 14 by BH—The amounts of newly formed α-amino groups were measured using their reaction with fluorescamine (33Tamura N. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Tamura T. Cell. 1998; 95: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After the digestion of unmodified and deiminated filaggrin (6.31 μm) with calpain I (0.32 μm) or caspase 14 (0.32 μm) for 1 h at an enzyme:filaggrin molar ratio of 1:20, the digests treated with caspase 14 were filtrated by centrifugation with a Microcon YM-3 (Millipore) for the exclusion of kosmotropic salts and then adjusted the volume. The reaction products were incubated with BH (13.0 μm) in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at different times, and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by boiling. Samples were mixed with 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) and 50 μl of acetone solution of fluorescamine (0.3 mg/ml). The mixture was vortexed, and 500 μl of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0) was added. Fluorescence was measured fluorometrically (excitation = 370 nm, emission = 475 nm). The generated amino groups were estimated using several concentrations of l-leucine as a standard. After a 1-h degradation period with calpain I or caspase 14, enzymes and undegraded filaggrin were removed by filtration (Nanosep-10, Pall Gelman Sciences), and the flow-through fractions were incubated with BH overnight at 37 °C. Free amino acids were analyzed using a Hitachi model L-8800 amino acid analyzer equipped with columns (number 2622: 4.6 × 40 mm + 4.6 × 40 mm, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by gradient elution with MCI buffer L-8500-PF kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the physiological fluids analysis method. Amino acids post-labeled with ninhydrin were detected by measuring the absorbance at 440 and 570 nm. Immunohistochemistry—Human specimens were obtained from the informed healthy volunteers. They received detailed information about the study and gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by Sagami Women's University Ethical Committee and by the Shiseido Committee on Human Ethics. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with 5-μm-thick cryosections of human skin. After rehydration in PBS at room temperature, sections were incubated in a moist chamber for 30 min with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 and then overnight at 4 °C with the anti-rat BH IgG and monoclonal anti-human filaggrin IgG diluted in the same buffer. After four washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1/500) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1/500) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20. After four washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, sections were mounted in an antifading solution before observation under a confocal laser microscope (LSM 5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), with excitation at 488 and 543 nm by argon and He-Ne lasers, respectively. For negative controls, sections were incubated without primary antibodies. Amino Acid Sequence Analyses of Tryptic Peptides—After the enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity was dipyridylated, it was digested with trypsin (31Takeda A. Higuchi D. Yamamoto T. Nakamura Y. Masuda Y. Hirabayashi T. Nakaya K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The digested peptides were separated by a reverse-phase Shimadzu HPLC on an ODT-120T column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peak fractions detected by measuring the absorbance at 215 nm were collected in test tubes and lyophilized. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems model 120A PHT analyzer. Detection of Citrulline Aminopeptidase Activity with Double Layer Fluorescent Zymography—We analyzed exo- and endopeptidase activities using Cit-MCA and FRETS-25Cit libraries, respectively, in newborn rat epidermal extract by double layer fluorescent zymography. As shown in Fig. 1, strong citrulline aminopeptidase activity was detected in rat epidermal extract at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.5 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1, arrowhead). When rat kidney extract was analyzed, a faint band was detected at the same position at both pHs as well as strong activity with low mobility at pH 6.0 but not at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2, arrow). However, no endopeptidase activity against FRETS-25Cit libraries was detected (data not shown). These results suggested the presence of a novel enzyme with strong citrulline aminopeptidase activity at neutral pH in rat epidermal extract. Purification and Characterization of an Enzyme with Citrulline Aminopeptidase Activity from Newborn Rat Epidermis—A three-step protocol was developed using Sephacryl S-200, DEAE-Sepharose, and Mono Q, resulting in the 4,300-fold purification of an enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity from newborn rat epidermal extract. The purified enzyme revealed a single band with a molecular mass of about 48 kDa on SDS-PAGE and resolved as a single symmetrical peak with a molecular mass of about 280 kDa by gel filtration. These results suggested that the enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity is a hexameric protein. We examined the aminopeptidase properties of the enzyme by comparing its activity toward various aminoacyl-β-NA substrates (Fig. 2). The enzyme released different amino acids from the substrates, indicating a broad specificity, but it released no Pro and little Glu. Cit-β-NA was the best substrate for the aminopeptidase function of the enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk plots showed a linear relationship between 1/V (nmol/min/μg) and 1/[S] (mm) and gave a Km value of 1.85 mm and Vmax value of 4.30 nmol/min/μg. However, no activity was found toward any protein substrates including deiminated filaggrin, myelin basic protein, azocasein, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and cystatin A. This result suggested that the enzyme probably participates in the degradation of citrulline-containing peptides in vivo. We have analyzed a peptide map and the NH2-terminal amino acid residues of tryptic peptides of the purified enzyme. The digest of the enzyme obtained with trypsin was separated by reverse-phase HPLC as shown in Fig. 3A, in which six major peaks were designated as T1–T6 in order of elution. The NH2-terminal amino acid residues of the six peptides are summarized in Fig. 3B, indicating that each tryptic peptide, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6, coincided with the amino acid numbers 49–57, 203–212, 363–370, 406–415, 283–292, and 428–434, respectively, of the sequence of rat BH (34Joshua-Tor L. Johnston S.A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Ltd., New York and London2004: 1197-1201Google Scholar). When double layer fluorescent zymography was conducted using rat BH, strong activity was detected at the position where the band was observed in newborn rat epidermal extract at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1C, lane 3, arrowhead). In addition, citrulline aminopeptidase activity was usually coeluted with activity to hydrolyze bleomycin throughout the process of purification from newborn rat epidermis. It was found that the enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity was identical to BH in rat skin, which should show aminopeptidase activity rather than bleomycin hydrolase activity in the normal mammalian epidermis. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with cryosections of normal human skin allowed us to locate an enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity using anti-BH antibody and filaggrin in the granular layer of human epidermis (Fig. 4, B and C). Double staining using both antibodies revealed a convincing co-localization of BH and filaggrin in the granular layer (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Immunohistochemical localization of BH and filaggrin. Immunofluorescence staining for BH (red) and filaggrin (green) in paraffin-embedded sections of human skin tissue was performed. A, nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). B and C, paraffin-embedded sections of human skin tissue labeled with dual immunofluorescence were subjected to confocal microscopy. BH and filaggrin co-localized in the granular layer.

Magnification of ×40.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Degradation of Deiminated Filaggrin by Calpain I or Caspase 14—The recombinant filaggrin was purified from bacterial extract of Escherichia coli BL21 carrying pET-filaggrin, which contains 30 arginine residues (29Kanno T. Kawada A. Yamanouchi J. Yoshida-Noro C. Yoshiki A. Shiraiwa M. Kusakabe M. Manabe M. Tezuka T. Takahara H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was completely deiminated with mPAD3 that converted the guanidino side chain of arginine to the ureido side chain of citrulline, resulting in a change of mobility of the filaggrin band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A, arrow to arrowhead). The deiminated filaggrin after an appropriate incubation was digested by trypsin to confirm the conversion from arginine to citrulline (Fig. 5B). The deiminated filaggrin was resistant to trypsin digestion but was fragmented at two susceptible Lys residues as presumed from the presence of faint bands with a low molecular mass (Fig. 5B, asterisks). Then, we analyzed its degradation by calpain I or caspase 14. Fig. 6, A and B, show the time course of the decrease in the filaggrin and deiminated filaggrin bands on SDS-PAGE, respectively, with calpain I or caspase 14. The initial proteolysis of both substrates was very rapid, and about 70% of the substrate was degraded within 10 min, indicating that the two proteases seem to have a high degree of specificity toward unmodified and deiminated filaggrins. Furthermore, the deiminated filaggrin was more susceptible to calpain I than the unmodified filaggrin. These results suggested calpain I to be the best protease for the degradation of deiminated filaggrin.FIGURE 6Degradation of the deiminated filaggrin by calpain I or caspase 14. The degradation of the unmodified (closed circles) and deiminated (opened circles) filaggrin by calpain I (A) or caspase 14 (B) was analyzed at an enzyme: filaggrin molar ratio of 1:20 for all digests in vitro. Calpain I (0.32 μm) was incubated at 30 °C with filaggrin (6.31 μm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm DTT, whereas caspase 14 (0.32 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with it (6.31 μm) in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 60 mm NaCl, 0.01% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, and 1.1 m sodium citrate as a kosmotropic buffer. The extent of degradation was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by a densitometric analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the degradation of deiminated filaggrin by calpain I, we measured MALDI-TOF MS. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows the MS spectra at m/z 4,000–40,000 of the products from unmodified (A, C, and E) and deiminated (B, D, and F) filaggrin degraded by calpain I. In spectra obtained at the earliest time point, signals for 1+, 2+, and 3+ ions from both filaggrins can be seen (labeled A1+, A2+, and A3+ for unmodified filaggrin and B1+, B2+, and B3+ for deiminated filaggrin) as well as a few other ions (A and B). These signals disappeared, and many new signals appeared in the spectra of the products of both filaggrins digested for 60 min by calpain I (C–F), indicating that calpain I degraded the filaggrins into many peptides of different mass. Furthermore, the spectral pattern showed that deiminated filaggrin was degraded into shorter fragments than unmodified filaggrin by calpain I. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the MS spectra at m/z 3,500–15,000 of products from unmodified (A) and deiminated (B) filaggrins degraded by caspase 14. Caspase 14 degraded them into a few peptides of limited mass with slightly different patterns. These results indicated that calpain I acts preferentially on deiminated filaggrin when compared with caspase 14. Detection of Free Amino Acids Derived from Peptides of Deiminated Filaggrin Treated with Calpain I or Caspase 14—We investigated the free amino acids released from calpain I- or caspase 14-digested filaggrin peptides by BH using a fluorescamine post-labeling method and amino acid analysis. Free amino groups were released from the calpain I-digested filaggrin and deiminated filaggrin peptides treated with BH in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). The peptides derived from deiminated filaggrin were more susceptible to BH than those from filaggrin. Furthermore, serine, glycine, alanine, citrulline, threonine, and histidine, etc., composing deiminated filaggrin peptides, were released by BH (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, few amounts of free amino groups or amino acids were detected from the caspase 14-digested peptides treated by BH. These results suggest that calpain I and BH are essential for the breakdown of deiminated filaggrin peptides into amino acids. We identified and purified a novel enzyme with citrulline aminopeptidase activity in a rat epidermal homogenate. An unexpected result of the present study is that the enzyme is identical with rat BH, a bleomycin-detoxifying enzyme whose natural function and substrate are still unknown. Our finding suggests that BH plays an important role in the synthesis of free amino acids acting as NMFs from deiminated filaggrin peptides in the stratum corneum. BH is similar to a 20 S proteasome and also belongs to a family of self-compartmentalizing intracellular proteases (34Joshua-Tor L. Johnston S.A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Ltd., New York and London2004: 1197-1201Google Scholar, 35Berti P. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation and wide distribution of BH imply that the enzyme has a conserved cellular function. However, this function has remained enigmatic for many years. Recently, BH was shown to be involved in the post-translational processing of peptides for antigen presentation (36Stoltze L. Schirle M. Schwarz G. Schroter C. Thompson M.W. Hersh L.B. Kalbacher H. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and a protective mechanism against homocysteine toxicity (37Zimny J. Sikora M. Guranowski A. Lakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BH has been shown to interact with several proteins, such as cAMP-binding ectoprotein in yeast (38Niemer I. Muller G. Strobel G. Bandlow W. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the human homologue of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (39Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Di Sabella M.T. Lazo J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), human ribosomal proteins (40Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Di Sabella M.T. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7111-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and amyloid precursor protein (41Lefterov I.M. Koldamova R.P. Lazo J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the last case, we inferred that BH participated in the degradation of amyloid β-peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (42Kajiya A. Kaji H. Isobe T. Takeda A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Schwartz et al. (43Schwartz D.R. Homanics G.E. Hoyt D.G. Klein E. Abernethy J. Lazo J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4680-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that BH knockout newborn null mice displayed a mild and transient ichthyosis-like phenotype that strikingly resembles the phenotype of the filaggrin-deficient flaky tail ft/ft mouse mutant and also exhibited the tail auto-amputation phenotype (44Presland R.B. Boggess D. Lewis S.P. Hull C. Fleckman P. Sundberg J.P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 1072-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that BH has an important role in maintaining epidermal integrity. The novel enzyme exhibited mainly aminopeptidase activity with broad specificity toward aminoacyl-β-naphthylamide derivatives without Pro, among which Cit-β-NA was the most effective substrate at neutral pH. However, it had no activity toward any protein substrates including myelin basic protein, azocasein, bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, and cystatin A. The enzyme was co-localized with filaggrin in the upper layers of the stratum corneum, where it was present in large amounts, in mammalian skin (31Takeda A. Higuchi D. Yamamoto T. Nakamura Y. Masuda Y. Hirabayashi T. Nakaya K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Takeda A. Masuda Y. Yamamoto T. Hirabayashi T. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 2007; 141: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested that BH participated in the release of free amino acids including citrulline in peptides processed from deiminated filaggrin in mammalian skin. We proposed a reasonable scheme for the degradation of filaggrin as shown in Fig. 8. NMFs are present at high concentrations within corneocytes and represent up to 20–30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum (48Trianse S.J. Cosmetics Perfumery. 1974; 89: 57Google Scholar). By absorbing atmospheric water and dissolving in their own water, hygroscopic NMF components act as very efficient humectants (2Rawlings A.V. Harding C.R. Dermatol. Ther. 2004; 17: 43-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMFs consist primarily of amino acids or their derivatives such as pyrrolidine carboxylic acid and urocanic acid, together with lactic acid and urea, citrate, and sugars (49Cler E.J. Fourtanier A. Int. J. Cosmet. Sci. 1981; 3: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 50Scott I.R. Harding C.R. Barrett J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The calcium concentration is critical to epidermal differentiation and implicated in the expression and post-transcriptional modification of numerous proteins in the epidermis (51Bikle D.D. Pillai S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 3-19PubMed Google Scholar, 52Elias P.M. Nau P. Hanley K. Cullander C. Crumrine D. Bench G. Sideras-Haddad E. Mauro T. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 399-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PAD activity was significantly regulated by the calcium concentration during epidermal differentiation, where PAD1 and/or PAD3 probably participated in the deimination of filaggrin monomers, because of their potential co-localization demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy (53Senshu T. Kan S. Ogawa H. Manabe M. Asaga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1996; 225: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 54Mechin M.C. Enji M. Nachat R. Chavanas M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Serre G. Takahara H. Simon M. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1984-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which peptidase is involved in the degradation of deiminated filaggrin into its peptides and then into free amino acids. Our findings show that calpain I, a calcium-activated cysteine protease in cytoplasm, preferentially cleaved the deiminated filaggrin to peptides of low molecular masses when compared with filaggrin. Finally, those peptides were degraded into free amino acids by BH. The recent review summarized that caspase 14 is involved in the processing of filaggrin, not in the profilaggrin-processing pathway (16Denecker G. Ovaere P. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The present study revealed that caspase 14 processed the deiminated filaggrin into limited fragments because of aspartate residues at a specific cleavage site. However, there was no difference in susceptibility to caspase 14 with deimination, and also, few amounts of amino acids were released from caspase 14-digested peptides by BH. These results suggest that calpain I plays a major role in the processing of deiminated filaggrin into peptides. In conclusion, the results of these experiments have identified BH as essential for the degradation of the peptides derived from deiminated filaggrin into amino acids, although more work is needed to reveal the precise functional role of BH during terminal epidermal differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2053192881,"Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is an activator of soluble MMP-2. The activity of both MMPs is regulated by their physiological inhibitor TIMP-2. An MT1-MMP/MMP-2/TIMP-2 axis plays a key role in the invasive behavior of many cell types. Despite its importance, epigenetic control of this pro-invasive axis is insufficiently studied, and, as a result, its modification in a rational and clinically beneficial manner is exceedingly difficult. Therefore, we performed an epigenetic analysis of the MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 gene promoters in highly migratory glioblastoma cells and in low migratory breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. We determined, for the first time, that the epigenetic control leading to the transcriptional silencing of both MMPs includes hypermethylation of the corresponding CpG regions and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). In turn, undermethylation of the CpG islands and low levels of histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation are features of transcriptionally active MT1-MMP and MMP-2 genes in invasive cancer cells. Additional histone modifications we have analyzed, including H3ac and H3K4me2, are present in both transcriptionally active and inactive promoters of both MMPs. Histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation is likely to play no significant role in regulating MT1-MMP and MMP-2. The pattern of epigenetic regulation of TIMP-2 was clearly distinct from that of MMPs and included the coordinated methylation and demethylation of the two CpG regions in the promoter. Our results suggest that the epigenetic control plays an important role in both the balanced regulation of the MT1-MMP/MMP-2/TIMP-2 axis and the invasive behavior in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023461354,"We identified the first enzymes that use mycothiol and mycoredoxin in a thiol/disulfide redox cascade. The enzymes are two arsenate reductases from Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cg_ArsC1 and Cg_ArsC2), which play a key role in the defense against arsenate. In vivo knockouts showed that the genes for Cg_ArsC1 and Cg_ArsC2 and those of the enzymes of the mycothiol biosynthesis pathway confer arsenate resistance. With steady-state kinetics, arsenite analysis, and theoretical reactivity analysis, we unraveled the catalytic mechanism for the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in C. glutamicum. The active site thiolate in Cg_ArsCs facilitates adduct formation between arsenate and mycothiol. Mycoredoxin, a redox enzyme for which the function was never shown before, reduces the thiol-arseno bond and forms arsenite and a mycothiol-mycoredoxin mixed disulfide. A second molecule of mycothiol recycles mycoredoxin and forms mycothione that, in its turn, is reduced by the NADPH-dependent mycothione reductase. Cg_ArsCs show a low specificity constant of approximately 5 m(-1) s(-1), typically for a thiol/disulfide cascade with nucleophiles on three different molecules. With the in vitro reconstitution of this novel electron transfer pathway, we have paved the way for the study of redox mechanisms in actinobacteria."

We used small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated “knockdown” GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH1), the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme-recycling oxidized BH4 (7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2)), and studied the effects on eNOS regulation and biopterin metabolism in cultured aortic endothelial cells. Knockdown of either DHFR or GTPCH1 attenuated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced eNOS activity and NO production; these effects were recovered by supplementation with BH4. In contrast, supplementation with BH2 abolished VEGF-induced NO production. DHFR but not GTPCH1 knockdown increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increase in ROS production seen with siRNA-mediated DHFR knockdown was abolished either by simultaneous siRNA-mediated knockdown of eNOS or by supplementing with BH4. In contrast, addition of BH2 increased ROS production; this effect of BH2 was blocked by BH4 supplementation. DHFR but not GTPCH1 knockdown inhibited VEGF-induced dephosphorylation of eNOS at the inhibitory site serine 116; these effects were recovered by supplementation with BH4. These studies demonstrate a striking contrast in the pattern of eNOS regulation seen by the selective modulation of BH4 salvage/reduction versus de novo BH4 synthetic pathways. Our findings suggest that the depletion of BH4 is not sufficient to perturb NO signaling, but rather that concentration of intracellular BH2, as well as the relative concentrations of BH4 and BH2, together play a determining role in the redox regulation of eNOS-modulated endothelial responses. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a key redox-active cofactor in endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) catalysis and is an important determinant of NO-dependent signaling pathways.

NO is released by endothelial cells in response to diverse humoral, neural, and mechanical stimuli (1Arnal J.F. Dinh-Xuan A.T. Pueyo M. Darblade B. Rami J. Cell Mol.

Endothelial cell-derived NO activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to increased levels of cGMP and to smooth muscle relaxation. Blood platelets represent another key target for the actions of endothelium-derived NO (5Loscalzo J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar): platelet aggregation is inhibited by NO-induced guanylate cyclase activation. Many other effects of NO have been identified in cultured vascular cells and in vascular tissues, including the regulation of apoptosis, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, thrombosis, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and atherogenesis, among other cellular responses and (patho)physiological processes. The endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) is a membrane-associated homodimeric 135-kDa protein that is robustly expressed in endothelial cells (2Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J.

Similar to all the mammalian NOS isoforms, eNOS functions as an obligate homodimer that includes a cysteine-complex Zn2+ (zinc-tetrathiolate) at the dimer interface (8Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P.

The activity of eNOS is also regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites (11Shaul P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 749-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) that are differentially modulated following the activation of cell surface receptors by agonists such as insulin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (12He H.

The phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 activates eNOS, but phosphorylation at Thr-497 or Ser-116 is associated with inhibition of eNOS activity (13Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J.

The generation of NO by eNOS requires several redox-active cofactors, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), calmodulin, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which have key roles in the electron flow required for eNOS catalysis. If the flow of electrons within eNOS is disrupted, the enzyme is uncoupled from NO production and other redox-active products are generated, including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical (18Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1997; 237: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In vascular disease states such as diabetes, endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in NO bioactivity and by a concomitant increase in superoxide formation, while eNOS mRNA and protein levels are maintained or even increased. “Uncoupled” eNOS generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), shifting the nitroso-redox balance and having adverse consequences in the vascular wall (20Heller R. Werner-Felmayer G. Wener E.R. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2006; 62: 21-28Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several enzymes expressed in vascular tissues contribute to the production and efficient degradation of ROS, and an enhanced activity of oxidant enzymes and/or reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes may cause oxidative stress. Various agonists, pathological conditions, and therapeutic interventions lead to modulated expression and function of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes. However, the intimate relationship between intracellular redox state, eNOS regulation, and NO bioavailability remains incompletely characterized. BH4 is a key redox-active cofactor for activity of all NOS enzymes (21Cosentino F. Luscher T.F. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The exact role of BH4 in NOS catalysis is not yet completely defined, but this cofactor appears to facilitate electron transfer from the eNOS reductase domain and maintains the heme prosthetic group of the enzyme in its redox-active form (18Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 22Stuehr D.J.

Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and inhibits the formation of hydrogen peroxide or superoxide by uncoupled eNOS (18Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P.

Commun. 1997; 237: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes is accompanied a decrease in the abundance of bioactive BH4. Supplementation with BH4 has been shown to improve endothelial function in the models of diabetes and hypertension (25Moens A.L. Kass D.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 2439-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Katusic Z.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 28: H981-H986Google Scholar, 27Channon K.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, BH4 oxidation is seen in vascular cells in the setting of oxidative stress associated with diabetes (28Meininger C.J. Marinos R.S. Hatakeyama K. Martinez-Zaguilan R. Rojas J.D. Kelly K.A. Wu G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and hypertension (29Landmesser U. Dikalov S. Price S.R. McCann L. Fukai T. Holland S.M. Mitch W.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). BH4 can be formed either by a de novo biosynthetic pathway or by a salvage pathway. Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH1) catalyzes the conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. BH4 is generated by further steps catalyzed by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase (30Thorny B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTPCH1 appears to be the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis; overexpression of GTPCH1 is sufficient to augment BH4 levels in cultured endothelial cells (31Cai S. Alp N.J. McDonald D. Smith I. Kay J. Canevari L. Healeas S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the regeneration of BH4 from its oxidized form, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), in several cell types (30Thorny B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Werner-Felmayer G. Golderer G. Werner E.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). DHFR is mainly involved in folate metabolism and converts inactive BH2 back to BH4 and plays an important role in the metabolism of exogenously administered BH4. However, the relative contributions of endothelial GTPCH1 and DHFR to the modulation of eNOS-dependent pathways are incompletely understood. In these studies, we have used siRNA-mediated “knockdown” of GTPCH1 and DHFR to explore the relative roles of BH4 synthesis and recycling in the modulation of eNOS bioactivity, as well as in the regulation of NO-dependent signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Materials—Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Lipofectamine™ 2000, Amplex™ Red reagent, and most cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, and phospho-eNOS (Ser-1179) were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Polyclonal antibody against phospho-Ser-116-eNOS was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against eNOS and DHFR were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibody against GTPCH1 was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). The SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection reagents and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4), 7,8-dihydro-l-biopterin (BH2), and l-biopterin were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). VEGF was from Calbiochem. Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay kits from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Philadelphia, PA). Determinations of protein abundance using immunoblot analyses were quantitated using a ChemiImager HD4000 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma. Culture and Treatment of Cells—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in culture on gelatin-coated 100-mm culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) as described previously (33Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). BAECs are used for experiments between passages 6 and 8, and serum-starved overnight before experiments. Treatments with VEGF and preparation of cell lysates were performed as described previously (34Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32719-32729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with corresponding vehicle treatments as controls. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—Consistent with previous work (35Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we designed an siRNA duplex targeting bovine GTPCH1 mRNA (GTPCH1 siRNA, sequence 5′-CCGUGACGAGCACAAUGUU-3′, corresponding to bases 856–874 from the open reading frame of the bovine GTPCH1 mRNA; GenBank™ accession number XM_001251704.2). DHFR siRNA (sequence 5′-CCCAGAACAUGGGCAUCGGC-3′, corresponding to bases 527–546 from the open reading frame of the human DHFR mRNA; GenBank™ accession number NM_000791.3) was characterized in an earlier report (36Tai N. Schmitz J.C. Chen T.M. Chu E. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The nonspecific control siRNA 5′-AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGAC-dTdT-3′ was from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). We found that optimal conditions for siRNA knockdown involved transfecting BAECs when cells were at 50–70% confluence, and transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum; transfections with siRNA (30–45 nm) used Lipofectamine™ 2000 (0.15%, v/v) and followed protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Fresh medium was added 5 h after transfection, and experiments were typically conducted 48 h after transfection. Measurement of Intracellular Levels of Biopterins—Oxidized and reduced forms of biopterins were analyzed by the differential oxidation method of Fukushima and Nixon (37Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The whole procedure was performed in the dark. BAECs were washed and suspended in cold extract buffer (0.1 m phosphoric acid, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were removed by adding 35 μl of 2 m trichloroacetic acid to 300 μl of the extracts, followed by centrifugation. To determine total biopterins (BH4, BH2, and biopterin) by acid oxidation, 100 μl of cell extract was mixed with 15 μl of 0.2 m trichloroacetic acid and 15 μl of 1% iodine in 2% KI in 0.2 m trichloroacetic acid. To determine BH2 and biopterin by alkali oxidation, 15 μl of 1 m NaOH was added to 100 μl of extract, followed by addition of 15 μl of 1% iodine/2% KI in 3 m NaOH. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h in the dark, excess iodine was reduced by adding 25 μl of fresh ascorbic acid (20 mg/ml). After centrifugation, 10 μl of supernatant was injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent 1100 series, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a 150- × 0.32-mm ODS Hypersil column (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and couple to a helium-cadmium laser-induced highly sensitive fluorescent detector (325 nm laser, series 56, Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA; ZETALIF detector, Model LIF-SA-03, Picometrics, Ramonville, France), as described in Ref. 38Levy B.D. Bonnans C. Silverman E.S. Palmer L.J. Marigowda G. Israel E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 172: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar. The mobile phase was methanol:doubly distilled H2O (5:95, v/v) with a flow rate of 400 μl/min that was reduced to 4 μl/min with a precolumn flow splitter (100:1, series 620, Analytical Scientific Instruments, El Sobrante, CA) before laser-induced fluorescence detection. The criteria used for identification of biopterin were fluorescence, and retention time was compared with the standards. BH4 concentration, expressed as picomoles per milligram of protein, was calculated by subtracting BH2 plus biopterin from total biopterins. eNOS Activity Assay—eNOS activity was quantified as the formation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine as described before (16Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions are initiated by adding l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, diluted with unlabeled l-arginine to give a final concentration of 10 μm) plus various drug treatments; each treatment was performed in triplicate cultures, which were analyzed in duplicate. Measurement of NO–2—NO production from cells was measured by using an NO sensor (BioStat, ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA). Cell culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and various drugs were added as indicated. After incubation for varying times, aliquots were removed and added to the reagent solution (100 mm H2SO4, 100 mm NaI) with the NO sensor. The amount of redox current generated is directly proportional to the NO–2 concentration in the solution. The absolute NO–2 concentrations were calculated against a standard curve prepared by using NaNO2 solution. Cells were then harvested to determine protein concentration, permitting NO–2 production to be reported as picomoles per mg of protein. Measurement of H2O2—H2O2 production from cells was quantitated using the Amplex™ Red fluorescence assay using previously described methods (39Rinaldi M. Moroni P. Paapa M.J. Bannerman D.D. Vet. Immunol. Imuunopathol. 2007; 115: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium was replaced with Amplex Red reaction mixture, which consists of 50 μm Amplex Red, 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (10 units/ml superoxide dismutase is sufficient to convert all cell-derived superoxide to hydrogen peroxide; data not shown). After incubation for varying times as indicated, aliquots were withdrawn and fluorescence was quantitated using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (JY-Spex, Edison, NJ) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The absolute H2O2 concentrations were calculated against a standard curve prepared by using H2O2 solution. Cells were then harvested to determine protein concentration, permitting H2O2 production to be reported as picomoles per mg of protein. Immunoblot Analysis—BAEC lysates were prepared using a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Immunoblot analyses of endothelial protein expression and phosphorylation were assessed as described previously in detail (34Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32719-32729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Quantitative densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed using a ChemiImager HD4000 (AlphaInnotech). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for individual experiments are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed by ANOVA or t test when appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of DHFR and GTPCH1 Expression in BAECs—To selectively knockdown the expression of DHFR and GTPCH1 protein in BAECs, we transfected siRNA duplex-targeting constructs, as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” After validating the specificity of these DHFR and GTPCH1 siRNA constructs and optimizing experimental conditions for optimal protein knockdown, we determined the effects of “double knockdown” of these proteins transfecting both DHFR and GTPCH1 siRNA-targeting constructs in BAECs (Fig. 1). We analyzed immunoblots probed for DHFR, GTPCH1, or β-actin in cells transfected with DHFR siRNA and/or GTPCH1 siRNA constructs; the same quantity of siRNA was used in each transfection using nonspecific siRNA as indicated. DHFR protein expression was efficiently and specifically knocked down by transfection with DHFR siRNA, co-transfected either with control siRNA or GTPCH1-specific siRNA. Similarly, GTPCH1 expression was efficiently knocked down by transfection with GTPCH1 siRNA along with either control siRNA or DHFR-specific siRNA. Co-transfection of the DHFR siRNA along with GTPCH1 siRNA targeting constructs led to marked knockdown of both proteins. Under all experimental conditions, the levels of β-actin protein in cell lysates remained unchanged; as can be seen in this and subsequent figures and as noted in a prior report (36Tai N. Schmitz J.C. Chen T.M. Chu E. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), expression of other endothelial proteins was not affected by transfection of DHFR and/or GTPCH1 siRNA-targeting constructs. Intracellular Levels of BH4 and BH2 in siRNA-transfected BAECs—We next determined the intracellular concentrations of biopterins following siRNA-mediated knockdown of DHFR or GTPCH1 to determine the effects of these knockdowns on pterin metabolites (Table 1). As would be anticipated from its critical role in pterin synthesis, GTPCH1 knockdown markedly decreased the intracellular concentration of total biopterins, including BH4 and BH2 (82 ± 1% decrease compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, n = 3, p < 0.01), whereas the ratio of BH4 to BH2 was not affected (Fig. 2). On the other hand, DHFR knockdown significantly decreased the intracellular BH4 level (56 ± 10% decrease in BH4 concentration compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, n = 3, p < 0.01), with no significant change in the amount of total cellular biopterins (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2, the percentage of BH4 relative to total cellular biopterins was 79 ± 9% in control siRNA-transfected cells; 28 ± 11% in DHFR-knockdown cells (p < 0.01 compared with control cells); and 74 ± 9% in GTPCH1-knockdown cells (p not significantly different from control), respectively. These data indicate that DHFR siRNA-mediated suppression of the BH4 recycling pathway results in a relative increase in cellular BH2 levels. Because a number of studies have shown that administration of BH4 acutely improve endothelial function, we examined the effects of supplementation of BAECs with BH4 and BH2 on the intracellular levels of biopterins. As shown in Table 1, supplementation with BH4 (10 μm for 1 h) induced marked increases in total intracellular biopterins in treated cells. The decrease in BH4 levels seen with siRNA-mediated DHFR knockdown was recovered to the same levels as control cells following supplementation with BH4, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Supplementation with BH2 (10 μm, 1 h) also yielded marked increases in the levels of total biopterins (Table 1). However, as shown in Fig. 2, the proportion of BH4 in the BH2-treated cells was significantly and uniformly decreased compared with BH4-supplemented cells (n = 3, p < 0.01), independent of siRNA transfection (Table 1).TABLE 1Intracellular levels of biopterins in siRNA-transfected endothelial cells supplemented with BH4 or BH2SupplementBiopterins concentrationControl siRNADHFR siRNAGTPCH1 siRNA[Total biopterin][BH4][Total biopterin][BH4][Total biopterin][BH4]pmol/mg proteinVehicle3.8 ± 0.53.0 ± 0.34.6 ± 1.31.3 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 versus the BH4 concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells supplemented with vehicle (p values determined by ANOVA).0.7 ± 0.1bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.0.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 versus the BH4 concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells supplemented with vehicle (p values determined by ANOVA).BH422.5 ± 3.3bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.18.7 ± 3.6ap < 0.01 versus the BH4 concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells supplemented with vehicle (p values determined by ANOVA).20.4 ± 3.1bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.14.4 ± 2.3ap < 0.01 versus the BH4 concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells supplemented with vehicle (p values determined by ANOVA).23.4 ± 6.6bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.20.2 ± 5.3ap < 0.01 versus the BH4 concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells supplemented with vehicle (p values determined by ANOVA).BH217.7 ± 3.6bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.6.6 ± 3.519.1 ± 2.8bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins concentration in control siRNA-transfected cells incubated with vehicle.2.5 ± 2.020.1 ± 3.2bp < 0.01 versus total biopterins con"
https://openalex.org/W2032087224,"The homothallic ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans serves as model organism for filamentous fungi because of its ability to propagate with both asexual and sexual life cycles, and fatty acid-derived substances regulate the balance between both cycles. These so-called psi (precocious sexual inducer) factors are produced by psi factor-producing oxygenases (Ppo enzymes). Bioinformatic analysis predicted the presence of two different heme domains in Ppo proteins: in the N-terminal region, a fatty acid heme dioxygenase/peroxidase domain is predicted, whereas in the C-terminal region, a P450 heme thiolate domain is predicted. To analyze the reaction catalyzed by Ppo enzymes, PpoA was expressed in Escherichia coli as an active enzyme. The protein was purified by 62-fold and identified as a homotetrameric ferric heme protein that metabolizes mono- as well as polyunsaturated C(16) and C(18) fatty acids at pH approximately 7.25. The presence of thiolate-ligated heme was confirmed on the basis of sequence alignments and the appearance of a characteristic 450 nm CO-binding spectrum. Studies on its reaction mechanism revealed that PpoA uses different heme domains to catalyze two separate reactions. Within the heme peroxidase domain, linoleic acid is oxidized to (8R)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid by abstracting a H-atom from C-8 of the fatty acid, yielding a carbon-centered radical that reacts with molecular dioxygen. In the second reaction step, 8-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid is isomerized within the P450 heme thiolate domain to 5,8-dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acid. We identify PpoA as a bifunctional P450 fusion protein that uses a previously unknown reaction mechanism for forming psi factors."
https://openalex.org/W2078908135,"Aberrant expression of cyclin D1 protein is a common feature of breast cancer. However, the CCND1 gene encodes two gene products, cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b, which have discrete mechanisms of regulation and impact on cell behavior. A polymorphism at nucleotide 870 in the CCND1 gene, rs603965, influences the relative production of the encoded proteins and can impart increased risk for tumor development. Here, the impact of both the G/A870 polymorphism and cyclin D1b protein production on breast cancer risk, disease phenotype and patient outcome was analysed. In a large multiethnic case–control study, the G/A870 polymorphism conferred no significant risk for breast cancer overall or by stage or estrogen receptor (ER) status. However, the cyclin D1b protein was found to be upregulated in breast cancer, independent of cyclin D1a levels, and exhibited heterogeneous levels in breast cancer specimens. High cyclin D1a expression inversely correlated with the Ki67 proliferation marker and was not associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, elevated cyclin D1b expression was independently associated with adverse outcomes, including recurrence, distant metastasis and decreased survival. Interestingly, cyclin D1b was particularly associated with poor outcome in the context of ER-negative breast cancer. Thus, specific cyclin D1 isoforms are associated with discrete forms of breast cancer and high cyclin D1b protein levels hold prognostic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1986400564,"Background There is accumulating evidence that in some marine environments aerobic bacteriochlorophyll a-producing bacteria represent a significant part of the microbial population. The interaction of photosynthesis and carbon metabolism in these interesting bacteria is still largely unknown and requires further investigation in order to estimate their contribution to the marine carbon cycle. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we analyzed the structure, composition and regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus in the obligately aerobic marine gammaproteobacterium KT71T. Photoheterotrophically grown cells were characterized by a poorly developed lamellar intracytoplasmic membrane system, a type 1 light-harvesting antenna complex and a photosynthetic reaction center associated with a tetraheme cytochrome c. The only photosynthetic pigments produced were bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin. Under semiaerobic conditions KT71T cells expressing a photosynthetic apparatus showed a light-dependent increase of growth yield in the range of 1.3–2.5 fold. The expression level of the photosynthetic apparatus depended largely on the utilized substrate, the intermediary carbon metabolism and oxygen tension. In addition, pigment synthesis was strongly influenced by light, with blue light exerting the most significant effect, implicating that proteins containing a BLUF domain may be involved in regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Several phenotypic traits in KT71T could be identified that correlated with the assumed redox state of growing cells and thus could be used to monitor the cellular redox state under various incubation conditions. Conclusions/Significance In a hypothetical model that explains the regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus in strain KT71T we propose that the expression of photosynthesis genes depends on the cellular redox state and is maximal under conditions that allow a balanced membrane redox state. So far, bacteria capable of an obligately aerobic, photosynthetic metabolism constitute a unique phenotype within the class Gammaproteobacteria, so that it is justified to propose a new genus and species, Congregibacter litoralis gen. nov, sp. nov., represented by the type strain KT71T ( = DSM 17192T = NBRC 104960T)."

Also, Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein promoted dynein motor complex, late endosome and vRNA clustering at the MTOC suggesting that the dynein motor and late endosomes were involved in vRNA trafficking. To investigate the role of the dynein motor in vRNA trafficking, dynein motor function was disrupted by small interference RNA-mediated depletion of the dynein heavy chain or by p50/dynamitin overexpression. These treatments led to a marked relocalization of vRNA and viral structural protein Gag to the cell periphery with late endosomes and a severalfold increase in HIV-1 production. In contrast, rerouting vRNA to the MTOC reduced virus production. vRNA localization depended on Gag membrane association as shown using both myristoylation and Gag nucleocapsid domain proviral mutants. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic localization of vRNA and Gag was not attributable to intracellular or internalized endocytosed virus particles. Our results demonstrate that dynein motor function is important for regulating Gag and vRNA egress on endosomal membranes in the cytoplasm to directly impact on viral production.

https://openalex.org/W2059921810,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) functions as both a mitogen and a patterning agent during development. Looking mainly at the developing mouse cerebellum, this study shows that the mitogenic activity, but not the patterning role, requires Shh to interact with proteoglycans. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) has dual roles in vertebrate development, promoting progenitor cell proliferation and inducing tissue patterning. We found that the mitogenic and patterning functions of Shh can be uncoupled from one another. Using a genetic approach to selectively inhibit Shh-proteoglycan interactions in a mouse model, we found that binding of Shh to proteoglycans was required for proliferation of neural stem/precursor cells, but not for tissue patterning. Shh-proteoglycan interactions regulated both spatial and temporal features of Shh signaling. Proteoglycans localized Shh to specialized mitogenic niches and also acted at the single-cell level to regulate the duration of Shh signaling, thereby promoting a gene expression program that is important for cell division. Because activation of the Shh pathway is a feature of diverse human cancers, selective stimulation of proliferation by Shh-proteoglycan interactions may also figure prominently in neoplastic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2088032208,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 promotes ultraviolet (UV)-triggered long-term detrimental effects such as cancer formation and premature skin aging. Although histone modifications may play a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-1, the relationship between UV-induced histone modification and MMP-1 expression is not completely understood. Here, we identify regulators of histone acetylation that may link UV-mediated DNA damage and MMP-1 induction by UV in cultured human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in vitro. UV irradiation of HDFs induced MMP-1 expression and increased the level of phosphorylation of H2AX (gamma-H2AX), p53 and the acetylation of histone H3 (acetyl-H3). Total histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was decreased by UV irradiation, while histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity was increased. Suppression of p300 histone acetyltransferase (p300HAT) activity by the p300HAT inhibitor anacardic acid (AA) or by down-regulation of p300 by siRNA prevented UV-induced MMP-1 expression and inhibited UV-enhanced gamma-H2AX, p53 level, and acetyl-H3. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that gamma-H2AX, p53, acetyl-H3, p300 and c-Jun were consistently recruited by UV to a distinct region (-2067/-1768) adjacent to the p300 binding site (-1858/-1845) in the MMP-1 promoter. In addition, these recruitments of gamma-H2AX, p53, acetyl-H3, p300 and c-Jun to the p300-2 site were significantly abrogated by post-treatment with AA. Furthermore, overexpression of p300 increased the basal and UV-induced MMP-1 promoter activity. Our results suggest that p300HAT plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-1 by UV."

Here, we show that TRAF1 inhibits TNFR2-induced proteasomal degradation of TRAF2 and relieves TNFR1-induced activation of NFκB from the inhibitory effect of TNFR2. TRAF1 co-recruited with TRAF2 to both TNF receptors. Despite lacking an amino-terminal RING/zinc-finger domain, TRAF1 did not interfere with TNFR1-induced activation of JNK and NFκB. It is noted that physiological expression levels of TRAF1 enhanced NFκB activation and interleukin-8 (IL8) production induced by TNFR2. Thus, TRAF1 shifts the quality of integrated TNFR1–TNFR2 signaling from apoptosis induction to proinflammatory NFκB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2085135960,"Background Plasmids that encode certain subtypes of the botulinum neurotoxin type B have recently been detected in some Clostridium botulinum strains. The objective of the present study was to investigate the frequency with which plasmid carriage of the botulinum neurotoxin type B gene (bont/B) occurs in strains of C. botulinum type B, Ab, and A(B), and whether plasmid carriage is bont/B subtype-related. Methodology/Principal Findings PCR-Restriction fragment length polymorphism was employed to identify subtypes of the bont/B gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization with specific probes were performed to analyze the genomic location of the bont/B subtype genes. All five known bont/B subtype genes were detected among the strains; the most frequently detected subtype genes were bont/B1 and /B2. Surprisingly, the bont/B subtype gene was shown to be plasmid-borne in >50% of the total strains. The same bont/B subtype gene was associated with the chromosome in some strains, whereas it was associated with a plasmid in others. All five known bont/B subtype genes were in some cases found to reside on plasmids, though with varying frequency (e.g., most of the bont/B1 subtype genes were located on plasmids, whereas all but one of the bont/B2 subtypes were chromosomally-located). Three bivalent isolates carried both bont/A and /B genes on the same plasmid. The plasmids carrying the bont gene were five different sizes, ranging from ∼55 kb to ∼245 kb. Conclusions/Significance The unexpected finding of the widespread distribution of plasmids harboring the bont/B gene among C. botulinum serotype B strains provides a chance to examine their contribution to the dissemination of the bont genes among heterogeneous clostridia, with potential implications on issues related to pathogenesis and food safety."
https://openalex.org/W2052850585,"Understanding the activation mechanism of Cys loop ion channel receptors is key to understanding their physiological and pharmacological properties under normal and pathological conditions. The ligand-binding domains of these receptors comprise inner and outer β-sheets and structural studies indicate that channel opening is accompanied by conformational rearrangements in both β-sheets. In an attempt to resolve ligand-dependent movements in the ligand-binding domain, we employed voltage-clamp fluorometry on α1 glycine receptors to compare changes mediated by the agonist, glycine, and by the antagonist, strychnine. Voltage-clamp fluorometry involves labeling introduced cysteines with environmentally sensitive fluorophores and inferring structural rearrangements from ligand-induced fluorescence changes. In the inner β-sheet, we labeled residues in loop 2 and in binding domain loops D and E. At each position, strychnine and glycine induced distinct maximal fluorescence responses. The pre-M1 domain responded similarly; at each of four labeled positions glycine produced a strong fluorescence signal, whereas strychnine did not. This suggests that glycine induces conformational changes in the inner β-sheet and pre-M1 domain that may be important for activation, desensitization, or both. In contrast, most labeled residues in loops C and F yielded fluorescence changes identical in magnitude for glycine and strychnine. A notable exception was H201C in loop C. This labeled residue responded differently to glycine and strychnine, thus underlining the importance of loop C in ligand discrimination.

Glycine (Ajax Finechem, Seven Hills, Australia) was dissolved in water and stored at 4 °C. Strychnine (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at −20 °C. Sulforhodamine methanethiosulfonate (MTSR) and 2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine) carboxylamino)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). Alexa Fluor 546 C5 maleimide (AF546) and tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (TMRM) were purchased from Invitrogen. MTSR, MTS-TAMRA, and TMRM were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. AF546 was dissolved in water on the day of the experiment and stored on ice for up to 6 h. Human GlyR α1 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEMHE vector. All of the constructs generated in this study were made on the α1 GlyR C41A background to eliminate the only uncross-linked extracellular cysteine. QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate all of the cysteine mutants used in this study. Automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence confirmed successful incorporation of the mutations. Capped mRNA for oocyte injection was generated using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes from female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, France) were prepared as previously described (31.Pless S.A. Dibas M.I. Lester H.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol.

The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C for 3–10 days in an incubation solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm theophylline, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Cambrex Corporation, East Rutherford, NJ), pH 7.4. On the day of recording, the oocytes were transferred into ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 10–20 μm of the dye. Typical labeling times were 30 s for MTSR and MTS-TAMRA (on ice), 30 min for TMRM (on ice), or 45 min for AF546 (at room temperature). The oocytes were then thoroughly washed and stored in ND96 for up to 6 h on ice before recording. All four sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophores employed in this study respond with an increase in quantum efficiency as the hydrophobicity of their environment is increased (27.Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat.

Each cysteine mutant was incubated with all four fluorophores in turn, and the one yielding the largest fluorescence change (ΔF) upon agonist application was analyzed. Fig. 1 shows a model of the GlyR LBD showing the positions of successfully labeled residues. Because wild type GlyRs never exhibited a ΔF or a change in electrophysiological properties following fluorophore incubation (see Table 1), we can rule out nonspecific effects of the labels.TABLE

Open table in a new tab The experimental set up has recently been described in detail (31.Pless S.A. Dibas M.I. Lester H.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36057-36067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, an inverted fluorescence microscope was equipped with a high-Q tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT), a Plan Fluor 40× objective lens (Nikon Instruments, Kawasaki, Japan), and a PhotoMax 200 photodiode (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN) with a xenon lamp as light source (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The recording chamber is described in detail in Ref. 28.Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10195-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. The cells were voltage-clamped at −40 mV, and currents were recorded with a Gene Clamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Current and fluorescence traces were acquired at 200 Hz via a Digidata 1322A interface using Clampex 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). Fluorescence signals were digitally filtered at 1–2 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter for analysis and display. Half-maximal concentrations (EC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values for ligand-induced activation of current and fluorescence were obtained using the Hill equation fitted with a nonlinear least squares algorithm (SigmaPlot 9.0, Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). All of the results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. The spectral analysis methodology has previously been explained in detail (31.Pless S.A. Dibas M.I. Lester H.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36057-36067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, the photodiode was replaced by a MicroSpec 2150i spectrometer (Acton Research Corporation, Acton, MA) coupled to an ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and operated using SpectraPro Monochromator Software (Acton Research Corporation, Acton, MA). For excitation, a HQ535/50× filter was used in combination with a Q565LP dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and no emission filter. The region of interest was aligned with the slit of the spectrometer and reflected onto the grating (300 g/mm; 500-nm blaze). The extracted spectrum was imaged on the ORCA-ER CCD using MetaMorph 6.2 (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downington, PA). The x axis of the resulting “spectral image” represents the wavelength dimension, whereas the y axis represents the one-dimensional spatial dimension of the slit. The results from six oocytes were averaged and not subjected to further filtering. The loop E domain in the inner β-sheet forms a β-strand that lines the agonist-binding site (3.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). VCF studies showed that loop E residues of GABAA receptor subunits report structural rearrangements that are correlated with channel activation (27.Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30.Muroi Y. Czajkowski C. Jackson M.B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7013-7022Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The corresponding GlyR mutants, L127C and R122C, were both investigated in the present study. The location of L127C is indicated in Fig. 1. The L127C mutation resulted in a large decrease in glycine sensitivity that decreased further following labeling with MTS-TAMRA (Table 1). The MTS-TAMRA-labeled L127C mutant GlyR responded with large (∼50%) ΔF increases during glycine-mediated activation (Fig. 2A). As previously suggested (30.Muroi Y. Czajkowski C. Jackson M.B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7013-7022Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35.Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this increased fluorescence is consistent with the idea of a ligand-induced closure of the agonist-binding site. Consistent with both previous studies (27.Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30.Muroi Y. Czajkowski C. Jackson M.B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7013-7022Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we found the glycine sensitivity of the change in current (ΔI) and ΔF responses to be identical (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Note that the deactivation kinetics often appeared different for ΔF and ΔI signals from the same oocyte (Fig. 2A). Because current was recorded from the entire oocyte, whereas fluorescence recorded from a small membrane portion, these effects may have been due to nonuniform solution exchange profiles around the oocyte. Application of the competitive antagonist strychnine in the absence of glycine also evoked large ΔF signals (Fig. 2C). These signals exhibited a mean EC50 of 280 ± 22 nm, an nH of 1.1 ± 0.1, and a ΔFmax of 147 ± 43% (n = 5 cells). Because the strychnine ΔFmax was three times greater than that produced by a saturating glycine concentration (Fig. 2D), it is likely that the two compounds induced distinct structural changes. To further test this possibility, we performed a spectroscopic analysis of the fluorescence signal before, during, and after the application of glycine or strychnine (Fig. 2E). We found that glycine application increased the quantum yield but did not significantly shift the emission peak (compared with the emission peak before glycine application). However, strychnine application produced both an increase in quantum yield and a ∼4-nm blue shift in the emission spectrum (Fig. 2F). This highly significant difference (p < 0.001) suggests that glycine-induced conformational changes are mainly evoked by dequenching, whereas strychnine-induced movements also result in an increased hydrophobicity in the fluorophore environment. This finding supports the idea of ligand-specific conformational changes at L127C. Labeling with MTSR produced similar results to MTS-TAMRA, although AF546 and TMRM produced no significant glycine-dependent ΔF (n = 3–5 cells each). Although the AF546-labeled E122C in the GABAA receptor β2 subunit produces ΔF responses that correlate well with channel activation (30.Muroi Y. Czajkowski C. Jackson M.B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7013-7022Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the corresponding GlyR mutant (R122C) did not give rise to a significant ΔF with any of the four fluorophores. Like loop E, loop D is a β-strand on the inner β-sheet. A portion of this strand contributes to the complementary (−) side of the GlyR-binding pocket (36.Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Because Phe63 and Arg65 in loop D are important residues for ligand binding (36.Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 37.Pless S.A. Millen K.S. Hanek A.P. Lynch J.W. Lester H.A. Lummis S.C. Dougherty D.A. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the adjacent residues on the same side of the β-strand, Q67C and N69C, may report on conformational rearrangements during agonist and antagonist binding. Introduction of the Q67C mutation led to a minor increase in the current EC50, which increased further after incubation with MTS-TAMRA (Table 1). Glycine application to Q67C-injected oocytes labeled w"

SLS is a key virulence determinant and responsible for the beta-hemolytic phenotype of these bacteria. Despite over a century of research, the chemical structure of SLS remains unknown. Recent experiments have revealed that SLS is generated from an inactive precursor peptide that undergoes extensive post-translational modification to an active form. In this work, we address outstanding questions regarding the SLS biosynthetic process, elucidating the features of substrate recognition and sites of posttranslational modification to the SLS precursor peptide. Further, we exploit these findings to guide the design of artificial cytolytic toxins that are recognized by the SLS biosynthetic enzymes and others that are intrinsically cytolytic. This new structural information has ramifications for future antimicrobial therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1999462877,"Observations of material and cellular systems in response to time-varying chemical stimuli can aid the analysis of dynamic processes. We describe a microfluidic ""chemical signal generator,"" a technique to apply continuously varying chemical concentration waveforms to arbitrary locations in a microfluidic channel through feedback control of the interface between parallel laminar (co-flowing) streams. As the flow rates of the streams are adjusted, the channel walls are exposed to a chemical environment that shifts between the individual streams. This approach can be used to probe the dynamic behavior of objects or substances adherent to the interior of the channel. To demonstrate the technique, we exposed live fibroblast cells to ionomycin, a membrane-permeable calcium ionophore, while assaying cytosolic calcium concentration. Through the manipulation of the laminar flow interface, we exposed the cells' endogenous calcium handling machinery to spatially-contained discrete and oscillatory intracellular disturbances, which were observed to elicit a regulatory response. The spatiotemporal precision of the generated signals opens avenues to previously unapproachable areas for potential investigation of cell signaling and material behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1994135664,"GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a required cofactor for nitricoxide synthases and aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Alterations of GTPCH activity and BH4 availability play an important role in human disease. GTPCH expression is regulated by inflammatory stimuli, in association with reduced expression of GTP cyclohydrolase feedback regulatory protein (GFRP). However, the relative importance of GTPCH expression versus GTPCH activity and the role of GFRP in relation to BH4 bioavailability remain uncertain. We investigated these relationships in a cell line with tet-regulated GTPCH expression and in the hph-1 mouse model of GTPCH deficiency. Doxycycline exposure resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in GTPCH protein and activity, with a strong correlation between GTPCH expression and BH4 levels (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001). These changes in GTPCH and BH4 had no effect on GFRP expression or protein levels. GFRP overexpression and knockdown in tet-GCH cells did not alter GTPCH activity or BH4 levels, and GTPCH-specific knockdown in sEnd.1 endothelial cells had no effect on GFRP protein. In mouse liver we observed a graded reduction of GTPCH expression, protein, and activity, from wild type, heterozygote, to homozygote littermates, with a striking linear correlation between GTPCH expression and BH4 levels (r2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Neither GFRP expression nor protein differed between wild type, heterozygote, nor homozygote mice, despite the substantial differences in BH4. We suggest that GTPCH expression is the primary regulator of BH4 levels, and changes in GTPCH or BH4 are not necessarily accompanied by changes in GFRP expression.

BH4 is synthesized in cells from GTP in a three-step pathway where the first and rate-limiting enzyme is GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), encoded by GCH1 (Fig. 1). GTPCH activity can be regulated transcriptionally, for example by induction of GCH1 expression by proinflammatory cytokines (1Katusic Z.S. Stelter A. Milstien S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, GTPCH can also be regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation (2Hesslinger C. Kremmer E. Hultner L. Ueffing M.

Structural studies suggest that GFRP regulates GTPCH activity by formation of a multimeric protein complex comprising two GFRP pentamers bound to one GTPCH decamer. Allosteric regulation of GTPCH by phenylalanine or BH4, through GFRP, appears to either stimulate or inhibit GTPCH activity, respectively (5Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In addition to allosteric regulation by phenylalanine or BH4, recent studies have suggested that altered expression of GFRP might also contribute to changes in GTPCH activity and BH4 levels, in response to proinflammatory stimuli and hydrogen peroxide (6Werner E.R. Bahrami S. Heller R. Werner-Felmayer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10129-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Kalivendi S. Hatakeyama K. Whitsett J. Konorev E.

Sci. 2005; 97: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these stimuli lead to major changes in the expression of multiple genes, including GCH1 and the other BH4 biosynthetic enzymes. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether GCH1 expression alone is the critical regulator of GTPCH protein levels, GTPCH activity, and steady state BH4 levels or whether changes in the relative abundance of GTPCH and GFRP are also important.Accordingly, we sought to systematically quantify the relationships between GCH1 expression, GTPCH protein levels, GTPCH enzymatic activity, steady state BH4 levels, and any associated changes in GFRP expression and protein levels. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of inflammatory or other nonspecific stimuli, we quantified the effects of primary and specific alterations in GCH1 and GCHFR expression, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of tet-GCH Cells—Murine fibroblasts (NIH-3T3 cells) were transfected with a tet-off plasmid and a neomycin resistance gene (“tet cells”). They were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding human GCH1, incorporating an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (10Cai S. Alp N.J. Mc Donald D. Canevari L. Heales S. Channon K.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These cells are under the control of a tetracycline response element with a plasmid encoding hygromycin B resistance gene allowing stable clones (“tet-GCH cells”) to be selected by resistance to hygromycin B. In the tet-off system, the presence of doxycycline prevents binding of the tetracycline controlled transactivator to the tetracycline response element, thus causing a “switch off” of GCH1 gene expression. sEnd.1 murine endothelial cells were used as a positive control for both GTPCH and GFRP in these experiments (11Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 1053-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Additionally tet-GCH cells were maintained using medium containing the antibiotics hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and genetecin (200 μg/ml). Where appropriate, doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to cell culture media to abolish transcription of GCH1 mRNA.Experimental Animals—The hph-1 mouse, in which there is constitutively reduced expression of GCH1 (12McDonald J.D. Bode V.C. Pediatr. Res. 1988; 23: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was produced by breeding of hph-1 heterozygotes producing matched litters of hph-1 homozygotes (hph), hph-1 heterozygotes (+/-), and wild type littermates (Wt) on a C57BL/b background, as previously described (13Khoo J.P. Nicoli T. Alp N.J. Fullerton J. Flint J. Channon K.M. Mol. Genet Metab. 2004; 82: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mice were used between 12 and 18 weeks of age and housed in individually ventilated cages with 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature of 20 °C to 22 °C. The mice were given free access to a normal chow diet and water ad libitum. All of the studies were conducted in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from snap frozen tissue or cell pellets in 1 ml of TRIzol solution by homogenization or freeze-thaw cycles, respectively. Total RNA was quantified with RiboGreen® RNA reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was completed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA and Taqman gene expressions systems. Quantitative PCR was performed with 50 ng/μl of cDNA on an iCycler IQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) using gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels of human GCH1, mouse GCH1, and mouse GCHFR were normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin or GAPDH.RT-PCR was also completed with Quantitect SYBR Green RT-PCR one-step kits, (Qiagen) using 50 ng of total RNA and the following primers for mRNA transcripts of GCH1 (5′ → 3′): mouse GCH1 forward, TGCTTACTCGTCCATTCTGC, and reverse, CCTTCACAATCACCATCTCG; and human GCH1 forward, CGCCTACTCGTCCATCCTGA, and reverse, CCTTCACAATCACCATCTCA; and for mRNA transcripts of GFRP (5′ → 3′): mouse GFRP forward, GGAGTAACGGGACTGTGGTC, and reverse, GAGGAGGGTCGTTGACGTAG. Relative quantities of mRNA were compared using the Rotor-Gene system (Corbett Research Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Gene expression levels were normalized to MLN51 (MLN-51 mouse forward, CGCCGAGGAGTCTGAGTGTG, and reverse, TCGTTAGCTTCTGATTTCAGC).Western Blot Analysis—Tissue samples were homogenized and cells were freeze-thawed in lysis buffer (Tris 10 mm, NaCl 154 mm, pH 7.4), including a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques with human GTPCH, mouse GTPCH, GFRP, HA, and GAPDH antibodies. The mouse GTPCH and GFRP antibodies were kindly provided by Prof. Steven S. Gross (Weill Medical College, Cornell University, New York, NY). The human GTPCH antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Gabriele Werner-Felmayer (Institute for Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Innsbruck, Austria).GTPCH Activity Assay—GTPCH activity was measured in tissue extracts and cell pellets by HPLC analysis after iodine oxidation as described previously (14Werner-Felmayer G. Gross S.S. Feelish M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 1996: 271-299Google Scholar). In brief, snap frozen tissue samples were homogenized, and cell pellets were freeze-thawed in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.3 m potassium chloride, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8). The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 mm GTP in the absence of light. The samples were then oxidized with 0.1 m potassium iodide/iodine and deproteinated with 1 m HCl for 1 h at room temperature in the absence of light. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 m ascorbic acid, and 16 units/ml of alkaline phosphatase was added for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence of light. Neopterin content was quantified by isocratic HPLC and fluorescence detection (JASCO) detection. Quantitation of neopterin was carried out by comparison with external standards and normalized for sample protein content. The protein concentration of each sample was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Measurement of BH4—BH4 was measured by electrochemical detection following sample separation by HPLC as previously described (15Howells D.W. Smith I. Hyland K. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 381: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Heales S. Hyland K. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 494: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, snap frozen tissue samples were homogenized, and cell pellets were freeze-thawed in ice-cold resuspension buffer (50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 16,100 × g, 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and ice-cold acid precipitation buffer (1 m phosphoric acid, 2 m trichloroacetic acid, 1 mm dithioerythritol) was added. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g 4 °C, the samples were injected onto an isocratic HPLC system and quantified using sequential electrochemical (Coulochem III, ESA Inc.) detection. HPLC separation was performed using a 250-mm, ACE C-18 column (Hichrom) and a mobile phase comprising 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm citric acid, 48 μm EDTA, and 160μm dithioerythritol (pH 5.2) at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Background currents of +500 nA and -50 nA were used for the detection of BH4 on electrochemical cells E1 and E2, respectively. Quantitation of BH4 was done by comparison with external standards after normalizing for sample protein content as previously described.GFRP Overexpression—GFRP and green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression was completed by transient transfection into tet-GCH cells. 2 × 105 cells/well of tet-GCH cells were plated the day before transfection. GFRP cDNA clones (Invitrogen) were utilized for transfections after insertion into pcDNA3.1(+). Transfections were incubated for 48 h, and cells were harvested with trypsin.GFRP and GTPCH Knockdown by RNA Interference—GFRP-specific, ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Thermo Scientific. The siRNAs were used as a pool of four specific siRNA duplexes with the following sequences: GFRP: Duplex 1, ACGAAUACUACGUCAACGA; Duplex 2, GACCCUGGCUCUUGCUGUA; Duplex 3, CCAUGGUGGGUGAUGAACA Duplex 4 - CCUGGAUCCUACACAGCUA. GTPCH: Duplex 1, GGUAGAAUGCUAAGUACGU; Duplex 2, CGAGAAGUGUGGCUACGUA; Duplex 3, GAGAAGGGAGAAUCGCUUU; Duplex 4, AGUAGUGAUUGAAGCGACA. tet-GCH cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). 24 h prior to transfection, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates. The cells were then transfected with GFRP or GTPCH-specific siRNA (100 nm), GAPDH-positive (100 nm), or nonspecific pooled duplex negative control siRNA (100 nm). The cells were cultured for 72 h, and gene silencing was detected by analysis of GFRP and GTPCH protein expression by Western blotting using GFRP or GTPCH-specific antibodies.Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = number of animals/cell pellet). Between group comparisons of normally distributed measurements were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. When more than two groups were being compared, one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Newman-Keul's multiple comparison test was used. Correlations between normally distributed measurements were made using a Pearson's correlation. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTet-regulatable GCH1 Overexpression—We sought to evaluate the quantitative relationships between GCH1 expression, GTPCH protein and activity, and intracellular BH4 levels using a novel cell line in which the expression of human GCH1, incorporating an HA epitope tag, is regulated by doxycycline via the tet system. We measured mRNA levels of mouse and human GCH1 by real time RT-PCR and first confirmed that the expression of endogenous mouse GCH1 in tet-GCH cells was not altered on addition of doxycycline (Fig. 2a). The appropriate negative control cells (tet cells without stable transfection of human GCH1) and positive control cells (mouse endothelial sEnd.1 cells that express high levels of GCH1) demonstrated either barely detectable or high levels of mouse GCH1 expression, respectively, with no change in response to doxycycline (Fig. 2a). In contrast, tet-regulated expression of human GCH1 in tet-GCH cells was reduced more than 90% by the addition of doxycycline (Fig. 2b), accompanied by a loss of human GTPCH protein by Western blotting (Fig. 2c), a 95% reduction in GTPCH enzymatic activity, as measured by neopterin triphosphate production (Fig. 2d), and a 90% reduction in cellular biopterin levels (Fig. 2e). These initial findings confirm that tet-GCH cells provide a robust model of regulated human GCH1 expression, leading to quantitatively corresponding changes in GTPCH protein, GTPCH enzymatic activity, and steady state intracellular BH4 levels.FIGURE 2Expression, protein levels, and activity of GTPCH and BH4 levels in tet-GCH cells. a, GCH1 mRNA levels from cell pellets were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Levels of mRNA were corrected for the level of the housekeeping gene β-actin. Mouse GCH1 expression in tet-GCH, tet, and sEnd.1 cells showed no difference on addition of doxycycline (Dox). b, human GCH1 was reduced in tet-GCH cells on addition of doxycycline. Control tet cells and sEnd.1 cells demonstrated no difference. c, protein levels were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies for human GTPCH, mouse GTPCH, HA, and GAPDH. Representative blots are shown. tet-GCH and tet cells exhibited low levels of mouse GTPCH. sEnd.1 cells demonstrated high levels of mouse GTPCH. Importantly all cell types showed no difference on addition of doxycycline. The presence of human GTPCH/HA tag was observed only in tet-GCH cells which was switched off on addition of doxycycline. GAPDH was used to ensure equal protein loading and showed similar levels in all cells under all conditions. d, GTPCH activity was determined in cell pellets by HPLC. GTPCH activity was abolished in the presence of doxycycline in tet-GCH, where tet cells had barely detectable levels compared sEnd.1 control cells. e, BH4 levels were determined in cell pellets by HPLC. BH4 levels in tet-GCH cells are markedly reduced on addition of doxycycline. tet and sEnd.1 control cells showed very low and high levels of BH4, respectively. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05 compared with tet-GCH-DOX. **, p < 0.01 compared with tet-GCH-DOX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to establish in more detail the quantitative relationship between GCH1 expression and BH4 production in tet-GCH cells across a range of doxycycline concentrations. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in human GCH1 expression and GTPCH protein in tet-GCH cells exposed to increasing doxycycline concentrations (Fig. 3, a and b). Furthermore, both GTPCH enzymatic activity and cellular BH4 levels showed quantitatively parallel changes in response to doxycycline concentration (Fig. 3, c and d). Indeed, there was a striking linear relationship between human GCH1 mRNA expression and the resulting steady state intracellular BH4 levels (Fig. 3e), suggesting that GCH1 expression is the principal determinant of cellular BH4 levels through corresponding changes in GTPCH protein and enzymatic activity.FIGURE 3Dose-dependent GCH1 'switch -off' in tet-GCH cells. a and b, GCH1 mRNA levels from cell pellets were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Levels of mRNA were corrected for the level of the housekeeping gene β-actin. GTPCH protein levels were determined by immunoblotting for human GTPCH. Human GCH1 expression and GTPCH protein demonstrated a dose-dependent switch-off following exposure to increasing concentrations of doxycycline (DOX) for 10 days. c, GTPCH activity was determined in cell pellets by HPLC. GTPCH enzymatic activity is attenuated following exposure of tet-GCH cells to different concentrations of doxycycline. d, BH4 levels were determined in cell pellets by HPLC and were altered in parallel with GCH1 mRNA expression, GTPCH protein levels, and enzymatic activity. e, a striking linear relationship was observed between human GCH1 mRNA expression and intracellular BH4 levels. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the level of GCHFR expression is reported to change in response to inflammatory stimuli that can induce GCH1 expression, we next tested whether alterations in BH4 levels in tet-GCH cells would be accompanied by changes in GFRP expression or protein. Despite the 50-fold change in GCH1 expression and BH4 levels observed in tet-GCH cells exposed to doxycycline, neither GCHFR expression nor GFRP protein levels were significantly altered (Fig. 4), suggesting that altered GFRP levels are not a necessary or direct consequence of primary alterations in GTPCH or BH4 levels.FIGURE 4GCHFR expression and GFRP protein levels in tet-GCH cells. a, GCHFR mRNA levels from cell pellets were quantified by real time RT-PCR. The levels of mRNA were corrected for the level of the housekeeping gene β-actin. GCHFR mRNA levels demonstrated no difference on addition of doxycycline (Dox) in tet-GCH, tet, or sEnd.1 cells. b, GFRP and GAPDH protein levels were determined by immunoblotting. GFRP protein levels showed no difference on addition of doxycycline in all cell types. GAPDH was used to ensure equal protein loading and showed similar levels in all cells under all conditions. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The level of GCH1 expression appears to determine the level of BH4 produced in tet-GCH cells, whereas no difference was observed in GFRP expression and protein levels. The effect of modulating GFRP in this cell line was next investigated to see whether this would influence GTPCH activity and consequently BH4 levels. tet-GCH cells were transfected with mouse GFRP and compared with GFP transfected and untreated control cells. Simultaneous transfections were carried out, and the proteins levels were determined for GFP, GFRP, human GTPCH, and α-actinin by immunoblotting (Fig. 5a). As expected, GFP protein was present only in cells that had been transfected with the protein and was absent in both control and GFRP transfected cells. GFRP protein was elevated by 60% in tet-GCH cells transfected with GFRP, and the level of human GTPCH was not altered upon transfection with GFP or GFRP (Fig. 5a). The transient transfection of GFRP was successful in tet-GCH cells as previously confirmed by protein levels, and additionally the method of transfection (GFP) did not alter GFRP or other proteins. This model was then used to determine whether overexpression of GFRP would alter the activity of GTPCH and BH4 production. GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were not altered following overexpression of GFRP or GFP (Fig. 5, b and c).FIGURE 5GTPCH Protein, GTPCH activity and BH4 levels in tet-GCH cells overexpressing GFRP. tet-GCH cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding GFP or GFRP. a, GFP, GFRP, and GTPCH protein levels were determined by immunoblotting. GFP protein was present only in GFP transfected tet-GCH cells. GFRP protein was significantly elevated in tet-GCH transfected with GFRP. Human and mouse GTPCH were not altered by transfection of either GFP or GFRP.α-actinin protein as a loading control was similar levels in all cells under all conditions. b and c, GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were determined in cell pellets by HPLC. GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were not altered with overexpression of either GFP or GFRP. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In tet-GCH cells, GTPCH is the principal regulator of BH4 levels, and overexpression of GFRP does not alter the enzymatic activity of GTPCH or levels of BH4. The knockdown of GFRP expression using GFRP-specific siRNA in these cells was next determined. This experiment will provide evidence of whether the absence of GFRP would induce prominent changes in BH4 levels through changes in GTPCH activity. GFRP-specific siRNA dramatically reduced GFRP protein by 84% (Fig. 6a). Human GTPCH was not altered by GFRP knockdown, and a down-regulation in GAPDH protein levels was also observed in tet-GCH cells treated with GAPDH-specific siRNA (Fig. 6a). α-Actinin protein levels were similar in all treated cells in both conditions, demonstrating equal protein loading (Fig. 6a). Having confirmed that GFRP protein levels are knocked down with GFRP-specific siRNA, the activity of GTPCH and BH4 levels were next established to see whether a dramatic reduction in GFRP would cause associated changes in GTPCH activity and consequently BH4 production. GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were not altered in tet-GCH cells treated with GFRP-specific siRNA compared with control cells (Fig. 6, b and c).FIGURE 6Effect of GFRP knockdown on GTPCH protein, GTPCH activity, and BH4 levels in tet-GCH cells. tet-GCH cells were transfected with GFRP-specific, control GAPDH, or scrambled nonspecific siRNA. a, protein levels were determined by immunoblotting for GFRP, GTPCH, GAPDH, and α-actinin. GFRP-specific siRNA induced 84% knockdown of GFRP protein. Importantly, GAPDH knockdown and scrambled control siRNAs had no effect on GFRP protein levels. GAPDH protein was reduced with GAPDH-specific siRNA, whereas α-actinin showed similar levels in all cells under all conditions. b and c, GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were determined in cell pellets by HPLC. GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were not altered by GFRP knockdown. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have observed that altered GTPCH and BH4 levels are not associated with changes in GFRP in this in vitro model. To further confirm this in an endothelial cell line where GFRP regulation has previously been shown (17Nandi M. Kelly P. Vallance P. Leiper J. Vasc. Med. 2008; 13: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of GTPCH-specific RNA interference in a murine endothelial cell line (sEnd.1). Mouse GTPCH-specific siRNA reduced GTPCH protein levels by 62% (Fig. 7a). A down-regulation in GAPDH protein was also observed with GAPDH-specific siRNA, and our loading control α-actinin was not altered by siRNA treatment (Fig. 7a). Interestingly, siRNA transfection of scrambled negative and GTPCH-specific siRNA resulted in a nonspecific reduction in GFRP protein levels, but specific GTPCH knockdown had no effect on GFRP levels compared with GAPDH knockdown or scrambled siRNA transfection (Fig. 7b). GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were dramatically reduced in sEnd.1 endothelial cells treated with GTPCH-specific siRNA (Fig. 7, c and d).FIGURE 7Effect of GTPCH knockdown on GFRP protein, GTPCH activity and BH4 levels in sEnd.1 cells. sEnd.1 cells were transfected with GTPCH-specific, control GAPDH, or scrambled nonspecific siRNA. a, protein levels were determined by immunoblotting for GFRP, GTPCH, GAPDH, and α-actinin. GTPCH-specific siRNA induced an 62% knockdown of GTPCH protein. There was no significant change in GFRP protein with GTPCH-specific knockdown. Importantly, GAPDH knockdown and scrambled control siRNAs did not have any effect on GTPCH protein levels. GAPDH protein was attenuated with GAPDH-specific siRNA, and α-actinin showed similar levels in all cells under all conditions. b, siRNA transfection resulted in a nonspecific reduction in GFRP protein levels in both scramble control and GTPCH-specific siRNA; however GTPCH knockdown had no effect on GFRP proteins levels compared with GAPDH knockdown or scrambled siRNA transfection. c and d, GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were determined in cell pellets by HPLC. GTPCH activity and BH4 levels were decreased by 98 and 91%, respectively, with GTPCH knockdown in sEnd.1 cells. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 3)."

The heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex and numerous clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) display dedicated surfaces or domains that engage PtdIns(4,5)P2 with good selectively (3Maldonado-Baez L.

PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is localized to the cell surface, thus biases the deposition and assembly of these coat components at the plasma membrane by synergizing with other low affinity interactions in a phenomenon termed coincidence detection (2Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 4Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2007; 448: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Later acting endocytic regulatory proteins also bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2. The large GTPase dynamin contains a pleckstrin homology domain, which engages PtdIns(4,5)P2 and is required for vesicle scission (6Vallis Y. Wigge P. Marks B. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Curr.

Similarly the clathrin uncoating cofactor, auxilin, has a PTEN homology domain that also binds to phosphoinositides and is necessary for targeting of this J-domain protein to clathrin-coated membranes (7Lee D.W. Wu X. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The lipid binding features of all these endocytic components is in full accord with PtdIns(4,5)P2 being necessary for both early and late stages of coated vesicle production (8Jost M. Simpson F.

This raises the question of whether the prevailing PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentration at the cell surface is simply permissive and sufficient for nucleation and sustained clathrin-coated vesicle assembly and budding or whether, in addition to basal PtdIns(4,5)P2 that might act as an initial compartmental cue, regional synthesis of this lipid is also necessary for clathrin coat assembly and progression. Supporting the first possibility is the general decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in the brains of type Iγ phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPKIγ) nullizygous mice that parallels major synaptic vesicle recycling aberrations in neurons of these animals, which die before (12Narkis G.

Also, activated P2Y purinergic receptors, which trigger phospholipase C-mediated cleavage of PtdIns(4,5)P2, diminish clathrin-mediated uptake of insulin (15Carvou N. Norden A.G. Unwin R.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. Signal. 2006; 19: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that signaling and endocytic processes can utilize a common phosphoinositide pool. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is rather uniformly dispersed over the plasma membrane of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Yu J.W. Mendrola J.M. Audhya A. Singh S. Keleti D. DeWald D.B. Murray D. Emr S.D.

Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and Mss4p, the only phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase in this organism, is not localized to cortical, clathrin-containing endocytic structures (18Sun Y. Carroll S. Kaksonen M. Toshima J.Y. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the subcellular positioning of PIPKI enzymes is, at least in part, dictated by substrate availability/concentration as switching the activation loop residues of a type II phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, which usually acts on phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, to that of a PIPKI induces the chimeric kinase to localize to the cell surface (19Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopically expressed, tailored proteins that drive rapamycin-induced consumption of bulk PtdIns(4,5)P2 lead to a rapid and dramatic loss of the majority of surface-associated clathrin-coated structures and halt clathrin-dependent internalization (20Varnai P.

In fact, excess pleckstrin homology domain can block clathrin-mediated endocytosis in an in vitro reconstitution assay (8Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet the second idea of localized PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis is in accord with the subcellular localization of PIPKI isozymes depending upon more than just the location of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (10Brough D. Bhatti F. Irvine R.F. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and with the PIPKI enzymes associating physically with the AP-2 adaptor complex (23Bairstow S.F.

The fact that ectopic expression of PIPKI enzymes in cultured cells increases both the number of surface clathrin-coated structures and the rate of internalization (27Padron D. Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also indicates that PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the cell surface can be limiting. Local production of PtdIns(4,5)P2 might counteract general competition of endocytic factors with other cell surface proteins for a limited phosphoinositide pool and thus may be important to sustain the rapid kinetics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This may be particularly relevant in vivo during signal transmission when PtdIns(4,5)P2 is consumed to generate diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (1Krauss M. Haucke V. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 15Carvou N. Norden A.G. Unwin R.J. Cockcroft S. Cell. Signal. 2006; 19: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Irrespective of precisely how PIPKI enzymes translocate to the plasma membrane, what is also clear is that temporal remodeling of PtdIns(4,5)P2 apparently accompanies coated vesicle biogenesis (18Sun Y.

After targeted gene disruption of the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1, neurons exhibit excessive and prolonged clathrin coat associations with the membrane (29Cremona O. Di Paolo G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Somewhat analogously, S. cerevisiae synaptojanin-null mutants display mislocalized PtdIns(4,5)P2; the phospholipid now appears in endosomal structures (17Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Sun Y. Carroll S. Kaksonen M. Toshima J.Y. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results show clearly that under normal conditions PtdIns(4,5)P2 within forming transport vesicles is dephosphorylated prior to, or rapidly following, scission from the cell surface. Recent time-resolved live cell imaging of the two splice isoforms of synaptojanin 1, termed SJ145 and SJ170 (31Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), reveals that although SJ145 masses at the bud site around the time of the fission event SJ170 populates the coat throughout the assembly process (28Perera R.M.

Thus molecular mechanisms appear to exist to align cycles of PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation and hydrolysis with progression of the coated assemblage toward the final fission step. In this study, we confirm that PIPKIγ, a vital lipid kinase (12Narkis G. Ofir R. Landau D. Manor E. Volokita M. Hershkowitz R. Elbedour K. Birk O.S. Am. J. Hum.

We show that this depends on an interaction surface positioned upon the sandwich subdomain of the β2 appendage, a site also engaged by clathrin and eps15. Binding of these proteins to the β2 appendage is mutually exclusive, leading to a model for spatial and temporal phosphoinositide remodeling managed by AP-2 appendages. DNA Constructs—The recombinant proteins consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to PIPKIγ (mouse residues 460-635, 460-661, 636-661, 630-661, and 624-661) were generated by PCR using a mouse PIPKIγ661 cDNA as a template followed by digestion and ligation into EcoRI/XhoI-cleaved pGEX-4T-1. Point mutations (I633A, Y634A, F635A, W642A, Y644A, Y649A, and S645E) were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The GST-PIPKIγ-(460-687) construct was generated by PCR using rat PIPKIγ687 cDNA kindly provided by Robin Irvine (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) as a template followed by digestion and ligation into EcoRI/XhoI-cleaved pGEX-4T-1. A GST-human PIPKIγ668 C-terminal 28-amino acid fusion was generated by PCR utilizing overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into pGEX-4T-1.

PIPKIγ-(630-661) was cloned into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pGBKT7, whereas AP-2 β2 appendage (rat residues 700-937) was cloned into EcoRI/XhoI-cut pGADT7. Upon confirmation of the sequences, indicated mutations in the β2 appendage were created by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The hexahistidine (His6)-tagged AP-2 β2 hinge and appendage (rat AP-2 β2 residues 592-951) was kindly provided by Tom Kirchhausen (Harvard University, Boston, MA).

The anti-clathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibody (mAb) TD.1 was generously provided by Frances Brodsky (University of California, San Francisco, CA), and the light chain mAb Cl37.3 was provided by Reinhard Jahn. The anti-AP-1/2 β1/β2 subunit mAb 100/1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-eps15 serum were kind gifts from Ernst Ungewickell (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany). The rabbit R11-29 polyclonal anti-AP-2 μ2 subunit serum was a generous gift from Juan Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the rabbit polyclonal anti-NECAP antibody was a kind gift from Peter McPherson (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The anti-PIPKIγ, anti-AP180, and anti-amphiphysin I/II mAbs were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-FLAG M1 and M2 and anti-talin mAbs were purchased from Sigma. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE with an altered acrylamide-bisacrylamide (30:0.4) ratio stock solution. After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose in ice-cold 15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine. Blots were usually blocked overnight in 5% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and then portions were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in individual figure legends. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G, immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein and Tissue Extract Preparation—GST and various GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Bacteria were induced by shifting log phase cultures (A600 ∼0.6) from 37 °C to room temperature and then adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm with constant shaking for 3 h or, in some instances, to 200 μm with constant shaking overnight (∼16 h). The bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min and used immediately or stored at -80 °C. Lysis was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with sonication on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 23,700 × gmax at 4 °C for 30 min, and then the GST fusions were collected on glutathione-Sepharose. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, GST fusions were eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm glutathione, 5 mm DTT on ice and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm DTT before use in binding assays. In some instances, purified fusion proteins were cleaved from the GST with thrombin (GE Healthcare) while still immobilized upon glutathione-Sepharose. Digestion was as recommended by the manufacturer followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 25 μm. His6-β2 hinge + appendage was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by induction of log phase cultures with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 3 h. Cleared lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose, and bound protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole. Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brains (PelFreez) by sequential differential centrifugation after homogenization in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture. The 105,000 × gmax supernatant is defined as cytosol and was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. Before use in binding assays, thawed samples of rat brain cytosol were adjusted to 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT (assay buffer) by addition of a 10× stock and then centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax (TLA-100.4 rotor) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove insoluble particulate material. Lysates from infected Sf9 cells (35Doray B. Lee I. Knisely J. Bu G. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1887-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were prepared by solubilization of pelleted cells in assay buffer with 0.4% Triton X-100 and supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysates were sonicated on ice three times for 15 s and centrifuged at 500 × gmax. The supernatants were carefully aspirated and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Prior to use, thawed Sf9 cell lysates were centrifuged at 125,000 × gmax to remove aggregated material. Hemicomplexes were immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of clarified lysate using 35 μl of packed anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in assay buffer lacking DTT. After extensively washing the anti-FLAG-agarose, bound proteins were eluted with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Rat brain clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared exactly as described previously (37Mishra S.K. Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

Synaptosomes were prepared from rat brain homogenized in 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose with a Potter-Elvehjem tissue disruptor on ice (39Fischer von Mollard G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The supernatant from a 2-min 3,000 × gmax spin at 4 °C was recentrifuged at 13,000 × gmax for 12 min, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and again centrifuged at 13,000 × gmax for 12 min. The resuspended pellet was layered over a discontinuous gradient of 13%/9%/6% Ficoll 400 in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 86,600 × gmax for 35 min at 4 °C. Cream/white-colored synaptosomes were harvested from the 6%/9% and 9%/13% interfaces and concentrated by centrifugation at 27,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 12.5 min after dilution with homogenization buffer. 10-fold dilution of synaptosomes into ice-cold 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 followed by disruption in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer was used to generate synaptic plasma membranes. After adjusting the lysed membranes to 1.105 m sucrose, the sample was overlaid with 0.92 m and then 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at 60,000 × gave at 4 °C for 60 min. The turbid, white-colored synaptosome plasma membrane-enriched fraction at the 0.92 m/1.105 m interface was collected and concentrated by centrifugation after dilution in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Kinase Assays and TLC—Phosphoinositide synthesis on synaptic membranes was assayed in assay buffer in a final volume of 50 μl precisely as described previously (40Arneson L.S. Kunz J. Anderson R.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17794-17805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly the final concentrations were 0.5 mg/ml for membranes, 5 mg/ml for gel-filtered cytosol, and 500 μm for [γ-32P]ATP (0.5-1 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated after 10 min at 37 °C by addition of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (200:100: 0.75) followed by vigorous mixing. After carrier phosphoinositides (50 μg/tube) were added, a biphasic mixture was generated by addition of 0.6 m HCl. Samples were centrifuged at 200 × gave for 5 min, and the lower organic phase was removed and transferred to a new tube, washed twice with chloroform, methanol, 0.6 m HCl (3:48:47), and then dried under a stream of N2 gas at about 40 °C. Dried lipid films were resuspended in chloroform:methanol:H2O (75:25:1) and spotted onto oxalate-impregnated, heat-activated silica gel high performance TLC plates and resolved in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (160:60:52:48:28). Autoradiographs were quantitated using ImageJ (41Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis—Purified, thrombin-cleaved PIPKIγ-(460-635) and PIPKIγ-(460-661) (20 μg) were incubated with 5-fold serial dilutions of trypsin (Worthington) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteolysis was stopped by addition of 95 °C 2× sample buffer, and 10% of each reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding Assays—Typically 100-250 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins was first immobilized upon ∼25 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with continuous mixing. The Sepharose beads containing the required immobilized proteins were then washed and resuspended to 50 μl in assay buffer. A 250-μl volume of clarified rat brain cytosol was usually added, and the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with continuous mixing. For the peptide competition assay, thrombin-cleaved protein was added directly to the assay mixture in the presence of 25 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × gmax for 1 min, and then an aliquot of each supernatant was removed and adjusted to 100 μl with SDS sample buffer. After washing the Sepharose pellets four times each with ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated, and each pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer up to ∼80 μl. Unless otherwise noted, 10-μl aliquots, corresponding to ∼1.5% of each supernatant and 12.5% of each pellet, were analyzed. For direct interaction assays between His6-β2 hinge + appendage and GST fusion proteins, typically 5 μg of His6-tagged protein was bound to 5 μl of packed Ni-NTA-agarose in 20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. After washing, immobilized proteins were incubated with 25 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins in a 300-μl volume for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixin"
https://openalex.org/W2023071802,"Coronavirus M protein is an essential component of virion and plays pivotal roles in virion assembly, budding and maturation. The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of beta-actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles. This study reveals an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus."

In bacteria, damage recognition is achieved by the UvrA.UvrB ensemble. Here, we report the structure of the complex between the interaction domains of UvrA and UvrB. These domains are necessary and sufficient for full-length UvrA and UvrB to associate and thereby form the DNA damage-sensing complex of bacterial nucleotide excision repair. The crystal structure and accompanying biochemical analyses suggest a model for the complete damage-sensing complex."
https://openalex.org/W2011868999,"As fundamental units of neuronal communication, chemical synapses are composed of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations that form at specific locations with defined shape and size. Synaptic assembly must be tightly regulated to prevent overgrowth of the synapse size and number, but the molecular mechanisms that inhibit synapse assembly are poorly understood. We identified regulator of synaptogenesis–1 (RSY-1) as an evolutionarily conserved molecule that locally antagonized presynaptic assembly. The loss of RSY-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans led to formation of extra synapses and recruitment of excessive synaptic material to presynaptic sites. RSY-1 directly interacted with and negatively regulated SYD-2/liprin-alpha, a master assembly molecule that recruits numerous synaptic components to presynaptic sites. RSY-1 also bound and regulated SYD-1, a synaptic protein required for proper functioning of SYD-2. Thus, local inhibitory mechanisms govern synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2014870062,"The cellular ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains poorly understood because their isolation from and their identification in early developing small embryos are difficult. We attempted to dissect early developmental stages of HSCs using an in vitro mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation system combined with inducible HOXB4 expression. Here we report the identification of pre-HSCs and an embryonic type of HSCs (embryonic HSCs) as intermediate cells between ESCs and HSCs. Both pre-HSCs and embryonic HSCs were isolated by their c-Kit+CD41+CD45− phenotype. Pre-HSCs did not engraft in irradiated adult mice. After co-culture with OP9 stromal cells and conditional expression of HOXB4, pre-HSCs gave rise to embryonic HSCs capable of engraftment and long-term reconstitution in irradiated adult mice. Blast colony assays revealed that most hemangioblast activity was detected apart from the pre-HSC population, implying the early divergence of pre-HSCs from hemangioblasts. Gene expression profiling suggests that a particular set of transcripts closely associated with adult HSCs is involved in the transition of pre-HSC to embryonic HSCs. We propose an HSC developmental model in which pre-HSCs and embryonic HSCs sequentially give rise to adult types of HSCs in a stepwise manner."
https://openalex.org/W1980518783,"We introduce a model for assessing the levels and patterns of genetic diversity in pathogen populations, whose epidemiology follows a susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR). We model the population of pathogens as a metapopulation composed of subpopulations (infected hosts), where pathogens replicate and mutate. Hosts transmit pathogens to uninfected hosts. We show that the level of pathogen variation is well predicted by analytical expressions, such that pathogen neutral molecular variation is bounded by the level of infection and increases with the duration of infection. We then introduce selection in the model and study the invasion probability of a new pathogenic strain whose fitness (R0(1+s)) is higher than the fitness of the resident strain (R0). We show that this invasion probability is given by the relative increment in R0 of the new pathogen (s). By analyzing the patterns of genetic diversity in this framework, we identify the molecular signatures during the replacement and compare these with those observed in sequences of influenza A."
https://openalex.org/W1987452145,"A new role is reported for CP12, a highly unfolded and flexible protein, mainly known for its redox function with A(4) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Both reduced and oxidized CP12 can prevent the in vitro thermal inactivation and aggregation of GAPDH from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This mechanism is thus not redox-dependent. The protection is specific to CP12, because other proteins, such as bovine serum albumin, thioredoxin, and a general chaperone, Hsp33, do not fully prevent denaturation of GAPDH. Furthermore, CP12 acts as a specific chaperone, since it does not protect other proteins, such as catalase, alcohol dehydrogenase, or lysozyme. The interaction between CP12 and GAPDH is necessary to prevent the aggregation and inactivation, since the mutant C66S that does not form any complex with GAPDH cannot accomplish this protection. Unlike the C66S mutant, the C23S mutant that lacks the N-terminal bridge is partially able to protect and to slow down the inactivation and aggregation. Tryptic digestion coupled to mass spectrometry confirmed that the S-loop of GAPDH is the interaction site with CP12. Thus, CP12 not only has a redox function but also behaves as a specific ""chaperone-like protein"" for GAPDH, although a stable and not transitory interaction is observed. This new function of CP12 may explain why it is also present in complexes involving A(2)B(2) GAPDHs that possess a regulatory C-terminal extension (GapB subunit) and therefore do not require CP12 to be redox-regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2017430753,"The novel class of protein kinase C (nPKC) isoform eta is expressed in platelets, but not much is known about its activation and function. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of activation and functional implications of nPKCeta using pharmacological and gene knock-out approaches. nPKCeta was phosphorylated (at Thr-512) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by 2MeSADP. Pretreatment of platelets with MRS-2179, a P2Y1 receptor antagonist, or YM-254890, a G(q) blocker, abolished 2MeSADP-induced phosphorylation of nPKCeta. Similarly, ADP failed to activate nPKCeta in platelets isolated from P2Y1 and G(q) knock-out mice. However, pretreatment of platelets with P2Y12 receptor antagonist, AR-C69331MX did not interfere with ADP-induced nPKCeta phosphorylation. In addition, when platelets were activated with 2MeSADP under stirring conditions, although nPKCeta was phosphorylated within 30 s by ADP receptors, it was also dephosphorylated by activated integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 mediated outside-in signaling. Moreover, in the presence of SC-57101, a alpha(IIb)beta3 receptor antagonist, nPKCeta dephosphorylation was inhibited. Furthermore, in murine platelets lacking PP1cgamma, a catalytic subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase, alpha(IIb)beta3 failed to dephosphorylate nPKCeta. Thus, we conclude that ADP activates nPKCeta via P2Y1 receptor and is subsequently dephosphorylated by PP1gamma phosphatase activated by alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin. In addition, pretreatment of platelets with eta-RACK antagonistic peptides, a specific inhibitor of nPKCeta, inhibited ADP-induced thromboxane generation. However, these peptides had no affect on ADP-induced aggregation when thromboxane generation was blocked. In summary, nPKCeta positively regulates agonist-induced thromboxane generation with no effects on platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2078686098,"The physiological relevance of the activation of hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf) by the plasminogen (Plg) system of proteases and its contribution to tissue repair are largely undefined. Here, we investigated whether the defective liver repair in mice lacking Plg is due to impaired activation of Hgf. Loss of Plg in vivo suppressed Hgf activation and signaling through its Met tyrosine kinase receptor. Without Plg, hepatocytes were unresponsive to Hgf-induced proliferation and migration, with a more pronounced impairment in hepatocyte movement within the hepatic environment. Most notably, circumventing the defect in proteolytic activation of Hgf by the downstream expression of an activated Met receptor corrected the functional deficits and improved liver repair in Plg-deficient mice. These findings support a fibrinolysis-unrelated role for Plg in modulating cell proliferation and migration by activation of Hgf."
https://openalex.org/W2084662393,"It is well-known that human beings are able to associate stimuli (novel or not) perceived in their environment. For example, this ability is used by children in reading acquisition when arbitrary associations between visual and auditory stimuli must be learned. The studies tend to consider it as an ""implicit"" process triggered by the learning of letter/sound correspondences. The study described in this paper examined whether the addition of the visuo-haptic exploration would help adults to learn more effectively the arbitrary association between visual and auditory novel stimuli.Adults were asked to learn 15 new arbitrary associations between visual stimuli and their corresponding sounds using two learning methods which differed according to the perceptual modalities involved in the exploration of the visual stimuli. Adults used their visual modality in the ""classic"" learning method and both their visual and haptic modalities in the ""multisensory"" learning one. After both learning methods, participants showed a similar above-chance ability to recognize the visual and auditory stimuli and the audio-visual associations. However, the ability to recognize the visual-auditory associations was better after the multisensory method than after the classic one.This study revealed that adults learned more efficiently the arbitrary association between visual and auditory novel stimuli when the visual stimuli were explored with both vision and touch. The results are discussed from the perspective of how they relate to the functional differences of the manual haptic modality and the hypothesis of a ""haptic bond"" between visual and auditory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1996822245,"Previously we have shown that tyrosine 718 of ASK1 when phosphorylated is critical for SOCS1 binding and SOCS1-mediated degradation of ASK1. However, the kinase and phosphatase responsible for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr-718 are unknown.

Myocardial infarction due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries remains the leading cause of death in the United States. It has become clear that increases in inflammatory mediators represent a common pathogenic mechanism for atherosclerosis (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6973) Google Scholar). The vascular cell that normally limits the inflammatory and atherosclerotic process is the EC. 3The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; IFN, interferon; SHP2, SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2; SH, Src homology; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; KO, knock-out; WT, wild type; MLEC, mouse lung EC; HAEC, human aorta EC; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CHX, cycloheximide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PI, propidium iodide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; JAK, Janus tyrosine kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. Proinflammatory stimuli induce EC dysfunction, which is characterized by an enhanced sensitivity of vascular cells to proinflammatory and proapoptotic stimuli. Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1), a member of MAP3K family (2Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Tobiume K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Antioxid. Redox.

Almost all inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and reactive oxygen species activate ASK1. Activated ASK1 subsequently recruits and activates its downstream target MAP2Ks (MKK3/7 and MKK4/7), which in turn activate MAPKs (JNK and p38). Studies from ASK1-deficient mice have also linked ASK1 to cardiovascular pathogenesis. ASK1 deletion in mice attenuated angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Neointimal formation due to proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a cuff injury model is also attenuated by ASK1 deletion in mice (9Izumi Y. Kim S. Yoshiyama M. Izumiya Y. Yoshida K. Matsuzawa A.

Ichijo H. Iwao H. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although the linkage of ASK1 to inflammation is very strong, the mechanism by which inflammatory stimuli, including TNF, activate ASK1 is not fully understood. The identification of proteins associated with ASK1 and their regulation on ASK1 have provided some insights into the mechanism for ASK1 activation. ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein that is composed of an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. One important regulatory mechanism of ASK1 activity is its Ser/Thr phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases. ASK1 is basally phosphorylated at Ser-967 by an unidentified kinase, and 14-3-3 binds to this site and inhibits ASK1 activity (11Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Zhang R. Al-Lamki R. Bai L. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. Bradley J. Min W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TNF activates ASK1 in part by dissociating these cellular inhibitors from ASK1 (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified PP2A as a phosphatase in TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 Ser(P)-967 (13Min W. Lin Y. Tang S. Yu L. Zhang H. Wan T. Luhn T. Fu H. Chen H. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the 14-3-3-binding site, Ser(P)-967, ASK1 is phosphorylated at Ser-83 by Akt, leading to inhibition of ASK1 activity. In contrast, autophosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr-838 leads to oligomerization and activation (14Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-845 can be negatively regulated by the phosphatase PP5 (15Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the ASK1 autophosphorylation at Thr-813 and Thr-842 also positively regulates ASK1 signaling (16Bunkoczi G. Salah E. Filippakopoulos P. Fedorov O. Muller S. Sobott F. Parker S.A. Zhang H. Min W. Turk B.E. Knapp S. Structure (Lond.). 2007; 15: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ser/Thr phosphorylation, regulation of ASK1 by tyrosine phosphorylation is less well understood. We have recently shown that ASK1 is phosphorylated at Tyr-718, and this phosphorylation is critical for the binding to suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), a subunit of ubiquitin ligase responsible for ASK1 degradation (17He Y. Zhang W. Zhang R. Zhang H. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5559-5566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ASK1 is up-regulated in response to growth factors and cytokines such as IFN-γ, whereas this phosphorylation can be down-regulated by TNF treatment, resulting in ASK1 dissociation from SOCS1. However, the kinase and phosphatase responsible for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr-718 are not known. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2, autophosphorylates in response to growth factors and cytokines, including IFN-γ. JAK2 then activates cytokine receptors and other cytoplasmic proteins such as the STATs by phosphorylating their key tyrosine residue. The JAK/STAT pathway can be regulated by SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP2 (18Ali S. Nouhi Z. Chughtai N. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52021-52031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Xu D. Qu C.K. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4925-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). SHP2 is ubiquitously expressed and composed of two SH2 domains on the N-terminal and C-terminal protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain. The SH2 domain of SHP2 mediates the association with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present on activated receptors as well as on activated JAKs and STATs; this association triggers activation of the tyrosine phosphatase domain and subsequent dephosphorylation of substrates. SHP2 signals downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors, and in most cases it serves to positively transduce signals from these receptors. In other instances SHP2 has been shown to exhibit inhibitory signaling properties by negatively regulating the JAK-STAT pathway (19Xu D. Qu C.K. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4925-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the IFN-γ-activated kinase JAK2 and TNF-activated SHP2 are the tyrosine kinase and phosphatase for Tyr-718 on ASK1, respectively. The actions of both JAK2 and SHP2 affect protein turnover of ASK1 and thus regulate ASK1/JNK-dependent proinflammatory and proapoptotic pathways in EC. Plasmid Construction—Expression plasmids for human SOCS1 and ASK1 were described previously (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin.

Human JAK1 and JAK2 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning the respective cDNA into pcDNA3. The mutant ASK1 and SHP2 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol of the manufacturer and were verified by DNA sequencing. Adenoviral and GST vectors expressing SHP2-WT, SHP2-RM, and SHP2-DAQA were described previously (22Kontaridis M.I. Eminaga S. Fornaro M. Zito C.I. Sordella R. Settleman J. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5340-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, SHP-2 expression was established by subcloning wild type, catalytically inactive, and nonsubstrate trapping (Arg-465 to Met-465 (RM)) and the double substrate-trapping mutant of SHP-2 (Asp-425 to Ala-425, Gln-506 to Ala-506 (DAQA)) into the pIRES-green fluorescent protein vector (Invitrogen). SHP-2 adenoviruses were generated by using the pAdEasy method. For GST substrate-trapping experiments, GST fusion proteins that represented the PTP domain alone of SHP-2 (amino acids 218–528) were constructed by PCR amplification with wild type SHP-2 as a template. The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the pGEX-2TK vector to generate pGEX-2TK-PTP-WT (GST-PTP-WT). The substrate-trapping variant of SHP-2, Asp-425 to Ala-425, was generated by performing site-directed mutagenesis on GST-PTP-WT to generate pGEX-2TK-PTP-DA (GST-PTP-DA). Cells, Cytokines, and Inhibitors—SOCS1+/– mice were from Dr. James Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (23Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D.

Human aorta EC (HAEC) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human and murine recombinant TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1), IL-6, IFN-β, and IFN-γ were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Chemicals, including proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (20 μm), JAK inhibitor AG-490 (tyrphostin B42, 10 μm), and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Transfection—Transfection of EC was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 90% confluence in 6-well plates and were transfected with total of 4 μg of plasmid constructs as indicated. Cells were harvested at 36–48 h post-transfection, and cell lysates were used for protein assays. Adenoviral Expression and Preparation—Replication-deficient adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ), Cre recombinase (Cre), SHP2, and its mutants under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter were generated using pAdTrack-CMV vector and the AdEasy System. The viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells, purified using CsCl, and titered using cytopathic effects. Multiplicities of infection of 50 of virus resulted in close to 100% of the cells expressing the gene of interest with no signs of toxicity. Generation of Antibodies against Phospho-ASK1 (Tyr(P)-718)-specific Antibody—Polyclonal antibodies directed against specific phospho-ASK1 (Tyr(P)-718) were produced from Cell Signaling by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to residues surrounding ASK1 Tyr-718. The peptide sequences is AC-CERDSRpYSQPLH-amide, where pY indicates phospho-Tyr-718. The peptide was synthesized with N-terminal cysteine residues and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization. The antibodies were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera by affinity chromatography steps using protein A columns to purify immunoglobulins followed by specific phosphopeptide (immunogen) columns. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—EC (HAEC or MLEC) after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad kit. For immunoprecipitation to analyze protein interaction in vivo, 400 μg of cell lysate supernatant were precleared by incubating with 5 μg of normal rabbit serum plus protein A/G-agarose beads on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. The lysates were then incubated with 5 μg of the first protein-specific antiserum (e.g. anti-ASK1 H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. The immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min followed by four washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) with the second protein-specific antibody (e.g. JAK2 from Cell Signaling). The chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies against STAT1, ASK1, TRAF1, SHP2, JNK1, and β-tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphospecific antibodies recognizing ASK1 (Tyr(P)-718), ASK1 (Thr(P)-845), p-JAK1 or -2, p-STAT1, p-JNK1/2, p-SHP2 (Tyr(P)-542), and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-p-JAK1/2 was from BIOSOURCE, and anti-SOCS1 was from Medical and Biological Laboratory. GST-SOCS1 Pulldown Assay—GST fusion protein preparation and GST pulldown assay were performed as described previously (4Liu Y. Yin G. Surapisitchat J. Berk B.C. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Min W. Cir. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-SOCS1 fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 400 μg of cell lysates expressing JAK1 or JAK2 or together with WT-ASK or Y718F ASK1 were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST-SOCS1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose in the lysis buffer. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer before the addition of boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Bound ASK1 or JAK proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot with antibodies. Quantitation of Apoptotic Cell—Cell killing assay was performed as described previously with a modification (7Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Min W. Cir. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y.

The propidium iodide (PI)-exclusion method for loss of integrity of cell membranes was used to assess viability. In brief, cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 25 μg/ml PI for 5 min at 37 °C and then subjected to analytic flow cytometry on a FACSort (BD Biosciences) immediately after labeling. A light scatter gate was set up to eliminate cell debris from the analysis. The PI fluorescence signal was recorded on the FL3 channel and analyzed by using CellQuest software. Phosphatidylserine translocation, which precedes loss of PI exclusion in apoptotic cell death, was assessed by an annexin V-488 staining kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. For nuclear morphology, cells were stained with DAPI, and apoptotic cells (nuclei condensation) were visualized under a UV microscope. IFN-γ Induces ASK1 Phosphorylation and Degradation in EC—To identify tyrosine kinases responsible for phosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr(P)-718, which mediates SOCS1 association and ASK1 degradation, we examined the effects of various cytokines on ASK1 protein stability. MLEC were treated with various cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-β, or IFN-γ at 10 ng/ml) for 16 h, and ASK1 expression was determined by Western blotting using an anti-ASK1 antibody. Among these cytokines, only IFN-γ strongly induced ASK1 degradation (Fig. 1a for IFN-γ, TNF, and IFN-β). To confirm these cytokines function in EC, cytokine-inducible proteins, including TRAF1 and SOCS1, were tested for their expression. As expected, IFN-β and IFN-γ induced SOCS1 expression. TNF up-regulated TRAF1 as reported previously (28Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFN-β and IFN-γ also induced TRAF1 expression in EC. To determine whether IFN-γ-induced ASK1 degradation is SOCS1-dependent, as we demonstrated previously, we examined the effects of cytokines in SOCS1-KO EC. As expected, SOCS1 was not detected in SOCS1-KO EC (Fig. 1b). Cytokine-induced TRAF1 expression was augmented in SOCS1-KO EC, consistent with the observation that SOCS1 is a suppressor in IFN-β, IFN-γ, and TNF signaling (17He Y. Zhang W. Zhang R. Zhang H. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5559-5566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Importantly, IFN-γ did not induce ASK1 degradation in SOCS1-KO EC (Fig. 1b), suggesting that IFN-γ-induced ASK1 degradation is SOCS1-dependent. Because both IFN-β and IFN-γ induce SOCS1 up-regulation, and only IFN-γ treatment leads to ASK1 degradation, we reasoned that IFN-γ but not IFN-β induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr-718 (Tyr(P)-718), which has been shown to be required for ASK1 degradation. To this end, WT and SOCS1-KO EC were treated with TNF, IFN-β, or IFN-γ (10 ng/ml for 15 min), and ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 was determined by Western blot with an ASK1 Tyr(P)-718-specific antibody. IFN-γ, but not TNF or IFN-β, strongly induced ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 in both WT and SOCS1-KO EC (Fig. 1c). JAK2 Associates with ASK1 and Mediates IFN-γ-induced ASK1 Phosphorylation—IFN-γ activates JAK1 and JAK2, whereas IFN-β activates JAK1 and Tyk2. To determine whether IFN-γ-specific kinase JAK2 is responsible for ASK1 phosphorylation, HAEC were treated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 15 min with or without prior treatment with the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 for 60 min. As a control, IFN-γ-induced activation of JAK2, as determined by Western blot with a phosphospecific antibody, was blocked by AG490 (Fig. 2a). IFN-γ-induced ASK1 phosphorylation was completely diminished by AG490. These results suggest that JAK2 kinase mediates IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ASK1. To determine whether JAK2 and ASK1 form a complex in response to IFN-γ, HAEC were treated with IFN-γ for the indicated times. As controls, IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1 was determined by phospho-specific antibodies. Consistent with previous results, IFN-γ induced activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in EC in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 15–30 min (Fig. 2b). ASK1-JAK2 complex formation was determined by immunoprecipitation assay with anti-JAK2 followed by Western blot with anti-ASK1. ASK1-JAK2 complex was weakly detected in untreated EC and was increased in response to IFN-γ, correlating with JAK2 activation and ASK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2b). However, phosphorylation of ASK1 and JAK2-ASK1 complex declined by 30 min, suggesting that JAK2-ASK1 complex is unstable. To determine whether the JAK2-ASK1 complex could be stabilized by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, EC were pretreated with MG312 (20 μm) for 60 min followed by IFN-γ treatment for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2c, IFN-γ-induced JAK2 and ASK1 phosphorylation and subsequently JAK2-ASK1 complex formation were increased in the presence of MG132. JAK2 Directly Phosphorylates ASK1 at Tyr(P)-718—To test if JAK2 phosphorylates ASK1, we first performed an in vitro kinase assay. JAK2 or the JAK1-expressing cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK1/2, and the immunoprecipitates were used for an in vitro kinase using GST-ASK1 as a substrate. Phosphorylation of GST-ASK1 at Tyr-718 was determined by Western blot with anti-Tyr(P)-718. JAK2 strongly but JAK1 only weakly phosphorylated GST-ASK1 (Fig. 3a). To determine whether JAK2 phosphorylates ASK1 in cells, we employed an overexpression system by expressing JAK2 together with ASK1. JAK1 was used as a control. Co-expression of ASK1 with JAK2, but not with JAK1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr-718, indicating JAK2 specifically phosphorylates ASK1 in vivo. Consistent with previous findings, increased ASK1 tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with decreased total ASK1 protein levels. In contrast, ASK1-Y718F was not phosphorylated and degraded upon overexpression of JAK2 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that Tyr(P)-718 is a major site that can be phosphorylated by JAK2. To determine whether JAK2-mediated phosphorylation increases ASK1-SOCS1 association, ASK1 was co-transfected with JAK2, and cell lysates were used for an in vitro pulldown assay with GST-SOCS1. As a control, ASK1-Y718F failed to bind to GST-SOCS1 (data not shown). As expected, JAK2 also bound to GST-SOCS1. More importantly, consistent with increased ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 by JAK2 overexpression, JAK2 strongly enhanced association of ASK1 to GST-SOCS1 (Fig. 3c). SHP2 Binds to and Dephosphorylates ASK1—SHP2, an SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, has been shown to share the same binding phosphotyrosine motif as SOCS proteins (29De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Nash A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether SHP2 could dephosphorylate the SOCS1-binding site on ASK1 (Tyr(P)-718), human EC were infected with adenovirus expressing SHP2 wild type (WT) or a phosphatase-inactive/nonsubstrate-trapping mutant of SHP2 (SHP2-RM) followed by TNF treatment (10 ng/ml for 15 min). Overexpression of SHP2-WT decreased, but SHP2-RM enhanced, ASK1 tyrosine phosphorylation. More importantly, TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 was inhibited by SHP2-RM (Fig. 4a). SHP2-ASK1 interaction was also determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-ASK1 followed by Western blot with anti-SHP2. Consistent with the effect of SHP2 on ASK1 phosphorylation, SHP2-WT, but not SHP2-RM, associated with ASK1 in response to TNF (Fig. 4b). To determine whether SHP2 directly targets ASK1 for dephosphorylation, we examined SHP2-ASK1 interaction in an in vitro GST pulldown assay using a substrate-trapping mutant of SHP2 (SHP2-DAQA) containing a mutation in the catalytic domain (PTP). The application of PTP “substrate-trapping” mutants has been widely used as a tool to define PTP-substrate interactions, and such an interaction is direct evidence of a PTP-substrate based interaction based on the fact this complex is mediated by the catalytic cysteine of the PTP (20Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Significantly, we found that ASK1 bound more tightly to SHP2-DAQA than SHP2-WT in the pulldown assay (Fig. 4c), suggesting ASK1 is a direct substrate of SHP-2. Based on these observations, we reasoned that SHP2 binds to and dephosphorylates ASK1, leading to dissociation of ASK1 from SOCS1. To test this hypothesis, ASK1 and SOCS1 were co-transfected into 293T cells in the presence of SHP2-WT, SHP2-RM (inactive in substrate binding and catalysis), or SHP2-DA (catalytic inactive/substrate trapping). ASK1-SOCS1 association was determined by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ASK1 followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG. As reported previously, ASK1 associated with SOCS1 in the absence of SHP2. Expression of SHP2-WT, but not SHP2-RM, disrupted the ASK1-SOCS1 complex (Fig. 4d). SHP2-DA, which lacks significant catalytic activity, could not dephosphorylate ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 but still partially disrupted the ASK1-SOCS1 complex (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these data suggest that both the phosphatase activity and the ASK1 binding activity of SHP2 are required to disrupt ASK1-SOCS1 complex formation. SHP2 Knock-out EC (?) Blunted TNF-induced Dephosphorylation of ASK1 and ASK1-JNK Signaling—To determine the role of endogenous SHP2 in ASK1 dephosphorylation and stability, we isolated MLEC from SHP2-lox/lox mice (24Fornaro M. Burch P.M. Yang W. Zhang L. Hamilton C.E. Kim J.H. Neel B.G. Bennett A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) followed by infection with LacZ or Cre-expressing adenovirus. Deletion of SHP2 mediated by Cre expression was verified by Western blot with anti-SHP2 (Fig. 5a). SHP2-lox/lox (WT) and SHP2-lox/lox/Cre (KO) EC were first examined for IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of ASK1 by Western blot with a phospho-specific antibody (Tyr(P)-718). Consistent with the observation shown in Fig. 1, IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ASK1 in SHP2-WT EC peaked at 15 min followed by a decline at 30 min. However, the basal level of ASK-pY 718 was increased, and IFN-γ-induced ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 was prolonged in SHP2-KO EC compared with normal EC. Consistent with this, phospho-ASK1 was unstable, and the level of total ASK1 protein was decreased in SHP2-KO EC in response to IFN-γ (Fig. 5a). As a control, IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 was slightly reduced in SHP2-KO EC, suggesting that increased ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 in SHP2-KO EC was primarily due to lack of SHP2. We then determined the role of endogenous SHP2 in TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1-Tyr(P)-718. EC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) as indicated, and TNF induced SHP2 activation as determined by a phospho-specific antibody recognizing an active form of SHP1 (Tyr(P)-542). TNF induced a reduction of ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 in SHP2-WT cells as determined by a phospho-specific antibody. In contrast, TNF failed to induce dephosphorylation of ASK1-Tyr(P)-718 in SHP2-KO EC (Fig. 5b). These data suggest that SHP2 is a critical regulator controlling basal and TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1. To determine the role of endogenous SHP2 in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling, SHP2-lox/lox (WT) and SHP2-lox/lox/Cre (KO) EC were generated and treated with TNF as indicated. ASK1-JNK signaling was determined by Western blot with phospho-specific antibodies recognizing active forms of ASK1 (Thr(P)-845) and JNK1/2. Phosphorylation of ASK1 Thr-845 is indicative of ASK1 activation, resulting from ASK1 oligomerization and autophosphorylation. As observed in our previous studies (17He Y. Zhang W. Zhang R. Zhang H. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5559-5566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), TNF induced ASK1-JNK signaling, peaking at 15 min. In contrast, deletion of SHP2 blunted TNF-induced activation of ASK1 and its downstream target JNK (Fig. 5c). Therefore, dephosphorylation of ASK1 at Tyr-718 is crucial for TNF-induced activation ASK1-JNK signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)-718 not only increases ASK1 stability but also is critical for the activation of ASK1 kinase. Critical Roles of SHP2 in TNF-induced EC Apoptosis—ASK1-JNK signaling has been shown to be critical for TNF-induced apoptosis (7Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Min W. Cir. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19036-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and we determined TNF (plus cycloheximide, CHX)-induced EC apoptosis in WT and SHP2-KO EC. MLEC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) in the presence of CHX (10 μg/ml) for 6 h when EC apoptosis is initiated (26Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). EC apoptosis, characterized by nuclear fragmentation, was determined by DAPI staining followed by fluorescence microscopy. TNF (+CHX) strongly induced apoptosis in WT EC (∼16%) (Fig. 6a). Similar to TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling, TNF-induced apoptosis was also significantly reduced in SHP2-KO MLEC (∼5%) (Fig. 6a). Some of the dead cells cannot be visualized using this assay as they detached from the culture dish. Therefore, EC apoptosis was further determined by PI exclusion and annexin V staining followed by FACS analysis. TNF (plus CHX) significantly induced apoptosis in WT EC (∼30%). However, TNF(+CHX)-induced apoptosis was significantly blunted in SHP2-KO EC (∼14%) (Fig. 6, b with quantification apoptosis in c). These data support the critical roles of SHP2 in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK activation and EC apoptosis. We have previously shown that the activity of ASK1 is negatively regulated by Tyr-718 phosphorylation, which is critical for SOCS1 binding and SOCS1-mediated proteasomal degradation. TNF induces dephosphorylation of ASK1, leading to dissociation of ASK1 from SOCS1 and ASK1 stabilization. However, the kinase and phosphatase modulating the phosphorylation status of Tyr-718 on ASK1 were unknown. In this study, we identified that JAK2, when overexpressed or activated by IFN-γ, can phosphorylate Tyr-718 of ASK1. JAK2-induced Tyr(P)-718 triggers interaction between SOCS1 and ASK1, leading to subsequent ASK1 proteasomal degradation. In contrast, SHP2, an SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is engaged by TNF, dephosphorylates ASK1 at Tyr-718 and dissociates ASK1 from SOCS1, stabilizing ASK1 and activating ASK1-JNK apoptotic pathway in EC (Fig. 7). We have previously shown a single tyrosine residue Tyr-718 on ASK1 is responsible for binding to SOCS1, which in turn mediates a ubiquitin-dependent ASK1 degradation. Our current studies demonstrate that JAK2 is a specific kinase for ASK1 Tyr(P)-718. This is supported by the following evidence. 1) Overexpression of JAK2, but not JAK1, induces ASK1 Tyr(P)-718. 2) IFN-γ (activates JAK1 and JAK2), but not IFN-β (activates JAK1 and Tyk2), can induce ASK1 degradation. 3) IFN-γ-induced ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 and degradation can be blocked by a JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490. Interestingly, SOCS1 is a specific feedback inhibitor of IFN-γ, which acts by associating with JAK2 and its downstream signaling proteins to interfere with their kinase activity or binding to Tyr(P)-1007 on JAK2 to mediate its proteosome degradation. It is plausible that SOCS1 mediates degradation of the ASK1-JAK2 complex in response to IFN-γ. Consistent with this model, ASK1-JAK2 complex is labile and can be stabilized by proteasomal inhibitors. JAK2 can be activated by a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Consistently, we have previously shown that ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 is induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and IGF-1. Although the IGF-1 receptor is reported to directly bind to and tyrosine-phosphorylate ASK1, whether or not ASK1 tyrosine phosphorylation by IGF-1 receptor is mediated by the IGF-1 receptor-associated JAK2 has not been determined. Similarly, it needs to be further investigated whether JAK2 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor or other cytokine-induced ASK1 phosphorylation. We have also investigated the mechanism by which TNF induces dephosphorylation of ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 and subsequent release of SOCS1 from ASK1, a critical step in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. Our data suggest that SHP2 is a tyrosine phosphatase critical for TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 and activation of the ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, overexpression of the SHP2 wild type, but not a catalytically inactive form, induces dephosphorylation of ASK1 Tyr(P)-718. Second, a substrate-trapping mutant directly binds to ASK1 to a greater extent than SHP2-WT. More importantly, SHP2 deletion in EC blunts TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 and JNK activation. In SHP2-KO EC, basal and IFN-γ-induced ASK1 Tyr(P)-718 was enhanced, and TNF-induced dephosphorylation of ASK1 and activation of ASK1-JNK signaling as well as EC apoptosis are reduced. A similar role of SHP2 in facilitating SOCS1 release from JAK2 has also been reported (18Ali S. Nouhi Z. Chughtai N. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52021-52031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SHP2 dephosphorylates tyrosine (Tyr(P)-1007) of JAK2 kinase, a critical recruitment site for SOCS1, dissociating SOCS1 from JAK2 and stabilizing JAK2. Our data may reveal a common mechanism by which SOCS1-SHP2 regulates cytokine signaling and function. ASK1 is phosphorylated at several Ser/Thr sites (Ser(P)-83, pThr-845, Ser(P)-967, and Ser(P)-1034) (15Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H.

Regulation of phosphorylation by kinase and/or dephosphorylation by phosphatase at Ser-83, Ser-967, and Thr-845 has been investigated (15Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is known that the protein kinase Akt in complex with Hsp90 phosphorylates ASK1 at Ser-83 to inhibit ASK1-induced apoptosis (30Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 32Zhang R. Luo D. Miao R. Bai L. Ge Q. Sessa W.C. Min W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3954-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have also identified PP2A as a Ser-967-specific phosphatase, activating TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. In contrast, Thr(P)-845 positively regulates ASK1 activation. In response to upstream signals, ASK1 is activated by autophosphorylation at Thr-845 (14Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). PP5 and a member of PP2C (PP2Cϵ) have been implicated in dephosphorylation of ASK1 Thr-845 to negatively regulate ASK1 activity, functioning as a negative feedback inhibitor of ASK1 signaling (15Morita K.

https://openalex.org/W2052914871,"Normal pregnancy is associated with systemic and intrarenal vasodilatation resulting in an increased glomerular filtration rate. This adaptive response occurs in spite of elevated circulating levels of angiotensin II (Ang II). In the present study, we evaluated the potential mechanisms responsible for this adaptation. The reactivity of the mesangial cells (MCs) cultured from 14-day-pregnant rats to Ang II was measured through changes in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Cai]). The expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the Ang II-induced vasodilatation receptor AT2, and the relaxin (LGR7) receptor were evaluated in cultured MCs and in the aorta, renal artery and kidney cortex by real time-PCR. The intrarenal distribution of LGR7 was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The MCs displayed a relative insensitivity to Ang II, which was paralleled by an impressive increase in the expression level of iNOS, AT2 and LGR7. These results suggest that the MCs also adapt to the pregnancy, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the glomerular surface area even in the presence of high levels of Ang II. The mRNA expression levels of AT2 and LGR7 also increased in the aorta, renal artery and kidney of the pregnant animals, whereas the expression of the AT1 did not significantly change. This further suggests a role of these vasodilatation-induced receptors in the systemic and intrarenal adaptation during pregnancy. LGR7 was localized in the glomeruli and on the apical membrane of the tubular cells, with stronger labeling in the kidneys of pregnant rats. These results suggest a role of iNOS, AT2, and LGR7 in the systemic vasodilatation and intrarenal adaptation to pregnancy and also suggest a pivotal role for relaxin in the tubular function during gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2053068816,"Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a copper- and zinc-dependent enzyme. The main function of SOD1 is believed to be the scavenging and detoxification of superoxide radicals. Nevertheless, the last 30 years have seen a rapid accumulation of evidence indicating that SOD1 may also act as a peroxidase, an alternative function that was implicated in the onset and progression of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although SOD1 peroxidase activity and its dependence on carbon dioxide have been well described, the molecular basis of the SOD1 peroxidase cycle remains obscure, because none of the proposed catalytic intermediates have so far been identified. In view of recent observations, we hypothesized that the SOD1 peroxidase cycle relies on two steps: 1) reduction of SOD-Cu(II) by hydrogen peroxide followed by 2) oxidation of SOD-Cu(I) by peroxymonocarbonate, the product of the spontaneous reaction of bicarbonate with hydrogen peroxide, to produce SOD-Cu(II) and carbonate radical anion. This hypothesis has been investigated through electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance to provide direct evidence for a peroxycarbonate-driven, SOD1-catalyzed carbonate radical production. The results gathered herein indicate that peroxymonocarbonate (HOOCO(2)(-)) is a key intermediate in the SOD1 peroxidase cycle and identify this species as the precursor of carbonate radical anions."

Specifically, we demonstrate that the caspase 8 cleavage fragment Caspase8p43, activates p50/p65 Nuclear Factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), in a manner which is inhibited by dominant negative IkappaBalpha. This caspase 8 dependent NF-kappaB activation occurs following stimulation with gp120, TNF, or CD3/CD28 crosslinking, but these treatments do not activate NF-kappaB in cells deficient in caspase 8. The Casp8p43 cleavage fragment also transactivates the HIV LTR through NF-kappaB, and the absence of caspase 8 following HIV infection greatly inhibits HIV replication.Gp120 induced caspase 8 dependent NF-kappaB activation is a novel pathway of HIV replication which increases understanding of the biology of T-cell death, as well as having implications for understanding treatment and prevention of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2058244557,"The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 cadCA operon encodes a P-type ATPase, CadA, that confers resistance to Cd(II)/Pb(II)/Zn(II). Expression is regulated by CadC, a homodimeric repressor that dissociates from the cad operator/promoter upon binding of Cd(II), Pb(II), or Zn(II). CadC is a member of the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins. The crystal structure of CadC shows two types of metal binding sites, termed Site 1 and Site 2, and the homodimer has two of each. Site 1 is the physiological inducer binding site. The two Site 2 metal binding sites are formed at the dimerization interface. Site 2 is not regulatory in CadC but is regulatory in the homologue SmtB. Here the role of each site was investigated by mutagenesis. Both sites bind either Cd(II) or Zn(II). However, Site 1 has higher affinity for Cd(II) over Zn(II), and Site 2 prefers Zn(II) over Cd(II). Site 2 is not required for either derepression or dimerization. The crystal structure of the wild type with bound Zn(II) and of a mutant lacking Site 2 was compared with the SmtB structure with and without bound Zn(II). We propose that an arginine residue allows for Zn(II) regulation in SmtB and, conversely, a glycine results in a lack of regulation by Zn(II) in CadC. We propose that a glycine residue was ancestral whether the repressor binds Zn(II) at a Site 2 like CadC or has no Site 2 like the paralogous ArsR and implies that acquisition of regulatory ability in SmtB was a more recent evolutionary event. The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 cadCA operon encodes a P-type ATPase, CadA, that confers resistance to Cd(II)/Pb(II)/Zn(II). Expression is regulated by CadC, a homodimeric repressor that dissociates from the cad operator/promoter upon binding of Cd(II), Pb(II), or Zn(II). CadC is a member of the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins. The crystal structure of CadC shows two types of metal binding sites, termed Site 1 and Site 2, and the homodimer has two of each. Site 1 is the physiological inducer binding site. The two Site 2 metal binding sites are formed at the dimerization interface. Site 2 is not regulatory in CadC but is regulatory in the homologue SmtB. Here the role of each site was investigated by mutagenesis. Both sites bind either Cd(II) or Zn(II). However, Site 1 has higher affinity for Cd(II) over Zn(II), and Site 2 prefers Zn(II) over Cd(II). Site 2 is not required for either derepression or dimerization. The crystal structure of the wild type with bound Zn(II) and of a mutant lacking Site 2 was compared with the SmtB structure with and without bound Zn(II). We propose that an arginine residue allows for Zn(II) regulation in SmtB and, conversely, a glycine results in a lack of regulation by Zn(II) in CadC. We propose that a glycine residue was ancestral whether the repressor binds Zn(II) at a Site 2 like CadC or has no Site 2 like the paralogous ArsR and implies that acquisition of regulatory ability in SmtB was a more recent evolutionary event. Numerous cellular processes require metal ions as cofactors for enzymatic reactions or structural components of proteins. Some required metals are toxic at high concentrations, and other metal ions play no physiological roles and are toxic at low concentrations. Therefore, cells have evolved detoxification systems for a variety of metals including arsenic, antimony, zinc, lead, and cadmium (1Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Phung le T. Silver S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 311-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Nies D.H.S. Silver S. Molecular Microbiology of Heavy Metals. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2007: 371-406Google Scholar). These systems are extremely important to the survival of bacteria and are generally composed of a single transcriptionally regulated operon that encodes at least two gene products; that is, a transcriptional repressor (metal sensor protein) and a resistance protein such as an efflux pump, intracellular chelator, or modifying enzyme. The cadCA operon of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 confers resistance to Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) and encodes two proteins: CadC, a metal-responsive transcriptional repressor that responds to Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(I) (3Corbisier P.

The CadC homodimer binds to the cad operator/promoter (o/p) 3The abbreviations used are: o/p, operator/promoter; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; EXAFS, extended x-ray fine structure; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; SSRL, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; NSLS, National Synchrotron Light Source; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; O/N, oxygen/nitrogen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: o/p, operator/promoter; XAS, x-ray absorption spectroscopy; EXAFS, extended x-ray fine structure; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; SSRL, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; NSLS, National Synchrotron Light Source; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; O/N, oxygen/nitrogen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and represses transcription of the operon. When CadC binds Cd(II), Zn(II), or Pb(II), it dissociates from the DNA, allowing expression of the CadA ATPase. CadC has two different types of metal binding sites (four binding sites per dimer) (7Wong M.D. Lin Y.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40930-40936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The regulatory site, termed Site 1, is composed of four cysteine resides, Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60 (of which Cys11 is not absolutely required) (5Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of apo-CadC revealed a second type of binding site, termed Site 2, at the C-terminal interface between the dimers is composed of four residues, Asp101 and His103 from one monomer and His114 and Glu117 from the other monomer (9Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to examine the roles of Site 1 and Site 2 in CadC function and to shed light on the evolution of these sites. Although Site 2 is not regulatory in CadC, it is congruent with the regulatory Zn(II) site of the homologous SmtB repressor (10Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the aporepressor, one Site 2 is filled with Zn(II), and the other Site 2 is empty (9Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study the Site 1 and Site 2 metal binding sites were eliminated by mutagenesis. The stoichiometry, relative affinities, and coordination geometry of both sites of were determined. Both types of sites bound both Cd(II) and Zn(II), but Site 1 had a preference for Cd(II) over Zn(II), and the reverse was found for Site 2. Although mutagenesis of the metal binding residues in Site 2 eliminated binding of Zn(II) at the dimer interface, there was only a minimal effect on dimerization. The structure of the mutant lacking Site 2 was compared with the wild type with bound Zn(II) and with the structures of SmtB with and without Zn(II) (11Eicken C. Pennella M.A. Chen X. Koshlap K.M. VanZile M.L. Sacchettini J.C. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The results suggest that a single residue at position 87 may be responsible for the difference between the non-regulatory Zn(II) site in CadC and the Zn(II)-responsive site in SmtB. Construction of Mutants and Purification of CadC—CadC with a C11G substitution has wild type metalloregulatory properties and is considered as the wild type for the purposes of this study (5Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This variant has improved solubility properties and is less prone to form intermolecular disulfide bonds than CadC with a cysteine residue at position 11. Purified CadC was prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pYSCM2, as described previously (9Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CadC was reduced with 10 mol eq of dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 3–4 h. Dithiothreitol removal and concentration of protein were performed by dialysis using 10-kDa cut dialysis tubing membrane in an anaerobic chamber at 4 °C overnight. The stoichiometry of reduced thiols in purified wild type CadC was determined by titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (12Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar) to be 4.0 ± 0.2, consistent with Cys7, Cys52, Cys58, and Cys60 all being fully reduced. To mutate Site 1, Cys7, Cys58, and Cys60 were altered to serine residues. To mutate Site 2, Asp101 was changed to glycine in a previously constructed H103A mutant (7Wong M.D. Lin Y.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40930-40936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutants were prepared from the C11G variant using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were purified by the same procedure as described above. Fluorescence Anisotropy; DNA Binding by Fluorescence Anisotropy—DNA binding studies by fluorescence anisotropy were made using a Photon Technology International spectrofluorimeter fitted with polarizers in the L format. Complementary 34-mer oligonucleotides, one of which was labeled at the 5′ end with carboxyfluorescein, were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) to include the cad operator/promoter regions (5Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Endo G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): 5′-carboxyfluorescein-ATAATACACTCAAATAAATATTTGAATGAAGATG-3′ and 3′-TATTATGTGAGTTTATTTATAAACTTACTTACTAC-5′. The two strands were heated to 94 °C for 5 min, annealed by cooling to room temperature, and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Anisotropy measurements were performed in a buffer consisting of 5 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA. Dithiothreitol and EDTA were excluded for metal titrations. The buffer was degassed by bubbling with argon before the assay. Apo or metallated CadCs were titrated with 1.7 ml of 50 nm fluorescein-labeled cad o/p DNA. CadC was metallated by prior incubation with the addition of a mol eq of CdCl2. Changes in anisotropy were calculated after each addition using the supplied Felix32 software. The stoichiometry of binding of the CadC dimer to the cad o/p was calculated using DynaFit (14Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)—All metal binding experiments were carried out anaerobically under argon at 4 °C. For metal titrations, CadC in a buffer consisting of 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl was mixed with various concentrations of Zn(II) or Cd(II) at the indicated molar ratios in the same buffer. The final volume of each tube was adjusted to 0.1 ml with buffer and incubated 15 to 20 min on ice. Unbound metal was removed using Bio-Gel P-6 Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad). For experiments in which bound Cd(II) was replaced by Zn(II), 2 mol eq of ZnCl2 were added to CadC before the Cd(II) titration. The metal content of eluted samples was determined by ICP-MS using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ELAN 9000. All samples were dissolved in 2% analytical grade HNO3 acid for analysis. Standard solutions were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences for calibration. The protein concentration was determined using a calculated molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 6585 m-1 cm-1 (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) or a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—Samples for XAS analysis were prepared under argon in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7, 0.3 m NaCl, and 30% (v/v) glycerol Zn(II) or Cd(II) were added at either 0.9 or 1.8 mol eq to fill one or both types of sites. In experiments with both cadmium and zinc, the two metals were each added at 0.9 mol eq. Samples were added to Lucite cuvettes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Zinc and cadmium XAS data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beamlines 9-3 and 10-2 and at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) on beamline X9b. SSRL beamlines 9-3 and 10-2 were equipped with Si111 double crystal monochromators; beamline 9-3 utilized a mirror for harmonic rejection, whereas 10-2 was detuned 50% at k = 13 Å-1 at each element. NSLS beamline X9b was equipped with a Si111 monochromator equipped with a harmonic rejection mirror. SSRL samples were maintained at 10 K using Oxford Instruments continuous-flow liquid helium cryostats, and NSLS samples were run at 24 K using a He Displex Cryostat. Protein fluorescence excitation spectra were collected using 30-element Ge solid-state array detector at SSRL beamline 9-3 and using 13-element GE Healthcare solid-state detectors at both SSRL beamline 10-2 and at NSLS beamline X9b. X-ray energies were calibrated by collecting zinc or cadmium foil absorption spectra simultaneously with protein data, assigning the first inflection point as 9659 eV for zinc and 26725 eV for cadmium. Each fluorescence channel of each scan was examined for spectral anomalies before averaging. SSRL 9-3 data represent the average of 5 to 6 scans, whereas SSRL 10-2 and NSLS data represent the average of 9–10 scans. Full XAS data sets were collected on multiple independent wild type and mutant CadC samples to ensure sample reproducibility. XAS data were processed using the Macintosh OSX version of the EXAFSPak program suite integrated with the Feff v7.0 software for theoretical model generation. Data reduction was performed following preexisting protocols (16Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Data were converted to k-space using an E0 = 9680 eV for zinc and 26730 eV for cadmium. The k3-weighted EXAFS was truncated between 1.0 and 13 Å-1 for both metals for filtering purposes and Fourier-transformed. EXAFS data-fitting analysis was performed on raw/unfiltered data. Single scattering Feff Version 7.0 models were calculated for zinc- and cadmium-carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and zinc/cadmium coordination scattering to simulate possible metal-ligand environments. During data simulation, only the bond length and Debye-Waller factors were allowed to freely vary, whereas coordination numbers were fixed at half-integer values. For zinc fits, values for the scale factor of 1.0 and an E0 of -15.25, determined from fitting crystallographically characterized models, were fixed and utilized in the protein spectral simulations (16Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For cadmium fits, values for the scale factor of 1.0 and an E0 of -10.00, determined from fitting crystallographically characterized models, were fixed and utilized in the protein spectral simulations. Criteria for judging the best fit simulation and for the addition of ligand environments to the fit included the lowest mean square deviation between data and fit (F′), a value that was corrected for number of degrees of freedom in the fit, and all Debye-Waller factors maintained below a maximum value of 0.006 Å2. Simulation parameters of the progressively optimized zinc and cadmium EXAFS data for each sample are in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Assays—Protein and aqueous ZnCl2 solutions were prepared anaerobically in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 mm NaCl. ITC experiments were conducted anaerobically at 25 °C using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA) by titrating a 4 mm metal solution into 0.2 mm CadC in 1.4 ml of buffer. After an initial 2 μl of ZnCl2 solution injection, 40 additional injections of 3 μl each were titrated into the protein sample at 5-min intervals. The syringe stirring speed was held constant at 500 rpm. All experiments were conducted in triplicate on independent protein and ZnCl2 samples to ensure data reproducibility. Data analysis was performed utilizing Origin 7.0 Scientific Graphing and Analysis Software (MicroCal) by applying a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm. Optical Spectroscopy Measurements of Cd(II) Binding by CadC—UV-visible absorption measurements were carried out under argon at room temperature in a Varian Carry 1E spectrophotometer. Aliquots of CdCl2 were added from a gastight Hamilton syringe to reduced CadC in a sealed cuvette. EDTA was used to buffer very low concentrations of free Cd(II). A conditional stability constant for the Cd-EDTA complex was 3.2 × 1012m-1 under these experimental conditions (17Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Other Organic Ligands. Plenum Press, New York1977: 168Google Scholar). After each addition the solution was mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min, after which spectra were collected from 200 to 600 nm. Spectra were corrected for dilution and by subtracting the apoCadC spectrum from each spectrum of metallated protein. Ultracentrifugation Analysis of CadC—Wild type CadC and the Site 2 mutant were analyzed by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation at the National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility at the University of Connecticut. Crystallization of the Site 2 Mutant—Crystals of the Site 2 mutant were grown at 23 ± 2 °C in hanging drops. Purified protein (2 μl of 13.5 mg/ml) was added to 2 μl of a well solution containing 1.6 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0. The droplets were equilibrated with 0.6 ml of well solution. The crystals grew within 4–5 days, attaining dimensions of 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3. Using a well solution containing 30% glucose, data were collected at the Advance Photon Source, LS-CAT Beamline 21-ID-D, Chicago, IL. The crystal belonged to the space group P43, with cell parameters a = b = 89.47 Å, c = 148.54 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (24McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storonia L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13901) Google Scholar) using a dimer from the CadC crystal structure (PDB code 1U2W) as a model (9Ye J. Kandegedara A. Martin P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The solution was further refined by the maximum likelihood method using REFMAC (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). A total of 142 water molecules were identified in the 2Fo - Fc map. A few peaks that appeared at >3.5 σ in the difference Fourier map were identified Na+ ions. Attempts to model zinc atoms with partial occupancy into those made the R- and B-factors worse. There were a few unexplained densities in the final difference Fourier map. The final R-factor after refinement to convergence was 28.8%, with a free R value of 28.6%. X-ray data and refinement statistics are in supplemental Table 1. Construction of Site 1 and Site 2 Mutants—Mutant CadCs were created that eliminated either Site 1 or Site 2. To the Site 1 mutant, Cys7, Cys58, and Cys60 were sequentially altered to serine residues. In this mutant Site 2 is unaltered. To construct the Site 2 mutant, Asp101 was changed to glycine residue in a previously constructed H103A mutant (7Wong M.D. Lin Y.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40930-40936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This double mutant was used because, as described below, it crystallized well. The wild type and two mutants were purified, and their DNA and metal binding properties were compared. DNA Binding and Cd(II)-dependent Dissociation—To examine the effect of the two types of mutations on binding to the cad o/p, fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed using a 5′-fluorescein-labeled 34-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the cad o/p. Binding was estimated from the change in fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 1). The magnitude of the binding affinities reveals that the three apoproteins bind to DNA with similar affinities. Wild type CadC has only an ∼2-fold higher affinity (Ka = 1.3 ± 0.02 × 107m-1) (Fig. 1A) than the Site 1 (6.4 ± 0.01 × 106m-1) (Fig. 1B) and Site 2 mutants (Ka = 6.2 ± 0.01 × 106m-1) (Fig. 1C). Binding of Cd(II) to wild type CadC reduces the affinity for DNA by nearly 2 orders of magnitude relative to the apoprotein (Fig. 1A). Similarly, binding of Cd(II) to the Site 2 mutant decreased the affinity for DNA approximately by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with its apo form (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that the Site 2 mutant retains near wild type response to Cd(II). In contrast, Cd(II) had little effect on the affinity of the Site 1 mutant for DNA (Fig. 1B), indicating loss of metalloregulation of DNA binding by elimination of Site 1. Analysis of Binding of Zn(II) and Cd(II) to Wild Type and Mutant CadCs by ICP-MS—The binding properties of wild type CadC has been characterized by optical spectroscopy for Cd(II) and Pb(II), which absorb light at ∼240 nm when they form a charge-transfer intermediate with the cysteine thiolates of Site 1 (8Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Zn(II), however, does not produce a spectroscopic signal upon binding in CadC Site 1 nor do the metal-O and metal-N bonds in Site 2 produce a detectable absorbance. On the other hand, high affinity metal binding can be determined directly by ICP-MS, with which multiple metals can be analyzed simultaneously. Wild type CadC and the Site 1 and Site 2 mutants were titrated with either Cd(II) or Zn(II) (supplemental Fig. 1). Wild type protein bound Zn(II) with a stoichiometry of 4 per CadC dimer but only two Cd(II) per dimer (supplemental Fig. 1A), indicating four binding sites for Zn(II) but only two for Cd(II). The Site 2 mutant, which retains Site 1, bound either Zn(II) or Cd(II) in a ratio of two metals per dimer (supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that Site 1 binds either metal. Surprisingly, the Site 1 mutant, which retains Site 2, also bound two atoms of either Zn(II) or Cd(II) (supplemental Fig. 1B), indicating that Site 2 also binds either metal. Which sites bind which metals? To investigate this question, wild type CadC was saturated with four Zn(II) atoms, and then the Zn(II)-bound protein was titrated with Cd(III) (Fig. 2A). Using ICP-MS, the same sample could be assayed for both metals simultaneously. At saturating Cd(II), two of the four Zn(II) atoms were displaced, resulting in a CadC dimer with two Cd(II) and two Zn(II) atoms. These results indicate that one type of site is selective for Zn(II) over Cd(II), and the other has higher affinity site for Cd(II) than Zn(II). In the Site 2 mutant, Zn(II) was displaced by Cd(II) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the Site 1 mutant Zn(II) was not displaced by Cd(II) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that Site1 is selective for Cd(II) over Zn(II), whereas Site 2 is selective for Zn(II) over Cd(II). Cd(II) binding isotherms for wild type and mutant CadCs were calculated from the amount of bound Cd(II) as a function of the [Cd(II)]/[CadC] molar ratio using Dynafit (14Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The fit of the data shown is consistent with binding of two cadmium atoms per dimer for all three proteins, indicating that each has single type of tight Cd(II) binding site, in agreement with EXAFS data described below. The sensitivity of the method allows estimation of only a lower limit of Kd (1 > 107m-1) under these experimental conditions. The affinity of the wild type and Site 2 mutant was too high for determination, but affinity of the Site 1 mutant (Kd = 4.3 ± 0.01 × 106m-1) could be calculated. The results show that only two cadmium atoms are bound with high affinity in the wild type and Site 2 mutant, i.e. to Site 1. Thus, although both Site 1 and Site 2 appear individually capable of binding Cd(II), Site 2 binds only low affinity. Binding of Cd(II) to Site 2 Assayed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To confirm that Cd(II) binds to Site 2 at low affinity, binding was assayed by ITC. Again, the binding affinity for wild type and the Site 2 mutant, i.e. at Site 1, is too high to be determined accurately by this method, but the affinity of the Site 1 mutant, i.e. binding of Cd(II) at Site 2, was within the range of ITC analysis (Fig. 3). The data displayed a mixed heat reaction that began with exothermic and was followed by late exothermic heat changes. Cd(II) binding follows an exponential binding curve in the initial stages followed by constant heat absorption due to Cd(II) hydration at the post-saturation sate. The best fit binding isotherm for Cd(II) binding was found to have a stoichiometry of 1.4 ± 0.02 per dimer, consistent with the value of 2 cadmiums per dimer found by the ICP-MS direct binding measurements. The Ka for Cd(II) was determined to be 8.1 ± 1.4 × 106m-1, which is in the same range as binding affinity observed (Kd = 4.3 ± 0.01 × 106m-1) from the direct binding measurements by ICP-MS. Binding of Cd(II) to Site 1 by Optical Spectroscopy—The intense cadmium-thiolate charge-transfer band at ∼240 nm is useful for determining the relative affinities of Site 1 and Site 2. Wild type and mutant CadCs were titrated with Cd(II) in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4). Both wild type (Fig. 4A) and the Site 2 mutant (Fig. 4B) produce a peak centered at 238 nm. The association constants of Cd(II) binding were calculated using DynaFit (14Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) with assumed stoichiometries of 1:1, 2:1, or 4:1 Cd(II):CadC dimer. Assumptions of 1:1 and 4:1 stoichiometries gave unreasonably high standard errors, whereas the 2:1 stoichiometry was within acceptable limits. Association constants of 4.1 × 1012 and 2.6 × 1012m-1 were calculated for the wild type and Site 2 mutants, respectively, demonstrating that Site 1 is a high affinity cadmium binding site. Analysis of Cadmium and Zinc Binding by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to probe the local structural environment of zinc and cadmium metal bound to the individual CadC metal binding sites. Full zinc EXAFS were collected for a number of samples including 1) wild type CadC with two or four zincs bound per protein dimer, 2) wild type protein with both two zinc and two cadmium bound per dimer, 3) the Site 1 mutant with two zinc bound per dimer, and 4) the Site 2 mutant with two zinc bound per dimer (supplemental Fig. 2). Full cadmium EXAFS were collected on the complementary set of samples. Raw and simulated zinc and cadmium EXAFS for each sample are given in spectra A–E in supplemental Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Corresponding Fourier transforms of the raw and simulated EXAFS are given in spectra F–J in supplemental Figs. 2 and 3. In the case of the wild type samples with two or four zincs bound per dimer in the absence of an additional metal, spectral simulations indicate nearly identical average zinc coordination environments between the two samples constructed on average of 2.0 O/N and 1.5 S nearest neighbor zinc ligands at respective average distances of 1.97 and 2.20 Å (supplemental Table 2, fits 1.4 and 2.4). In both cases, additional long range Zn···C scattering is observed at ca. 3 and 4 Å. The strong similarity between the best-fit averaged zinc-nearest neighbor bond parameters for the wild type, regardless of whether two or four zinc atoms are bound per dimer suggests that in the absence of additional metals, zinc populates both Sites 1 and 2 equally. Upon the addition of stoichiometric amounts of cadmium and zinc to the wild type, the average zinc environment becomes constructed of only oxygen/nitrogen-based ligands (there is no Zn-S scattering present in this sample).

We present a computational algorithm that employs clique-finding for heterogeneity and multidimensionality in biomedical and epidemiological research (the “CHAMBER” algorithm). Methodology/Principal Findings This algorithm uses graph-building to (1) identify genetic variants that influence disease risk and (2) predict individuals at risk for disease based on inherited genotype. We use a set-covering algorithm to identify optimal cliques and a Boolean function that identifies etiologically heterogeneous groups of individuals. We evaluated this approach using simulated case-control genotype-disease associations involving two- and four-gene patterns. The CHAMBER algorithm correctly identified these simulated etiologies. We also used two population-based case-control studies of breast and endometrial cancer in African American and Caucasian women considering data on genotypes involved in steroid hormone metabolism. We identified novel patterns in both cancer sites that involved genes that sulfate or glucuronidate estrogens or catecholestrogens. These associations were consistent with the hypothesized biological functions of these genes. We also identified cliques representing the joint effect of multiple candidate genes in all groups, suggesting the existence of biologically plausible combinations of hormone metabolism genes in both breast and endometrial cancer in both races. Conclusions The CHAMBER algorithm may have utility in exploring the multifactorial etiology and etiologic heterogeneity in complex disease."
