https://openalex.org/W1967224500,"Epigenetic reprogramming including demethylation of DNA occurs in mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) and in early embryos, and is important for the erasure of imprints and epimutations, and the return to pluripotency. The extent of this reprogramming and its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We previously showed that the cytidine deaminases AID and APOBEC1 can deaminate 5-methylcytosine in vitro and in Escherichia coli, and in the mouse are expressed in tissues in which demethylation occurs. Here we profiled DNA methylation throughout the genome by unbiased bisulphite next generation sequencing in wild-type and AID-deficient mouse PGCs at embryonic day (E)13.5. Wild-type PGCs revealed marked genome-wide erasure of methylation to a level below that of methylation deficient (Np95(-/-), also called Uhrf1(-/-)) embryonic stem cells, with female PGCs being less methylated than male ones. By contrast, AID-deficient PGCs were up to three times more methylated than wild-type ones; this substantial difference occurred throughout the genome, with introns, intergenic regions and transposons being relatively more methylated than exons. Relative hypermethylation in AID-deficient PGCs was confirmed by analysis of individual loci in the genome. Our results reveal that erasure of DNA methylation in the germ line is a global process, hence limiting the potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. AID deficiency interferes with genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation patterns, indicating that AID has a critical function in epigenetic reprogramming and potentially in restricting the inheritance of epimutations in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2126931729,"Vimentin is used widely as a marker of the epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) that take place during embryogenesis and metastasis, yet the functional implications of the expression of this type III intermediate filament (IF) protein are poorly understood. Using form factor analysis and quantitative Western blotting of normal, metastatic, and vimentin-null cell lines, we show that the level of expression of vimentin IFs (VIFs) correlates with mesenchymal cell shape and motile behavior. The reorganization of VIFs caused by expressing a dominant-negative mutant or by silencing vimentin with shRNA (neither of which alter microtubule or microfilament assembly) causes mesenchymal cells to adopt epithelial shapes. Following the microinjection of vimentin or transfection with vimentin cDNA, epithelial cells rapidly adopt mesenchymal shapes coincident with VIF assembly. These shape transitions are accompanied by a loss of desmosomal contacts, an increase in cell motility, and a significant increase in focal adhesion dynamics. Our results demonstrate that VIFs play a predominant role in the changes in shape, adhesion, and motility that occur during the EMT."

In two treated patients, insertional activation of MDS1–EVI1, PRDM16 and SETBP1 markedly increased the number of transduced cells in the blood, leading to oligoclonal hematopoiesis, monosomy 7 and a myelodysplastic syndrome ( pages 163–165 ). Gene-modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) can provide ample clinical benefits to subjects suffering from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD), a rare inherited immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent, often life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Here we report on the molecular and cellular events observed in two young adults with X-CGD treated by gene therapy in 2004. After the initial resolution of bacterial and fungal infections, both subjects showed silencing of transgene expression due to methylation of the viral promoter, and myelodysplasia with monosomy 7 as a result of insertional activation of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1). One subject died from overwhelming sepsis 27 months after gene therapy, whereas a second subject underwent an allogeneic HSC transplantation. Our data show that forced overexpression of EVI1 in human cells disrupts normal centrosome duplication, linking EVI1 activation to the development of genomic instability, monosomy 7 and clonal progression toward myelodysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1993868308,"The authors develop a model of synaptic plasticity that can account for a large body of experimental data on connection patterns in the cortex. This model uses multiple parameters, including presynaptic spike interval and postsynaptic membrane potential. Electrophysiological connectivity patterns in cortex often have a few strong connections, which are sometimes bidirectional, among a lot of weak connections. To explain these connectivity patterns, we created a model of spike timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) in which synaptic changes depend on presynaptic spike arrival and the postsynaptic membrane potential, filtered with two different time constants. Our model describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under rate-coded input with spatial correlations only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different coding principles across brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that plasticity is fast."
https://openalex.org/W2029447880,"Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used.We conducted a statistical analysis of >2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures--a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants.We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults."

https://openalex.org/W2126505667,"HSAN1 is an inherited neuropathy found to be associated with several missense mutations in the SPTLC1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). SPT catalyzes the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, the initial step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Here we show that the HSAN1 mutations induce a shift in the substrate specificity of SPT, which leads to the formation of the two atypical deoxy-sphingoid bases (DSBs) 1-deoxy-sphinganine and 1-deoxymethyl-sphinganine. Both metabolites lack the C(1) hydroxyl group of sphinganine and can therefore neither be converted to complex sphingolipids nor degraded. Consequently, they accumulate in the cell, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells overexpressing mutant SPTLC1 and lymphoblasts of HSAN1 patients. Elevated DSB levels were also found in the plasma of HSAN1 patients and confirmed in three groups of HSAN1 patients with different SPTLC1 mutations. The DSBs show pronounced neurotoxic effects on neurite formation in cultured sensory neurons. The neurotoxicity co-occurs with a disturbed neurofilament structure in neurites when cultured in the presence of DSBs. Based on these observations, we conclude that HSAN1 is caused by a gain of function mutation, which results in the formation of two atypical and neurotoxic sphingolipid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1993362565,"Two amplified genes from chromosome 8q22—YWHAZ and LAPTM4B—are associated with metastatic breast cancer recurrence by promoting resistance to anthracyclines. YWHAZ codes for an antiapoptotic protein and LAPTM4B encodes a previously undescribed lysosomal protein. Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer after surgery has effectively lowered metastatic recurrence rates1. However, a considerable proportion of women suffer recurrent cancer at distant metastatic sites despite adjuvant treatment. Identification of the genes crucial for tumor response to specific chemotherapy drugs is a challenge but is necessary to improve outcomes2. By using integrated genomics, we identified a small number of overexpressed and amplified genes from chromosome 8q22 that were associated with early disease recurrence despite anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. We confirmed the association in an analysis of multiple independent cohorts. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of either of two of these genes, the antiapoptotic gene YWHAZ and a lysosomal gene LAPTM4B, sensitized tumor cells to anthracyclines, and overexpression of either of the genes induced anthracycline resistance. Overexpression of LAPTM4B resulted in sequestration of the anthracycline doxorubicin, delaying its appearance in the nucleus. Overexpression of these two genes was associated with poor tumor response to anthracycline treatment in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in women with primary breast cancer. Our results suggest that 8q22 amplification and overexpression of LAPTM4B and YWHAZ contribute to de novo chemoresistance to anthracyclines and are permissive for metastatic recurrence. Overexpression of these two genes may predict anthracycline resistance and influence selection of chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2092811282,"Just how animals are able to use the Earth's magnetic field for navigation is the subject of much current interest. It is known that the UV-A/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry) mediates the light-dependent magnetic sense in Drosophila. Steven Reppert and colleagues now use genetic manipulation to show that two cryptochromes from the monarch butterfly, Drosophila-like Cry1 and vertebrate-like Cry2, can restore magnetic sensation in cry-deficient Drosophila. This suggests that both types of Cry have the capacity to sense magnetic fields in the migratory monarch butterfly via a mechanism that remains unclear — and that light sensitivity is involved in some way. Animals use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation but the biophysical basis of this is unclear. The light-dependent magnetic sense of Drosophila melanogaster was recently shown to be mediated by the cryptochrome (Cry) photoreceptor; here, using a transgenic approach, the type 1 and 2 Cry of the monarch butterfly are shown to both function in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila, and probably use an unconventional photochemical mechanism. Understanding the biophysical basis of animal magnetoreception has been one of the greatest challenges in sensory biology. Recently it was discovered that the light-dependent magnetic sense of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the ultraviolet (UV)-A/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry)1. Here we show, using a transgenic approach, that the photoreceptive, Drosophila-like type 1 Cry and the transcriptionally repressive, vertebrate-like type 2 Cry of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can both function in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila and require UV-A/blue light (wavelength below 420 nm) to do so. The lack of magnetic responses for both Cry types at wavelengths above 420 nm does not fit the widely held view that tryptophan triad-generated radical pairs mediate the ability of Cry to sense a magnetic field. We bolster this assessment by using a mutant form of Drosophila and monarch type 1 Cry and confirm that the tryptophan triad pathway is not crucial in magnetic transduction. Together, these results suggest that animal Crys mediate light-dependent magnetoreception through an unconventional photochemical mechanism. This work emphasizes the utility of Drosophila transgenesis for elucidating the precise mechanisms of Cry-mediated magnetosensitivity in insects and also in vertebrates such as migrating birds."
https://openalex.org/W2031658574,"In perceptual discrimination tasks, a subject's response time is determined by both sensory and motor processes. Measuring the time consumed by the perceptual evaluation step alone is therefore complicated by factors such as motor preparation, task difficulty and speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Here we present a task design that minimizes these confounding factors and allows us to track a subject's perceptual performance with unprecedented temporal resolution. We find that monkeys can make accurate color discriminations in less than 30 ms. Furthermore, our simple task design provides a tool for elucidating how neuronal activity relates to sensory as opposed to motor processing, as demonstrated with neural data from cortical oculomotor neurons. In these cells, perceptual information acts by accelerating and decelerating the ongoing motor plans associated with correct and incorrect choices, as predicted by a race-to-threshold model, and the time course of these neural events parallels the time course of the subject's choice accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W1991262879,"Anandamide (AEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that exerts several effects in the brain as well as in peripheral tissues. These effects are mediated mainly by two types of cannabinoid receptors, named CB(1)R and CB(2)R, making AEA a prominent member of the ""endocannabinoid"" family. Also immune cells express CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, and possess the whole machinery responsible for endocannabinoid metabolism. Not surprisingly, evidence has been accumulated showing manifold roles of endocannabinoids in the modulation of the immune system. However, details of such a modulation have not yet been disclosed in primary human T-cells.In this investigation we used flow cytometry and ELISA tests, in order to show that AEA suppresses proliferation and release of cytokines like IL-2, TNF-alpha and INF-gamma from activated human peripheral T-lymphocytes. However, AEA did not exert any cytotoxic effect on T-cells. The immunosuppression induced by AEA was mainly dependent on CB(2)R, since it could be mimicked by the CB(2)R selective agonist JWH-015, and could be blocked by the specific CB(2)R antagonist SR144528. Instead the selective CB(1)R agonist ACEA, or the selective CB(1)R antagonist SR141716, were ineffective. Furthermore, we demonstrated an unprecedented immunosuppressive effect of AEA on IL-17 production, a typical cytokine that is released from the unique CD4+ T-cell subset T-helper 17.Overall, our study investigates for the first time the effects of the endocannabinoid AEA on primary human T-lymphocytes, demonstrating that it is a powerful modulator of immune cell functions. In particular, not only we clarify that CB(2)R mediates the immunosuppressive activity of AEA, but we are the first to describe such an immunosuppressive effect on the newly identified Th-17 cells. These findings might be of crucial importance for the rational design of new endocannabinoid-based immunotherapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2145411867,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) kills ~1.6 million people annually. Pneumococcal infections predominantly manifest as pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and otitis media. S. pneumoniae is also a member of the normal nasopharyngeal flora, colonizing up to 80% of children. Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) has been associated with both pneumococcal disease and transmission. However, to date no animal model has been available to investigate the role of IAV in the spread of S. pneumoniae. Here we investigate pneumococcal-influenza synergism with a particular focus on the role of IAV on pneumococcal transmission. Infant mice were colonized with S. pneumoniae and subsequently infected with IAV 3 d later. Using this novel model we show increased pneumococcal colonization and disease in the presence of IAV. Notably, in vivo imaging showed that IAV was essential for the transmission of S. pneumoniae from colonized (“index”) mice to their naive cohoused littermates (“contacts”). Transmission occurred only when all mice were infected with IAV and was prevented when an IAV-neutralizing antibody was used to inhibit IAV replication in either index mice or contact mice. Together, these data provide novel insights into pneumococcal-influenza synergism and may indicate a previously unappreciated role of IAV in the spread of S. pneumoniae. —Diavatopoulos, D.

https://openalex.org/W2135160600,"The cleavage of sphingoid base phosphates by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase to produce phosphoethanolamine and a fatty aldehyde is the final degradative step in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. We have studied mice with an inactive S1P lyase gene and have found that, in addition to the expected increase of sphingoid base phosphates, other sphingolipids (including sphingosine, ceramide, and sphingomyelin) were substantially elevated in the serum and/or liver of these mice. This latter increase is consistent with a reutilization of the sphingosine backbone for sphingolipid synthesis due to its inability to exit the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Furthermore, the S1P lyase deficiency resulted in changes in the levels of serum and liver lipids not directly within the sphingolipid pathway, including phospholipids, triacyglycerol, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol. Even though lipids in serum and lipid storage were elevated in liver, adiposity was reduced in the S1P lyase-deficient mice. Microarray analysis of lipid metabolism genes in liver showed that the S1P lyase deficiency caused widespread changes in their expression pattern, with a significant increase in the expression of PPARgamma, a master transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. However, the mRNA expression of the genes encoding the sphingosine kinases and S1P phosphatases, which directly control the levels of S1P, were not significantly changed in liver of the S1P lyase-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that S1P lyase is a key regulator of the levels of multiple sphingolipid substrates and reveal functional links between the sphingolipid metabolic pathway and other lipid metabolic pathways that may be mediated by shared lipid substrates and changes in gene expression programs. The disturbance of lipid homeostasis by altered sphingolipid levels may be relevant to metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2003660636,"In budding yeast, many inducible genes translocate to the nuclear periphery when activated. Sequence motifs have now been identified in promoters, which target genes to the nuclear periphery and contribute to gene activation Many genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are recruited to the nuclear periphery after transcriptional activation. We have identified two gene recruitment sequences (GRS I and II) from the promoter of the INO1 gene that target the gene to the nuclear periphery. These GRSs function as DNA zip codes and are sufficient to target a nucleoplasmic locus to the nuclear periphery. Targeting requires components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and a GRS is sufficient to confer a physical interaction with the NPC. GRS I elements are enriched in promoters of genes that interact with the NPC, and genes that are induced by protein folding stress. Full transcriptional activation of INO1 and another GRS-containing gene requires GRS-mediated targeting of the promoter to the nuclear periphery. Finally, GRS I also functions as a DNA zip code in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that this mechanism of targeting to the nuclear periphery has been conserved over approximately one billion years of evolution."

Targeted antiretroviral PrEP could be particularly effective at slowing the spread of HIV-1 if a single antiretroviral combination were found to be broadly protective across multiple routes of transmission. Therefore, we designed our in vivo preclinical study to systematically investigate whether rectal and intravenous HIV-1 transmission can be blocked by antiretrovirals administered systemically prior to HIV-1 exposure. We performed these studies using a highly relevant in vivo model of mucosal HIV-1 transmission, humanized Bone marrow/Liver/Thymus mice (BLT). BLT mice are susceptible to HIV-1 infection via three major physiological routes of viral transmission: vaginal, rectal and intravenous. Our results show that BLT mice given systemic antiretroviral PrEP are efficiently protected from HIV-1 infection regardless of the route of exposure. Specifically, systemic antiretroviral PrEP with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate prevented both rectal (Chi square = 8.6, df = 1, p = 0.003) and intravenous (Chi square = 13, df = 1, p = 0.0003) HIV-1 transmission. Our results indicate that antiretroviral PrEP has the potential to be broadly effective at preventing new rectal or intravenous HIV transmissions in targeted high risk individuals. These in vivo preclinical findings provide strong experimental evidence supporting the potential clinical implementation of antiretroviral based pre-exposure prophylactic measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."

This is dependent on the presence of intracellular flagellin. Previous reports have suggested that this activation is independent of extracellular K+ and not accompanied by leakage of K+ from the cell, in contrast to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, non-flagellated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to activate NLRC4, suggesting that formation of a pore in the cell membrane by the TTSS apparatus may be sufficient for inflammasome activation. Thus, we set out to determine if extracellular K+ influenced P. aeruginosa inflammasome activation. We found that raising extracellular K+ prevented TTSS NLRC4 activation by the non-flagellated P. aeruginosa strain PA103ΔUΔT at concentrations above 90 mm, higher than those reported to inhibit NLRP3 activation. Infection was accompanied by efflux of K+ from a minority of cells as determined using the K+-sensitive fluorophore PBFI, but no formation of a leaky pore.

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other main inflammasome, which is based around the NLRC4 protein (formerly known as interleukin-1 protein-activating factor, IPAF), is involved mainly in detection of intracellular bacteria or their products (22.Evans T.J. Future Microbiol. 2009; 4: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23.Brodsky I.E. Monack D. Semin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The only well-defined ligand for NLRC4 is bacterial flagellin (24.Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 25.Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A.

This requires to be translocated into the host cell cytoplasm, a process that usually requires a bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS) (24.Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 25.Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Núñez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In contrast to the NLRP3 inflammasome, this process is described as not being inhibited by raising extracellular K+ (21.Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 26.Franchi L. Kanneganti T.D. Dubyak G.R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18810-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Initially described for the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, this TTSS-dependent activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome has also been described for the extracellular pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27.Sutterwala F.S. Mijares L.A. Li L. Ogura Y. Kazmierczak B.I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3235-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 28.Miao E.A. Ernst R.K. Dors M. Mao D.P. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29.Franchi L. Stoolman J. Kanneganti T.D. Verma A. Ramphal R. Núñez G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 3030-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, one of the strains used in these experiments, PA103, lacks flagellin, yet was still able to activate the NLRC4 inflammasome in a TTSS-dependent fashion (27.Sutterwala F.S. Mijares L.A. Li L. Ogura Y. Kazmierczak B.I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3235-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, there must exist TTSS-dependent triggers to NLRC4 activation that are distinct from flagellin. We are interested in elucidating the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa can activate the NLRC4 inflammasome in the absence of flagellin. One possibility is that rather than introducing a pathogen-specific molecule, the TTSS induces membrane damage that leads to inflammasome activation, in much the same way as for the NLRP3 inflammasome. We set out to test this hypothesis by determining if alteration of the extracellular K+ concentration affected the ability of P. aeruginosa lacking flagellin to activate the inflammasome. Rather surprisingly, we found that this is true, but not only for a non-flagellated P. aeruginosa. Inflammasome activation by flagellated strains of this microbe as well as the flagellated S. typhimurium was also abrogated by raising extracellular K+. The concentration of extracellular K+ required to inhibit NLRC4 inflammasome activation is much higher than reported for the NLRP3 inflammasome. Infection of cells produces a detectable K+ efflux, but only in a minority of cells. However, we found no evidence of a leaky pore on infection of cells with P. aeruginosa. Thus, K+ efflux is important in NLRC4 activation by P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium as well as its role in the activation of NLRP3 by diverse stimuli, but these bacteria do not produce a nonspecific membrane pore. All animals were kept according to Institutional and National guidelines. C57BL/6 mice (bred in-house) were housed in filtered cages and sacrificed using cervical dislocation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated as previously described (30.Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, femurs and tibias were flushed with medium using a 21G needle to obtain bone marrow mononuclear phagocytic precursor cells. To remove tissue and debris the cell suspension was passed through a Nitex mesh (Cadish, London, UK). Culture medium used was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone (amphotericin B), and 100 μm/ml sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). Bone marrow mononuclear phagocytic precursor cells were seeded into untreated 9-cm Petri dishes (Sterilin, Caerphilly, UK) at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/plate. Complete medium was further supplemented with M-CSF, obtained from the supernatant of L929 cells. Cells were cultured for 3 days, after which medium and M-CSF were added, and cells were grown for a further 3–4 days. Matured macrophages were replated on the day of the experiment. RAW 264 and HeLa cells (ECACC, Porton Down, UK) were cultured in RPMI as above. For imaging experiments, medium without Phenol Red was used, with the addition of 25 mm HEPES. ATP and Escherichia coli LPS purified by ion-exchange chromatography were from Sigma. The following bacterial strains were used. P. aeruginosa PA103ΔUΔT (31.Arora S.K. Dasgupta N. Lory S. Ramphal R. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1474-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which lacks any effectors passing through its functional TTSS. PA103ΔpcrV lacks the ability to form a functional TTSS (both were a gift from D. Frank, University of Wisconsin). PA103ΔUΔT:exoU translocates the toxin ExoU (32.Stirling F.R. Cuzick A. Kelly S.M. Oxley D. Evans T.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1294-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa PAO1 strains: PAO1ΔSTY has a functional TTSS but does not translocate any toxins; PAO1ΔpopB has a non-functional TTSS (both gifts from A. Rietsch, Case Western Reserve University). S. enterica serovar typhimurium strain SL1344 was a gift from M. Roberts, University of Glasgow. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm. The following day bacteria were diluted 1 in 30 and grown until the A600 was between 0.4 and 0.6. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, bacteria were diluted in medium and used to infect macrophages at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). For experiments involving manipulation of extracellular potassium concentration, medium was replaced 0.5 h prior to infection with “high” (140 mm K+) or “low” (5 mm K+) potassium buffer as described by (19.Gurcel L. Abrami L. Girardin S. Tschopp J. van der Goot F.G. Cell. 2006; 126: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), supplemented with 1× MEM vitamin solution, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× MEM amino acids solution and 100 μm/ml sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). Intermediate potassium concentrations were prepared by mixing of the two buffers. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100 μm glybenclamide (Sigma) 30 min before infection as previously described (33.Muruve D.A. Pétrilli V. Zaiss A.K. White L.R. Clark S.A. Ross P.J. Parks R.J. Tschopp J. Nature. 2008; 452: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Internalization was measured by a gentamicin protection assay. After a 90-min infection of BMDM as above, cells were washed three times in medium before incubating for a further 90 min in medium with gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Cells were then washed, lysed in 1% Triton X in phosphate-buffered saline, and viable bacteria enumerated by colony counting after culture. Macrophages were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per well of a 6-well dish on the day of experiment in complete medium lacking antibiotics. Macrophages were then infected or stimulated at indicated time points, and medium was removed and cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of 10% nitric acid and intracellular K+ concentration was measured as previously described (26.Franchi L. Kanneganti T.D. Dubyak G.R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18810-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intracellular K+ content was measured using a Sherwood MA10C Flame Photometer. Values were compared with those obtained with standard solutions of potassium chloride. Additionally, intracellular K+ was determined in individual cells using the K+-sensitive fluorophore PBFI (34.Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BMDM were seeded onto chamber slides at 5 × 105 cells/well in complete RPMI without Phenol Red (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to settle, and the medium was changed to RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES. Cells were loaded with the cell permeant acetoxymethyl ester of PBFI (PBFI-AM (Invitrogen) at 2 μm together with Pluronic F-127 (a non-ionic detergent polyol used to facilitate cell loading of large dye molecules, Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After one wash in medium, cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 60 inverted microscope with a 37 °C heated stage. Fluorescence emission at 500 nm was recorded with excitation alternating between 340 and 380 nm; PBFI shows K+ emission dependent at 500 nm when excited at 340 nm, but a K+-independent fluorescence when excited at 380 nm, near the isosbestic point. Hence, the ratio between fluorescence emission at 500 nm when excited at 340 and 380 nm provides a good assay for intracellular K+ that is independent of dye concentration and photobleaching. After an initial period of stabilization, cells were infected or treated as indicated. Control incubations using valinomycin to equilibrate intracellular and extracellular K+ were performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed the expected decrease in PBFI 340/380 fluorescence ratio. Time lapse images were acquired every 30 s using OpenLab software (Improvision, PerkinElmer, Wiesbaden, Germany). Image analysis was performed using Image J software (USA NIH, Bethesda, MD). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (27.Sutterwala F.S. Mijares L.A. Li L. Ogura Y. Kazmierczak B.I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3235-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting. The rabbit anti-mouse caspase-1 p10 (sc-514) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Insight Biotechnology, Wembley, UK) and the mouse anti-mouse β-actin was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Mouse interleukin 1β (IL-1β) was measured in culture supernatants with ELISA kits (DuoSet DY401) from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Release of pro-IL-1β was controlled for as previously described (24.Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in cell supernatants was determined with the CytoTox 96 assay from Promega (Southampton, UK). Cells were exposed to Lucifer yellow after infection as described in Neyt and Cornelis (35.Neyt C. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and cells imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescence microscope and OpenLab software. Intracellular calcium imaging was performed using the dye Fluo-4 (Invitrogen). Cells were loaded with 3 μm Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester for 60 min at 37 °C, then washed in medium and incubated a further 30 min at 37 °C, Imaging was performed on a 37 °C heated stage every 15 s using OpenLab to control the microscope. Time lapses and image analysis was performed using the program ImageJ. In cells infected with the ExoU translocating strain PA103ΔUΔT:exoU, the medium was additionally supplemented with ethidium bromide at 5 μg/ml. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Statistical tests were used as described; results were considered statistically significant at a p value of less than 0.05. Statistical analysis was carried out using the computer program Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To investigate the role of the type III secretion system (TTSS) in triggering the activation of the inflammasome, we used murine BMDM and infected them with strains of P. aeruginosa or treated them with ATP after LPS induction of pro-IL-1β as a control. We used the non-flagellated strain PA103ΔUΔT that has a fully functional TTSS, but does not translocate any pseudomonal toxins. Following infection of unprimed BMDM for 90 min at a MOI of 100, this strain of P. aeruginosa induced significant secretion of IL-1β into the medium, and cleavage of caspase-1 to a processed p10 fragment (Fig. 1). Infection with a strain that lacked a functional TTSS, PA103ΔpcrV, failed to activate the inflammasome (Fig. 1). Thus, as described previously (27.Sutterwala F.S. Mijares L.A. Li L. Ogura Y. Kazmierczak B.I. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 3235-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), activation of the inflammasome following infection with P. aeruginosa can occur in the absence of flagellin but does require a functional TTSS. Importantly, even a short (90 min) incubation with the bacteria in the absence of pretreatment with LPS led to a significant accumulation of secreted IL-1β, which was just under half the amount produced by ATP stimulation of LPS pretreated BMDM (Fig. 1a). Differences in internalization could not account for the differences observed (Fig. 1c). Microbial infection alone is thus a sufficient stimulus to lead to pro-IL-1β induction, presumably through its possession of LPS. In other experiments (later figures and data not shown) we have used BMDM pretreated with LPS to maximize the IL-1β signal, as others have adopted, but there were no other differences in the results of the experiments. To confirm that P. aeruginosa PA103ΔUΔT activation of the inflammasome was dependent on the protein NLRC4, we repeated these experiments using BMDM from mice with specific homozygous deletions of genes encoding various inflammasome components (supplemental Fig. S1). This confirmed that inflammasome activation by PA103ΔUΔT was dependent on NLRC4 and ASC, but was independent of NLRP3. In these and all other experiments, cytotoxicity of this infection, as measured by release of LDH, was typically ≤ 10% (supplemental Fig. S1a), showing that capsase-1 activation and IL-1β release can be dissociated from cell death. Interestingly, at higher MOIs, we did observe a very high LDH release in BMDM from NLRP3-deleted mice (data not shown), suggesting that this protein may protect against cell death in this model. One possible explanation for the activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome by PA103ΔUΔT is membrane damage caused by the TTSS, rather than a specific pathogen-derived molecule. We hypothesized that such membrane-damage might lead to efflux of K+ and contribute to NLRC4 activation, as has been described for NLRP3 activation (21.Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 26.Franchi L. Kanneganti T.D. Dubyak G.R. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18810-18818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we infected BMDM at a variety of multiplicities of infection (MOIs) with PA103ΔUΔT in medium with either a normal physiological K+ concentration (5 mm) or a high K+ concentration (140 mm), to inhibit potential efflux of K+ through a TTSS mediated pore. As expected at normal extracellular K+, infection with PA103ΔUΔT led to IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation that increased with increasing MOI (Fig. 2, a and c). However, in the high K+ buffer the secretion of IL-1β was significantly inhibited, as was the activation of caspase-1 (Fig. 2, a and c). Extracellular K+ concentration did not affect cell death, as evidenced by LDH release at all the MOIs tested (Fig. 2b). We next turned to another strain of P. aeruginosa, PAO1, which also activates the inflammasome in a TTSS- and NLRC4-dependent fashion, but predominantly through the intracellular introduction of flagellin (28.Miao E.A. Ernst R.K. Dors M. Mao D.P. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Following infection of BMDM in low K+ buffer, the strain PAO1ΔSTY that has a functional TTSS but does not translocate any effectors, produced secretion of IL-1β (Fig. 2d). A strain lacking a functional TTSS, PAO1ΔpopB, did not induce IL-1β. Surprisingly, however, we found that exactly as with PA103ΔUΔT, infection of cells in medium with high K+ concentration largely abrogated the secretion of IL-1β (Fig. 2d, open bars). We confirmed that isogenic strains of PAO1 lacking flagellin largely lacked the ability to induce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion (data not shown), confirming the observation that in this strain NLRC4 activation is predominantly due to delivery of intracellular flagellin (28.Miao E.A. Ernst R.K. Dors M. Mao D.P. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Next, we determined the concentration of extracellular K+ required to inhibit activation of the inflammasome by PA103ΔUΔT. We infected BMDM at a fixed MOI of 30 in buffers of varying K+ concentration. At extracellular K+ concentrations above 90 mm, there was a progressive decline in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release that was virtually complete at 140 mm K+ (Fig. 3, a and c). This compares to effective inhibitory concentrations of 60 mm K+ to prevent staphylococcal α-toxin-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (36.Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); however, greater concentrations were required to produce full inhibition after longer preincubations with LPS. Potassium efflux from cells can also be blocked by inhibitors of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, such as glybenclamide (33.Muruve D.A. Pétrilli V. Zaiss A.K. White L.R. Clark S.A. Ross P.J. Parks R.J. Tschopp J. Nature. 2008; 452: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Addition of this drug to BMDM prior to infection with P. aeruginosa PA103ΔUΔT significantly inhibited Il-1β release (Fig. 3b), again supporting the conclusion that K+ exit from the cells is required for the NLRC4-mediated activation of the inflammasome. Because we were not expecting that raising extracellular K+ concentration could inhibit activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome, we re-examined the effects of altering extracellular K+ on inflammasome activation in BMDM following infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen, S. typhimurium. Previous studies have reported that prevention of K+ efflux does not inhibit inflammasome activation initiated by infection with this microbe. We adopted a similar experimental approach as for our experiments with P. aeruginosa infection. Firstly, we infected BMDM at a variety of MOIs for 90 min with S. typhimurium strain SL1344 in low (5 mm) and high (140 mm) K+ buffers. As with infection with PA103ΔUΔT, high extracellular K+ concentration was an effective inhibitor of IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation following SL1344 over a range of MOIs (Fig. 4, a and b), with no difference in cell death (Fig. 4c). We then investigated the exact extracellular K+ concentration necessary to inhibit S. typhimurium activation of the inflammasome. By infecting BMDM in buffers of various K+ concentrations, we found that significant reduction in IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation was observed at extracellular K+ concentrations above 90 mm (Fig. 5, a and c).

Little is known, however, about the regulation and physiological relevance of this system. Patch-clamp studies in freshly isolated ASDN provide evidence that increased dietary Na+ intake in wild-type mice lowers ENaC Po, consistent with a contribution to Na+ homeostasis, and is associated with increased urinary concentrations of UTP and the ATP hydrolytic product, ADP. Genetic deletion of P2Y2 receptors in mice (P2Y2 −/−; litter-mates to wild-type mice) or inhibition of apical P2Y-receptor activation in wild-type mice prevents dietary Na+-induced lowering of ENaC Po. Although they lack suppression of ENaC Po by dietary NaCl, P2Y2−/− mice do not exhibit NaCl-sensitive blood pressure, perhaps as a consequence of compensatory down-regulation of aldosterone levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, clamping mineralocorticoid activity at high levels unmasks greater ENaC activity and NaCl sensitivity of blood pressure in P2Y2−/− mice. The studies indicate a key role of the apical ATP/UTP-P2Y2-receptor system in the inhibition of ENaC Po in the ASDN in response to an increase in Na+ intake, thereby contributing to NaCl homeostasis and blood pressure regulation.—Pochynyuk, O., Rieg, T., Bugaj, V., Schroth, J., Fridman, A., Boss, G.

https://openalex.org/W1984734545,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in cardiomyocytes, which contributes to myocardial depression during sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. This study was undertaken to investigate the contribution of histone deacetylase (HDAC) to TNF-alpha expression in cardiomyocytes and the signaling mechanism of LPS-induced HDAC activation. Here, we show for the first time that LPS increases HDAC activity and that inhibition of HDAC decreases LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha expression via the accumulation of NF-kappaB/p65 at the TNF-alpha promoter in cardiomyocytes. Using a positive screen, we have further identified HDAC3 as a specific member of the HDAC family able to regulate TNF-alpha production. Furthermore, our data reveal that LPS-induced HDAC activity is mediated through reactive oxygen species from mitochondria and c-Src signaling. In summary, this study demonstrates a novel signaling mechanism by which LPS via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species/c-Src/HDAC3 pathways mediate TNF-alpha expression in cardiomyocytes."

In the present studies, we further investigated the detailed molecular mechanism of the cross-talk between TGF-β/Smad3 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. We found that C-terminal Smad3 interacted with both the N-terminal region and the middle region of β-catenin protein in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Both Smad3 and Smad4 were required for the interaction with β-catenin and protected β-catenin from an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation. In addition, the formation of the Smad3-Smad4-β-catenin protein complex also mediated β-catenin nuclear translocation.

Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B.

Cell. 2005; 8: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutive activation of β-catenin in chondrocytes through deletion of exon 3 of the β-catenin gene leads to severely compromised cartilage formation (6.Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1072-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Other signaling molecules could interact with β-catenin and indirectly regulate chondrocyte function (8.Monga S.P. Mars W.M. Pediaditakis P. Bell A. Mulé K. Bowen W.C. Wang X. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2064-2071PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Haq S. Michael A. Andreucci M. Bhattacharya K. Dotto P. Walters B. Woodgett J. Kilter H. Force T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4610-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The TGF-β signaling is involved in multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGF-β ligand transduces its signal through binding with type II and type I receptors leading to Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact with Smad4 and then translocate into nucleus where they act as transcription factor and participate in transcriptional regulation of target genes. Cumulative evidence demonstrates that TGF-β stimulates cell proliferation during early chondrocyte formation. Specific expression of the dominant-negative form of type II TGF-β receptor in articular cartilage and synovium promotes chondrocyte differentiation leading to osteoarthritis (10.Serra R. Johnson M. Filvaroff E.H. LaBorde J. Sheehan D.M. Derynck R. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). More studies are required to further understand the detailed molecular mechanism of TGF-β during chondrogenesis. Recent studies suggest that TGF-β interacts with Wnt signaling during chondrogenesis (11.Tuli R. Tuli S. Nandi S. Huang X. Manner P.A. Hozack W.J. Danielson K.G. Hall D.J. Tuan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41227-41236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), but the detailed molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that TGF-β activates β-catenin signaling through Smad3 (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we further investigated the role of Smad3 and Smad4 in the protection of β-catenin degradation and β-catenin nuclear translocation in chondrocytes. COS cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DNA plasmids were transiently transfected into COS, 293T, or RCJ3.1C5.18 in 6-cm culture dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Empty vector was used to keep the total amount of transfected DNA plasmid constant in each group in all experiments. FLAG-EGFP plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control to evaluate transfection efficiency. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were performed 24 h after transfection. Western blotting and IP were performed as described previously (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The interaction between endogenous β-catenin and Smad3/4 and the ubiquitination of endogenous β-catenin protein was determined in chondrogenic RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm) was added to the cell culture 4 h before the cells were harvested in β-catenin ubiquitination assay. The rat anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody (clone 14) was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Rabbit anti-Smad3 polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used to detect Smad3 expression. β-Catenin and Smad3 immunostaining was performed as previously described (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were seeded in 15-cm culture dishes, and 100 mm Smad3 siRNA or 10 μg of pCMV5B-FLAG-Smad3 were used for transfection. 24 h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and split into five 10-cm dishes. 12 h after recovery, the cells were cultured in regular medium with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem) for 0, 30, 60, 120, and 300 min before harvesting. Western blotting was performed to detect the decay of endogenous β-catenin proteins. The plasmids of reporter constructs were co-transfected with wild type (WT) Smad3 or mutant forms of Smad3 expression plasmid into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with Wnt3a (100 ng/ml) for 36 h or with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 4 h. The cell lysates were then collected, and luciferase activity was measured using a Promega Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Real time PCR was performed as described previously (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study were as follow: β-actin, 5′-TGT TAC CAA CTG GGA CGA CA (upper primer) and 3′-CTG GGT CAT CTT TTC ACG GT (lower primer); Smad4, 5′-TCG ATT CAA ACC ATC CAA CA (upper primer) and 3′-GCC CTG AAG CTA TCT GCA AC (lower primer); Dkk1, 5′-AAT CGA GGA AGG CAT CAT TG (upper primer) and 3′-GCT TGG TGC ATA CCT GAC CT (lower primer); Axin2, 5′-CTC TAA CGC TAG GCG GAA TG (upper primer) and 3′-CCA GAA GTC CAG GGT ATC CA (lower primer); and cyclin D1, 5′-GCG TAC CCT GAC ACC AAT CT (upper primer) and 3′-GGC TCC AGA GAC AAG AAA CG (lower primer). The PCR conditions included a denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 58 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. Detection of the fluorescent product was carried out at the end of the 72 °C extension period. The PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis, and the data were analyzed and quantified with the Rotor-Gene analysis software. Dynamic tube normalization and noise slope correction were used to remove background fluorescence. Each sample was tested at least in triplicate and repeated using three independent cell preparations. Statistical comparison between two groups was performed using unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant and is denoted in the figures. Our previous study demonstrated that Smad3 interacts with β-catenin in chondrocytes (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we first mapped the interaction domains of β-catenin and Smad3. COS cells were overexpressed with Smad1 or Smad3 together with β-catenin, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-β-catenin antibody, and expression of Smad1/3 proteins was detected by Western blotting. Both Smad1 and Smad3 interacted with β-catenin, and Smad3 exhibited much stronger interaction with β-catenin than Smad1 (Fig. 1A). β-Catenin protein contains an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–149), a central armadillo repeat domain (amino acids 150–665), and a C-terminal p300 binding domain (amino acids 666–781) (13.Song L.N. Gelmann E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37853-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated three mutant β-catenin constructs that encode different segments of β-catenin protein (BD1, amino acids 1–260; BD2, amino acids 261–500; and BD3, amino acids 501–781) (Fig. 1B). These three truncated forms of β-catenin expression constructs were co-transfected with Smad3 expression plasmid into COS cells. The BD1 and BD2 fragments of β-catenin interacted with Smad3 (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that Smad3 interacts with both the N-terminal and the mid-region of β-catenin protein. We then investigated whether β-catenin fragments interact with endogenous Smad3 in chondrocytes and whether this interaction is TGF-β-dependent. The rat chondrogenic progenitor cell line RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were transfected with three truncated forms of β-catenin and treated with or without TGF-β. Endogenous Smad3 protein was immunoprecipitated, and expression of truncated forms of β-catenin was detected by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that Smad3 interacted with β-catenin BD1 and BD2 fragments in a TGF-β-dependent manner in RCJ3.1C5.18 cells (Fig. 1D). To clarify which domain of Smad3 interacts with β-catenin, we generated three truncated forms of Smad3 expression constructs: N-Smad3 (amino acids 1–145), NL-Smad3 (amino acids 1–211), and C-Smad3 (amino acids 200–425) (Fig. 1E). These three truncated forms of Smad3 were co-transfected with β-catenin in RCJ3.1C5.18 cells, and IP assay was performed. C-terminal Smad3 but not N-Smad3 or NL-Smad3 interacted with β-catenin (Fig. 1F). Taken together, the results demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Smad3 interacts with both the N-terminal and the mid-region of β-catenin, and this interaction is TGF-β-dependent. β-Transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the SCFβ-TrCP protein complex, which induces β-catenin degradation in many cell types (4.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 15.Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-TrCP induces β-catenin degradation in chondrocytes and whether Smad3 plays a role in β-catenin degradation, we transfected β-TrCP expression plasmid with or without Smad3 into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. Overexpression of β-TrCP mediated β-catenin degradation; however, Smad3 blocked the effect of β-TrCP (Fig. 2A). To determine the effect of Smad3 on β-catenin degradation, the RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were overexpressed with Smad3 or transfected with Smad3 siRNA. 24 h after the transfection, protein synthesis was stopped by the addition of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. β-Catenin protein levels in the control siRNA transfected group began to decline 60 min after treatment with cycloheximide, whereas β-catenin protein levels declined much faster at the very beginning of cycloheximide treatment, and the protein levels decreased dramatically in the Smad3 siRNA transfected group (Fig. 2B). In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 protected β-catenin degradation. β-Catenin protein levels remained stable during the entire period of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2B). The silencing efficiency of Smad3 siRNA was over 70% (Fig. 2C). To determine whether Smad3 inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were transiently transfected with Smad3 expression plasmid, and expression of phospho-β-catenin was detected. Overexpression of Smad3 significantly inhibited β-catenin phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). We also performed the ubiquitination assay using UbiQaptureTM-Q kit. After 4 h of treatment with MG-132, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-ubiquitin-conjugated beads, and ubiquitinated β-catenin protein levels were detected through Western blotting. Overexpression with β-TrCP induced the ubiquitination of β-catenin (Fig. 2E, second lane), whereas transfection of Smad3 reversed the effect of β-TrCP on β-catenin degradation (Fig. 2E, fourth lane). In TGF-β signaling pathway, Smad4 acts as co-Smad to bind with Smad2/3 and facilitates the nuclear translocation of the heteromeric complex. To determine whether Smad4 interacts with β-catenin, immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-β-catenin antibody, Smad4 expression was detected by Western blotting. The interaction between Smad4 and β-catenin was detected in a Smad3-dependent manner. Overexpression of Smad3 facilitated the interaction between Smad4 and β-catenin, whereas silencing of Smad3 blocked this interaction (Fig. 3A). To determine whether this interaction is TGF-β-dependent, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were treated with TGF-β, and the IP assay was performed. Under TGF-β induction, the interaction between Smad4 and β-catenin was enhanced (Fig. 3B). To determine whether silencing of Smad4 accelerates β-catenin degradation, the β-catenin protein levels were detected after Smad4 siRNA was transfected. Transfection of Smad4 siRNA effectively inhibited Smad4 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). Silencing of Smad4 attenuated the β-catenin protein level, even in the presence of Smad3. Transfection of Smad3 completely reversed β-TrCP-induced β-catenin degradation. However, Smad3 failed to reverse β-TrCP-induced β-catenin degradation when Smad4 siRNA was transfected into these cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that Smad4, together with Smad3, forms a complex with β-catenin and protects β-catenin degradation. Smad2 is another R-Smad protein that is phosphorylated by TGF-β receptors and then interacts with Smad4. The interaction between Smad2 and β-catenin has been demonstrated (18.Hirota M. Watanabe K. Hamada S. Sun Y. Strizzi L. Mancino M. Nagaoka T. Gonzales M. Seno M. Bianco C. Salomon D.S. Cell Signal. 2008; 20: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined whether Smad2 protects β-catenin degradation by Western blotting. Smad2 partially reversed the effect of β-TrCP-induced β-catenin degradation. When the Smad3 expression was knocked down, Smad2 showed minimal effect on protection of β-catenin degradation (Fig. 3E). These results demonstrate that Smad3 plays dominant role in the protection of β-catenin degradation. In previous studies, we found that TGF-β promotes nuclear translocation of Smad3 as well as β-catenin in chondrocytes (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether Wnt3a-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation is impaired when Smad3 is inhibited in chondrocytes, Smad3 siRNA were transfected into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. 24 h after transfection of Smad3 siRNA, the cells were treated with Wnt3a, and immunostaining was performed 4 h later. Compared with the control group, in which Wnt3a facilitated β-catenin nuclear translocation, silencing of Smad3 inhibited β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 4A). To further determine whether Smad3 promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation, we have generated two Smad3 NLS mutant constructs: ΔK40K41 and K43N/K44Q mutants based on previous report (19.Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Expression of the deletion mutant ΔK40K41 of Smad3 is evenly distributed throughout the cells. The K43N/K44Q mutant of Smad3 is significantly less enriched in the nucleus compared with the WT Smad3 and acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation (20.Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To confirm that mutant Smad3 does serve as a dominant-negative mutant, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were co-transfected with WT Smad3 or two mutant forms of Smad3 and p3TP-Lux reporter with or without TGF-β treatment. The results from the luciferase assay demonstrated that TGF-β stimulated p3TP-Lux reporter activity, and overexpression of Smad3 further increased the reporter activity. In contrast, two mutant forms of Smad3 (ΔK40K41 and K43N/K44Q) partially inhibited TGF-β-mediated reporter activity (Fig. 4B). To determine whether Smad3 promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation, WT and two mutant Smad3 constructs were transfected into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with or without TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 4 h, and the nuclear translocation of Smad3 and β-catenin were examined by the immunostaining assay. TGF-β induced the nuclear translocation of Smad3 as well as β-catenin in WT Smad3-transfected cells but failed to induce Smad3 and β-catenin localization in mutant Smad3 (K43N/K44Q and Smad3 ΔK40K41) transfected cells (Fig. 4C). These findings are consistent with the previous report (19.Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To further confirm the nuclear translocation patterns of Smad3 and β-catenin, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were transfected with WT Smad3 or two mutant forms of Smad3 with or without TGF-β treatment. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were collected separately, and Western blotting was performed. TGF-β induced nuclear Smad3 and β-catenin protein levels in WT Smad3 transfected cells (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of the mutant forms of Smad3 inhibited the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 4D). RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were also transfected with Smad3 siRNA. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β for 4 h, and β-catenin localization was determined by immunostaining. Silencing of Smad3 inhibited the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that in addition to the protection of β-catenin degradation, Smad3 also assists β-catenin nuclear translocation. To investigate the effect of Smad3 on the activity of β-catenin as a transcription factor, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were transfected with Smad3 siRNA and treated with Wnt3a. mRNA expression and promoter activity of cyclin D1 and Axin2, downstream target genes of β-catenin, were detected. Silencing of Smad3 inhibited the stimulatory effect of Wnt3a on both cyclin D1 and Axin2 expression (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, knocking down of Smad3 also inhibited Wnt3a-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 5C). To determine whether β-catenin signaling is affected by NLS mutants of Smad3, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells were co-transfected with WT and two mutant constructs of Smad3 together with TOP-flash reporter and treated with or without Wnt3a. The effect of mutant Smad3 on β-catenin signaling was examined by luciferase assay. Smad3 alone significantly increased TOP-flash reporter activity, which is consistent with our previous results (12.Li T.F. Chen D. Wu Q. Chen M. Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. Drissi H. Zuscik M. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21296-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Wnt3a-induced β-catenin reporter activity was enhanced by overexpression of Smad3, suggesting that Smad3 protects β-catenin degradation and activates the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. However, the effect of Wnt3a on TOP-flash reporter activity was significantly inhibited by transfection of NLS mutant forms of Smad3 (Fig. 5D). WT and two NLS mutant forms of Smad3 were then co-transfected with cyclin D1 promoter, −962CD1-Luc, into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells with or without β-catenin co-transfection. Compared with the control group, WT Smad3 increased cyclin D1 promoter activity (∼2.5-fold increase). Overexpression of β-catenin significantly enhanced the effect of Smad3 on cyclin D1 promoter activity (6-fold increase). In contrast, two mutant forms of Smad3 inhibited the stimulatory effect of β-catenin on cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that Smad3 nuclear translocation is required for β-catenin to activate downstream target genes. To determine whether TGF-β stimulates cyclin D1 promoter activity in a β-catenin-dependent manner, WT (−962CD1) and mutant (−962CD1) (with the deletion of four TCF binding sites) (21.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar) cyclin D1 promoter constructs were transfected into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with different concentrations of TGF-β (0, 0.2, 1, and 5 ng/ml). Treatment with TGF-β significantly increased WT cyclin D1 promoter activity (6-fold increase, 1 ng/ml of TGF-β), and deletion of TCF binding sites inhibited the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that TGF-β may regulate target genes indirectly through activation of the β-catenin activity. Chondrogenesis is a tightly regulated event involving multiple steps from condensation of the precartilagineous mesenchyme to chondrogenic lineage determination toward chondroblasts and eventually differentiation into hypertrophic chondrocytes. This process is regulated by several key growth factors and signaling molecules, such as BMP, Hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-β, which play important roles at various stages of chondrogenesis (22.Kawakami Y.

At sites of endochondral bone formation, TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 are detected in the chondrocytes of proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and TGF-β2 is detected in cells of all zones of the cartilage (24.Janssens K. ten Dijke P. Janssens S. Van Hul W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 743-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad2/3 in upper sternal chondrocytes inhibits colX expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating that the TGF-β pathway inhibits chondrocyte maturation (25.Ferguson C.M.

Our recent studies demonstrated that chondrocyte proliferation was inhibited, the chondrocyte differentiation process was promoted, and BMP signaling was up-regulated in chondrocytes derived from Smad3 knock-out mice (12.Li T.F.

Compared with TGF-β, canonical Wnt pathway inhibits early chondrogenesis in the developing skeleton but is necessary for the chondrocyte maturation and the lineage determination of osteo-chondrogenic progenitor cells (5.Hill T.P.

Cross-talk between TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways during chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells has been previously reported. It has been demonstrated that TGF-β stimulates Wnt2, 4, 5a, 7a, 10a, and Lrp5 expression. TGF-β also dramatically increases the protein level, protein stability, and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in human mesenchymal progenitor cells and human bone marrow stromal cells (11.Tuli R.

Bone Miner Res. 2004; 19: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and this pathway is required for the stimulation of bone marrow stromal cell proliferation (33.Jian H. Shen X. Liu I. Semenov M. He X. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we further investigated the detailed molecular mechanism on Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation by TGF-β. We found that both Smad3 and Smad4 interact with β-catenin and form a protein complex. This complex not only stabilizes β-catenin to prevent it from proteasome degradation but also assists β-catenin in nuclear translocation and eventually facilitates β-catenin transcriptional activity. This regulatory pattern also indicates that Wnt/β-catenin may act synergistically with the TGF-β pathway or work as a downstream target of TGF-β during a specific stage of chondrogenesis. Cross-talk among TGF-β, BMP, Wnt, and other pathways is crucial for stem cell maintenance, body patterning, organogenesis, and homeostasis in adult animals. The cooperation among multiple signaling pathways may contribute to the specification of cell fates (34.Mishra L. Shetty K. Tang Y. Stuart A. Byers S.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5775-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35.Guo X. Wang X.F. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). It has been reported that BMP-2 cross-talk with Wnt pathway through Smad1/4 interacting with β-catenin/TCF to synergistically activate late osteoblastic differentiation marker genes. Overexpression of Wnt3a suppresses the inhibitory effect of BMP-2 on myogenic differentiation (36.Nakashima A. Katagiri T. Tamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37660-37668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our present results indicate that in addition to Smad3, Smad4 also interacts with β-catenin in chondrocytes, which is consistent with the previous report that Smad4 forms a complex with Lef1/TCF and β-catenin to activate target gene transcription (37.Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Our data also showed that in chondrocytes, silencing of Smad4 reversed the effect of Smad3 on β-catenin, suggesting that the interaction of Smad4 with β-catenin also protects β-catenin degradation. Similar observations were found in pancreatic carcinoma cells (38.Romero D. Iglesias M. Vary C.P. Quintanilla M. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that regulation of Smad3/4 on β-catenin may exist in multiple cell types. Many studies have reported that the cooperation between TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin pathways permits tight control of critical developmental processes. It has been reported that TGF-β and Wnt pathways synergistically regulate downstream target gene transcription through transcription factors TCF/Lef1 and Smad3 (39.Labbé E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In human bone marrow stromal cells, myostain induces Smad3/β-catenin interaction to activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which results in inhibition of adipogenesis (40.Guo W. Flanagan J. Jasuja R. Kirkland J. Jiang L. Bhasin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9136-9145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that TGF-β3 stimulates chondrogenic differentiation partially through Wnt5a-mediated signaling. Up-regulation of Wnt5a promotes expression of cell adhesion molecules through the p38 MAPK pathway in early stage chondrogenesis (41.Jin E.J. Park J.H. Lee S.Y. Chun J.S. Bang O.S. Kang S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Smad7 directly interacts with β-catenin and mediates β-catenin degradation by recruiting E3 ligase Smurf2, thereby reducing Wnt activity (42.Han G. Li A.G. Liang Y.Y. Owens P. He W. Lu S. Yoshimatsu Y. Wang D. Ten Dijke P. Lin X. Wang X.J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Axin1, as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling pathway, binds with Smad7, leading to Smad7 ubiquitination and degradation, and subsequently facilitates TGF-β signaling (14.Liu W. Rui H. Wang J. Lin S. He Y. Chen M. Li Q. Ye Z. Zhang S. Chan S.C. Chen Y.G. Han J. Lin S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1646-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to its indirect effect, Axin1 also directly interacts with Smad3 and facilitates Smad3 phosphorylation and enhances TGF-β transcriptional activity (31.Furuhashi M. Yagi K. Yamamoto H. Furukawa Y. Shimada S. Nakamura Y. Kikuchi A. Miyazono K. Kato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5132-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In summary, our results reveal the novel molecular mechanism that TGF-β activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway through interaction of Smad3/4 with β-catenin. This interaction permits tight regulation of chondrocyte development and leads to a stage-specific effect of TGF-β during chondrogenesis."

Microarray analysis showed differential expression of multiple miRNAs in HIVE compared to control brains. Target prediction and gene ontology enrichment analysis disclosed targeting of several gene families/biological processes by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), with cell death-related genes, including caspase-6, showing a bias toward down-regulated DEMs. Consistent with the miRNA data, HIVE brains exhibited higher levels of caspase-6 transcripts compared with control patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of the cleaved form of caspase-6 in astrocytes in HIVE brain sections. Exposure of cultured human primary astrocytes to HIV viral protein R (Vpr) induced p53 up-regulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-6 activation followed by cell injury. Transgenic mice, expressing Vpr in microglial cells, demonstrated astrocyte apoptosis in brain, which was associated with caspase-6 activation and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Overall, these data point to previously unrecognized alterations in miRNA profile in the brain during HIV infection, which contribute to cell death through dysregulation of cell death machinery.—Noorbakhsh, F., Ramachandran, R., Barsby, N., Ellestad, K.

https://openalex.org/W1675428930,"Anorexia and weight loss are prevalent in infectious diseases. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we established animal models of infection-associated anorexia by administrating bacterial and viral products, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 transactivator protein (Tat). In these models, we found that the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a pivotal transcription factor for inflammation-related proteins, was activated in the hypothalamus. In parallel, administration of LPS and Tat increased hypothalamic pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which was abrogated by inhibition of hypothalamic NF-κB. In vitro, NF-κB activation directly stimulated the transcriptional activity of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor of anorexigenic melanocortin, and mediated the stimulatory effects of LPS, Tat, and pro-inflammatory cytokines on POMC transcription, implying the involvement of NF-κB in controlling feeding behavior. Consistently, hypothalamic injection of LPS and Tat caused a significant reduction in food intake and body weight, which was prevented by blockade of NF-κB and melanocortin. Furthermore, disruption of IκB kinase-β, an upstream kinase of NF-κB, in POMC neurons attenuated LPS- and Tat-induced anorexia. These findings suggest that infection-associated anorexia and weight loss are mediated via NF-κB activation in hypothalamic POMC neurons. In addition, hypothalamic NF-κB was activated by leptin, an important anorexigenic hormone, and mediates leptin-stimulated POMC transcription, indicating that hypothalamic NF-κB also serves as a downstream signaling pathway of leptin.

In addition, hypothalamic NF-κB was activated by leptin, an important anorexigenic hormone, and mediates leptin-stimulated POMC transcription, indicating that hypothalamic NF-κB also serves as a downstream signaling pathway of leptin. Anorexia and wasting are common symptoms associated with infectious diseases (1.Hart B.L. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1988; 12: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 2.Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Infection-associated anorexia is not merely the consequence of fever and general weakness (3.Aubert A. Goodall G. Dantzer R. Physiol. Behav. 1995; 57: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it appears to occur due to an alteration in the motivation to eat (4.McCarthy D.O. Kluger M.J. Vander A.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1984; 40: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The suppression of food intake during acute infection may constitute a host defense mechanism as poor nutritional states might limit the proliferation of infectious organisms (5.Murray M.J. Murray A.B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1979; 32: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, a prolonged reduction in food intake will deplete body fat and protein reserves, resulting in malnutrition, impaired host immune functions, and increased morbidity and mortality (6.Grinspoon S. Mulligan K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 36: S69-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of infection-associated anorexia and weight loss should aid in improving the quality of life in patients with chronic debilitating infections. Cumulating evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the periphery and brain play a role in infection-associated anorexia and weight loss (7.Plata-Salaman, C. R. (2001) Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 25 Suppl 5, S48–52Google Scholar). Because appetite is regulated by the central nervous system, infection-associated anorexia may be mediated via the central mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has demonstrated that central inflammatory signals are important for bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 3The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideNF-κBnuclear factor-κBIKKIκB kinasePOMCpro-opiomelanocortinTattransactivator proteinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayIL-1interleukin-1CMVcytomegalovirusAGRPAgouti-related proteinICVintracerebroventricularMAP2microtubule-associated protein 2α-MSHα-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. -induced anorexia (8.Wisse B.E.

On the other hand, a number of studies suggest an important role of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in infection-associated anorexia (9.DeBoer M.D. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors were originally identified as critical regulators of genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity (10.Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). In the quiescent state, NF-κB dimers exist in an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to the IκBα inhibitory protein. Inflammatory stimuli activate the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates IκB, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. IκB degradation facilitates translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, thereby regulating the transcription of genes involved in human disorders, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and obesity-related metabolic disease (11.Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar, 12.Yang L. Tao L.Y. Chen X.P. Neurosci.

Med. 2005; 11: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also involved in cancer-induced cachexia, because intratumoral injection of NF-κB inhibitory oligonucleotides prevents cachexia in a mouse tumor model (14.Kawamura I. Morishita R. Tomita N. Lacey E. Aketa M. Tsujimoto S. Manda T. Tomoi M. Kida I. Higaki J. Kaneda Y. Shimomura K. Ogihara T. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence that, during infection, NF-κB is activated in the hypothalamus, a center for appetite and body weight regulation, and stimulates the local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), thereby causing anorexia and weight loss. Male C57BL/6 mice 8–10 weeks of age were obtained from Orient Bio Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Mice were fed standard chow (Samyang Co, Seoul, Korea) ad libitum. Animals were housed under controlled temperature (22 °C) and a 12-h light-dark cycle, with light from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Asian Institute for Life Sciences. AtT-20 and SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Hypothalamic neurons were primarily cultured as previously described (15.Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S. Won J.C. Kim K.S. Kim S.W. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Kim Y.B. Lee K.U. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Tat1–72 cDNA was cloned and ligated into pGex4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting gene product was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Tat was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose 4B (Sigma). Cannulation and injection into the third ventricle (ICV: 0.8 mm caudal to the bregma and 5 mm ventral to the sagittal sinus) or the mediobasal hypothalamus (intra-mediobasal hypothalamic: 1.8 mm caudal to the bregma, and 5.5 mm ventral and 0.3 mm lateral to the sagittal sinus) were performed according to a previous report (16.Kim M.S. Park J.Y. Namkoong C. Jang P.G. Ryu J.W. Song H.S. Yun J.Y. Namgoong I.S. Ha J. Park I.S. Lee I.K. Viollet B. Youn J.H. Lee H.K. Lee K.U. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). LPS (Sigma), Tat1–72, and leptin (R&D Systems) were dissolved in 0.9% saline and administered via intra-mediobasal hypothalamic- or ICV-implanted cannulae in 0.5 and 2 μl of volume, respectively, at 8:00–10:00 a.m. in mice following an overnight fast, unless otherwise indicated. For the inhibition study, Agouti-related protein (AGRP, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), IKK inhibitory peptide (Calbiochem, #401477), and Bay 11-7085 (Sigma) were dissolved in either saline or 1% DMSO before use and injected 30 min before injection of LPS or Tat1–72. The doses of inhibitors used were determined from the preliminary studies with a wide range of doses and small sized groups, which alone did not significantly change food intake and body weight and blocked the effects of LPS or Tat. Medial hypothalami were harvested at indicated times following intraperitoneal injection of LPS (200 μg/kg) and leptin (3 mg/kg) as previously described (15.Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S. Won J.C. Kim K.S. Kim S.W. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Kim Y.B. Lee K.U. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These doses of LPS and leptin was determined from our preliminary feeding study and found to produce a significant decrease in food intake. Primary-cultured hypothalamic neurons were treated with LPS, Tat1–72, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Sigma) for 4 h before harvest. Nuclear protein extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled general κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), POMC-specific κB-1 probe (5′-GCCACAGGGAAAGCACTTCAGCTG-3′), or κB-2 probe (5′-GCTCTCTGGGGCTTTCCAGGAAG-3′), as previously described (15.Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S. Won J.C. Kim K.S. Kim S.W. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Kim Y.B. Lee K.U. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For inhibition electromobility shift assay (EMSA), 10-fold excess cold oligonucleotides or antibodies against p50 and p65 (10–20 μg each, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added prior to the 32P-labeled κB probe. The 1-kb promoter region (nucleotide positions −877 to +320) and the first intron (+1705 to +4134) of the human POMC gene or the promoter region (nucleotide positions −1000 to −1) of the human AGRP gene were cloned and ligated into a luciferase reporter (POMC-luc1, POMC-luc2, and AGRP-luc reporters). The κB2 mutant of POMC-luc2 was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: 5′-GCAGCTGAAATGCTTACACTGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCACAGTGTAAGCATTTCAGCTGC-3′. AtT-20 or SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with POMC or AGRP reporters (200 ng), p50 (10–100 ng), p65 (10–100 ng), and CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng) genes using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml), IL-1β (20 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (200 ng/ml), Tat1–72 (1 nm), and leptin (100–1000 nm) with or without NF-κB inhibitors Bay 11-7085 or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (100 μm) for 4 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data are shown as -fold increase compared with controls. Transfections were performed in duplicate, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 1 h, fixed with formaldehyde, lysed, and sonicated. Soluble chromatin was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-p50 rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an equivalent amount of rabbit immunoglobulin-γ (IgG). After de-cross-linking of DNA, samples were subjected to PCR to amplify the first intron region of the human POMC gene (nucleotide positions +2123 to +2430) using the primers (5′-TGAAGTTTTAGCAATAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-TGGTAGTTACGTATGTCACCAA-3′). Total RNA was extracted from the mediobasal hypothalamus and AtT-20 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neuropeptides, and NF-κB were determined by real-time PCR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using the primers specified in supplemental Fig. S1. Expression of each mRNA was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The murine sequences of p50 (positions +2624 to +2643) were targeted for RNA interference (supplemental Fig. S2). AtT-20 cells were transfected with control or p50-specific small interfering RNA (100 nm) using Lipofectamine 36 h before promoter assay. Mice were sacrificed 45 min after intraperitoneal injection of saline or LPS (200 μg/kg). Whole brains were immediately frozen in isopentene-prechilled liquid nitrogen and maintained at −70 °C. Coronal brain sections (15-μm thickness) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Brain sections were incubated with primary antibodies against p50 (1:500, rabbit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKKβ (1:200, rabbit, Abcam), MAP2 (1:500, mouse, Sigma), or αMSH (1:15000, sheep, Chemicon) at 4 °C for 48 h. After washing, slides were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody, Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-sheep antibodies (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h. For nuclear staining, slides were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:20,000, Invitrogen) for 10 min before mounting. Triple immunofluorescence was examined using confocal microscopy (Leica). The p50 and IKKβ immunoreactivities in the nuclei of MAP2- and α-MSH-labeled neurons were counted in three arcuate nucleus sections per mouse using the program ImageTool (The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, n = 3). To generate POMC neuron-specific IKKβ knock-out (IkkβΔPOMC) mice, IKKβ-flox/flox (IkkβF/F) mice were crossed with Pomc-Cre transgenic mice (17.Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 18.Balthasar N. Coppari R. McMinn J. Liu S.M. Lee C.E. Tang V. Kenny C.D. McGovern R.A. Chua Jr., S.C. Elmquist J.K. Lowell B.B. Neuron. 2004; 42: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Successful knockdown of IKKβ was confirmed by estimating IKKβ expression in hypothalamic POMC neurons via double immunohistochemistry with antibodies against IKKβ (Abcam) and αMSH (Chemicon). Rectal temperature was measured using a thermometer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Trunk blood was collected 45 min after intraperitoneal administration of LPS. Serum corticosterone levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (DPC, Deerfield, IL). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Groups were compared using Student's t test or analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc least significant difference test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Initially, we investigated whether NF-κB is activated in the hypothalamus during systemic infection. LPS (200 μg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in freely fed C57BL/6J mice in the early light phase and the mediobasal hypothalamus was collected to assess NF-κB activity at 1 and 6 h following LPS injection. NF-κB activity was determined with the EMSA using the NF-κB binding consensus sequence (19.Cummings R. Zhao Y. Jacoby D. Spannhake E.W. Ohba M. Garcia J.G.N. Watkins T. He D. Saatian B. Natarajan V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41085-41094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A single intraperitoneal administration of LPS led to NF-κB activation in the hypothalamus at 1 h post injection (Fig. 1A). However, this effect was not sustained at 6 h (data not shown). Binding of NF-κB to the corresponding DNA sequences was inhibited and supershifted in the presence of antibodies specific for the NF-κB subunits, p50 and p65 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the canonical NF-κB pathway was activated (20.Meffert M.K. Baltimore D. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). NF-κB is expressed in neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system. Neuronal NF-κB plays an important role in both normal and pathologic conditions (20.Meffert M.K. Baltimore D. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPS activates NF-κB in hypothalamic neurons, we performed double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies specific to p50 and the neuron marker, MAP2. We used anti-p50-antibody, because commercially available anti-p65 antibodies were all nonspecific, as previously mentioned (21.Meffert M.K. Chang J.M. Wiltgen B.J. Fanselow M.S. Baltimore D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal administration of LPS (200 μg/kg) significantly increased the nuclear translocation of p50 in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus at 45 min after injection (Fig. 1C). Treatment with LPS (10–1000 nm) in primary cultured hypothalamic neurons activated neuronal NF-κB (supplemental Fig. S3A), suggesting that LPS can directly activate NF-κB in hypothalamic neurons. Tat, a viral protein produced by the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, has originally been implicated in the transcription initiation and elongation of human immunodeficiency virus-encoding genes (22.Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a transcriptional regulator, Tat is released from infected cells and acts like an extracellular cytokine (23.Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Extracellular Tat causes neuron toxicity through N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (22.Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Tat protein for establishment of viral infection model. Similar to LPS, biologically active Tat1–72 increased IκB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in primary-cultured hypothalamic neurons (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). These findings clearly demonstrate that the Tat1–72 protein also causes NF-κB activation in hypothalamic neurons. During systemic infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced in the meninges, choroid plexus, and brain, which may provoke inflammatory responses within the central nervous system in a paracrine and autocrine manner (7.Plata-Salaman, C.

Consistent with this notion, intraperitoneal administration of LPS (200 μg/kg) and Tat1–72 (4 mg/kg) enhanced the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the mediobasal hypothalamus at 3 h post-injection (Fig. 1, D and E). To explore a role for NF-κB in LPS- and Tat-induced hypothalamic cytokine production, we administered the NF-κB inhibitor (24.Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), Bay 11-7085 (500 nmol), into the third ventricle, 30 min prior to intraperitoneal administration of LPS and Tat1–72. ICV administration of Bay 11-7085 significantly inhibited the increase in hypothalamic cytokine expression following LPS and Tat treatment (Fig. 1, D and E). These data suggest that hypothalamic NF-κB mediates LPS- and Tat-induced increase in hypothalamic cytokine expression. On the other hand, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production may further amplify NF-κB activation in the hypothalamus, as evidenced by the finding that treatment of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α caused NF-κB activation in primary cultured hypothalamic neurons (supplemental Fig. S4). The melanocortins, α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (MSH), are produced from the precursor protein, POMC (25.Ellacott K.L. Cone R.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Central melanocortin and its receptors (melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors, MC3R and MC4R) play an important role in the maintenance of normal food intake and body weight in rodents and humans (25.Ellacott K.L. Cone R.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the hypothalamic melanocortin system is a potential mediator in illness-associated anorexia (26.Catania A. Airaghi L. Colombo G. Lipton J.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27.Huang Q.H. Hruby V.J. Tatro J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R864-R871PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Marks D.L. Butler A.A. Turner R. Brookhart G. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hypothalamic αMSH levels are increased in pathologic conditions, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection (26.Catania A. Airaghi L. Colombo G. Lipton J.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that intraperitoneal administration of LPS (200 μg/kg) and Tat1–72 (4 mg/kg) increased hypothalamic POMC mRNA expression at 3 h after intraperitoneal administration (Fig. 2A). Moreover, ICV administration of αMSH augments LPS-induced anorexia and cachexia, whereas the melanocortin antagonist, SHU9119, attenuates it (27.Huang Q.H. Hruby V.J. Tatro J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R864-R871PubMed Google Scholar). LPS- and cancer-induced anorexia and weight loss are also diminished in MC4R-null mice (28.Marks D.L. Butler A.A. Turner R. Brookhart G. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These findings collectively suggest that hypothalamic melanocortins cause anorexia and weight loss through the MC4R during the illness. However, the mechanisms via which infectious products or pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the hypothalamic melanocortin system remain to be established. We hypothesized that POMC is a downstream target of NF-κB. Putative NF-κB binding motifs were identified within the 1-kb nucleotide sequence upstream of the coding sequence (κB-1) and the first intron (κB-2) of the human, mouse, and rat POMC genes (Fig. 2B). To investigate the effects of NF-κB on POMC transcriptional activity, we generated two luciferase reporter constructs containing κB-1 (nucleotides −877 to +320, POMC-luc1) and κB-2 (nucleotides +1705 to +4134, POMC-luc2) of the human POMC gene. Human p50 and/or p65 were coexpressed with POMC-luc1 or POMC-luc2 in POMC-producing murine AtT-20 cells. Expression of p50 increased POMC-luc2 activity up to ∼8-fold (Fig. 2C), and POMC-luc1 activity only by 2-fold (supplemental Fig. S5). Interestingly, expression of p65 alone did not affect POMC-luc2 activity, whereas coexpression with p50 further enhanced POMC-luc2 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). These findings, taken together with EMSA data (Fig. 1B), indicate that p50:p50 and p50:p65 dimers, but not p65:p65 dimers, may be involved in transcriptional regulation of POMC. EMSA using oligonucleotides compatible with the potential κB binding sites 1 and 2 (κB-1 and κB-2 probes) demonstrated that the κB-2 probe was better than κB-1 probe for the detection of LPS-induced hypothalamic NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D). Consistently, mutation of κB-2 site completely abolished p50-induced stimulation of POMC transcriptional activity, suggesting that κB-2 site is critical for NF-κB-mediated stimulation of POMC transcription (Fig. 2E). Finally, we confirmed that endogenous p50 binds to κB-2 of the human POMC gene, using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data revealed that binding of endogenous p50 to this region was low in the basal state, but significantly increased by LPS treatment (10 ng/ml) in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2F). Collectively, NF-κB p50 stimulates POMC transcriptional activity through direct interactions at κB-2 site. Because Tat functions as a transcriptional coactivator (22.Rice A.P. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we also examined the effects of Tat gene expression on POMC promoter activity. Expression of the Tat gene modestly increased POMC-luc2 activity in AtT-20 cells (supplemental Fig. S6A). Moreover, coexpression of Tat and p50 led to a synergistic increase in POMC transcriptional activity (supplemental Fig. S6B), suggesting that NF-κB-induced POMC transcription is enhanced by endogenous Tat expression. We additionally determined the direct effects of LPS, Tat1–72, and pro-inflammatory cytokines on POMC transcriptional activity. Treatment with these agents significantly stimulated POMC-luc2 transcriptional activity in both AtT-20 and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2G and supplemental Fig. S6C), which was inhibited by pretreatment with a NF-κB inhibitor, Bay 11-7085 (Fig. 2G). Moreover, depletion of p50 expression using a small inhibitory RNA-mediated gene-silencing system completely abolished the effects of LPS and Tat on POMC-luc2 activity (Fig. 2H). Our results strongly suggest that NF-κB is an important downstream mediator in the regulation of POMC transcription by LPS, Tat, or pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with a previous report (29.Langhans W. Harlacher R. Balkowski G. Scharrer E. Physiol. Behav. 1990; 47: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), central administration of LPS and Tat caused a reduction in food intake and body weight (supplemental Fig. S7). Next, we investigated a role for hypothalamic NF-κB in LPS- and Tat-induced anorexia and weight loss. For this, we injected an NF-κB inhibitor, Bay 11-7085 (500 nmol) or IKK inhibitory peptide (30.Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) (1 and 3 μg), into the mediobasal hypothalamus 30 min prior to administration of LPS (3 ng) or Tat1–72 (0.1 nmol). Injection of NF-κB inhibitor or IKK inhibitor alone did not significantly alter food intake and body weight but blocked the effects of LPS and Tat1–72 (Fig. 3, A–D). These findings indicate that hypothalamic NF-κB activation is an important signaling event for anorexia and weight loss induced by LPS and Tat. We further investigated the relationship of NF-κB and the hypothalamic melanocortin system in feeding regulation. In line with a previous report (27.Huang Q.H. Hruby V.J. Tatro J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R864-R871PubMed Google Scholar), prior ICV administration of an endogenous melanocortin antagonist, AGRP (4 μg), blocked the effects of LPS (10 ng) and Tat1–72 (1 nmol) on food intake and body weight (Fig. 3, E and F). Although treatment with AGRP alone increased food intake and body weight, the blocking effect of AGRP on LPS- and Tat-induced anorexia and weight loss was much greater than that seen in AGRP-alone treatment, supporting an involvement of the central melanocortin system in illness-associated anorexia. Given that POMC is a target gene of NF-κB, we hypothesized that the central melanocortin system acts as a downstream of NF-κB in infection-associated anorexia and weight loss. To define the specific role of NF-κB in hypothalamic POMC neurons in illness-associate anorexia, we selectively disrupted the IKKβ gene, a key upstream signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation (31.Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), in POMC-producing neurons using the Cre-lox system. The IkkβF/F mice (17.Park J.M. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Karin M. Science. 2002; 297: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) were crossed with Pomc-Cre transgenic mice (18.Balthasar N. Coppari R. McMinn J. Liu S.M. Lee C.E. Tang V. Kenny C.D. McGovern R.A. Chua Jr., S.C. Elmquist J.K. Lowell B.B. Neuron. 2004; 42: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) to generate POMC-specific IKKβ-depleted mice (IkkβΔPomc). In IkkβΔPOMC mice, IKKβ expression in αMSH-expressing neurons was significantly less than the level of IkkβF/F mice (Fig. 4A). The IkkβΔPomc mice showed normal food intake and body weight under a standard chow diet at young adult ages compared with Pomc-Cre mice and IkkβF/F mice (supplemental Fig. S8, A and B). There were no differences in plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin concentrations between IkkβF/F and IkkβΔPomc mice (supplemental Fig. S8, C–E). Basal hypothalamic NF-κB activity and POMC mRNA expression tended to be lower in IkkβΔPomc mice than in IkkβF/F (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p50 was significantly decreased in the hypothalamic POMC neurons (Fig. 4D). In IkkβΔPomc mice, LPS (3 ng)- and Tat (0.1 nmol)-induced reduction in food intake and weight loss was significantly attenuated, which was reversed by intrahypothalamic coadministration of α-MSH (Fig. 4, E–H). These findings further support the hypothesis that NF-κB activation in POMC neurons plays a critical role in infection-associated anorexia and weight loss. Because melanocortins have antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects in the central and peripheral nervous systems (26.Catania A. Airaghi L. Colombo G. Lipton J.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of LPS on body temperature and circulating levels of anti-inflammatory hormone corticosteroid. IkkβΔPOMC mice displayed lower corticosterone levels and higher body temperatures in response to intraperitoneal LPS (200 μg/kg), compared with IkkβF/F mice (Fig. 4, I and J). Previous studies have shown that leptin, an important anorexigenic hormone, activates NF-κB in cortical neurons, microglia, and astrocytes from the brain (32.Valerio A. Dossena M. Bertolotti P. Boroni F. Sarnico I. Faraco G. Chiarugi A. Frontini A. Giordano A. Liou H.C. De Simoni M.G. Spano P. Carruba M.O. Pizzi M. Nisoli E. Stroke. 2009; 40: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33.Tang C.H. Lu D.Y. Yang R.S. Tsai H.Y. Kao M.C. Fu W.M. Chen Y.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34.Mattace Raso G. Esposito E. Iacono A. Pacilio M. Coppola A. Bianco G. Diano S. Di Carlo R. Meli R. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 396: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether leptin also causes hypothalamic NF-κB activation. Similarly to LPS, intraperitoneal administration of leptin (3 mg/kg) significantly increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB in the mediobasal hypothalamus at 1 h post-injection (Fig. 5A). To examine if hypothalamic NF-κB may serve as a downstream signaling of leptin, we administered leptin (3 μg) with or without IKK inhibitor (3 μg) in overnight-fasted mice via ICV-implanted cannulae. ICV administration of IKK inhibitor significantly inhibited the effects of leptin on food intake and body weight (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that hypothalamic NF-κB activation is essential for leptin-induced anorexia and weight loss. Hypothalamic melanocortins are considered as an important downstream mediator of the anorexigenic actions of leptin (35.Seeley R.J. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Burn P. Thiele T.E. van Dijk G. Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Nature. 1997; 390: 349Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 36.Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Woods S.C. Weigle D.S. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Baskin D.G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we investigated an involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of POMC transcription by leptin. Leptin treatment in AtT-20 cells significantly increased the promoter activity and mRNA levels of POMC, but cotreatment of NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, blocked these effects, suggesting that NF-κB mediates the effects of leptin on POMC transcription (Fig. 5, D and E). To further confirm a role for NF-κB activation of POMC neuron in leptin-induced anorexia, leptin (0.1 μg) was administered into the mediobasal hypothalamus of IkkβF/F and IkkβΔPOMC mice following an overnight fast. Intrahypothalamic administration of leptin induced a marked decrease in food intake and body weight in IkkβF/F mice (Fig. 5, F and G). However, these effects were significantly attenuated in IkkβΔPOMC mice, suggesting that leptin-induced anorexia and weight loss depends on NF-κB activation in POMC neurons. Our findings are summarized in Fig. 5H. Hypothalamic NF-κB is activated by infectious agents, LPS and Tat, or by leptin. Hypothalamic NF-κB activation leads to increased production of anorexigenic cytokines and POMC in the hypothalamus. In particular, NF-κB activation in hypothalamic POMC neurons is an important molecular mechanism for anorexia and weight loss as evidenced by the findings that POMC neuron-specific NF-κB inhibition significantly reduced LPS, Tat, or leptin-induced anorexia and weight loss. Although a critical role for the hypothalamic melanocortin system in illness-associated anorexia has been suggested (26.Catania A. Airaghi L. Colombo G. Lipton J.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27.Huang Q.H. Hruby V.J. Tatro J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R864-R871PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Marks D.L. Butler A.A. Turner R. Brookhart G. Cone R.D. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it was unclear how central melanocortin system was regulated in the state of illness. In this study, we demonstrated that NF-κB directly bound the human POMC gene to stimulate POMC transcription. Therefore, hypothalamic NF-κB may be a missing link between illness and central melanocortin system. On the other hand, we have found that hypothalamic NF-κB is activated by leptin, a critical anorexigenic hormone. Inhibition of hypothalamic NF-κB blocks the anorexigenic and weight-reducing effects of leptin, suggesting an important role for hypothalamic NF-κB in normal feeding regulation. Consistently, Zhang et al. demonstrated that IKKβ and NF-κB are abundantly expressed in hypothalamic neurons (37.Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our data, they showed that overnutrition induced activation of hypothalamic NF-κB through elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress (37.Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypothalamic NF-κB activation interrupted leptin and insulin signaling by increasing the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3. Finally, depletion of IKKβ in mediobasal hypothalamus and AGRP neurons had a protective effect against diet-induced obesity. From these data, they concluded that hypothalamic NF-κB activation in obese state causes hypothalamic resistance to leptin and insulin. Taking these data and our data together, hypothalamic NF-κB plays a pivotal role in controlling feeding behaviors under the two opposite metabolic situations, undernutrition and overnutrition. Leptin-induced activation of NF-κB acts as a downstream mediator of leptin in feeding regulation. On the other hand, NF-κB activation may induce suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression, which would constitute a negative feedback pathway of leptin signaling, as is the case for the signal transduction-activated transcript-3 signaling pathway (38.Bj⊘rbaek C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). It is also possible that NF-κB activation in POMC neurons may have a differential role from that in AGRP neurons. Indeed, NF-κB inhibition in POMC neurons did not show a protective effect against diet-induced obesity (supplemental Fig. S9). The central melanocortin receptor activities are determined by the relative amounts of melanocortins and endogenous antagonist, AGRP at the receptors (25.Ellacott K.L. Cone R.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2006; 361: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus activation of melanocortin receptors also results from the decrease levels of AGRP. Indeed, hypothalamic AGRP mRNA expression showed a tendency of decrease following LPS and Tat administration (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, treatment of LPS, Tat, and pro-inflammatory cytokines suppressed AGRP promoter activity in SH-SY5Y cells (supplemental Fig. S10). Thus NF-κB-mediated suppression of AGRP may also contribute to infection-associated anorexia and weight loss, as suggested previously (39.Wisse B.E. Schwartz M.W. Cummings D.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 994: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chronic activation of hypothalamic NF-κB and the melanocortin system during illness may have a detrimental effect on the host by causing a negative energy balance. However, cumulating evidence indicates that melanocortins have antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems (26.Catania A. Airaghi L. Colombo G. Lipton J.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In line with these notions, POMC-specific IKKβ knock-out mice showed decreased activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and enhanced febrile reaction in response to LPS. Therefore, NF-κB-mediated POMC activation may have both positive and negative effects on the hosts during infection. Although we focused on hypothalamic events during infection, illness-associated anorexia and cachexia may be also mediated by peripheral or non-hypothalamic mechanisms. Indeed, LPS- and Tat-induced reduction in food intake and body weight was partially blocked by hypothalamic administration of NF-κB and IKK inhibitors or in POMC-specific NF-κB knock-out mice, when LPS and Tat were injected peripherally (data not shown). On the other hand, we did not expand our study to include the cancer-anorexia model. However, cancer-associated anorexia may be through a similar molecular mechanism, because hypothalamic IL-1β expression was increased in the hypothalamus from tumor-bearing rats (40.Plata-Salamán C.R. Ilyin S.E. Gayle D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R566-R573PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, blockade of hypothalamic melanocortins prevented IL-1β- or cancer-induced anorexia (41.Lawrence C.B. Rothwell N.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 13: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42.Joppa M.A. Ling N. Chen C. Gogas K.R. Foster A.C. Markison S.

Peptides. 2007; 28: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that hypothalamic NF-κB and melanocortin may be a general molecular mediator causing anorexia and weight loss during chronic illness state. In conclusion, we show that NF-κB activation in the hypothalamic melanocortin system is essential for anorexia and weight loss induced by infectious agents and leptin. Therefore, chemicals having NF-κB inhibitory activity or MC4R antagonistic activity may have a therapeutic potential on anorexia and cachexia. We are grateful to J. K. Elmquist and B. B.

To investigate the regulatory genes responsible for the neuropathology in AD, we performed microarray analysis with APPV717I-CT100 transgenic mice, an animal model of AD, and isolated the S100a9 gene, which encodes an inflammation-associated calcium binding protein. In another AD animal model, Tg2576 mouse brain, and in human AD brain, induction of S100a9 was confirmed. The endogenous expression of S100a9 was induced by treatment with Aβ or CT peptides in a microglia cell line, BV2 cells. In these cells, silencing study of S100a9 showed that the induction of S100a9 increased the intracellular calcium level and up-regulated the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) and iNOS. S100a9 lentiviral short hairpin RNA (sh-S100a9) was injected into the hippocampus region of the brains of 13-month-old Tg2576 mice. At two months after injection, we found that knockdown of S100a9 expression had improved the cognition decline of Tg2576 mice in the water maze task, and had reduced amyloid plaque burden. These results suggest that S100a9 induced by Aβ or CT contributes to cause inflammation, which then affects the neuropathology including amyloid plaques burden and impairs cognitive function. Thus, the inhibition of S100a9 is a possible target for AD therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2124062217,"The phytochemical resveratrol has recently gained attention for its protection against metabolic disease and for extension of life span, which have been linked to its metabolic effects and SIRT1 activation in fat cells. However, little is known about the effect of resveratrol on fat cell apoptosis. Here, we identify a novel, SIRT1-independent mechanism by which resveratrol regulates fat cell numbers. We demonstrate for the first time that resveratrol enhances TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)- or CD95-induced apoptosis of human preadipocytes in a highly synergistic manner (EC(50) at 72 h: resveratrol, >300 microM; TRAIL, >100 ng/ml; combination: 30 microM resveratrol and 10 ng/ml TRAIL, combination index 0.4). Similar results in primary human preadipocytes prepared from subcutaneous white adipose tissue and mature human adipocytes underline the relevance to human physiology. Mechanistic studies reveal that resveratrol inhibits PI3K-driven phosphorylation of Akt, leading to increased Bax activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-dependent apoptosis. The synergistic interaction of resveratrol and TRAIL depends on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and caspases, since Bcl-2 overexpression and the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk inhibit apoptosis, whereas knockdown of SIRT1 by RNA interference has no effect. The discovery of this novel activity of resveratrol significantly advances the knowledge of fat tissue regulation by resveratrol and has important implications for its use in metabolic and age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2138027687,"Liposomes are vesicular structures consisting of an aqueous core surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Apart from the cytosol and lysosomes, no other intracellular compartment has been successfully targeted using liposomal delivery. Here, we report the development of liposomes capable of specific targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and associated membranes. Using competition and inhibitor assays along with confocal microscopy, we have determined that ER liposomes utilize scavenger and low-density lipoprotein receptors for endocytosis and enter cells through a caveolin- and microtubule-dependent mechanism. They traffic intact to the ER, where fusion with the ER membrane occurs after 22–25 min, which was confirmed by fluorescence-dequenching assays. Once inside the ER, tagged lipids intercalate with the ER membrane and are subsequently incorporated into ER-assembling entities, such as the ER-budding viruses hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), lipid droplets, and secreted lipoproteins. ER liposomes are superior to cytosolic liposome formulations for the intracellular delivery of aqueous cargo, such as HIV-1 antivirals, and are especially suited for the prolonged delivery of lipids and lipophilic drugs into human cells.—Pollock, S., Antrobus, R, Newton, L., Kampa, B., Rossa, J., Latham, S., Branza Nichita, N., Dwek, R A., Zitzmann, N.

https://openalex.org/W2125760235,"The physiological contribution of glucose in thermoregulation is not completely established nor whether this control may involve a regulation of the melanocortin pathway. Here, we assessed thermoregulation and leptin sensitivity of hypothalamic arcuate neurons in mice with inactivation of glucose transporter type 2 (Glut2)-dependent glucose sensing. Mice with inactivation of Glut2-dependent glucose sensors are cold intolerant and show increased susceptibility to food deprivation-induced torpor and abnormal hypothermic response to intracerebroventricular administration of 2-deoxy-d-glucose compared to control mice. This is associated with a defect in regulated expression of brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein I and iodothyronine deiodinase II and with a decreased leptin sensitivity of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, as observed during the unfed-to-refed transition or following i.p. leptin injection. Sites of central Glut-2 expression were identified by a genetic tagging approach and revealed that glucose-sensitive neurons were present in the lateral hypothalamus, the dorsal vagal complex, and the basal medulla but not in the arcuate nucleus. NPY and POMC neurons were, however, connected to nerve terminals from Glut2-expressing neurons. Thus, our data suggest that glucose controls thermoregulation and the leptin sensitivity of NPY and POMC neurons through activation of Glut2-dependent glucose-sensing neurons located outside of the arcuate nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2111024091,"During tumorigenesis, cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability. However, it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis. Here, we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration, which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development, trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration. Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase, these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability. Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks, DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors. Furthermore, since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps, these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation, cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation. Thus, our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress."

We examined pre-RC formation in vitro and found that it proceeds through separable binding events. Origin-bound ORC recruits Cdc6, and this ternary complex then promotes helicase loading in the presence of a pre-formed Mcm2-7-Cdt1 complex. Using a stepwise pre-RC assembly assay, we investigated the fate of pre-RC components during later stages of the reaction. We determined that helicase loading is accompanied by dissociation of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 from origin DNA. This dissociation requires ATP hydrolysis at a late stage of pre-RC assembly. Our results indicate that pre-RC formation is a dynamic process."
https://openalex.org/W2038756175,"Brucellosis, leptospirosis and Q fever are important infections of livestock causing a range of clinical conditions including abortions and reduced fertility. In addition, they are all important zoonotic infections infecting those who work with livestock and those who consume livestock related products such as milk, producing non-specific symptoms including fever, that are often misdiagnosed and that can lead to severe chronic disease. This study used banked sera from the Adamawa Region of Cameroon to investigate the seroprevalences and distributions of seropositive animals and herds. A classical statistical and a multi-level prevalence modelling approach were compared. The unbiased estimates were 20% of herds were seropositive for Brucella spp. compared to 95% for Leptospira spp. and 68% for Q fever. The within-herd seroprevalences were 16%, 35% and 39% respectively. There was statistical evidence of clustering of seropositive brucellosis and Q fever herds. The modelling approach has the major advantage that estimates of seroprevalence can be adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test used and the multi-level structure of the sampling. The study found a low seroprevalence of brucellosis in the Adamawa Region compared to a high proportion of leptospirosis and Q fever seropositive herds. This represents a high risk to the human population as well as potentially having a major impact on animal health and productivity in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2075259007,"Background There are currently 7 known serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) classified upon non-cross reactivity of neutralizing immunoglobulins. Non-neutralizing immunoglobulins, however, can exhibit cross-reactivities between 2 or more serotypes, particularly mosaic forms, which can hamper the development of highly specific immunoassays, especially if based on polyclonal antisera. Here we employ facile recombinant antibody technology to subtractively select ligands to each of the 7 BoNT serotypes, resulting in populations with very high specificity for their intended serotype. Methods and Findings A single llama was immunized with a cocktail of 7 BoNT toxoids to generate a phage display library of single domain antibodies (sdAb, VHH or nanobodies) which were selected on live toxins. Resulting sdAb were capable of detecting both toxin and toxin complex with the best combinations able to detect 100s-10s of pg per 50 µL sample in a liquid bead array. The most sensitive sdAb were combined in a heptaplex assay to identify each of the BoNT serotypes in buffer and milk and to a lesser extent in carrot juice, orange juice and cola. Several anti-A(1) sdAb recognized A2 complex, showing that subtype cross-reactivity within a serotype was evident. Many of our sdAb could act as both captor and tracer for several toxin and toxin complexes suggesting sdAb can be used as architectural probes to indicate BoNT oligomerisation. Six of 14 anti-A clones exhibited inhibition of SNAP-25 cleavage in the neuro-2A assay indicating some sdAb had toxin neutralizing capabilities. Many sdAb were also shown to be refoldable after exposure to high temperatures in contrast to polyclonal antisera, as monitored by circular dichroism. Conclusions Our panel of molecularly flexible antibodies should not only serve as a good starting point for ruggedizing assays and inhibitors, but enable the intricate architectures of BoNT toxins and complexes to be probed more extensively."
https://openalex.org/W2043245274,"Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and that is used clinically on drug-eluting stents to inhibit in-stent restenosis. Although inhibition of cell migration is an asset in preventing restenosis, it also leads to impaired stent endothelialization, a significant limitation of current drug-eluting stent technology that necessitates prolonged antiplatelet therapy. We measured the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) toward the chemoattractant vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Although acute administration of rapamycin had no effect, exposure for 24 h inhibited HUVEC and HCAEC migration. Disruption of the mTORC2 via small interfering RNA was also effective in inhibiting HCAEC migration. Treatment of HCAECs for this period with rapamycin produced an increase in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip), through a decrease in the targeting of the protein for degradation by phosphorylation at Thr(187). ECs isolated from a knock-in mouse expressing p27(Kip1) with a mutation of this residue to an alanine, blocking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced migration compared with wild-type controls. Silencing of p27(Kip1) with small interfering RNA blocked the effects of rapamycin on migration and tube formation as well as RhoA activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. We conclude that prolonged exposure of ECs to rapamycin increases p27(Kip1) and in turn inhibits RhoA activation, blocking cell migration and differentiation. These data elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of p27(Kip1) protein and cell migration by rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W1693424538,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with complex and strong genetic inheritance. Four genes have been established to either cause familial early onset AD (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) or to increase susceptibility for late onset AD (APOE). To date approximately 80% of the late onset AD genetic variance remains elusive. Recently our genome-wide association screen identified four novel late onset AD candidate genes. Ataxin 1 (ATXN1) is one of these four AD candidate genes and has been indicated to be the disease gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, which is also a neurodegenerative disease. Mounting evidence suggests that the excessive accumulation of Abeta, the proteolytic product of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the primary AD pathological event. In this study, we ask whether ATXN1 may lead to AD pathogenesis by affecting Abeta and APP processing utilizing RNA interference in a human neuronal cell model and mouse primary cortical neurons. We show that knock-down of ATXN1 significantly increases the levels of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. This effect could be rescued with concurrent overexpression of ATXN1. Moreover, overexpression of ATXN1 decreased Abeta levels. Regarding the underlying molecular mechanism, we show that the effect of ATXN1 expression on Abeta levels is modulated via beta-secretase cleavage of APP. Taken together, ATXN1 functions as a genetic risk modifier that contributes to AD pathogenesis through a loss-of-function mechanism by regulating beta-secretase cleavage of APP and Abeta levels."
https://openalex.org/W1988276885,"Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) is a highly heritable congenital heart defect. The low frequency of BAV (1% of general population) limits our ability to perform genome-wide association studies. We present the application of four a priori SNP selection techniques, reducing the multiple-testing penalty by restricting analysis to SNPs relevant to BAV in a genome-wide SNP dataset from a cohort of 68 BAV probands and 830 control subjects. Two knowledge-based approaches, CANDID and STRING, were used to systematically identify BAV genes, and their SNPs, from the published literature, microarray expression studies and a genome scan. We additionally tested Functionally Interpolating SNPs (fitSNPs) present on the array; the fourth consisted of SNPs selected by Random Forests, a machine learning approach. These approaches reduced the multiple testing penalty by lowering the fraction of the genome probed to 0.19% of the total, while increasing the likelihood of studying SNPs within relevant BAV genes and pathways. Three loci were identified by CANDID, STRING, and fitSNPS. A haplotype within the AXIN1-PDIA2 locus (p-value of 2.926×10−06) and a haplotype within the Endoglin gene (p-value of 5.881×10−04) were found to be strongly associated with BAV. The Random Forests approach identified a SNP on chromosome 3 in association with BAV (p-value 5.061×10−06). The results presented here support an important role for genetic variants in BAV and provide support for additional studies in well-powered cohorts. Further, these studies demonstrate that leveraging existing expression and genomic data in the context of GWAS studies can identify biologically relevant genes and pathways associated with a congenital heart defect."
https://openalex.org/W1994819746,"Background Surveillance data on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and behavioral characteristics identified in studies of the risk of seroconversion are often used as to track sexual behaviors that spread HIV. However, such analyses can be confounded by “seroadaptation”—the restriction of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), especially unprotected insertive UAI, to seroconcordant partnerships. Methods We utilized sexual network methodology and repeated-measures statistics to test the hypothesis that seroadaptive strategies reduce the risk of HIV transmission despite numerous partnerships and frequent UAI. Principal Findings In a prospective cohort study of HIV superinfection including 168 HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM), we found extensive seroadaptation. UAI was 15.5 times more likely to occur with a positive partner than a negative one (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1–26.4). Receptive UAI was 4.3 times more likely in seroconcordant partnerships than with negative partners (95% CI, 2.8–6.6), but insertive UAI was 13.6 times more likely with positives (95% CI, 7.2–25.6). Our estimates suggest that seroadaptation reduced HIV transmissions by 98%. Conclusion Potentially effective HIV prevention strategies, such as seroadaptation, have evolved in communities of MSM before they have been recognized in research or discussed in the public health forum. Thus, to be informative, studies of HIV risk must be designed to assess seroadaptive behaviors rather than be limited to individual characteristics, unprotected intercourse, and numbers of partners. STI surveillance is not an effective indicator of trends in HIV incidence where there are strong patterns of seroadaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2020166585,"Cytochrome P450 enzymes are versatile catalysts involved in a wide variety of biological processes from hormonal regulation and antibiotic synthesis to drug metabolism. A hallmark of their versatility is their promiscuous nature, allowing them to recognize a wide variety of chemically diverse substrates. However, the molecular details of this promiscuity have remained elusive. Here, we have utilized two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy to examine a series of mutants site-specific labeled with the unnatural amino acid, [13C]p-methoxyphenylalanine, in conjunction with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine substrate and inhibitor binding to CYP119, a P450 from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The results suggest that tight binding hydrophobic ligands tend to lock the enzyme into a single conformational substate, whereas weak binding low affinity ligands bind loosely in the active site, resulting in a distribution of localized conformers. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the ligand-free enzyme samples ligand-bound conformations of the enzyme and, therefore, that ligand binding may proceed largely through a process of conformational selection rather than induced fit.

https://openalex.org/W2092058086,"Reversible cobalt complexation of alkynes is a critical step in some chemical transformations. New research shows this reaction can be used to specifically retrieve modified lipids from complex cellular mixtures, simplifying tracking and providing insights into lipid metabolism. Alkyne-modified phospholipids can be unambiguously identified and differentiated from native species in complex mixtures by formation of dicobalthexacarbonyl complexes. This reaction is specific for alkynes and is unaffected by other glycerophospholipid-related moieties. Enrichment of cells with alkyne-derivatized fatty acids or glycerophospholipids followed by solid-phase sequestration and release is a promising new method for unequivocally monitoring individual glycerophospholipids following incorporation into cells. This technique also facilitates lipidomic analysis of substrates and products."
https://openalex.org/W2000128643,"Background Meprin metalloproteases are thought to be involved in basic physiological functions such as cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. However, the specific functions of these enzymes are still ambiguous, although a variety of growth factors and structural proteins have been identified as meprin substrates. The discovery of meprins α1, α2 and β in teleost fish provided the basis for uncovering their physiological functions by gene silencing in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings A Morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos targeting meprin α1 and β mRNA caused defects in general tissue differentiation. But meprin α2 morphants were affected more specifically and showed severe failures in the formation of the vascular system provoking the hypothesis of a pro-angiogenic effect. The blood circulation was largely diminished resulting in erythrocyte accumulation. These phenotypes mimic a previously described VEGF-A morphant, revealing a possible role of meprin α in VEGF-A activation. Indeed, human recombinant meprin α processed the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) specifically, revealing the same cleavage products detectable for VEGF from zebrafish whole lysate. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that meprin metalloproteases are important for cell differentiation and proliferation already during embryogenesis, predominantly by the activation of growth factors. Thus, we conclude that meprins play a significant role in VEGF-A processing, subsequently regulating angiogenesis. Therefore, meprin α might be a new therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases or in tumor growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2081211216,"Phogrin is a transmembrane protein expressed in cells with stimulus-coupled peptide hormone secretion, including pancreatic beta cells, in which it is localized to the membrane of insulin-containing dense-core vesicles. By sequence, phogrin is a member of the family of receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but it contains substitutions in conserved catalytic sequences, and no significant enzymatic activity for phogrin has ever been reported. We report here that phogrin is able to dephosphorylate specific inositol phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate and PI 4,5-diphosphate but not PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The phosphatidylinositol phosphatase (PIPase) activity of phogrin was measurable but low when evaluated by the ability of a catalytic domain fusion protein to hydrolyze soluble short-chain phosphatidylinositol phospholipids. Unlike most PIPases, which are cytoplasmic proteins that associate with membranes, mature phogrin is a transmembrane protein. When the transmembrane form of phogrin was overexpressed in mammalian cells, it reduced plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-disphosphate levels in a dose-dependent manner. When purified and assayed in vitro, the transmembrane form had a specific activity of 142 mol/min/mol, 75-fold more active than the catalytic domain fusion protein and comparable with the specific activities of the other PIPases. The PIPase activity of phogrin depended on the catalytic site cysteine and correlated with effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We propose that phogrin functions as a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that contributes to maintaining subcellular differences in levels of PIP that are important for regulating stimulus-coupled exocytosis of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2059403925,"Rhodopsin, encoded by the gene Rhodopsin (RH1), is extremely sensitive to light, and is responsible for dim-light vision. Bats are nocturnal mammals that inhabit poor light environments. Megabats (Old-World fruit bats) generally have well-developed eyes, while microbats (insectivorous bats) have developed echolocation and in general their eyes were degraded, however, dramatic differences in the eyes, and their reliance on vision, exist in this group. In this study, we examined the rod opsin gene (RH1), and compared its evolution to that of two cone opsin genes (SWS1 and M/LWS). While phylogenetic reconstruction with the cone opsin genes SWS1 and M/LWS generated a species tree in accord with expectations, the RH1 gene tree united Pteropodidae (Old-World fruit bats) and Yangochiroptera, with very high bootstrap values, suggesting the possibility of convergent evolution. The hypothesis of convergent evolution was further supported when nonsynonymous sites or amino acid sequences were used to construct phylogenies. Reconstructed RH1 sequences at internal nodes of the bat species phylogeny showed that: (1) Old-World fruit bats share an amino acid change (S270G) with the tomb bat; (2) Miniopterus share two amino acid changes (V104I, M183L) with Rhinolophoidea; (3) the amino acid replacement I123V occurred independently on four branches, and the replacements L99M, L266V and I286V occurred each on two branches. The multiple parallel amino acid replacements that occurred in the evolution of bat RH1 suggest the possibility of multiple convergences of their ecological specialization (i.e., various photic environments) during adaptation for the nocturnal lifestyle, and suggest that further attention is needed on the study of the ecology and behavior of bats."
https://openalex.org/W2034130859,"European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) foragers have a highly developed visual system that is used for navigation. To clarify the neural basis underlying the highly sophisticated visual ability of foragers, we investigated the neural activity pattern of the optic lobes (OLs) in pollen-foragers and re-orienting bees, using the immediate early gene kakusei as a neural activity marker.We performed double-in situ hybridization of kakusei and Amgad, the honeybee homolog of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD, to assess inhibitory neural activity. kakusei-related activity in GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons was strongly upregulated in the OLs of the foragers and re-orienting bees, suggesting that both types of neurons are involved in visual information processing. GABAergic neuron activity was significantly higher than non-GABAergic neuron activity in a part of the OLs of only the forager, suggesting that unique information processing occurs in the OLs of foragers. In contrast, GABAergic neuron activity in the antennal lobe was significantly lower than that of GABAergic neurons in the OLs in the forager and re-orienting bees, suggesting that kakusei-related visual activity is dominant in the brains of these bees.The present study provides the first evidence that GABAergic neurons are highly active in the OL neurons of free-moving honeybees and essential clue to reveal neural basis of the sophisticated visual ability that is equipped in the small and simple brain."
https://openalex.org/W2091436376,"Extracellular antagonists of alpha 4 integrin are an effective therapy for several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases; however, these agents that directly block ligand binding may exhibit mechanism-based toxicities. Inhibition of alpha 4 integrin signaling by mutations of alpha 4 that block paxillin binding inhibits inflammation while limiting mechanism-based toxicities. Here, we test a pharmacological approach by identifying small molecules that inhibit the alpha 4 integrin-paxillin interaction. By screening a large (approximately 40,000-compound) chemical library, we identified a noncytotoxic inhibitor of this interaction that impaired integrin alpha 4-mediated but not alpha L beta 2-mediated Jurkat T cell migration. The identified compound had no effect on alpha 4-mediated migration in cells bearing the alpha 4(Y991A) mutation that disrupts the alpha 4-paxillin interaction, establishing the specificity of its action. Administration of this compound to mice led to impaired recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to a site of inflammation in vivo, whereas an isomer that does not inhibit the alpha 4-paxillin interaction had no effect on alpha 4-mediated cell migration, cell spreading, or recruitment of leukocytes to an inflammatory site. Thus, a small molecule inhibitor that interferes with alpha 4 integrin signaling reduces alpha 4-mediated T cell migration in vivo, thus providing proof of principle for inhibition of alpha 4 integrin signaling as a target for the pharmacological reduction of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1975756431,"We reveal a set of divergent octamer elements in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (dm) core histone gene promoters. These elements recruit transcription factor POU-domain protein in <i>D. melanogaster</i> 1 (Pdm-1), which along with co-activator dmOct-1 coactivator in S-phase (dmOCA-S), activates transcription from at least the <i>Drosophila</i> histone 2B (dmH2B) and 4 (dmH4) promoters in a fashion similar to the transcription of mammalian histone 2B (H2B) gene activated by octamer binding transcription factor 1 (Oct-1) and Oct-1 coactivator in S-phase (OCA-S). The expression of core histone genes in both kingdoms is coordinated; however, although the expression of mammalian histone genes involves subtype-specific transcription factors and/or co-activator(s), the expression of <i>Drosophila</i> core histone genes is regulated by a common module (Pdm-1/dmOCA-S) in a directly coordinated manner.

https://openalex.org/W2099935611,"ICP0 is a regulatory protein that plays a critical role in the replication-latency balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Absence of ICP0 renders HSV prone to establish quiescent infections, and thus cellular repressor(s) are believed to silence HSV mRNA synthesis when ICP0 fails to accumulate. To date, an ICP0-antagonized repressor has not been identified that restricts HSV mRNA synthesis by more than 2-fold. We report the unexpected discovery that HSV's major transcriptional regulator, ICP4, meets the criteria of a bona fide ICP0-antagonized repressor of viral mRNA synthesis. Our study began when we noted a repressive activity that restricted ICP0 mRNA synthesis by up to 30-fold in the absence of ICP0. When ICP0 accumulated, the repressor only restricted ICP0 mRNA synthesis by 3-fold. ICP4 proved to be necessary and sufficient to repress ICP0 mRNA synthesis, and did so in an ICP4-binding-site-dependent manner. ICP4 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged ICP0; thus, a physical interaction likely explains how ICP0 antagonizes ICP4's capacity to silence the ICP0 gene. These findings suggest that ICP0 mRNA synthesis is differentially regulated in HSV-infected cells by the virus-encoded repressor activity embedded in ICP4, and a virus-encoded antirepressor, ICP0. Bacteriophage lambda relies on a similar repression-antirepression regulatory scheme to ""decide"" whether a given infection will be productive or silent. Therefore, our findings appear to add to the growing list of inexplicable similarities that point to a common evolutionary ancestry between the herpesviruses and tailed bacteriophage."

Principal Findings Here we report on two genome tile path ChIP-chip designs for interrogating the Xenopus tropicalis genome. In particular, a whole-genome microarray design was used to identify active promoters by close proximity to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation. A second microarray design features these experimentally derived promoter regions in addition to currently annotated 5′ ends of genes. These regions truly represent promoters as shown by binding of TBP, a key transcription initiation factor. Conclusions A whole-genome and a promoter tile path microarray design was developed. Both designs can be used to study epigenetic phenomena and transcription factor binding in developing Xenopus embryos."

We developed the criterion that genomic occurrence of paired HREs at an inter-HRE distance less than 200 bp predicts hormone responsiveness, based on synergy of multiple HREs, and HRE information from known target genes. This criterion predicts a substantial number of novel responsive genes, when applied to genomic regions 10 kb upstream of genes. Multiple-tissue in situ hybridization showed that mRNA expression of 6 out of 10 selected genes was induced in a tissue-specific manner in mice treated with a single dose of corticosterone, with the spleen being the most responsive organ. Caveolin-1 was strongly responsive in several organs, and the HRE pair in its upstream region showed increased occupancy by glucocorticoid receptor in response to corticosterone. Our approach allowed for discovery of novel tissue specific glucocorticoid target genes, which may exemplify responses underlying the permissive actions of glucocorticoids."
