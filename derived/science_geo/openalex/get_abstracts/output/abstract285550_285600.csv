https://openalex.org/W2008276312,"Recent paleomagnetic-radiometric data from six rhyolite domes in the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, indicate that the last change in polarity of the earth's magnetic field from reversed to normal (the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary) occurred at about 0.7 million years ago. A previously undiscovered geomagnetic polarity event, herein named the ""Jaramillo normal event,"" occurred about 0.9 million years ago."

Lizards recovered from subsurface retreats in the fall exhibited a mean body temperature significantly lower than that for sequestered lizards recorded during winter, spring, and summer."
https://openalex.org/W2076049856,"Comparison of the distributions of Martian and lunar crater diameters indicates that the visible surface of Mars is 2.2 to 3 × 10 9 years old. This result implies that in the early history of Mars large-scale subaerial erosion occurred. Of 69 Martian craters with diameters greater than 10 kilometers, 13 percent have central peaks. This compares favorably with the frequency (11.7 percent) of central peaks among lunar craters and may indicate that the central peaks are a direct result of the impact mechanism rather than post-impact volcanism. A well-defined system of lineaments is shown in the Mariner photographs. The presence of these lineaments may indicate that Mars has lost appreciable angular momentum during its history."

The diatoms are found in a brine solution in microfissures between ice crystals on the underside of the ice. The chlorophyll content of this layer is 100 times more than that of the surrounding sea waters; this has led to a hypothesis that a considerable fraction of the primary production of the Arctic Sea may be carried out in sea ice, especially during the spring and early summer months."

The intensity of the spectrum was proportional to the intensity of the optical absorption near 545 mμ. The EPR spectrum of the color center corresponded to a positive hole trapped on a substitutional Fe 3+ ion in the quartz structure. We ascribe the color to a charge-transfer transition, Fe 4+ + O 2 — → Fe 3+ + O 1- ."
https://openalex.org/W2044072022,"The mineral and chemical composition of sediments deposited in the three lowermost reservoirs of the Columbia River is remarkably similar to the composition of many graywackes. Lithic fragments are abundant. In comparison with an ""average"" sandstone, the sediments have low concentrations of silica and high concentrations of all other major constituents, except calcium. Sodium is more abundant than potassium. The sediments are generally better sorted than graywackes. If graywacke texture is post-depositional in origin, Columbia River-type sediments could be expected to form graywackes upon deep burial without any significant addition or removal of material."
https://openalex.org/W1969382966,Diffraction analysis of minerals from iron meteorites indicates a pronounced shock-induced alteration in the minerals' crystallographic character. The extent of alteration seems to be dependent on the degree of shock and can therefore serve as a measure of shock intensity. The changes appear to be due to the minerals' direct recrystallization during passage of the shock wave.

Dating by the carbon-14 and thorium-230-uranium-234 methods suggests that the shells are at least 33,000 years old. The more probable age of the Tomales Bay locality is ≥ 50,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2075609675,"When I reflect that preceding Edison medallists
have been men of the type of Charles F. Brush, who
first showed the world that electricity might be used
for city lighting; Alexander Graham Bell, whose invention
was at the base of the whole vast system of
modern communications; Frank Sprague, who was
responsible for the application of electric power to
railway transportation; M. I. Pupin, who made long
distance telephony possible; J. J. Carty, under whose
inspiration and leadership the telephone repeater and
amplifier, with all that they mean to the enrichment
of modern life, have been brought forth, and others
of like achievement in the application of electricity
to large industrial uses, I feel that there may have
been a misunderstanding or a mistake in connection
with this year's award. For when I look over my
thirty years of scientific effort I can find no industry
which has grown out of my researches, nor even any
which have been very immediately benefited by them."
