https://openalex.org/W2009051280,"CEPHALOSPORIN N, an antibiotic produced by a species of Cephalosporium, was recently reported to be a new type of penicillin. The physical properties of this substance indicated that it contained a basic group as well as acidic groups1. The purest preparation of cephalosporin N so far obtained, which appears from analysis of a counter-current distribution curve to be at least 50 per cent homogeneous, has now been found to yield D-α-aminoadipic acid on hydrolysis. While L-α-aminoadipic acid is known to occur in Nature2,3, the D-isomer does not appear to have been isolated previously from a natural source."

https://openalex.org/W1969787306,"THE utilization of purines by various species ranges from a utilization of adenine for the synthesis of both polynucleotide adenine and guanine and the utilization of guanine for polynucleotide guanine synthesis only1, to the utilization of guanine for both polynucleotide adenine and guanine synthesis and the utilization of adenine for polynucleotide adenine only2. Between these contrasting patterns there exists a range of qualitative differences among various species3."

https://openalex.org/W1991309497,"IN the course of an investigation on the phosphatase content of the vaginal smear of some non-pregnant cows and heifers, extremely high alkaline phosphatase activity was observed in the mucus at regular intervals corresponding with the ovarian cycle of the animal. The highest values were found on the day that mucus secretion, begins, two days before the visible signs of heat (bellowing, unrest, willingness to copulate). On that day a relatively small but highly active amount of mucus is secreted. A second period of relatively high activity of the mucus is often seen between the eighth and the twelfth day post œstrum. The activity is rather variable in different individuals and the daily variations may be great, especially in periods of irregular mucus secretion."

In his recent monograph on the British Amphibia, Smith1, discussing the habits of Bufo bufo (L.), writes: “Periodically the skin is shed, certainly several times in the course of a summer. Gadow states that they shed it every few weeks, but this surely is an overstatement”."

https://openalex.org/W2047094533,"GLUTATHIONE, γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine, can easily be split into glutamic acid and cysteinylglycine by mild acid hydrolysis1, and even without acid by heating in a water solution2. The tripeptide has therefore been used as material for the preparation of cysteinylglycine. In order to prepare this dipeptide for a microbiological purpose, the latter of the two methods was tried."

https://openalex.org/W2032959618,"THE colonization in soil of detached host tissue by soil-inhabiting parasitic fungi was demonstrated by Sadasivan1 with Fusarium culmorum. Recently, this technique has been utilized by several University of Madras research workers in studies to determine the effect of micro-elements on the colonization and survival of Fusaria in cotton and gram (Cajanus cajan) roots2–4. Generally, they found that zinc, aluminium, boron, lithium, manganese and cobalt at soil concentrations from 100 to 400 p.p.m. retarded Fusarium colonization and survival."

Of the various possibilities suggested, it may be mentioned that thyroxine has been stated to cause a release of co-enzymes, protein carriers or other substances needed for many of the energy-transforming processes in cells2,3; but neither the mechanism of release nor the source of these materials is clear. Martius and Hess4 have suggested that thyroxine acts as an uncoupling agent."

Muller, which he states has been found at Millport, St. Andrews, Plymouth and Valencia1."
