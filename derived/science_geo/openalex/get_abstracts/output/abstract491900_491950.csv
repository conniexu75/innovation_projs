https://openalex.org/W2014981887,"Prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally poor because of the lack of simple, convenient, and noninvasive tools for CRC detection at the early stage. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their different expression profiles among different kinds of diseases has opened a new avenue for tumor diagnosis. We built a serum microRNA expression profile signature and tested its specificity and sensitivity as a biomarker in the diagnosis of CRC. We also studied its possible role in monitoring the progression of CRC. We conducted a two phase case-control test to identify serum miRNAs as biomarkers for CRC diagnosis. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, we tested ten candidate miRNAs in a training set (30 CRCs vs 30 controls). Risk score analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the serum miRNA profiling system. Other independent samples, including 83 CRCs and 59 controls, were used to validate the diagnostic model. In the training set, six serum miRNAs (miR-21, let-7g, miR-31, miR-92a, miR-181b, and miR-203) had significantly different expression levels between the CRCs and healthy controls. Risk score analysis demonstrated that the six-miRNA-based biomarker signature had high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing the CRC samples from cancer-free controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the six-miRNA signature profiles were 0.900 and 0.923 for the two sets of serum samples, respectively. However, for the same serum samples, the areas under the ROC curve used by the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were only 0.649 and 0.598, respectively. The expression levels of the six serum miRNAs were also correlated with CRC progression. Thus, the identified six-miRNA signature can be used as a noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC, with relatively high sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2163702558,"In the vertebrate immune system, each B-lymphocyte expresses a surface IgM-class B cell receptor (BCR). When cross-linked by antigen or anti-IgM antibody, the BCR accumulates with other proteins into distinct surface clusters that activate cell signaling, division, or apoptosis. However, the molecular composition of these clusters is not well defined. Here we describe a quantitative assay we call selective proteomic proximity labeling using tyramide (SPPLAT). It allows proteins in the immediate vicinity of a target to be selectively biotinylated, and hence isolated for mass spectrometry analysis. Using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model, we use SPPLAT to provide the first proteomic analysis of any BCR cluster using proximity labeling. We detect known components of the BCR cluster, including integrins, together with proteins not previously thought to be BCR-associated. In particular, we identify the chicken B-lymphocyte allotypic marker chB6. We show that chB6 moves to within about 30–40 nm of the BCR following BCR cross-linking, and we show that cross-linking chB6 activates cell binding to integrin substrates laminin and gelatin. Our work provides new insights into the nature and composition of the BCR cluster, and confirms SPPLAT as a useful research tool in molecular and cellular proteomics.

When either soluble or membrane-bound antigen binds to the BCR it becomes cross-linked, and assembles into spatially restricted and functionally integrated protein clusters (1Treanor B. B-cell receptor: from resting state to activate.Immunology. 2012; 136: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cross-linked BCRs enter lipid rafts, and drive their coalescence (2Gupta N. DeFranco A.L. Visualizing lipid raft dynamics and early signaling events during antigen receptor-mediated B-lymphocyte activation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These events activate a complex series of signal transduction pathways, followed by the “capping” and endocytosis of the BCR-antigen complex (3Stoddart A. Jackson A.P. Brodsky F.M. Plasticity of B cell receptor internalization upon conditional depletion of clathrin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the B-lymphocyte can either undergo division and differentiation, ultimately to produce an antibody-secreting plasma cell, or can initiate apoptosis. Which pathway is followed depends on the developmental stage of the B-lymphocyte and its immunological context (4DeFranco A.L. The complexity of signaling pathways activated by the Bcr.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). B cell receptor guainine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit α2 stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture selective proteomic proximity labeling assay using tyramide Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride proximity ligation assay. The molecular composition of the BCR cluster is of considerable interest. Currently, however, it is not well characterized, and the proteomic analysis of such clusters represents a significant technical challenge (5Zheng Y.Z. Foster L.J. Biochemical and proteomic approaches for the study of membrane microdomains.J. Proteomics. 2009; 72: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is in part because the BCR clusters are highly dynamic, and their composition may change during the BCR cross-linking process (1Treanor B. B-cell receptor: from resting state to activate.Immunology. 2012; 136: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Tolar P. Sohn H.W. Liu W. Pierce S.K. The molecular assembly and organization of signaling active B-cell receptor oligomers.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 232: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More fundamentally, proteins that become concentrated in these clusters may not necessarily bind each other directly, or may bind only weakly. Traditional isolation methods such as immunoprecipitation may not be effective in this case. Although cross-linking could theoretically be used, in practice it can be difficult to control (7Yang W. Steen H. Freeman M.R. Proteomic approaches to the analysis of multiprotein signaling complexes.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 832-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We believe that alternative analytical methods will be required to better survey protein diversity within membrane-localized structures such as the BCR cluster. Recently, several groups have described the use of “proximity labeling assays” for the investigation of membrane proteins (8Jiang S. Kotani N. Ohnishi T. Miyagawa-Yamguchi A. Tsuda M. Yamashita R. Ishiura Y. Honke K. A proteomics approach to the cell-surface interactome using the enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources reaction.Proteomics. 2012; 12: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Rhee H.W. Zou P. Udeshi N.D. Martell J.D. Mootha V.K. Carr S.A. Ting A.Y. Proteomic mapping of mitochondria in living cells via spatially restricted enzymatic tagging.Science. 2013; 339: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In these methods, an appropriately targeted peroxidase enzyme acts on a substrate to generate a short-lived product capable of covalently labeling proteins in the immediate vicinity of the enzyme. The labeled proteins can then be isolated by standard affinity chromatography, and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Here we describe a new variation of proximity labeling, which combines cleavable tyramide-biotin chemistry with high throughput proteomics, made quantitative using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We use the method to provide the first proteomic analysis of a cross-linked BCR cluster on any B-lymphocyte. For our model, we use the avian leukosis virus-transformed chicken cell line DT40 (10Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Increased ratio of targeted to random integration after transfection of chicken B cell lines.Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This cell line is derived from an immature B-lymphocyte (11Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. Requirement of phospholipase C-γ2 activation in surface immunoglobulin M-induced B cell apoptosis.J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The DT40 cell line is widely used for functional studies, because its high rate of homologous recombination greatly facilitates gene targeting (10Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Increased ratio of targeted to random integration after transfection of chicken B cell lines.Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The genes for several proteins within the BCR signaling pathway have been knocked out in DT40 and the functional consequences investigated (12Yasuda T. Yamamoto T. Analysis of B-cell signaling using Dt40 B-cell line.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). DT40 cells can also be grown in large numbers, aiding proteomic analysis (13Hall S.L. Hester S. Griffin J.L. Lilley K.S. Jackson A.P. The organelle proteome of the Dt40 lymphocyte cell line.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1295-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DT40 cells therefore represent an attractive and physiologically relevant model system on which to apply our proximity labeling assay. We identify known and suspected components of the BCR clusters, including the lipid raft marker raftlin (14Saeki K. Miura Y. Aki D. Kurosaki T. Yoshimura A. The B cell-specific major raft protein, Raftlin, is necessary for the integrity of lipid raft and Bcr signal transduction.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and integrins (15Spaargaren M. Beuling E.A. Rurup M.L. Meijer H.P. Klok M.D. Middendorp S. Hendriks R.W. Pals S.T. The B cell antigen receptor controls integrin activity through Btk and PLCγ2.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We also detect proteins not previously linked to BCR cluster assembly. Surprisingly, we detect protein chB6, a molecule long used as an important allotypic marker for avian B-lymphocyte development, but whose function is currently unknown (16Tregaskes C.A. Bumstead N. Davison T.F. Young J.R. Chicken B-cell marker Chb6 (Bu-1) is a highly glycosylated protein of unique structure.Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We show that chB6 is partitioned between lipid rafts and non-raft regions of the DT40 plasma membrane, and we show that BCR clustering drives the close association of chB6 with the BCR. Analysis of the chB6 primary sequence suggests structural similarities to immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing signaling and cell-adhesion molecules. Consistent with this view, we show that chB6 cross-linking activates integrin-mediated cell binding. Our results confirm the potential of proximity labeling assays for the analysis of the BCR cluster, and identify new targets for further functional studies. The composition of buffers used in the biotinylation, purification, and immunofluorescence experiments were as follows: tyramide labeling buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with fresh 0.03% H2O2 containing 80 μg/ml of tyramide-biotin label), antibody strip buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2), cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 m sodium thiocyanate), wash buffer 1 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 mg/ml of PMSF (Sigma), 0.1 m sodium thiocyanate), wash buffer 2 (0.1 m sodium thiocyanate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1× protease inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml of PMSF), elution buffer (0.1 m sodium thiocyanate, 1% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm TCEP (Thermo), 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 mg/ml of PMSF), immunofluorescence wash buffer (PBS containing 0.5% saponin, 0.1% Triton X-100), immunofluorescence blocking buffer (immunofluorescence wash buffer containing 10% non-immune goat serum), immunofluorescence reducing buffer (5 mm TCEP in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% BSA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.6) (17Cline D.J. Redding S.E. Brohawn S.G. Psathas J.N. Schneider J.P. Thorpe C. New water-soluble phosphines as reductants of peptide and protein disulfide bonds: reactivity and membrane permeability.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15195-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and TBS-Tween (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5). The cleavable tyramide-biotin label was prepared by gently mixing 5 mg of EZ-Link NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo) with 1.55 mg of tyramine hydrochloride (Sigma) in 2 ml of 50 mm borate, pH 8.8, overnight, at room temperature in the dark (18Earnshaw J.C. Osbourn J.K. Signal amplification in flow cytometry using biotin tyramine.Cytometry. 1999; 35: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After filtering with a 0.2-μm filter the label was stored at −20 °C. Routine growth and maintenance of the DT40 cell line was as previously described (13Hall S.L. Hester S. Griffin J.L. Lilley K.S. Jackson A.P. The organelle proteome of the Dt40 lymphocyte cell line.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1295-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For SILAC experiments, RPMI 1640 heavy medium contained 13C6-labeled l-lysine and l-arginine (K6R6), whereas the light medium was RPMI 1640 containing non-labeled l-lysine and l-arginine (K0R0), both of which were supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (all from Dundee Cell Products), 1% dialyzed chicken serum (in house), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Exponentially growing cells were pelleted and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. About 5 × 108 cells were incubated with end over end rotation for 2 h with 20 μg/ml of HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM (Bethyl Ltd.), or 20 μg/ml of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) in 20 ml of PBS with 10% (v/v) goat serum (Ultraclone Ltd.) at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted and re-suspended in 10 ml of tyramide-labeling buffer and incubated with end over end rotation at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation, 100 units/ml of catalase (Sigma) was added and incubated with the samples for a further 5 min to quench H2O2. Cells were washed gently with 45 ml of antibody strip buffer and left on ice for 5 min. Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 4 min at 130,000 × g and protein-containing soluble fraction was recovered for streptavidin-bead capture. The same amount of specifically and nonspecifically biotinylated proteins (1.04 mg (1st SILAC) and 0.78 mg (2nd SILAC)) were mixed and incubated with 0.25 ml of streptavidin-agarose beads in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer containing sodium thiocyanate to reduce nonspecific interactions (19Rees J.S. Lilley K.S. Method for suppressing non-specific protein interactions observed with affinity resins.Methods. 2011; 54: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Beads were then incubated in 1 ml of elution buffer with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The biotinylated proteins were recovered by centrifugation and concentrated by vacuum drying. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). The gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue prior to dividing and excising into four equal strips. Gel slices were destained in ddH2O and 20 mm NH4HCO3, reduced with 2 mm DTT, and alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide prior to overnight digestion with 2 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). Peptides were extracted with acetonitrile and 1% formic acid and re-suspended in water with 1% formic acid after vacuum drying. 5 × 108 cells were separately incubated with either HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG control, lysed as described above. About 1.7 mg of cell lysate protein was incubated with 0.25 ml of bead slurry of rabbit anti-goat IgG-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, washed extensively with cold PBS, and protein was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, at 4 °C. Samples were concentrated by freeze drying and separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient gels). Four equal sized bands were excised and processed for trypsin digestion as above. All LC-MS/MS SPPLAT experiments were performed using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and an LTQ Orbitrap Velos hybrid ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Separation of peptides was performed by reverse-phase chromatography using a Waters reverse-phase nanocolumn (BEH C18, 75 μm inner diameter × 250 mm, 1.7-μm particle size) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were initially loaded onto a pre-column (Waters UPLC Trap Symmetry C18, 180 μm inner diameter × 20 mm, 5-μm particle size) from the nanoAcquity sample manager with 0.1% formic acid for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After this period, the column valve was switched to allow the elution of peptides from the pre-column onto the analytical column where a linear gradient of increasing acetonitrile (5–35%) over 60 min was employed. The LC eluant was sprayed into the mass spectrometer by means of a nanospray source. All m/z values of eluting ions were measured in the Orbitrap Velos mass analyzer, set at a resolution of 30,000. Data-dependent scans (top 10) were employed to automatically isolate and generate fragment ions by collision-induced dissociation in the linear ion trap, resulting in the generation of MS/MS spectra. Ions with charge states of 2+ and above were selected for fragmentation. Post-run, the data were processed using Protein Discoverer (version 1.2, Thermo Scientific). The raw MS data files were converted to mgf files and searched against the UniprotKB Gallus gallus database (2012, 27,000 entries) using the Mascot search algorithm (version 2.2.07, Matrix Science, London, UK) with methionine oxidation (M) as a variable modification and cysteine carbamidomethylation (C) as a fixed modification, allowing 2 missed cleavages, a peptide mass tolerance of ±1 Da, and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 Da. Quantitation was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.0.3.5). Raw data were searched using Andromeda (20Cox J. Neuhauser N. Michalski A. Scheltema R.A. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Andromeda: a peptide search engine integrated into the maxquant environment.J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10: 1794-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar), with Arg-6 and Lys-6 set as heavy labels, methionine oxidation and N-acetylation as variable modifications, and cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. The proteins were considered to be identified if there was at least one unique peptide and to be quantified if there were at least two unique peptides. Only unique peptides were used for quantitation. LC-MS/MS experiments were performed as above but using a nanoLC Ultra 1D plus system (Eksigent Corp., Dublin, CA) and an LTQ Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. Peptides were initially loaded onto an in-house pre-column (100 μm inner diameter × 40 mm, 3.6-μm particle size) from a nanoLC AS-2 autosampler with 0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min, then further separated using an in-house reverse-phase nanocolumn (Phenomenex, kinetex C18, 75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm, 2.6-μm particle size) at a flow rate of 250 nl/min for 120 min. Peptide mass tolerance was ±20 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was 0.8 Da. Significance threshold was set to p > 0.05 and ion score cut off was set to 0. Protein abundance was estimated by calculating emPAI scores (21Ishihama Y. Oda Y. Tabata T. Sato T. Nagasu T. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Exponentially modified protein abundance index (Empai) for estimation of absolute protein amount in proteomics by the number of sequenced peptides per protein.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1265-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Tyramide-biotin labeling of about 5 × 108 cells was carried out as described above. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer without sodium thiocyanate for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by brief centrifugation (2000 × g, 3 min). Lysate supernatants were separately incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-CDC42 (Abcam ab170048) (1:100 dilution) or mouse FU5–11G2 monoclonal anti-chB6 (1:100 ascites (22Veromaa T. Vainio O. Eerola E. Toivanen P. Monoclonal antibodies against chicken Bu-1a and Bu-1b alloantigens.Hybridoma. 1988; 7: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with 0.05 ml of slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) with end over end rotation for 2 h at 4 °C and pelleted by centrifugation (2000 × g, 3 min). To remove weakly interacting proteins, pellets were washed four times in 1.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and four times in 1.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.75 m NaCl all without sodium thiocyanate, with 5-min incubations between spins. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then eluted with 0.08 ml of antibody strip buffer at 50 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) without reducing agent and electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF membrane using the iBlot gel transfer system (Invitrogen). Separate blotted samples were blocked for 3 h at 4 °C with 4% BSA in TBS-Tween, then probed overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit anti-chB6 specific peptide EMIADVESQENASNC (Dragonfly Sciences, Wellesley, MA) (1:200 dilution in TBS-Tween), or polyclonal rabbit anti-CDC42 (Abcam ab175270) (1:100 dilution in TBS-Tween). Membranes were washed with TBS-Tween, then probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Dako) at 1:5000 dilution in TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed with TBS-Tween four times for 5 min each at room temperature. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). In parallel, separate blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) (1:8000 dilution in TBS-Tween) for 1 h at 4 °C to detect biotinylation. Blots were washed as above, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). DT40 cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM, or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and tyramide biotinylated as described above. Cells were attached to coverslips pre-coated with 0.05% poly-l-lysine and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature as described previously (13Hall S.L. Hester S. Griffin J.L. Lilley K.S. Jackson A.P. The organelle proteome of the Dt40 lymphocyte cell line.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1295-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were washed four times in immunofluorescence wash buffer followed by immunofluorescence blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:100) and Alexa 568-conjugated avidin (1:2000) (both Abcam) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed four times, and coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector) and examined using an Olympus Fluoview IX81 laser scanning confocal microscope. To test for surface biotinylation, cells were preincubated with HRP-conjugated anti-chicken IgM, tyramide-biotinylated as described above, then half the cell population was incubated with immunofluorescence reducing buffer for 10 min. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG to detect BCR and Texas Red-conjugated avidin to detect the remaining biotin. Images were rendered in pseudo-three-dimensional using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health; rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). For integrin and BCR immunofluorescence, cells were preincubated with HRP-conjugated anti-chicken IgM, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG as above for 1 h. Cells were washed six times in immunofluorescence wash buffer. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-chicken β1 integrin subunit (1:100) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) for 1 h in immunofluorescence wash buffer. Cells were washed six times with immunofluorescence blocking buffer, followed by staining with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) (Sigma) in immunofluorescence blocking buffer. Cells were processed and analyzed for fluorescence microscopy as above. Control cells lacking either HRP-conjugated anti-IgM or primary antibodies were identically processed. For co-localization of chB6 and lipid rafts, ∼106 cells were suspended with primary antibody FU5-11G2 (mouse anti-chB6.2 ascites (22Veromaa T. Vainio O. Eerola E. Toivanen P. Monoclonal antibodies against chicken Bu-1a and Bu-1b alloantigens.Hybridoma. 1988; 7: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), diluted 1:100, and incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice and resuspended with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, diluted 1:200 (Millipore, Temecula, CA), and Alexa 568-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (Invitrogen) diluted 1:800. The cells were then incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were washed twice and then resuspended in PBS. Images of chB6 immunofluorescence and lipid raft overlay were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600) with ×40 objective. Images were processed with SPOT Advanced software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Detergent-soluble and -insoluble membrane fractions were prepared according to the method of Xie et al. (23Xie P. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. Requirement for Traf3 in signaling by Lmp1 but not Cd40 in B lymphocytes.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 DT40 cells were washed and the cell pellet was resolubilized in 1% Brij 58 lysis buffer (1% Brij 58, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to separate Brij-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The supernatant (Brij detergent-soluble or non-lipid raft fraction) was kept on ice until later use. The detergent-insoluble pellet (lipid rafts) was resolubilized in octyl glucopyranoside lysis buffer (60 mm octyl glucopyranoside 292, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS) by sonication, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The detergent-insoluble fraction was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove further insoluble material. The supernatant was kept on ice until further use. Aliquots of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions equivalent to 106 cells were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with 0.35 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight with 4% BSA in TBS at room temperature and then washed twice with TBS-Tween.

https://openalex.org/W1997882784,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase B (PknB) comprises an intracellular kinase domain, connected through a transmembrane domain to an extracellular region that contains four PASTA domains. The present study describes the comprehensive analysis of different domains of PknB in the context of viability in avirulent and virulent mycobacteria. We find stringent regulation of PknB expression necessary for cell survival, with depletion or overexpression of PknB leading to cell death. Although PknB-mediated kinase activity is essential for cell survival, active kinase lacking the transmembrane or extracellular domain fails to complement conditional mutants not expressing PknB. By creating chimeric kinases, we find that the intracellular kinase domain has unique functions in the virulent strain, which cannot be substituted by other kinases. Interestingly, we find that although the presence of the C-terminal PASTA domain is dispensable in the avirulent M. smegmatis, all four PASTA domains are essential in M. tuberculosis. The differential behavior of PknB vis-à-vis the number of essential PASTA domains and the specificity of kinase domain functions suggest that PknB-mediated growth and signaling events differ in virulent compared with avirulent mycobacteria. Mouse infection studies performed to determine the role of PknB in mediating pathogen survival in the host demonstrate that PknB is not only critical for growth of the pathogen in vitro but is also essential for the survival of the pathogen in the host.

Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a critical regulatory mechanism by which extracellular cues are transduced into cellular responses. Traditionally, two-component systems comprising a histidine kinase sensor and the associated response regulator were thought to be responsible for phosphorylation-mediated signaling in prokaryotes (1Stock J.B.

Two-component pathways are rare in eukaryotes, and phosphotransfer-based signaling predominantly involves phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues, often in a cascade.

Protein kinases A and B, encoded by pknA and pknB, respectively, are part of the operon carrying cistrons coding for protein phosphatase pstP, rodA (involved in cell shape control), and pbpA (involved in peptidoglycan synthesis). This locus also includes two FHA (forkhead-associated) domain-containing genes and is found near the origin of replication throughout the Mycobacterium genus (15Narayan A. Sachdeva P. Sharma K.

As in most other kinases, PknA and PknB consist of a kinase domain, a juxtamembrane region, a short transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region (9Av-Gay Y. Everett M.

Both kinases have been found to be essential based on transposon-insertion experiments (17Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Genes required for mycobacterial growth defined by high density mutagenesis.Mol.

PknB is among the highly characterized serine/threonine protein kinases of mycobacteria. The kinase domain of PknB (aa 1–279) by itself has been shown to be sufficient for its activity (20Durán R.

Crystal structure analysis of the PknB kinase domain found it to be a two-lobed structure (N- and C- terminal lobes) showing conservation of protein fold and catalytic machinery to eukaryotic STPK homologs (21Ortiz-Lombardía M.

The N-terminal lobe contains the ATP binding site, whereas the C-terminal lobe is involved in rendering an active state and in stabilizing interactions with the substrate (23Lombana T.N. Echols N.

Based on the structures, PknB is proposed to form both back-to-back and front-to-front dimers (24Mieczkowski C. Iavarone A.T. Alber T. Auto-activation mechanism of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknB receptor Ser/Thr kinase.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3186-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The dimerization of PknB was shown to be essential for autophosphorylation and activation of kinase through an allosteric mechanism (23Lombana T.N. Echols N. Good M.C. Thomsen N.D. Ng H.L.

The extracellular domain of PknB is predicted to have four conserved PASTA (penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase-associated) domains (22Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A.

This domain has been suggested to play a role in the recognition of d-alanyl-d-alanine dipeptides used to build up the peptidoglycan layers (25Yeats C. Finn R.D. Bateman A. The PASTA domain: a β-lactam-binding domain.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Using nuclear magnetic resonance and small angle x-ray scattering, the four PASTA domains have been shown to be organized in a linear fashion, in contrast to penicillin-binding protein PBP2x (from Streptococcus pneumoniae), where the two PASTA domains fold over in a compact arrangement (26Barthe P. Mukamolova G.V. Roumestand C. Cohen-Gonsaud M.

The extracellular domain of M. tuberculosis PknB has also been shown to bind muropeptides, and the specific amino acids in the stem peptide that impact the efficacy of the interaction have been identified (28Mir M. Asong J. Li X. Cardot J. Boons G.J. Husson R.N. The extracytoplasmic domain of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr kinase PknB binds specific muropeptides and is required for PknB localization.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the PknB structure and the mode of activation in vitro are now understood, structure-function relationships of the various domains have not been investigated in the context of mycobacterial growth and survival. The present study was undertaken to comprehensively evaluate the importance of the different domains in modulating PknB function in vivo. Using pknB conditional mutants in Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis strains, we observe that variable expression of PknB regulates cell growth and morphology, with both overexpression and depletion leading to cell death. Interestingly, we find that the minimum number of PASTA domains required in the extracytoplasmic region varies between avirulent and virulent mycobacteria. Infection studies with a mouse model reveal that depletion of PknB results in clearance of pathogen from the host tissues, indicating definitively that PknB is essential for survival of the pathogen within the host.

HiT-PknB was created by subcloning the NdeI-HindIII fragment from pENTR-PknB into the corresponding sites in pST-HiT. The PknB-KD (aa 1–279), PknB-JM (aa 1–331), PknB-TM (aa 1–352), PknB-PASTA1 (aa 1–422), PknB-PASTA2 (aa 1–490), and PknB-PASTA3 (aa 1–557) fragments were amplified from pENTR-PknB, using PknB-specific forward and domain-specific reverse primers, and the amplicons were cloned into pMAL-c2X and pNit vectors. All point mutations were made by overlapping PCR using appropriate mutagenic primers, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To make the PknA-B and PknH-B chimeric proteins, the intracellular domains of PknA or PknH were fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of PknB using overlapping PCR. pMAL-c2X constructs expressing PknB or its mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene), and the MBP-tagged proteins were purified as described (32Khan S.

The strategy used for creation of the pknB conditional gene replacement mutant in M. smegmatis (mc2ΔpknB) is described above. Electrocompetent cells of mc2155 or H37Rv were transformed with pNit or pNit-PknB to generate mc2::pNit, mc2::PknB, Rv::pNit, and Rv::PknB. To analyze the growth patterns of M. smegmatis mc2155, mc2::pNit, mc2::PknB, and mc2ΔpknB, each strain was grown in LB medium containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% glycerol, and appropriate antibiotic to A600 ∼0.8, either in the absence of inducer isovaleronitrile (IVN) in the case of mc2::pNit and mc2::PknB or in the presence of inducer ATc in the case of mc2ΔpknB mutant. M. tuberculosis transformants Rv::pNit and Rv::PknB as well as the mutant strain Rv-pptr-B were grown to A600 ∼0.8 in 7H9-ADC containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% glycerol, and appropriate antibiotic in the presence of inducer pristinamycin 1A in the case of Rv-pptr-B or in the absence of inducer IVN in the case of H37Rv, Rv::pNit and Rv::PknB. The cultures were washed twice in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 80 and were used to seed fresh cultures at an initial A600 of 0.02 (in the case of M. smegmatis) or 0.1 (in the case of M. tuberculosis) in the presence or absence of inducer. To analyze growth in M. smegmatis strains, A600 was measured every 3–30 h after initiation. To analyze growth in M. tuberculosis strains, A600 was measured every 24 h to 8 days after initiation. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and the average A600 values were plotted as a function of time. S.E. values were calculated using SigmaPlot for each time point. For Western blot analysis, cultures of M. smegmatis strains were initiated at an A600 of 0.2 and were grown for 9 h in the absence or presence of ATc. Cultures of M. tuberculosis strains were likewise initiated and grown in the absence or presence of inducer for 6 days. In order to determine whether the absence of PknB has bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effects, cultures were withdrawn on days 0, 2, and 5, and different dilutions were spotted on plates containing the inducer pristinamycin 1A.

This process depends on the nature of the selenocysteine insertion sequence element located in the 3′ UTR of selenoprotein mRNAs, selenium bioavailability, and, possibly, exogenous stimuli. To further understand the function and regulation of selenoproteins in antioxidant defense and redox homeostasis, we investigated how oxidative stress influences selenoprotein expression as a function of different selenium concentrations. We found that selenium supplementation of the culture media, which resulted in a hierarchical up-regulation of selenoproteins, protected HEK293 cells from reactive oxygen species formation. Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress, we identified a selective up-regulation of several selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense (Gpx1, Gpx4, TR1, SelS, SelK, and Sps2). Interestingly, the response was more efficient when selenium was limiting. Although a modest change in mRNA levels was noted, we identified a novel translational control mechanism stimulated by oxidative stress that is characterized by up-regulation of UGA-selenocysteine recoding efficiency and relocalization of SBP2, selenocysteine-specific elongation factor, and L30 recoding factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

Selenium is an essential trace element implicated in muscular, thyroid, immune, and brain functions (1Rayman M.P.

Selenium and selenoproteins in health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Numerous epidemiological and intervention studies have recognized the link between low levels of selenium in human body fluids and an increased risk of cancers, including prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Selenium is incorporated as selenocysteine, a rare amino acid, into at least 25 human selenoproteins, an essential family of redox enzymes (3Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V.

Many selenoproteins are involved in antioxidant defense, redox homeostasis, and redox signaling through the action of glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1-Gpx6), methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrB1 or SelX), thioredoxin reductases (TR1-TR3), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumSECISselenocysteine insertion sequenceROSreactive oxygen speciesGpxglutathione peroxidaseTRthioredoxin reductaseCtrlcontrolSupsupplementedt-BHPter-butyl hydroperoxideLucluciferaseCu-OOHcumene hydroperoxide. selenoproteins (Sel15, SelS, SelK, and SelM).

Selenocysteine is cotranslationally inserted by the ribosome using an UGA codon, normally read as a stop signal. The 3′ UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a secondary structure called the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element. The SECIS controls the faithful recoding of the UGA codon as selenocysteine, thereby preventing the formation of truncated proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 2Papp L.V. Holmgren A. Khanna K.K.

However, despite much effort, the precise mechanism of selenoprotein synthesis and regulation remains elusive. Many studies have shown that selenium levels differentially control the expression of the selenoproteome in mammals and cultured cells. This regulation occurs moderately at the level of mRNA transcription/stability, but mostly during translation, to maintain essential selenoproteins at the expense of the others (18Bermano G.

Gpx1 expression was more affected than Gpx4 by selenium availability (22Lei X.G. Evenson J.K. Thompson K.M. Sunde R.A.

Nutr. 1995; 125: 1438-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), essentially via a translational control mechanism (23Latrèche L. Duhieu S. Touat-Hamici Z. Jean-Jean O. Chavatte L. The differential expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 depends on the nature of the SECIS element.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing luciferase-SECIS constructs to quantitatively evaluate the translational regulation of selenoprotein expression (23Latrèche L. Duhieu S. Touat-Hamici Z. Jean-Jean O. Chavatte L. The differential expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 depends on the nature of the SECIS element.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Latrèche L. Jean-Jean O. Driscoll D.M. Chavatte L. Novel structural determinants in human SECIS elements modulate the translational recoding of UGA as selenocysteine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 5868-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, we demonstrated that, in response to selenium level variations, selenocysteine insertion was driven by the nature of the SECIS element. To date, no stimulus other than selenium has been shown to stimulate selenoprotein expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated either endogenously during cellular metabolism, mostly by mitochondria, or exogenously from environmental stress. ROS are also emerging as essential signaling molecules at low concentrations that transduce signals from the mitochondrial compartment to other compartments of the cell. To maintain ROS homeostasis, cells possess enzymatic antioxidant systems such as Gpxs, TRs, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, including glutathione (GSH), vitamin E, and ascorbate. Among the selenoproteins, the Gpxs are implicated in the elimination of peroxides, whereas the TRs are critical for many cellular functions involving thiol-dependent redox mechanisms. Gpxs reduce hydrogen and lipid peroxides using GSH as a cofactor, which is subsequently recycled by glutathione reductases (25Brigelius-Flohé R. Maiorino M. Glutathione peroxidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1830: 3289-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). TRs catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxidized thioredoxin and, therefore, participate in the defense against oxidative stress during DNA synthesis and in redox signaling (26Arnér E.S. Focus on mammalian thioredoxin reductases: important selenoproteins with versatile functions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 495-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In addition to thioredoxin, a vast range of small molecules can also be reduced by TRs and participate in its antioxidant function. In parallel, the ER-resident selenoproteins, which include SelS, SelK, Sel15, and SelM, have important functions in protein folding and the ER stress response (27Shchedrina V.A. Zhang Y. Labunskyy V.M. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Structure-function relations, physiological roles, and evolution of mammalian ER-resident selenoproteins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). ROS can severely damage a variety of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Depending on the nature of oxidative damage, these oxidized molecules can be repaired by various cellular machineries, several of which involve selenoproteins such as Gpxs, SelX, or TRs. When ROS production is overwhelming, oxidized macromolecules accumulate, hamper biological functions, and lead to pathological conditions. Down-regulation of selenoprotein expression is expected to increase ROS production and ER stress, which would lead to accumulation of oxidized molecules and DNA damage, and to impair cellular homeostasis and cell cycle progression. Accumulation of ROS-induced cellular damage is associated with cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and aging. ROS have been proposed to link the selenium activity in mammals with these pathologies (28Steinbrenner H. Sies H. Protection against reactive oxygen species by selenoproteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1478-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of the antioxidant defense has been well described in response to oxidative stress. ROS induce a rapid activation of the NRF2 and NF-κB transcription factors (29Buelna-Chontal M. Zazueta C. Redox activation of Nrf2 and NF-κB: a double end sword?.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25: 2548-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Their targets include a multitude of genes involved in the stress response, antioxidant activity, the anti-inflammatory response, DNA repair, molecular chaperones, proteasome systems, and two selenoproteins, Gpx2 (mostly expressed in the intestine) and TR1 (an essential cytoplasmic enzyme). The degree of expression of these genes involves other transcription factors (30Brigelius-Flohé R. Müller M. Lippmann D. Kipp A.P. The yin and yang of nrf2-regulated selenoproteins in carcinogenesis.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 2012: 486147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Müller M. Banning A. Brigelius-Flohé R. Kipp A. Nrf2 target genes are induced under marginal selenium-deficiency.Genes Nutr. 2010; 5: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A link between selenium, selenoprotein expression, and the antioxidant response has been established via NRF2, which is induced in certain cell lines during severe selenium deficiency or complete loss of selenoproteins obtained by tRNASec gene inactivation (32Suzuki T. Kelly V.P. Motohashi H. Nakajima O. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Yamamoto M. Deletion of the selenocysteine tRNA gene in macrophages and liver results in compensatory gene induction of cytoprotective enzymes by Nrf2.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The remarkable feature of selenoprotein expression lies in the many levels of control. Indeed, the complex network of regulation during transcription, translation, and mRNA stabilization allows a hierarchical expression of these antioxidant components (6Driscoll D.M. Copeland P.R. Mechanism and regulation of selenoprotein synthesis.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2003; 23: 17-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Whether and how the selenoproteins that are involved in antioxidant defense are regulated by oxidative stress remains to be studied. In this work, we investigated the regulation of selenoprotein expression in the context of H2O2-induced oxidative stress as a function of selenium concentration in the culture media, defined as control (Ctrl) and supplemented (Sup) conditions. We used HEK293 cells in our study because selenoproteins are expressed at significant levels in this cell line (23Latrèche L. Duhieu S. Touat-Hamici Z. Jean-Jean O. Chavatte L. The differential expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 depends on the nature of the SECIS element.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Latrèche L. Jean-Jean O. Driscoll D.M. Chavatte L. Novel structural determinants in human SECIS elements modulate the translational recoding of UGA as selenocysteine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 5868-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and also because we developed cellular tools to quantitatively study the recoding of UGA as selenocysteine in this particular cell line (23Latrèche L. Duhieu S. Touat-Hamici Z. Jean-Jean O. Chavatte L. The differential expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 depends on the nature of the SECIS element.RNA Biol. 2012; 9: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that down-regulation of the antioxidant defense in the Ctrl condition was linked to a selective reduction of several selenoproteins. Thus, HEK293 cells grown in selenium-limiting conditions produced more ROS, accumulated more oxidized proteins, and were more sensitive to oxidative challenge. Remarkably, in this condition (i.e. Ctrl), several selenoproteins, including Gpx1, Gpx4, TR1, SelS, SelK, and Sps2, were specifically up-regulated by H2O2 treatment. However, only limited changes were observed in the Sup condition. We determined that H2O2-induced up-regulation of selenoproteins is due to a novel translational control mechanism leading to the stimulation of UGA recoding efficiency in selenoprotein mRNAs. Luciferase reporter plasmids and cell lines were generated as in Refs. 23Latrèche L. Duhieu S. Touat-Hamici Z. Jean-Jean O. Chavatte L.

The selenium concentration in the Ctrl medium was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 15 nm. Sup medium was made by adding 30 nm sodium selenite to the Ctrl medium, and, therefore, it contained 45 nm selenium. One day prior to H2O2 exposure, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in either Ctrl or Sup medium. When the cells reached 70% confluency, the medium was changed to a freshly prepared solution of FCS-free DMEM that contained different concentrations of H2O2, Cu-OOH, or t-BHP as indicated. After 30 min of exposure, the media were removed and replaced by the appropriate ones. Cell extracts were harvested 24 h post-treatment in 300 μl of lysis buffer (23Latrèche L. Duhieu S.

Cellular fractionations were performed with the ProteoJET cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction kit (Fermentas) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were measured using the DC kit (Bio-Rad) in microplate assays. HEK293 cells that were grown in Ctrl or Sup medium were incubated with 5 μm MitoSOXTM Red (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Antimycine A (2.5 μg/ml), an inhibitor of respiratory complex III, was added as indicated. Oxidation of MitoSOXTM Red reagent by superoxide produced red fluorescence that was measured as a function of time on a Partech flow cytometer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Fluorescence kinetics were determined from three independent experiments. HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown in either Ctrl or Sup medium for 1 day. Cells were treated with 0 or 300 μm H2O2 for 30 min in serum-free medium and then harvested 24 h later. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol/PBS for 2 h at −20 °C, rehydrated in PBS, and stained for 2 h at 37 °C with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (250 μg/ml). Cell fluorescence was then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analyses were done using Flowmax and Multicycle software. Protein extracts (50 μg) were separated in BisTris NuPAGE Novex Midi gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were probed with primary antibodies (as indicated) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Detection of total carbonyl contents in cell extracts was performed with the OxyblotTM protein oxidation detection kit (Millipore). Protein carbonyls from cell extracts (5 μg) were derived using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with an anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The chemiluminescence signal was detected using an ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare) and an LAS3000 charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (GE Healthcare). Gpx activity was measured in an enzymatic coupled assay according to methods described previously (19Bermano G. Nicol F. Dyer J.A. Sunde R.A. Beckett G.J. Arthur J.R. Hesketh J.E.

The reaction mixture was composed of 50 μg of protein extract, 0.25 mm NADPH, 2 mm reduced l-glutathione, and 1.5 IU of glutathione reductase adjusted to a total volume of 250 μl with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by the addition of 300 nm t-BHP, and consumption of NAPDH was followed at 340 nm with a Fluostar reader. Enzymatic activities were expressed as nanomoles of glutathione per minute per milligram (milliunits per milligram of protein). TR activity was measured as described in Ref. 33Arnér E.S. Recombinant expression of mammalian selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase and other selenoproteins in Escherichia coli.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Briefly, the catalytic reduction of oxidized thioredoxin by TR is coupled with the oxidation of one molecule of NADPH. In this work, the recycling of NADP in NADPH is associated with the conversion of 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, which is visible at 410 nm. The reaction mixture was composed of 50 μg of protein extract, 0.2 mm NADPH, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA, adjusted to a total volume of 250 μl with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by the addition of 25 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid), and the production of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid was followed at 340 nm with a Fluostar reader. Enzymatic activities were expressed as nanomoles of NADPH per minute per milligram (milliunits per milligram of protein). In every enzymatic analysis, the assays were performed in duplicate in three independent experiments. Total RNAs were extracted using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey Nagel). Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using a Transcriptor high-fidelity cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science). The PCR program was 95 °C for 5 min, 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s.

https://openalex.org/W1966980676,"Ancient conserved domain protein/cyclin M (CNNM) family proteins are evolutionarily conserved Mg(2+) transporters. However, their biochemical mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we show the functional importance of the commonly conserved cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains and reveal their unique binding ability to ATP. Deletion mutants of CNNM2 and CNNM4, lacking the CBS domains, are unable to promote Mg(2+) efflux. Furthermore, the substitution of one amino acid residue in the CBS domains of CNNM2, which is associated with human hereditary hypomagnesemia, abrogates Mg(2+) efflux. Binding analyses reveal that the CBS domains of CNNM2 bind directly to ATP and not AMP in a manner dependent on the presence of Mg(2+), which is inhibited in a similar pattern by the disease-associated amino acid substitution. The requirement of Mg(2+) for these interactions is a unique feature among CBS domains, which can be explained by the presence of highly electronegative surface potentials around the ATP binding site on CNNM2. These results demonstrate that the CBS domains play essential roles in Mg(2+) efflux, probably through interactions with ATP. Interactions with ATP, which mostly forms complexes with Mg(2+) in cells, may account for the rapid Mg(2+) transport by CNNM family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2003052333,"As a novel sugar transporter family, SWEETs play important roles in plant growth and development. Here, we characterized a SWEET gene named OsSWEET5 through its overexpression in rice. Heterologous expression assay indicated that OsSWEET5 encoded a galactose transporter in yeast. OsSWEET5-overexpressing plants displayed the phenotypes of growth retardation and precocious senescence at seedling stage. GC-MS analysis showed that the sugar levels were largely altered in the leaves of the OsSWEET5-overexpressing plants. Molecular analysis revealed that these phenotypes might be due to the transcriptional changes of the genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport. In addition, the transgenic plants showed a lower level of auxin with altered transcription of genes involved in auxin signaling and translocation pathways. However, no obvious phenotype was observed between the amiRNA-OsSWEET5 transgenic lines and WT plants, which could be a result of the functional redundancy of the galactose transporters in rice. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsSWEET5 plays a crucial role in regulating the crosstalk between sugar and auxin in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2117804067,"Eukaryotic genomes contain highly variable amounts of DNA with no apparent function. This so-called junk DNA is composed of two components: repeated and repeat-derived sequences (together referred to as the repeatome), and non-annotated sequences also known as genomic dark matter. Because of their high duplication rates as compared to other genomic features, transposable elements are predominant contributors to the repeatome and the products of their decay is thought to be a major source of genomic dark matter. Determining the origin and composition of junk DNA is thus important to help understanding genome evolution as well as host biology. In this study, we have used a combination of tools enabling to show that the repeatome from the small and reducing A. thaliana genome is significantly larger than previously thought. Furthermore, we present the concepts and results from a series of innovative approaches suggesting that a significant amount of the A. thaliana dark matter is of repetitive origin. As a tentative standard for the community, we propose a deep compendium annotation of the A. thaliana repeatome that may help addressing farther genome evolution as well as transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in this model plant."

The immediate effect of UCM in the first few minutes of life and the impact on neonatal resuscitation has not been described.Women admitted to a tertiary care center and delivering before 32 weeks gestation were randomized to receive UCM or ICC. A blinded analysis of physiologic data collected on the newborns in the delivery room was performed using a data acquisition system. Heart rate (HR), SpO2, mean airway pressure (MAP), and FiO2 in the delivery room were compared between infants receiving UCM and infants with ICC.41 of 60 neonates who were enrolled and randomized had data from analog tracings at birth. 20 of these infants received UCM and 21 had ICC. Infants receiving UCM had higher heart rates and higher SpO2 over the first 5 minutes of life, were exposed to less FiO2 over the first 10 minutes of life than infants with ICC.UCM when compared to ICC had decreased need for support immediately following delivery, and in situations where resuscitation interventions were needed immediately, UCM has the advantage of being completed in a very short time to improve stability following delivery.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01434732."
https://openalex.org/W2018453517,"The oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase from Enterobacter cloacae (NR) catalyzes two-electron reduction of nitroaromatics to the corresponding nitroso compounds and, subsequently, to hydroxylamine products. NR has an unusually broad substrate repertoire, which may be related to protein dynamics (flexibility) and/or a simple non-selective kinetic mechanism. To investigate the possible role of mechanism in the broad substrate repertoire of NR, the kinetics of oxidation of NR by para-nitrobenzoic acid (p-NBA) were investigated using stopped-flow techniques at 4 °C. The results revealed a hyperbolic dependence on the p-NBA concentration with a limiting rate of 1.90 ± 0.09 s(-1), indicating one-step binding before the flavin oxidation step. There is no evidence for a distinct binding step in which specificity might be enforced. The reduction of p-NBA is rate-limiting in steady-state turnover (1.7 ± 0.3 s(-1)). The pre-steady-state reduction kinetics of NR by NADH indicate that NADH reduces the enzyme with a rate constant of 700 ± 20 s(-1) and a dissociation constant of 0.51 ± 0.04 mM. Thus, we demonstrate simple transient kinetics in both the reductive and oxidative half-reactions that help to explain the broad substrate repertoire of NR. Finally, we tested the ability of NR to reduce para-hydroxylaminobenzoic acid, demonstrating that the corresponding amine does not accumulate to significant levels even under anaerobic conditions. Thus E. cloacae NR is not a good candidate for enzymatic production of aromatic amines."
https://openalex.org/W2165289220,"A fundamental problem in fungal pathogenesis is to elucidate the evolutionary forces responsible for genomic rearrangements leading to races with fitter genotypes. Understanding the adaptive evolutionary mechanisms requires identification of genomic components and environmental factors reshaping the genome of fungal pathogens to adapt. Herein, Magnaporthe oryzae, a model fungal plant pathogen is used to demonstrate the impact of environmental cues on transposable elements (TE) based genome dynamics. For heat shock and copper stress exposed samples, eight TEs belonging to class I and II family were employed to obtain DNA profiles. Stress induced mutant bands showed a positive correlation with dose/duration of stress and provided evidences of TEs role in stress adaptiveness. Further, we demonstrate that genome dynamics differ for the type/family of TEs upon stress exposition and previous reports of stress induced MAGGY transposition has underestimated the role of TEs in M. oryzae. Here, we identified Pyret, MAGGY, Pot3, MINE, Mg-SINE, Grasshopper and MGLR3 as contributors of high genomic instability in M. oryzae in respective order. Sequencing of mutated bands led to the identification of LTR-retrotransposon sequences within regulatory regions of psuedogenes. DNA transposon Pot3 was identified in the coding regions of chromatin remodelling protein containing tyrosinase copper-binding and PWWP domains. LTR-retrotransposons Pyret and MAGGY are identified as key components responsible for the high genomic instability and perhaps these TEs are utilized by M. oryzae for its acclimatization to adverse environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate how common field stresses change genome dynamics of pathogen and provide perspective to explore the role of TEs in genome adaptability, signalling network and its impact on the virulence of fungal pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2050445464,"The SOS response to DNA damage that induces up to 10% of the prokaryotic genome requires RecA action to relieve LexA transcriptional repression. In Acinetobacter species, which lack LexA, the error-prone polymerase accessory UmuDAb is instead required for ddrR induction after DNA damage, suggesting it might be a LexA analog. RNA-Seq experiments defined the DNA damage transcriptome (mitomycin C-induced) of wild type, recA and umuDAb mutant strains of both A. baylyi ADP1 and A. baumannii ATCC 17978. Of the typical SOS response genes, few were differentially regulated in these species; many were repressed or absent. A striking 38.4% of all ADP1 genes, and 11.4% of all 17978 genes, were repressed under these conditions. In A. baylyi ADP1, 66 genes (2.0% of the genome), including a CRISPR/Cas system, were DNA damage-induced, and belonged to four regulons defined by differential use of recA and umuDAb. In A. baumannii ATCC 17978, however, induction of 99% of the 152 mitomycin C-induced genes depended on recA, and only 28 of these genes required umuDAb for their induction. 90% of the induced A. baumannii genes were clustered in three prophage regions, and bacteriophage particles were observed after mitomycin C treatment. These prophages encoded esvI, esvK1, and esvK2, ethanol-stimulated virulence genes previously identified in a Caenorhabditis elegans model, as well as error-prone polymerase alleles. The induction of all 17978 error-prone polymerase alleles, whether prophage-encoded or not, was recA dependent, but only these DNA polymerase V-related genes were de-repressed in the umuDAb mutant in the absence of DNA damage. These results suggest that both species possess a robust and complex DNA damage response involving both recA-dependent and recA-independent regulons, and further demonstrates that although umuDAb has a specialized role in repressing error-prone polymerases, additional regulators likely participate in these species' transcriptional response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2152928287,"Strategies to stimulate revascularization are valuable for cardiovascular diseases. Here we identify neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF)/epidermacan as a secreted molecule that is up-regulated in endothelial cells in ischemic limbs of mice. NDNF was secreted from cultured human endothelial cells, and its secretion was stimulated by hypoxia. NDNF promoted endothelial cell network formation and survival in vitro through activation of Akt/endothelial NOS (eNOS) signaling involving integrin αvβ3. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NDNF in endothelial cells led to reduction of cellular responses and basal Akt signaling. Intramuscular overexpression of NDNF led to enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary density in ischemic limbs of mice, which was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. The stimulatory actions of NDNF on perfusion recovery in ischemic muscles of mice were abolished by eNOS deficiency or NOS inhibition. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated reduction of NDNF in muscles of mice resulted in reduction of perfusion recovery and phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in response to ischemia.

https://openalex.org/W2064632910,"Ferrets are widely used to study human influenza virus infection. Their airway physiology and cell receptor distribution makes them ideal for the analysis of pathogenesis and virus transmission, and for testing the efficacy of anti-influenza interventions and vaccines. The 2009 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1pdm09) induces mild to moderate respiratory disease in infected ferrets, following inoculation with 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) of virus. We have demonstrated that reducing the challenge dose to 102 pfu delays the onset of clinical signs by 1 day, and results in a modest reduction in clinical signs, and a less rapid nasal cavity innate immune response. There was also a delay in virus production in the upper respiratory tract, this was up to 9-fold greater and virus shedding was prolonged. Progression of infection to the lower respiratory tract was not noticeably delayed by the reduction in virus challenge. A dose of 104 pfu gave an infection that was intermediate between those of the 106 pfu and 102 pfu doses. To address the hypothesis that using a more authentic low challenge dose would facilitate a more sensitive model for antiviral efficacy, we used the well-known neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. Oseltamivir-treated and untreated ferrets were challenged with high (106 pfu) and low (102 pfu) doses of influenza H1N1pdm09 virus. The low dose treated ferrets showed significant delays in innate immune response and virus shedding, delayed onset of pathological changes in the nasal cavity, and reduced pathological changes and viral RNA load in the lung, relative to untreated ferrets. Importantly, these observations were not seen in treated animals when the high dose challenge was used. In summary, low dose challenge gives a disease that more closely parallels the disease parameters of human influenza infection, and provides an improved pre-clinical model for the assessment of influenza therapeutics, and potentially, influenza vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2006066120,"Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), the most abundant lignan in flaxseed, is metabolized by the ruminal microbiota into enterolignans, which are strong antioxidants. Enterolactone (EL), the main mammalian enterolignan produced in the rumen, is transferred into physiological fluids, with potentially human health benefits with respect to menopausal symptoms, hormone-dependent cancers, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and diabetes. However, no information exists to our knowledge on bacterial taxa that play a role in converting plant lignans into EL in ruminants. In order to investigate this, eight rumen cannulated cows were used in a double 4 × 4 Latin square design and fed with four treatments: control with no flax meal (FM), or 5%, 10% and 15% FM (on a dry matter basis). Concentration of EL in the rumen increased linearly with increasing FM inclusion. Total rumen bacterial 16S rRNA concentration obtained using Q-PCR did not differ among treatments. PCR-T-RFLP based dendrograms revealed no global clustering based on diet indicating between animal variation. PCR-DGGE showed a clustering by diet effect within four cows that had similar basal ruminal microbiota. DNA extracted from bands present following feeding 15% FM and absent with no FM supplementation were sequenced and it showed that many genera, in particular Prevotella spp., contributed to the metabolism of lignans. A subsequent in vitro study using selected pure cultures of ruminal bacteria incubated with SDG indicated that 11 ruminal bacteria were able to convert SDG into secoisolariciresinol (SECO), with Prevotella spp. being the main converters. These data suggest that Prevotella spp. is one genus playing an important role in the conversion of plant lignans to human health beneficial antioxidants in the rumen."
https://openalex.org/W2091636880,"The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is due in part to interactions between the immune system, genetics, the environment, and endogenous microbiota. Gonadal sex hormones (GSH), such as estrogen, are thought to be involved in the development of IBD as variations in disease severity occur during pregnancy, menopause, or oral contraceptives use. In certain strains of mice, infection with Helicobacter hepaticus triggers IBD-like mucosal inflammation that is more severe in female mice than in males, suggesting a role for GSH in this model. To determine the role of estrogen signaling in microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation, estrogen receptor (ER) α and β knock-out (KO) mice, ER agonists, and adoptive transfers were utilized. We demonstrate that, when signaling is limited to ERβ on a non-CD4+ cell subset, disease is less severe and this correlates with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators."

Herein we investigate the effects of both VIP analogues on cell viability, membrane integrity, and ultrastructure of various bacterial strains and Leishmania species. We found that the two VIP derivatives kill various non-pathogenic and pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as the parasite Leishmania major through a mechanism that depends on the interaction with certain components of the microbial surface, the formation of pores, and the disruption of the surface membrane. The cytotoxicity of the VIP derivatives is specific for pathogens, because they do not affect the viability of mammalian cells. Docking simulations indicate that the chemical changes made in the analogues are critical to increase their antimicrobial activities. Consequently, we found that the native VIP is less potent as an antibacterial and fails as a leishmanicidal. Noteworthy from a therapeutic point of view is that treatment with both derivatives increases the survival and reduces bacterial load and inflammation in mice with polymicrobial sepsis. Moreover, treatment with VIP51(6–30) is very effective at reducing lesion size and parasite burden in a model of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

https://openalex.org/W2168334893,"Pyropia has a unique heteromorphic life cycle with alternation stages between thallus and conchocelis, which lives at different water temperatures in different seasons. To better understand the different adaptation strategies for temperature stress, we tried to observe comparative biochemical changes of Pyropia haitanensis based on a short term heat shock model. The results showed that: (1) At normal temperature, free-living conchocelis contains significantly higher levels of H2O2, fatty acid-derived volatiles, the copy number of Phrboh and Phhsp70 genes,the activities of NADPH oxidase and floridoside than those in thallus. The released H2O2 and NADPH oxidase activity of conchocelis were more than 7 times higher than those of thallus. The copy number of Phrboh in conchocelis was 32 times that in thallus. (2) After experiencing heat shock at 35°C for 30 min, the H2O2 contents, the mRNA levels of Phrboh and Phhsp70, NADPH oxidase activity and the floridoside content in thallus were all significantly increased. The mRNA levels of Phrboh increased 5.78 times in 5 min, NADPH oxidase activity increased 8.45 times in 20 min. (3) Whereas, in conchocelis, the changes in fatty acids and their down-stream volatiles predominated, significantly increasing levels of saturated fatty acids and decreasing levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids occurred, and the 8-carbon volatiles were accumulated. However, the changes in H2O2 content and expression of oxidant-related genes and enzymatic activity were not obvious. Overall, these results indicate that conchocelis maintains a high level of active protective apparatus to endure its survival at high temperature, while thallus exhibit typical stress responses to heat shock. It is concluded that Pyropia haitanensis has evolved a delicate strategy for temperature adaptation for its heteromorphic life cycle."

Methods Vaginal tissue was collected from virgin (n = 3), parous (n = 6) and pregnant sheep (n = 6; mean gestation; 132 d; term = 145 d). Tissue histology was analyzed using H+E and Masson's Trichrome staining. Biochemical analysis of the extracellular matrix proteins used a hydroxyproline assay to quantify total collagen, SDS PAGE to measure collagen III/I+III ratios, dimethylmethylene blue to quantify glycosaminoglycans and amino acid analysis to quantify elastin. Uniaxial tensiometry was used to determine the Young's modulus, maximum stress and strain, and permanent strain following cyclic loading. Results Vaginal tissue of virgin sheep had the lowest total collagen content and permanent strain. Parous tissue had the highest total collagen and lowest elastin content with concomitant high maximum stress. In contrast, pregnant sheep had the highest elastin and lowest collagen contents, and thickest smooth muscle layer, which was associated with low maximum stress and poor dimensional recovery following repetitive loading. Conclusion Pregnant ovine vagina was the most extensible, but the weakest tissue, whereas parous and virgin tissues were strong and elastic. Pregnancy had the greatest impact on tissue composition and biomechanical properties, compatible with significant tissue remodeling as demonstrated in other species. Biochemical changes in tissue protein composition coincide with these altered biomechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2027566989,"Background Olive trees (Olea europaea subsp. europaea var. europaea) naturally grow in areas spanning the Mediterranean basin and towards the East, including the Middle East. In the Iranian plateau, the presence of olives has been documented since very ancient times, though the early history of the crop in this area is shrouded in uncertainty. Methods The varieties presently cultivated in Iran and trees of an unknown cultivation status, surviving under extreme climate and soil conditions, were sampled from different provinces and compared with a set of Mediterranean cultivars. All samples were analyzed using SSR and chloroplast markers to establish the relationships between Iranian olives and Mediterranean varieties, to shed light on the origins of Iranian olives and to verify their contribution to the development of the current global olive variation. Results Iranian cultivars and ecotypes, when analyzed using SSR markers, clustered separately from Mediterranean cultivars and showed a high number of private alleles, on the contrary, they shared the same single chlorotype with the most widespread varieties cultivated in the Mediterranean. Conclusion We hypothesized that Iranian and Mediterranean olive trees may have had a common origin from a unique center in the Near East region, possibly including the western Iranian area. The present pattern of variation may have derived from different environmental conditions, distinct levels and selection criteria, and divergent breeding opportunities found by Mediterranean and Iranian olives.These unexpected findings emphasize the importance of studying the Iranian olive germplasm as a promising but endangered source of variation."
https://openalex.org/W2058571654,"The jaguar, Panthera onca, is a top predator with the extant population found within the Brazilian Caatinga biome now known to be on the brink of extinction. Designing new conservation units and potential corridors are therefore crucial for the long-term survival of the species within the Caatinga biome. Thus, our aims were: 1) to recognize suitable areas for jaguar occurrence, 2) to delineate areas for jaguar conservation (PJCUs), 3) to design corridors among priority areas, and 4) to prioritize PJCUs. A total of 62 points records of jaguar occurrence and 10 potential predictors were analyzed in a GIS environment. A predictive distributional map was obtained using Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) as performed by the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) algorithm. Areas equal to or higher than the median suitability value of 0.595 were selected as of high suitability for jaguar occurrence and named as Priority Jaguar Conservation Units (PJCU). Ten PJCUs with sizes varying from 23.6 km2 to 4,311.0 km2 were identified. Afterwards, we combined the response curve, as generated by SDM, and expert opinions to create a permeability matrix and to identify least cost corridors and buffer zones between each PJCU pair. Connectivity corridors and buffer zone for jaguar movement included an area of 8.884,26 km2 and the total corridor length is about 160.94 km. Prioritizing criteria indicated the PJCU representing c.a. 68.61% of the total PJCU area (PJCU # 1) as of high priority for conservation and connectivity with others PJCUs (PJCUs # 4, 5 and 7) desirable for the long term survival of the species. In conclusion, by using the jaguar as a focal species and combining SDM and expert opinion we were able to create a valid framework for practical conservation actions at the Caatinga biome. The same approach could be used for the conservation of other carnivores."

https://openalex.org/W2039344551,"Pathogen recognition by the innate immune system initiates the production of proinflammatory cytokines but can also lead to programmed host cell death. Necroptosis, a caspase-independent cell death pathway, can contribute to the host defense against pathogens or cause damage to host tissues. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP1) is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates inflammatory and necroptotic responses. To investigate the mechanisms of RIP1-mediated activation of immune cells, we established a genetic screen on the basis of RIP1-mediated necroptosis in wild-derived MOLF/EiJ mice, which diverged from classical laboratory mice over a million years ago. When compared with C57BL/6, MOLF/EiJ macrophages were resistant to RIP1-mediated necroptosis induced by Toll-like receptors. Using a forward genetic approach in a backcross panel of mice, we identified cylindromatosis (CYLD), a deubiquitinase known to act directly on RIP1 and promote necroptosis in TNF receptor signaling, as the gene conferring the trait. We demonstrate that CYLD is required for Toll-like receptor-induced necroptosis and describe a novel mechanism by which CYLD is down-regulated at the transcriptional level in MOLF/EiJ macrophages to confer protection from necroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2000947415,"The pluripotent state of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by a network of specific transcription factors. Recent studies also suggested the significant contribution of mitochondria on the regulation of pluripotent stem cells. However, the molecules involved in these regulations are still unknown.In this study, we found that prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a pleiotrophic factor mainly localized in mitochondria, is a crucial regulatory factor for the homeostasis and differentiation of ES cells. PHB2 was highly expressed in undifferentiated mouse ES cells, and the expression was decreased during the differentiation of ES cells. Knockdown of PHB2 induced significant apoptosis in pluripotent ES cells, whereas enhanced expression of PHB2 contributed to the proliferation of ES cells. However, enhanced expression of PHB2 strongly inhibited ES cell differentiation into neuronal and endodermal cells. Interestingly, only PHB2 with intact mitochondrial targeting signal showed these specific effects on ES cells. Moreover, overexpression of PHB2 enhanced the processing of a dynamin-like GTPase (OPA1) that regulates mitochondrial fusion and cristae remodeling, which could induce partial dysfunction of mitochondria.Our results suggest that PHB2 is a crucial mitochondrial regulator for homeostasis and lineage-specific differentiation of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008442038,"Telomere maintenance can occur in the presence of telomerase or in its absence, termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). ALT adds telomere repeats using recombination-based processes and DNA repair proteins that function in homologous recombination. Our previous work reported that the RecQ-like BLM helicase is required for ALT and that it unwinds telomeric substrates in vitro. WRN is also a RecQ-like helicase that shares many biochemical functions with BLM. WRN interacts with BLM, unwinds telomeric substrates, and co-localizes to ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), suggesting that it may also be required for ALT processes. Using long-term siRNA knockdown of WRN in three ALT cell lines, we show that some, but not all, cell lines require WRN for telomere maintenance. VA-13 cells require WRN to prevent telomere loss and for the formation of APBs; Saos-2 cells do not. A third ALT cell line, U-2 OS, requires WRN for APB formation, however WRN loss results in p53-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of WRN and p53, U-2 OS cells undergo telomere loss for an intermediate number of population doublings (50–70), at which point they maintain telomere length even with the continued loss of WRN. WRN and the tumor suppressor BRCA1 co-localize to APBs in VA-13 and U-2 OS, but not in Saos-2 cells. WRN loss in U-2 OS is associated with a loss of BRCA1 from APBs. While the loss of WRN significantly increases telomere sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) in these three ALT cell lines, loss of both BRCA1 and WRN does not significantly alter T-SCE. This work demonstrates that ALT cell lines use different telomerase-independent maintenance mechanisms that variably require the WRN helicase and that some cells can switch from one mechanism to another that permits telomere elongation in the absence of WRN. Our data suggest that BRCA1 localization may define these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2047904921,"Melanocytic nevi are benign proliferations that sometimes turn into malignant melanoma in a way that is still unclear from the biochemical and genetic point of view. Diagnostic and prognostic tools are then mostly based on dermoscopic examination and morphological analysis of histological tissues. To investigate the role of mechanics and geometry in the morpholgical dynamics of melanocytic nevi, we study a computation model for cell proliferation in a layered non-linear elastic tissue. Numerical simulations suggest that the morphology of the nevus is correlated to the initial location of the proliferating cell starting the growth process and to the mechanical properties of the tissue. Our results also support that melanocytes are subject to compressive stresses that fluctuate widely in the nevus and depend on the growth stage. Numerical simulations of cells in the epidermis releasing matrix metalloproteinases display an accelerated invasion of the dermis by destroying the basal membrane. Moreover, we suggest experimentally that osmotic stress and collagen inhibit growth in primary melanoma cells while the effect is much weaker in metastatic cells. Knowing that morphological features of nevi might also reflect geometry and mechanics rather than malignancy could be relevant for diagnostic purposes."

While read mapping tools have been continually improved to enable the processing of the increasing number of reads generated by NGS technologies, analysis and visualization tools are struggling with the amount of data they are presented with. Current tools are capable of handling at most two to three datasets simultaneously before they are limited by available memory or due to processing overhead. In order to process fifteen transcriptome sequencing experiments of Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 obtained in a previous study, we developed TraV, a RNA-Seq analysis and visualization tool.

We investigated long-term effects of a prepuberal, subchronic 5-HT7-R agonist (LP-211) on adult behaviour, amino acids and synaptic markers in a model for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Naples High Excitability rats (NHE) and their Random Bred controls (NRB) were daily treated with LP-211 in the 5th and 6th postnatal week. One month after treatment, these rats were tested for indices of activity, non selective (NSA), selective spatial attention (SSA) and emotionality. The quantity of L-Glutamate (L-Glu), L-Aspartate (L-Asp) and L-Leucine (L-Leu), dopamine transporter (DAT), NMDAR1 subunit and CAMKIIα, were assessed in prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS), for their role in synaptic transmission, neural plasticity and information processing. Prepuberal LP-211 (at lower dose) reduced horizontal activity and (at higher dose) increased SSA, only for NHE but not in NRB rats. Prepuberal LP-211 increased, in NHE rats, L-Glu in the PFC and L-Asp in the VS (at 0.250 mg/kg dose), whereas (at 0.125 mg/kg dose) it decreased L-Glu and L-Asp in the DS. The L-Glu was decreased, at 0.125 mg/kg, only in the VS of NRB rats. The DAT levels were decreased with the 0.125 mg/kg dose (in the PFC), and increased with the 0.250 mg/kg dose (in the VS), significantly for NHE rats. The basal NMDAR1 level was higher in the PFC of NHE than NRB rats; LP-211 treatment (at 0.125 mg/kg dose) decreased NMDAR1 in the VS of NRB rats. This study represents a starting point about the impact of developmental 5-HT7-R activation on neuro-physiology of attentive processes, executive functions and their neural substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2095068829,"Limited prospective data are available on the importance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria in the prediction of all-cause mortality (ACM) in community-based elderly populations. We examined the relationship between GFR or proteinuria and ACM in 949 randomly selected community-dwelling elderly subjects (aged ≥65 years) over a 5-year period. A spot urine sample was used to measure proteinuria by the dipstick test, and GFR was estimated using the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Information about mortality and causes of death was collected by direct enquiry with the subjects and from the national mortality data. Compared to subjects without proteinuria, those with proteinuria of grade ≥1+ had a 1.725-fold (1.134–2.625) higher risk of ACM. Compared to subjects with GFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2, those with GFR<45 ml/min/1.73 m2 had a 2.357 -fold (1.170–4.750) higher risk for ACM. Among the 403 subjects included in the analysis of renal progression, the annual rate of GFR change during follow-up period was −0.52±2.35 ml/min/1.73 m2/year. The renal progression rate was 7.315-fold (1.841–29.071) higher in subjects with GFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 than in those with GFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2.

https://openalex.org/W2330474548,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G is a scaffold protein that organizes the assembly of those initiation factors needed to recruit the 40 S ribosomal subunit to an mRNA. Plants, like many eukaryotes, express two eIF4G isoforms. eIFiso4G, one of the isoforms specific to plants, is unique among eukaryotic eIF4G proteins in that it is highly divergent and unusually small in size, raising the possibility of functional specialization. In this study, the role of eIFiso4G in plant growth was investigated using null mutants for the eIF4G isoforms in Arabidopsis. eIFiso4G loss of function mutants exhibited smaller cell, leaf, plant size, and biomass accumulation that correlated with its reduced photosynthetic activity, phenotypes not observed with the eIF4G loss of function mutant. Although no change in photorespiration or dark respiration was observed in the eIFiso4G loss of function mutant, a reduction in chlorophyll levels and an increase in the level of nonphotochemical quenching were observed. An increase in xanthophyll cycle activity and the generation of reactive oxygen species contributed to the qE and qI components of nonphotochemical quenching, respectively. An increase in the transcript and protein levels of violaxanthin de-epoxidase in the eIFiso4G loss of function mutant and an increase in its xanthophyll de-epoxidation state correlated with the higher qE associated with loss of eIFiso4G expression. These observations indicate that eIFiso4G expression is required to regulate violaxanthin de-epoxidase expression and to support photosynthetic activity."

Survival rate and serum alanine aminotransferase were observed. IRI was assessed by hepatic pathologic alterations, apoptosis and necrosis. Regeneration response was detected by mitotic index, BrdU incorporation and PCNA, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E expression. The expression of mTOR, AKT, ERK, JNK2 and p70S6K, also involved in regeneration signaling pathways, were analyzed as well.30% partial liver graft resulted in a significantly low 7-day survival rate (P = 0.002) with no marked difference in tissue injury compared with the 50% partial graft group. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were not significantly different between partial transplantation and full-size transplantation. Western blot analysis of caspase-3 and TUNEL staining also indicated no significant difference in apoptosis response between 30% partial transplantation and half-size or full-size transplantation (P = 0.436, P = 0.113, respectively). However, liver regeneration response indicators, mitotic index (P<0.0001) and BrdU (P = 0.0022), were markedly lower in 30% LTx compared with 50% LTx. Suppressed expression of PCNA, cyclin D1, cyclin E, mTOR, JNK2, AKT, ERK and p70S6K was also detected by western blot.Liver regeneration is markedly suppressed in SFSS, and is more likely the primary cause of SFSS, rather than ischemia/reperfusion injury.

https://openalex.org/W2046442217,"Background and Purpose A high risk of stroke occurrence has been reported in several types of irradiated cancer patients. However, clinical data are lacking in irradiated lung cancer patients. The present study intended to explore a risk level of ischemic stroke occurrence in irradiated lung cancer patients. Methods A nationwide population-based database obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance was analyzed. Between 2003 and 2006, we recruited 560 resected lung cancer patients into two study groups: surgery-plus-irradiation (n = 112) and surgery-alone (n = 448). Patients treated with chemotherapy were excluded. Propensity score match was used for pairing cases with a ratio of 1∶4. Two-year ischemic-stroke-free survival was defined as the primary endpoint. Results Three observations supported a high risk of ischemic stroke occurrence in patients with postoperative irradiation when compared with those patients with surgery alone: first, a high incidence per 1,000 person-year (22.3 versus 11.2, 1.99 folds); second, a low two-year ischemic-stroke-free survival rate (92.2% versus 98.1%, P = 0.019); and third, a high adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.44–12.22; P = 0.009). More notably, the highest risk of ischemic stroke occurrence was found in irradiated patients who had diabetes mellitus (HR, 34.74; 95% CI, 6.35->100; P<0.0001). Conclusions A high incidence of ischemic stroke was observed in irradiated lung cancer patients, especially in those with diabetes mellitus. For these patients, close clinical surveillance and strict diabetes control should be considered. Further studies to define detail biological mechanisms are encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2074182278,"Derived members of the endoparasitic order Strepsiptera have acquired an extreme form of sexual dimorphism whereby males undergo metamorphosis and exist as free-living adults while females remain larviform, reaching sexual maturity within their hosts. Expression of the transcription factor, broad (br) has been shown to be required for pupal development in insects in which both sexes progress through metamorphosis. A surge of br expression appears in the last larval instar, as the epidermis begins pupal development. Here we ask if br is also up-regulated in the last larval instar of male Xenos vesparum Rossi (Stylopidae), and whether such expression is lost in neotenic larviform females. We clone three isoforms of br from X. vesparum (Xv'br), and show that they share greatest similarity to the Z1, Z3 and Z4 isoforms of other insect species. By monitoring Xv'br expression throughout development, we detect elevated levels of total br expression and the Xv'Z1, Xv'Z3, and Xv'Z4 isoforms in the last larval instar of males, but not females. By focusing on Xv'br expression in individual samples, we show that the levels of Xv'BTB and Xv'Z3 in the last larval instar of males are bimodal, with some males expressing 3X greater levels of Xv'br than fourth instar femlaes. Taken together, these data suggest that neoteny (and endoparasitism) in females of Strepsiptera Stylopidia could be linked to the suppression of pupal determination. Our work identifies a difference in metamorphic gene expression that is associated with neoteny, and thus provides insights into the relationship between metamorphic and neotenic development."

Several PIs exhibit isoform selectivity with little effect on GLUT1. The ability to target individual GLUT isoforms in an acute and reversible manner provides novel means both to investigate the contribution of individual GLUTs to health and disease and to develop targeted treatment of glucose-dependent diseases. To determine the molecular basis of transport inhibition, a series of chimeric proteins containing transmembrane and cytosolic domains from GLUT1 and GLUT4 and/or point mutations were generated and expressed in HEK293 cells. Structural integrity was confirmed via measurement of N-[2-[2-[2-[(N-biotinylcaproylamino)ethoxy)ethoxyl]-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzoyl]-1,3-bis(mannopyranosyl-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) labeling of the chimeric proteins in low density microsome fractions isolated from stably transfected 293 cells. Functional integrity was assessed via measurement of zero-trans 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake. ATB-BMPA labeling studies and 2-DOG uptake revealed that transmembrane helices 1 and 5 contain amino acid residues that influence inhibitor access to the transporter binding domain. Substitution of Thr-30 and His-160 in GLUT1 to the corresponding positions in GLUT4 is sufficient to completely transform GLUT1 into GLUT4 with respect to indinavir inhibition of 2-DOG uptake and ATB-BMPA binding. These data provide a structural basis for the selectivity of PIs toward GLUT4 over GLUT1 that can be used in ongoing novel drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1991864462,"Many plant populations have adapted to local soil conditions. However, the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is often overlooked in this context. Only a few studies have used reciprocal transplant experiments to study the relationships between soil conditions, mycorrhizal colonisation and plant growth. Furthermore, most of the studies were conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions. However, long-term field experiments can provide more realistic insights into this issue. We conducted a five-year field reciprocal transplant experiment to study the relationships between soil conditions, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth in the obligate mycotrophic herb Aster amellus. We conducted this study in two regions in the Czech Republic that differ significantly in their soil nutrient content, namely Czech Karst (region K) and Ceske Stredohori (region S). Plants that originated from region S had significantly higher mycorrhizal colonisation than plants from region K, indicating that the percentage of mycorrhizal colonisation has a genetic basis. We found no evidence of local adaptation in Aster amellus. Instead, plants from region S outperformed the plants from region K in both target regions. Similarly, plants from region S showed more mycorrhizal colonisation in all cases, which was likely driven by the lower nutrient content in the soil from that region. Thus, plant aboveground biomass and mycorrhizal colonisation exhibited corresponding differences between the two target regions and regions of origin. Higher mycorrhizal colonisation in the plants from region with lower soil nutrient content (region S) in both target regions indicates that mycorrhizal colonisation is an adaptive trait. However, lower aboveground biomass in the plants with lower mycorrhizal colonisation suggests that the plants from region K are in fact maladapted by their low inherent mycorrhizal colonization. We conclude that including mycorrhizal symbiosis in local adaptation studies may increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which plants adapt to their environment."

These immature DCs are able of efficient taking up and processing various antigens. Upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines or microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of bacteria, immature DCs undergo a maturation process and begin to migrate to local lymph nodes, where they interact with CD40 ligand on antigen specific T cells via CD40 and mature into potent immuno-stimulatory or immuno-tolerogenic cells (2Chomarat P.

Nevertheless, the key transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying human monocytes to DCs differentiation remain poorly understood.

Initially identified as a novel LEF/TCF associated antagonist of the canonical Wnt signaling through reverse genetic modeling of Xenopus embryogenesis, VentX was found to be a transcriptional activator of the p53/p21 and p16ink4a/Rb tumor suppression pathways (18Gao H.

In our current study, we provided evidence showing that VentX regulated DC differentiation and maturation through an IL6 mediated mechanism. The clinical importance of the findings was revealed by the elevated expression of VentX in DCs isolated from inflamed mucosa of IBD patients, and that VentX is a downstream target of corticosteroid treatment. Our data suggest that VentX is a key regulator of DC differentiation and maturation and may serve as a target of intervention for inflammatory disorders and immune therapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adult donors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. CD14+ monocytes were purified from PBMCs using anti-CD14 antibody-coated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Monocytes were cultured in 12-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), GM-CSF (100 ng/ml), and IL4 (20 ng/ml) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Cytokines were added to cultures every 2 or 3 days for a total of 5 days to induce dendritic cell differentiation. Neutralizing antibody against IL6 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at a daily dose of 2.5 μg/ml. Intestinal mucosa was obtained from surgically resected specimens from patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Specimens were taken from both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa and were confirmed macroscopically and microscopically. Lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated using previously described techniques (20Kamada N. Hisamatsu T. Okamoto S. Chinen H. Kobayashi T. Sato T. Sakuraba A. Kitazume M.T. Sugita A. Koganei K.

LPDCs were purified as the fraction of CD19−CD1c+ cells with magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). To promote maturation of DCs, 100 ng/ml of Escherichia coli LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium and further cultured for 24 h. Experiments with human materials were performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the institutional review committee of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Human primary monocytes were transfected with Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides using the Human Monocyte Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 × 106 monocytes were resuspended into 100 μl of nucleofector solution with 2.5 nmol of either VentX MO oligonucleotides (VentX MO: 5′-TACTCAACCCTGACATAGAGGGTAA-3′ or VentX MO-2: 5′-GAGCCCGGTTTGCATACACGGCTAA-3′) or a standard control MO oligonucleotides and electroporated with the Nucleofector II Device (Lonza). Cells were then immediately removed from the device and incubated overnight with 1 ml of pre-warmed Human Monocyte Nucleofector Medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. Cells were then resuspended into complete RPMI medium and treated with appropriate cytokines to induce differentiation into DCs. All the MO oligonucleotides were ordered from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). LPDCs were transfected with siRNA targeting VentX as described in our previous study (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Knockdown of IκBα expression in THP1 cells was achieved through electroporation transfection of SignalSilence® IκBα siRNA I from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Human monocytic leukemia cell line THP1 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). The doxycycline inducible retroviruses expressing GFP.VentX or GFP have been described in our previous study (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The THP1 cell line conditionally expressing GFP.VentX was generated through co-transduction of pRetroX-GFP.VentX and pRetroX-Tet-On Advanced retroviruses and GFP.VentX-positive cells were sorted by FACSAria high-speed sorter (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) after incubation with 1.0 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility). Sorted cells were then maintained in RPMI 1640 medium in the absence of doxycycline. The THP1 cell line conditionally expressing GFP was generated similarly as a control. To induce differentiation of THP1 cells toward DCs, cells were treated with the cytokines mixture as described previously (22Berges C. Naujokat C. Tinapp S. Wieczorek H. Höh A. Sadeghi M. Opelz G. Daniel V. A cell line model for the differentiation of human dendritic cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cell were grown in 12-well plate in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 ng/ml GM-CSF, 50 ng/ml IL4, and TNF-α, 100 ng/ml ionomycin for 2 days. Under this sub-optimal condition, only mild DCs differentiation was observed in GFP-expressing THP1 cells, which allowed us to determine the effect of VentX expression on the DCs differentiation in this model cell line. Phenotypic analyses of DCs and THP1 cells were performed with flow cytometry after immunostaining of cells with fluorescence dye conjugated antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). The following FITC or PE conjugated antibodies were used: anti-CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD11c, CD14, CD16, CD36, CD40, CD64, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD116, CCR7, HLA-DR, TLR2, and TLR4. Intracellular staining of CCL3, CCL5, IL6 and IL12, p70, and TNFα were performed with PE-conjugated antibodies following the protocol provided by manufacture. Isotope control staining was performed in parallel for all experiments and used for gating. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Stained cells were analyzed with FACScan flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using FlowJo software. Results are expressed as the percentage of positive cells or mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values after subtraction of the MFI obtained from the isotype control antibody. The −592 bp fragment of human IL6 promoter region was amplified with forward primer: 5′- GTAACGCGTTTCTACAACAGCCGCTCACAG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GATAGAGCTTCTCTTTCGTTC-3′. The −225 bp and −80 bp promoters were amplified with the same reverse primer and the following forward primers respectively: 5′-GTAACGCGTCAATGACGACCTAAGCTGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTAACGCGTGTGGGATTTTCCCATGAGTC-3′. The amplified products were digested with restriction enzymes Mlu I and XhoI, and digested fragments were subsequently cloned into pGL3 luciferase reporter. Transfection of reporter plasmid with pcDNA-VentX plasmid or control pcDNA-GFP plasmid into primary monocytes was carried out through electroporation. Reporter plasmid was also transfected into U2OS cells, which stably express tetracycline-inducible VentX (19Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Hager M. Xiao S. Freeman M.R. Zhu Z. VentX trans-activates p53 and p16ink4a to regulate cellular senescence.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12693-12701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and reporter activity was evaluated in the absence or presence of tetracycline. 10 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid was included for each transfection to normalize reporter activity. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection or addition of tetracycline and analyzed with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutation of NFκB binding site of luciferase reporters was achieved through QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (Santa Clara, CA).The wild type NFκB binding sequence 5′-GGGATTTTCC-3′ was mutated to 5′-GGGATTTTAG-3′ as reported previously (23Grassl C. Luckow B. Schlöndorff D. Dendorfer U. Transcriptional regulation of the interleukin-6 gene in mesangial cells.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1466-1477PubMed Google Scholar). THP1 cell lines conditionally expressing GFP or GFP.VentX were employed to detect if VentX expression impairs the NFκB binding to IL6 promoter region. Cells were treated with 1.0 μg/ml doxycycline for 2 days and harvested for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. The ChIP procedure was performed with SimpleChIP® Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit from Cell Signaling following the manufacturer's instructions. The NFκB/p65 antibody (Cell Signaling) was used for the immunoprecipitation. Human IL6 promoter region containing the NFκB binding site was amplified by quantitative PCR with forward primer: 5′-GGACGTCACATTGCACAATC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GCCTCAGACATCTCCAGTCC-3′. The dendritic cells migration assay was performed with CytoSelect™ 24-Well Cell Migration Assay kit from Cell Biolabs, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Dendritic & Antigen Presenting Cell PCR Array was purchased from SABiosciences (Valencia, CA). Real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler® (480 Real-Time PCR System; Roche). The primers used for the detection of mRNA levels of VentX, IL6, IL12, p21, c-myc, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL19, CXCL1, CXCL12, CD1a, TNFα, TLR2, and TLR4 have been shown previously (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis was conducted as described in our prior study (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against p21 and c-Myc were from Cell Signaling, and anti-VentX antibody was purchased from Abcam (Boston, MA). Mixed lymphocyte reaction was performed as described previously (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except that BrdU was added to culture to determine T cells proliferation. Incorporated BrdU was detected with PE-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody and analyzed with flow cytometry. The Student's t test was used to calculate statistical significance, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Following our recent finding that VentX is expressed in human primary monocytes (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we examined VentX expression during primary monocytes to dendritic cell differentiation induced by GM-CSF and IL-4 treatment. We found that VentX expression underwent a marked increase at both mRNA and protein levels during the induced DC differentiation (Fig. 1A). To explore potential role of VentX in DC differentiation, the effects of VentX knockdown on in vitro DCs differentiation were examined. VentX siRNA produced marginal VentX knockdown efficiency in monocytes after 5 days of transfection, whereas differentiation of DCs from monocytes in vitro requires 5∼7 days of incubation with GM-CSF and IL4 (2Chomarat P. Banchereau J. Davoust J. Palucka A.K. IL-6 switches the differentiation of monocytes from dendritic cells to macrophages.Nat.

Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). To obtain a long-lasting knockdown effect of VentX in monocytes, we developed an MO-mediated VentX knockdown strategy. Two different MO antisense oligonucleotides were designed (VentX MO and VentX MO-2) and tested for the knockdown efficiency of VentX. As shown in Fig. 1B, both MO oligonucleotides inhibited VentX expression in DCs compared with control MO 5 days after transfection. Freshly isolated CD14+CD1a− monocytes differentiate in vitro into immature CD14−CD1a+ DCs when cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 (2Chomarat P. Banchereau J. Davoust J. Palucka A.K. IL-6 switches the differentiation of monocytes from dendritic cells to macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A.

Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). We therefore examined surface expression of CD1a antigen in monocytes transfected with control MO or VentX MO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 C, transfection of VentX MO led to a substantial reduction in the percentage of CD14−CD1a+ cells (Fig. 1C) in comparison with the control MO. The surface expression of CD1b and CD1c, which are considered as additional differentiation markers of monocytes-derived DCs (2Chomarat P. Banchereau J. Davoust J. Palucka A.K. IL-6 switches the differentiation of monocytes from dendritic cells to macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A.

Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar), were similarly downregulated in VentX MO transfected cells (Fig. 1, D–E). Transfection of VentX MO did not cause excess cell death in monocytes (17Wu X. Gao H. Ke W. Giese R.W. Zhu Z. The homeobox transcription factor VentX controls human macrophage terminal differentiation and proinflammatory activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which ruled out the possibility that the decreased differentiation was due to compromised cell viability. The expression of other surface antigens such as CD16, CD36, and CD64 remained unchanged in VentX MO transfected DCs (Fig. 1F), further supporting that VentX MO transfection exerted specific effects on DC differentiation. To corroborate the role of VentX in regulating DCs differentiation, we ectopically expressed VentX in primary monocytes and determined the CD14−CD1a+ cells after 3 days of cytokines treatment. Overexpression of VentX in monocytes greatly accelerated the DCs differentiation (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these data demonstrated that VentX is a critical regulator of primary monocytes to DCs differentiation. Human monocytic cell line THP1, under appropriate differentiation conditions, can be induced to differentiate into immature and mature DCs with phenotypic and functional properties similar to those of primary DCs (22Berges C.

https://openalex.org/W2161169560,"The Traveler's Dilemma game and the Minimum Effort Coordination game are two social dilemmas that have attracted considerable attention due to the fact that the predictions of classical game theory are at odds with the results found when the games are studied experimentally. Moreover, a direct application of deterministic evolutionary game theory, as embodied in the replicator dynamics, to these games does not explain the observed behavior. In this work, we formulate natural variants of these two games as smoothed continuous-strategy games. We study the evolutionary dynamics of these continuous-strategy games, both analytically and through agent-based simulations, and show that the behavior predicted theoretically is in accord with that observed experimentally. Thus, these variants of the Traveler's Dilemma and the Minimum Effort Coordination games provide a simple resolution of the paradoxical behavior associated with the original games."
https://openalex.org/W2002853868,"Purpose To determine the time-wise effect of specific resistance training on neck pain among industrial technicians with frequent neck pain symptoms. Methods Secondary analysis of a parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 weeks performed at two large industrial production units in Copenhagen, Denmark. Women with neck pain >30 mm VAS (N = 131) were included in the present analysis. The training group (N = 77) performed specific resistance training for the neck/shoulder muscles three times a week, and the control group (N = 54) received advice to stay active. Participants of both groups registered neck pain intensity (0–100 mm VAS) once a week. Results Neck pain intensity was 55 mm (SD 23) at baseline. There was a significant group by time interaction for neck pain (F-value 2.61, P<0.001, DF = 19). Between-group differences in neck pain reached significance after 4 weeks (11 mm, 95% CI 2 to 20). The time-wise change in pain showed three phases; a rapid decrease in the training group compared with the control group during the initial 7 weeks, a slower decrease in pain during the following weeks (week 8–15), and a plateau during the last weeks (week 16–20). Adherence to training followed a two-phase pattern, i.e. weekly participation rate was between 70–86% during the initial 7 weeks, dropping towards 55–63% during the latter half of the training period. Conclusion Four weeks of specific resistance training reduced neck pain significantly, but 15 weeks is required to achieve maximal pain reduction. The time-wise change in pain followed a three-phase pattern with a rapid effect during the initial 7 weeks followed by a slower but still positive effect, and finally a plateau from week 15 and onwards. Decreased participation rate may explain the decreased efficacy during the latter phase of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1964604325,"The use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in sepsis has been shown to increase mortality and acute kidney injury. However, the knowledge of the exact mechanism by which several fluids, especially starch preparations may impair end-organ function particularly in the kidney, is still missing. The aim of this study was to measure the influence of different crystalloid and colloid fluid compositions on the inflammatory response in the kidney, the liver and the lung using a rodent model of acute endotoxemia. Rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. After one hour crystalloids [lactate-buffered (RLac) or acetate-buffered (RAc)] were infused i.v. (30 ml/kg) in all groups. At 2 hours rats either received different crystalloids (75 ml/kg of RLac or RAc) or colloids (25 ml/kg of HES in saline or HES in RAc or gelatin in saline). Expression of messenger RNA for cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), necrosis factor α (TNFα) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was assessed in kidney, liver and lung tissue by real-time PCR after 4 hours. The use of acetate-buffered solutions was associated with a significantly higher expression of CINC-1 and TNFα mRNA in the liver, in the kidney and in the lung. Only marginal effects of gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch on mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators were observed. The study provides evidence that the type of buffering agent of different colloidal and crystalloid solutions might be a crucial factor determining the extent of early end-organ inflammatory response in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W1989674433,"The C terminus of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 subunits contains several phosphorylation sites that regulate AMPAR activity and trafficking at excitatory synapses. Although many of these sites have been extensively studied, little is known about the signaling mechanisms regulating GluA1 phosphorylation at Thr-840. Here, we report that neuronal depolarization in hippocampal slices induces a calcium and protein phosphatase 1/2A-dependent dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Thr-840 and a nearby site at Ser-845. Despite these similarities, inhibitors of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and protein phosphatase 2B prevented depolarization-induced Ser-845 dephosphorylation but had no effect on Thr-840 dephosphorylation. Instead, depolarization-induced Thr-840 dephosphorylation was prevented by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels, indicating that distinct Ca(2+) sources converge to regulate GluA1 dephosphorylation at Thr-840 and Ser-845 in separable ways. Results from immunoprecipitation/depletion assays indicate that Thr-840 phosphorylation inhibits protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated increases in Ser-845 phosphorylation. Consistent with this, PKA-mediated increases in AMPAR currents, which are dependent on Ser-845 phosphorylation, were inhibited in HEK-293 cells expressing a Thr-840 phosphomimetic version of GluA1. Conversely, mimicking Ser-845 phosphorylation inhibited protein kinase C phosphorylation of Thr-840 in vitro, and PKA activation inhibited Thr-840 phosphorylation in hippocampal slices. Together, the regulation of Thr-840 and Ser-845 phosphorylation by distinct sources of Ca(2+) influx and the presence of inhibitory interactions between these sites highlight a novel mechanism for conditional regulation of AMPAR phosphorylation and function."
https://openalex.org/W1973645328,"The leucine rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like protein 1 (LRIG1) is a newly discovered negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a proposed tumor suppressor. It is not universally downregulated in human cancers, and its role in neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis is not well-documented. In this study, we show the expression of LRIG1 as a novel potential marker for neoplastic transformation in ocular-surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). The following two groups were included in this study: 1) benign group (3 cases; 1 with papilloma and 2 with dysplasia) and 2) malignant group (3 cases with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)). In both groups, immunofluorescence analysis was firstly performed for keratins 4, 12, 13, and 15 to characterize the state of differentiation, and for Ki67 to evaluate the proliferation activity. Subsequently, LRIG1 and EGFR expression was analyzed. Either keratin 4 and/or 13, both non-keratinized epithelial cell markers, were generally expressed in both groups, except for 1 severe SCC case. Keratin 15, an undifferentiated basal cell marker, was more strongly expressed in the malignant cases than in the benign cases. The Ki67 index was significantly higher (P<0.002) in the malignant group (33.2%) than in the benign group (10.9%). LRIG1 expression was limited to basal epithelial cells in normal corneal epithelial tissue. Interestingly, LRIG1 was expressed throughout the epithelium in all the benign cases. In contrast, its expression was limited or totally disappeared in the malignant cases. Inversely, EGFR staining was faintly expressed in the benign cases, yet strongly expressed in the malignant cases. Malignant tissue with proliferative potential presented EGFR overexpression and inverse downregulation of LRIG1, consistent with LRIG1 being a suppressor of neoplastic transformation by counteracting the tumor growth property of EGFR. Our findings indicate that downregulation of LRIG1 is possibly a novel potential marker of transformation and tumorigenesis in OSSN cases."

Methods Patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated either with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin (n = 37) or with pegylated interferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin (n = 33) for up to 24 weeks. Frequencies of peripheral regulatory T-cells (Tregs), programmed death-1 (PD-1) expressing CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells and toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expressing CD14+ monocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry in patients at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks following treatment and in 20 healthy controls. Results Frequencies of Tregs, PD-1 and TLR3 expressing cells were higher in patients than those in control subjects (P<0.05). Patients with complete early virological response (cEVR) showed lower Tregs, PD-1 expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells than those without cEVR at 12 weeks (P<0.05). Patients with low TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes at baseline had a high rate of cEVR (P<0.05). Conclusions Low peripheral TLR3 expressing CD14+ monocytes at baseline could serve as a predictor for cEVR of antiviral therapy in chronic HCV-infected patients. The cEVR rates were significantly increased in the patients with reduced circulating Tregs, PD-1 expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. Trial Registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR10001090."
https://openalex.org/W2070836019,"The HIV-1 pathogenicity factor Nef enhances viral replication by modulation of multiple host cell transport and signaling pathways. Nef associates with membranes via an N-terminal Src homology 4 (SH4) domain, and membrane association is believed to be essential for its biological functions. At which subcellular site(s) Nef exerts its different functions and how kinetics of membrane interactions contribute to its biological activity are unknown. To address how specific characteristics of Nef membrane association affect its biological properties, the SH4 domain of Nef was replaced by heterologous membrane targeting domains. The use of a panel of heterologous SH4 domains resulted in chimeric Nef proteins with distinct steady state subcellular localization, membrane association efficiency, and anterograde transport routes. Irrespective of these modifications, cardinal Nef functions affecting host cell vesicular transport and actin dynamics were fully preserved. In contrast, stable targeting of Nef to the surface of mitochondria, peroxisomes, or the Golgi apparatus, and thus prevention of plasma membrane delivery, caused potent and broad loss of Nef activity. These results support the concept that Nef adopts its active conformation in the membrane-associated state but exclude that membrane-associated Nef simply acts by recruiting soluble factors independently of its local microenvironment. Rather than its steady state subcellular localization or membrane affinity, the ability to undergo dynamic anterograde and internalization cycles appear to determine Nef function. These results reveal that functional membrane interactions of Nef underlie critical spatiotemporal regulation and suggest that delivery to distinct subcellular sites via such transport cycles provides the basis for the multifunctionality of Nef."
https://openalex.org/W2022307792,"The aim of this study was to isolate a glycerol-producing yeast strain from nature to prepare glycerol-enriched yeast culture (GY), and preliminarily evaluate the effects of GY on blood metabolites and ruminal fermentation in goats. During the trial, six isolates were isolated from unprocessed honey, and only two isolates with higher glycerol yield were identified by analysis of 26S ribosomal DNA sequences. One of the two isolates was identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a direct-fed microbe permitted by the FDA. This isolate was used to prepare GY. The fermentation parameters were optimized through single-factor and orthogonal design methods to maximize the glycerol yield and biomass. The final GY contained 38.7±0.6 g/L glycerol and 12.6±0.5 g/L biomass. In vivo, eight castrated male goats with ruminal fistula were used in a replicated 4×4 Latin square experiment with four consecutive periods of 15 d. Treatments were as follows: control, LGY, MGY, and HGY with 0, 100, 200, and 300 mL GY per goat per day, respectively. The GY was added in two equal portions at 08∶00 and 17∶00 through ruminal fistula. Samples of blood and ruminal fluid were collected on the last one and two days of each period, respectively. Results showed that the plasma concentrations of triglyceride and total cholesterol were not affected by the supplemented GY. Compared with the control, goats supplemented with MGY and HGY had significantly higher (P<0.05) concentrations of plasma glucose and total protein, ruminal volatile fatty acid and molar proportion of propionate, and significantly lower (P<0.05) ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen. These parameters changed linearly with increasing GY supplementation level (P<0.05). In conclusion, GY has great potential to be developed as a feed additive with dual effects of glycerol and yeast for ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W2037039833,"Activated factor XII (FXIIa) is selectively inhibited by corn Hageman factor inhibitor (CHFI) among other plasma proteases. CHFI is considered a canonical serine protease inhibitor that interacts with FXIIa through its protease-binding loop. Here we examined whether the protease-binding loop alone is sufficient for the selective inhibition of serine proteases or whether other regions of a canonical inhibitor are involved. Six CHFI mutants lacking different N- and C-terminal portions were generated. CHFI-234, which lacks the first and fifth disulfide bonds and 11 and 19 amino acid residues at the N and C termini, respectively, exhibited no significant changes in FXIIa inhibition (Ki = 3.2 ± 0.4 nm). CHFI-123, which lacks 34 amino acid residues at the C terminus and the fourth and fifth disulfide bridges, inhibited FXIIa with a Ki of 116 ± 16 nm. To exclude interactions outside the FXIIa active site, a synthetic cyclic peptide was tested. The peptide contained residues 20-45 (Protein Data Bank code 1BEA), and a C29D substitution was included to avoid unwanted disulfide bond formation between unpaired cysteines. Surprisingly, the isolated protease-binding loop failed to inhibit FXIIa but retained partial inhibition of trypsin (Ki = 11.7 ± 1.2 μm) and activated factor XI (Ki = 94 ± 11 μm). Full-length CHFI inhibited trypsin with a Ki of 1.3 ± 0.2 nm and activated factor XI with a Ki of 5.4 ± 0.2 μm. Our results suggest that the protease-binding loop is not sufficient for the interaction between FXIIa and CHFI; other regions of the inhibitor also contribute to specific inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2089424519,"Relatively few studies have investigated peripheral sweating mechanisms of long-distance runners. The aim of this study was to compare peripheral sweating mechanisms in male long-distance runners, and sedentary counterparts. Thirty six subjects, including 20 sedentary controls and 16 long-distance runners (with 7–12 years of athletic training, average 9.2±2.1 years) were observed. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) with iontophoresis (2 mA for 5 min) and 10% acetylcholine (ACh) were performed to determine axon reflex-mediated and directly activated (DIR, muscarinic receptor) sweating. Sweat onset time, sweat rate, number of activated sweat glands, sweat output per gland and skin temperature were measured at rest while maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) were measured during maximal cycling. Sweat rate, activated sweat glands, sweat output per gland, skin temperature and VO2max were significantly higher in the trained runners than in the sedentary controls. Sweat onset time was significantly shorter for the runners. In the group of long-distance runners, significant correlations were found between VO2max and sweat onset time (r2 = 0.543, P<0.01, n = 16), DIR sweat rate (r2 = 0.584, P<0.001, n = 16), sweat output per gland (r2 = 0.539, P<0.01, n = 16). There was no correlation between VO2max and activated sweat glands. These findings suggest that habitual long-distance running results in upregulation of the peripheral sweating mechanisms in humans. Additional research is needed to determine the molecular mechanism underlying these changes. These findings complement the existing sweating data in long-distance runners."
https://openalex.org/W2027791250,"In parasites, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent an important family of proteins related to drug resistance and other biological activities. Resistance of leishmanial parasites to therapeutic drugs continues to escalate in developing countries, and in many instances, it is due to overexpressed ABC efflux pumps. Progressively adapted baicalein (BLN)-resistant parasites (pB(25)R) show overexpression of a novel ABC transporter, which was classified as ABCC2 or Leishmania donovani multidrug resistance protein 2 (LdMRP2). The protein is primarily localized in the flagellar pocket region and in internal vesicles. Overexpressed LdABCC2 confers substantial BLN resistance to the parasites by rapid drug efflux. The BLN-resistant promastigotes when transformed into amastigotes in macrophage cells cannot be cured by treatment of macrophages with BLN. Amastigote resistance is concomitant with the overexpression of macrophage MRP2 transporter. Reporter analysis and site-directed mutagenesis assays demonstrated that antioxidant response element 1 is activated upon infection. The expression of this phase II detoxifying gene is regulated by NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response element activation. In view of the fact that the signaling pathway of phosphoinositol 3-kinase controls microfilament rearrangement and translocation of actin-associated proteins, the current study correlates with the intricate pathway of phosphoinositol 3-kinase-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which activates MRP2 expression in macrophages upon infection by the parasites. In contrast, phalloidin, an agent that prevents depolymerization of actin filaments, inhibits Nrf2 translocation and Mrp2 gene activation by pB(25)R infection. Taken together, these results provide insight into the mechanisms by which resistant clinical isolates of L. donovani induce intracellular events relevant to drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1982019848,"Objective Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection has been proved to be a growing public health concern. The prevalence and genotypic pattern vary with geographic locations. Limited information is available to date with regard to HCV genotype and its clinical implications among those former commercial blood donor communities. The aims of this study were to genetically define the HCV genotype and associated clinical characteristics of HIV/HCV co-infected patients from a region with commercial blood donation history in central China. Methods A cross sectional study, including 164 HIV infected subjects, was conducted in Shanxi province central China. Serum samples were collected and HCV antibody testing, AST and ALT testing were performed. Seropositive samples were further subjected to RT-PCR followed by direct sequence coupled with phylogenetic analysis of Core-E1 and NS5B regions performed in comparison with known reference genotypes. Findings A total of 139 subjects were HCV antibody positive. Genotype could be determined for 88 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant circulating subtype was HCV 1b (65.9%), followed by HCV 2a (34.1%). The HCV viral load in the subjects infected with HIV1b was significantly higher than those infected with HCV 2a (P = 0.006). No significant difference for HCV RNA level was detected between ART status, CD4+ cell count level and HIV RNA level. Serum AST and ALT level were likely to increase with HCV RNA level, although no significance was observed. Those who had conducted commercial donation later than 1991 (OR 3.43, 95% CI: 1.12–10.48) and had a short duration of donation (OR 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13–0.96) were more likely to be infected with HCV 1b. Conclusion These results suggest that HCV subtype 1b predominates in this population, and the impact of HIV status and ART on HCV disease progression is not significantly correlated."
https://openalex.org/W1973547571,"The aim of the study was to determine the distribution of different volumes of methylene blue solution injected into the epidural space in anaesthetized pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, to evaluate its cranial distribution and to compare between them. Fifteen pregnant and fifteen non-pregnant sheep were included in the study. Sheep were anaesthetized and received 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mL/kg of a lumbosacral epidural solution containing 0.12% methylene blue in 0.9% saline. Thirty minutes after the epidural injection, the ewes were euthanized. The extension of the dye within the epidural space was measured, and the correlation between the volume of the dye injected and the number of stained vertebrae was evaluated. The cranial migration of the dye between pregnant and non-pregnant sheep was also compared. The results show that the volume of methylene blue injected epidurally into pregnant and non-pregnant sheep correlated directly with its cephalic distribution into the epidural space; and a volume of 0.1 mL/kg or 0.2 mL/kg stained up to the first lumbar segment in pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, respectively. Also, the results suggest that the volume of drugs administered into the epidural space of pregnant sheep should be half the volume that would be used in non-pregnant sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2054035442,"The use of gibberellic acid (GA3) and N, N-dimethyl piperidinium chloride (DPC) in combination with prometryn would likely increase the control of black nightshade in cotton fields. Experiments were designed to investigate the physiological and biochemical responses of black nightshade at the three- to four-leaf stage to prometryn applied at different rates, either alone or in combination with GA3 or DPC, in a greenhouse environment. These studies demonstrated that prometryn applied in combination with DPC at low rates (7.2 g ai ha−1) led to increased fresh weight and visible injury of black nightshade compared with prometryn applied alone or in combination with GA3; however, at rates of 36, 180, and 900 g ai ha−1, prometryn in combination with DPC caused the least visible injury among all treatments and prometryn in combination with GA3 caused the greatest visible injury. These results suggest that black nightshade suffered more severe damage when prometryn was applied in combination with GA3, which is supported by the reduced soluble protein content, lower antioxidant enzyme activities, and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the plants treated with prometryn plus GA3. These results indicate that the application of GA3 in combination with prometryn to black nightshade may have the potential to lower the levels of prometryn tolerance in these plants."
