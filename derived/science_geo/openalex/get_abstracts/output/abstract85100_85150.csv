https://openalex.org/W1993405709,"A training procedure analogous to differential classical conditioning produces differential facilitation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP's) in the neuronal circuit for the siphon withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. Thus, tail shock (the unconditioned stimulus) produces greater facilitation of the monosynaptic EPSP from a siphon sensory neuron to a siphon motor neuron if the shock is preceded by spike activity in the sensory neuron than if the shock and spike activity occur in a specifically unpaired pattern or if the shock occurs alone. Further experiments indicate that this activity-dependent amplification of facilitation is presynaptic in origin and involves a differential increase in spike duration and thus in Ca2+ influx in paired versus unpaired sensory neurons. The results of these cellular experiments are quantitatively similar to the results of behavioral experiments with the same protocol and parameters, suggesting that activity-dependent amplification of presynaptic facilitation may make a significant contribution to classical conditioning of the withdrawal reflex."
https://openalex.org/W2070370133,"The endogenous neuropeptide cholecystokinin, when administered systemically or perispinally, potently antagonizes opiate analgesia produced by foot shock and morphine. Nonopiate foot-shock analgesia is not reduced by this neuropeptide. The spinal cord appears to be a critical site of cholecystokinin action. These experiments suggest a physiological role for cholecystokinin as a specific opiate antagonist in analgesia-mediating systems. A similar mode of action may explain other behavioral effects of cholecystokinin, such as suppression of food intake."
https://openalex.org/W1973886143,"We have shown previously that four of five white mutant alleles arising in P-M dysgenic hybrids result from the insertion of strongly homologous DNA sequence elements. We have named these P elements. We report that P elements are present in 30-50 copies per haploid genome in all P strains examined and apparently are missing entirely from all M strains examined, with one exception. Furthermore, members of the P family apparently transpose frequently in P-M dysgenic hybrids; chromosomes descendant from P-M dysgenic hybrids frequently show newly acquired P elements. Finally, the strain-specific breakpoint hotspots for the rearrangement of the pi 2 P X chromosome occurring in P-M dysgenic hybrids are apparently sites of residence of P elements. These observations strongly support the P factor hypothesis for the mechanistic basis of P-M hybrid dysgenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019708066,"The molecular nature of mutations arising in dysgenic hybrids between P and M Drosophila melanogaster strains has been investigated. Seven independent mutations at the white locus were examined, and these fell into two classes on the basis of their genetic and structural properties. The five mutations comprising the first class were caused by DNA insertions of 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 1.2 and 1.4 kb, respectively. The DNA insertions in four of these mutations were examined in detail. Although heterogeneous in size and pattern of restriction enzyme sites, they were homologous in sequence. We refer to members of this sequence family as P elements. Mutations caused by P elements appeared to be stable in the P cytotype, but had reversion rates greater than 10âˆ’3 in the M cytotype. Phenotypic reversion to wild-type was accompanied by excision of the P element. The two mutations comprising the second class were caused by insertion of the 5.0 kb copia element and appeared to be stable in both P and M cytotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1987764077,A cellular analog of associative learning has been demonstrated in individual sensory neurons of the tail withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. Sensory cells activated by intracellular current injection shortly before a sensitizing shock to the animal's tail display significantly more facilitation of their monosynaptic connections to a tail motor neuron than cells trained either with intracellular stimulation unpaired to tail shock or with tail shock alone. This associative effect is acquired rapidly and is expressed as a temporally specific amplification of heterosynaptic facilitation. The results suggest that activity-dependent neuromodulation may be a mechanism underlying associative information storage and point to aspects of subcellular processes that might be involved in the formation of neural associations.

https://openalex.org/W1512865667,"Protein C inhibitor was isolated from human plasma using conventional chromatographic technique consisting of barium citrate adsorption, polyethylene glycol fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, dextran sulfate-agarose chromatography, gel filtration on ACA-44, and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. The purified protein C inhibitor is a single polypeptide chain with an apparent Mr = 57,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The inhibitor is heterogeneous in pI: six pIs exist between pH 7.4 and 8.6. The inhibitor was shown to be different from the already known plasma protease inhibitors by chemical and immunological analyses. It migrates to the late alpha 1-globulin region on agarose gel electrophoresis. The inhibitor reduced the amidolytic activity of activated protein C noncompetitively by forming a 1:1 molar complex with the enzyme, determined by the use of a fluorogenic substrate toward activated protein C (Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide). The inhibition constant (Ki) of the inhibitor against activated protein C was 5.8 x 10(-8) M. The inhibitor also blocked the prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time by activated protein C. The immunoglobulin which was produced by the inhibitor completely removed the inhibitory activity present in normal human plasma against activated protein C. This suggests that the inhibitor which we have isolated is the only inhibitor in plasma against activated protein C."

https://openalex.org/W1626119615,"We have cloned and sequenced the alcohol dehydrogenase gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The gene was isolated by transformation and complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain which lacked functional alcohol dehydrogenase with an S. pombe gene bank constructed in the autonomously replicating yeast plasmid YEp13. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that S. pombe contains only one alcohol dehydrogenase gene. The structural region of the gene is 50% homologous to the alcohol dehydrogenase encoding genes of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. The gene exhibits a very strong codon usage bias; with the set of predominantly used codons generally resembling that which S. cerevisiae employs preferentially. All of the differences in codon usage bias between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are in the direction of greater G + C content in S. pombe codons. It is argued that this observation supports the hypothesis that selection toward uniform codon-anticodon binding energies contributes to codon usage bias and that the optimum binding energy is, on the average, higher in S. pombe than S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2064278373,"The aphthovirus genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA that encodes all the virus-induced proteins. We isolated recombinant aphthoviruses from cells simultaneously infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of two different subtype strains. Analysis of the proteins induced by 16 independently generated recombinants revealed two types of protein pattern, which were consistent with single genetic crossovers on the 5' side and 3' side, respectively, of the central P34-coding region. Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins. These fingerprints provide molecular evidence of recombination at the level of RNA and demonstrate the potential of RNA recombination for producing genetic diversity among picornaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2004886523,Two plasmids containing nonoverlapping deletions of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene were introduced into thymidine kinase-deficient mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Thymidine kinase-producing transformants were generated by a mixture of the two plasmids at a frequency significantly greater than that generated by either plasmid alone. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that functional thymidine kinase genes were generated by homologous recombination between the two deletion mutants.
https://openalex.org/W2080374410,"Direct evidence is given for the presence of an Nacetyl-d-galactosamine-specific lectin on the Kupffer cell surface by visualization of ligand binding in electron microscopy. When freshly isolated Kupffer cells are incubated with asialofetuin adsorbed onto colloidal gold particles (ASF-gold), binding and endocytosis of ligand are seen. Recognition of ASF-gold by Kupffer cells is completely abolished in the presence of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (25 mM) or EGTA (3 mM), but is not significantly reduced by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine or d-mannose (25 mM). ASF particles are endocytosed via the coated pit/vesicle pathway and appear to be transported to the secondary lysosomes by coated vesicles, as shown by the occurrence of coated areas in the secondary lysosome membrane. These observations demonstrate the presence of an asialoglycoprotein receptor on Kupffer cells; therefore, the hepatocyte is not the only cell in the rat liver with d-galactose receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1501167463,"Membrane vesicles (ghosts) containing ascorbic acid were prepared from bovine chromaffin granules. When ferricyanide or ferricytochrome c were added to the external medium, a membrane potential (interior positive) developed across the ghost membrane. This membrane potential could not be elicited from ascorbate-free ghosts or by ferrocyanide added instead of ferricyanide. These results indicate that the chromaffin-granule membrane has a transmembrane electron carrier with a midpoint potential between that of ascorbate (+85 mV) and that of cytochrome c (+255 mV). The most likely candidate is cytochrome b-561 (+140 mV)."
https://openalex.org/W1596409712,"Myosin heavy chain is encoded by a large multigene family. Using pMHC-25, a recombinant cDNA clone isolated from the rat myogenic cell line L6E9, four members of this family in the rat have been isolated and shown to be tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. The coding regions of these genes share regions of homology interspaced with regions of non-homology. Detailed analysis of one embryonic and one adult myosin heavy chain gene shows that the coding sequences are interrupted by numerous intervening sequences whose number, size, and distribution do not appear to be conserved in the same organism or between species."
https://openalex.org/W1495548641,"This report concerns the characterization of the RNA transcripts encoded by two cDNA sequences p4A3 and p3C5, derived from a hamster temperature-sensitive mutant cell line K12. Using the two cDNA sequences as hybridization probes, we show that they occur as single copy genes in the hamster genome and encode for RNA transcripts which are highly inducible in K12 cells at 40.5 degrees C. After incubation at 40.5 degrees C for 16 h, there is a 10-fold increase in the p4A3 and p3C5 mRNA levels, reaching a final concentration of about 1% of the cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA. We demonstrate that the kinetics of transcription of p4A3 and p3C5 directly parallel the accumulation of the mRNA levels at 40.5 degrees C. Thus, our data indicate that the expression of these two genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. In addition, there is a 3- to 4-fold increase in the p4A3 and p3C5 mRNA levels when the cells are specifically starved of glucose. This implies that the expression of these two genes are stringently regulated by the availability of glucose in the culture medium. The relationship between the cDNA clones and two glucose-regulated proteins which are overproduced in K12 cells at 40.5 degrees C is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1484829586,"Two closely related mRNAs (11.0 and 9.6 kilobases long) for sericin, a cocoon protein other than fibroin, were isolated from the middle silk gland of Bombyx mori. They were shown to be specifically accumulated in this particular part of the gland. Nine genomic clones complementary to the mRNAs were isolated from the recombinant phage library of Bombyx DNA. They represent two structurally similar genomic segments, and contain the 5' end and its surrounding region of sericin gene. We have identified at least 5 exons in then, and the intervening coding junctions were determined at nucleotide level. The two genomic segments differ mainly in the 5' flanking as well as in the intervening sequences and may represent alleles of a sericin locus. DNA sequence analysis of an exon has revealed an internally repetitive unit of 114 base pairs. From an internally repetitive unit of 114 base pairs. From an open frame of the repetitive DNA sequence, a peptide consisting of 38 amino acids abundant in serine was deduced. We propose the peptide represents a repetitive unit of a sericin protein. The probable site of initiation of sericin gene transcription in vivo has been identified at the nucleotide level that also turned out to be the 5' end of mature sericin mRNA. There exist strong homologous regions in the sericin and fibroin genes at their corresponding 5' flanking sequences. A possible involvement of the homologous sequences around -111 and -186 for the concerted expression of the sericin and fibroin genes in the silk glands is discussed."

Some enzymes produced a G-banding pattern; some revealed the presence of multiple chromosome-specific classes of highly repetitive DNA in C-band heterochromatin. Enzymes that produced the informative C-band patterns had recognition sequences that were four or five, but not six, base pairs long and did not contain a cytosine-guanine doublet. In both rat and human chromosomes, regions containing amplified ribosomal RNA genes were specifically removed by the restriction endonuclease Msp I."

https://openalex.org/W1550368474,"NADH-ubiquinone (Q) reductase isolated from beef heart mitochondria exhibited, upon reduction by NADH, a prominent EPR signal at room temperature attributable to stable ubisemiquinone radical(s). The concentration of the ubisemiquinone radical reached as high as 40% of the total Q content in the reductase. The radical was virtually abolished by adding rotenone, whereas rotenone had no effect on the reduction of FMN by NADH. The radical showed an EPR signal of g = 2.0042 at approximately 9.5 GHz with no resolved hyperfine structure and had a line width of 6.8 Gauss at 23 degrees C. The Q-band EPR spectra at 35 GHz showed well resolved g-anisotropy and had a field separation between derivative extrema of 24 Gauss. These results substantiate the fact that this radical was bound to a protein; we call it ubiquinone protein-N (QP-N). The pH dependence of the EPR signals demonstrated that the species of the ubisemiquinone radical(s) consisted of not only an anionic form but also a neutral form. Only about half of the QP-N radical formed by NADH reduction was abolished by p-chloromercuric sulfonate. The microwave power saturation curve of the radical was biphasic; the first phase leveled off at about 5 milliwatts and then at about 20 milliwatts. These results suggested that the ubisemiquinone radical from QP-N was heterogenous, consisting of at least two populations of stable ubisemiquinone radical(s). It is suggested that two kinds of QP-N exist in NADH-Q reductase. Each mole of protein may bind two mol of Q."
https://openalex.org/W2063829326,"Intracellular iontophoretic injection of the catalytic subunit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase increased input resistance and decreased a delayed voltage-dependent K+ current of the type B photoreceptor in the nudibranch Hermissenda crassicornis to a greater extent than an early, rapidly inactivating K+ current (IA). This injection also enhanced the long-lasting depolarization of type B cells after a light step. These findings suggest the involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent phosphorylation in the differential regulation of photoreceptor K+ currents particularly during illumination. On the other hand, conditioning-induced changes in IA may also be regulated by a different type of phosphorylation (for example, Ca2+-dependent)."
https://openalex.org/W1565050185,"Both the O- and N-linked oligosaccharide moieties of the subunits of the placental glycoprotein hormone, human choriogonadotropin (hCG), are removed by treatment with a mixture of glycosidases produced by Streptococcus (Diplococcus) pneumoniae. The resulting deglycosylated subunits recombine with their native counterparts in good yield, and the reassociated hormones bind to gonadotropin receptors equally as well as the untreated hormone. Stimulation of steroidogenesis by the deglycosylated alpha-native beta recombinant, however, was markedly less than the stimulation by unmodified hCG both in terms of relative potency (0.10-0.15) and the maximal amount of steroid (40-50%) produced. The native alpha-deglycosylated beta recombinant produced a maximum level of steroid production of 80-90% that of control hCG although its relative potency had decreased approximately 4-fold. The data are in accord with results by others in which either hCG or lutropin was partially deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. In addition, the effects of deglycosylation on the ability of each subunit to refold after reduction of their disulfide bonds was studied. Of particular interest is that, after deglycosylation, the beta subunit can correctly refold to a significant degree, in contrast to several unsuccessful attempts to demonstrate correct refolding of the unmodified beta subunit of either lutropin or hCG. Alpha subunit, as measured by a conformation sensitive radioimmunoassay, refolds with equal facility both before and after deglycosylation."

We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones specific for C3 mRNA and used them to isolate and characterize genomic clones for two C3 genes. Both genes are 3.2 kilobases with identical exon/intron arrangements, which is similar to the organization of the C1 and C2 genes, suggesting that they may have arisen by duplications of an ancestral gene. Finally, homologous human genes have not been detected."
https://openalex.org/W2042400223,"We investigated the genetic organization and evolutionary origin of t chromosomes of mice by examining the restriction fragment patterns of DNA from t haplotypes and normal chromosomes with cDNA probes to H-2 class I genes. On genomic DNA blots, the restriction fragments containing H-2-related sequences were highly variable among different inbred strains of mice, whereas they were very similar among different t haplotypes even when the t haplotypes carried serologically different H-2 haplotypes. These observations suggest that all t haplotypes have a common origin and are not products of independent mutational events. We also mapped the position of several restriction fragments characteristic of t DNA by using a battery of recombinant t haplotypes, defined with respect to their t-lethal factors and H-2 haplotypes. We thus show that restriction fragments containing H-2-related sequences map to the left of the H-2 class I genes in t chromosomes, a region in which the tw32 b-lethal factor also maps. The cloning of these fragments can be expected to provide an entry for the structural analysis of t DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2066311422,"A recombinant clone for the wild-type gene of sucrose synthetase has been selected. Subclones of the genomic clone were made and used as probes to construct a restriction map of the wild-type locus. The transcribed region and the direction of transcription in the map were also determined. Four Ds-induced mutations of the locus that were isolated by B. McClintock were analyzed and partially mapped. Two mutations contain insertions of âˆ¼20 kb of foreign DNA into the transcribed region; two others are at the 5â€² end of the gene. There are profound differences in the restriction maps of the Ds elements in the mutants analyzed, even though these elements have a common genetic origin and are separated by only a few generations. Comparison of one pair of closely related Ds elements indicates that these differences may be the result of extensive internal rearrangements. Exchange with other elements in the genome remains an alternative possibility. A revertant of one of the Ds-induced mutations has maintained a 21â€“22 kb insert at the same location in the transcribed region. This insert differs from its predecessor by extensive rearrangement in two thirds of its length. Part, or all, of this rearrangement presumably permits functional expression of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1526909016,"The biological properties of chemically deglycosylated human choriogonadotropin (DG-hCG) preparations were examined in collagenase-dispersed rat interstitial cells in vitro. Despite effective receptor binding activity in membrane preparations, DG-hCG failed to induce cyclic AMP accumulation in the cells when incubated in the presence or absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The steroidogenic ability as assessed by testosterone accumulation in the medium was less than 0.5% of the native hormone with a failure to attain maximal steroid production. Time course experiments have revealed that altered kinetics could not be responsible for the loss of hormone response. Consistent with its property of good receptor binding and poor cell activation, DG-hCG antagonized the action of native hCG. When added to the cells at the same time, DG-hCG inhibited the action of a maximal stimulatory dose of hCG in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation was complete whereas inhibition of steroidogenesis was about 75%. DG-hCG had no effect on the stimulatory action of cholera toxin in interstitial cells or that of follitropin in rat seminiferous tubular preparations. The data suggest that DG-hCG has a conformation conductive for effective interaction with the receptor, but its ability to activate the adenylate cyclase is either lost or weakly expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1949906439,"Eighty different adenine-modified cAMP analogs were tested as activators of rabbit muscle protein kinase I (cAKI) in an in vitro phosphotransferase assay. All the analogs tested were able to activate completely the kinase. The affinities of the cAMP derivatives for the two types (A and B) of binding sites associated with the regulatory moiety of cAKI were determined under conditions similar to those used in the phosphotransferase assay. The potency of the cAMP analogs as cAKI activators was found to correlate with the mean affinity for sites A and B, rather than to the affinity for only one of the sites. This was true whether cAKI was assayed at low or near physiological ionic strength, whether the concentration of cAKI binding sites was 0.2 or 400 nM, and whether the kinase substrate was mixed histones or homogeneous phenylalanine-4-monooxygenase. Furthermore, site A-selective and site B-selective cAMP analogs activated cAKI synergistically. Finally, it was shown that the degree of synergism between cAMP analogs in activating cAKI correlated with their degree of site selectivity. It is concluded that cyclic nucleotides interact with both types of binding sites in the process of cAKI activation."
https://openalex.org/W1566732350,"Histidine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.22) was purified to homogeneity from Clostridium perfringens and also from Lactobacillus buchneri. Both enzymes are composed of alpha and beta subunits, with an essential pyruvoyl group bound to the alpha subunit. In this respect and also in molecular weight of both the alpha and beta subunits and the native enzyme, they closely resemble the previously described (Riley, W.D., and Snell, E. E. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 1485-1491) histidine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a. Rabbit antibodies to the latter enzyme cross-react incompletely with the decarboxylase from L. buchneri but not with that from C. perfringens in double diffusion tests. The clostridial decarboxylase differs substantially from the Lactobacillus 30a enzyme in amino acid composition and, unlike the latter enzyme, requires high ionic strength (I approximately 1.4 M) for maximum activity. The enzymes also differ in rates of electrophoretic migration. A proenzyme for the decarboxylase similar to that previously found in Lactobacillus 30a was detected in immunoprecipitates of extracts of L. buchneri. We conclude that these proteins arise from pyruvate-free precursor proteins by similar mechanisms and probably have diverged from a common ancestral protein."
https://openalex.org/W1488648487,"Hybridization of Southern blots of EcoRI digests of total Bacillus subtilis DNA with ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA probes provides evidence of highly clustered tRNA and rRNA genes, with several tRNA clusters being located in spaces which span between tandem ribosomal RNA gene sets. Clones containing these tRNA clusters were isolated from a Charon 4A library. One of them, denoted trrnB, was partially sequenced. A cluster of six tRNA genes was found, with anticodon assignments of Asn, Thr, Gly, Arg, Pro, Ala. This cluster is closely flanked on both sides by ribosomal RNA gene sets, which were identified by sequencing upward through the 5 S rRNA gene, across a space, and into the 23 S rRNA gene, and also sequencing downward into the 16 S rRNA gene. The tRNA gene cluster appears to be organized into at least two transcriptional units separated by an attenuator region. These transcriptional units may be components of the flanking ribosomal RNA operons. The putative promoter region of the downstream 16 S rRNA is organized differently from Escherichia coli; it is smaller and seems less complex. This gene organization provides insight into possible mechanisms for coordinate and differential control of transfer and ribosomal RNA gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1570821484,"Type IV procollagen-like constituents of glomerular basement membrane were solubilized by reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds under denaturing conditions. Four polypeptides were observed with apparent Mr = 185,000, 175,000, 164,000, and 152,000. The two largest chains correspond to pro-alpha 1(IV) and pro-alpha 2(IV), described in model systems which secrete a basement membrane-like matrix, while the smaller chains appear to be shortened forms of these polypeptides. Fractionation of the four polypeptides into two groups was achieved by ion exchange chromatography. Pro-alpha 1(IV) and 164,000 polypeptide are relatively acidic with respect to pro-alpha 2(IV) and 152,000 polypeptide, which is due in part to a relatively high content of arginine in the latter. Based on amino acid analysis of the collagenase-sensitive regions of these polypeptides, pro-alpha 1(IV) is the parent molecule from which alpha 1(IV) is derived on pepsin digestion of basement membranes and pro-alpha 2(IV) is the parent molecule of alpha 2(IV). Pro-alpha 1(IV) was isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and characterized. It has a molecular weight of 194,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. The polypeptide contains 14% carbohydrate in the form of both disaccharide, glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine, and heteropolysaccharide units. The polypeptide backbone mass is calculated to be 167,000 daltons. Digestion of pro-alpha 1(IV) with bacterial collagenase resulted in two resistant segments of mass = 31,000 and 33,000 dalton, which make up approximately 30% of the polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1605653259,"Two prostaglandins, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostaglandin B1 (PGB1), block S-phase DNA synthesis in synchronous cultured baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The prostaglandin inhibition of DNA synthesis does not appear to require elevated levels of cAMP. In BHK-21 cells that have been desensitized to prostaglandin stimulation of adenylate cyclase and, therefore, have control levels of cAMP, PGE1 retains its inhibitory effect on the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA. When BHK cells are exposed to PGB1 (a prostaglandin that does not elicit a cAMP response), DNA synthesis is also blocked. In nonsynchronous cells exposed for 1 h to PGE and then incubated for 1 h with PGE removed, a rebound of DNA synthesis occurs, therefore providing evidence that a transient rise of cAMP in itself is not capable of causing a cascade of reactions that block the synthesis of DNA. In addition, the concentration of PGE required for inhibition of DNA synthesis is significantly less than that required for cAMP generation. Addition of 1 x 10(-8) M PGE to BHK cells can be shown to significantly inhibit DNA synthesis within 30 min, with half-maximal inhibition seen at 3 x 10(-7) M PGE. Cyclic AMP levels for controls were 4.9 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.1 for 1 x 10(-6) M PGE1. These findings suggest that the prostaglandins can act independently of cAMP at physiological concentrations; and, therefore, it is possible that prostaglandins have a physiological role in the control of cell growth during S-phase."
https://openalex.org/W2042509932,"Immunoreactivity to the amphibian peptide physalaemin was characterized from extracts of a human lung small-cell carcinoma by immunological, chemical, and pharmacological means. Tumor-related peptide cross-reacted with three antiserums to physalaemin to yield 1.1 to 1.6 nanomoles per gram of tissue. Physalaemin and tumor peptide had similar retention times on high-performance liquid chromatography after chemical and enzymic modifications that included pH changes, oxone oxidation, use of a hydrophilic ion-pairing reagent, and digestion with trypsin and pyroglutamate aminopeptidase. Both physalaemin and the tumor peptide produced a contractile response of isolated guinea pig ileum at threshold concentrations of approximately 100 to 150 picograms per milliliter. These data suggest that small-cell carcinoma of the lung contains a physalaemin-like peptide that has structural and biological homology to its amphibian counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W173210378,"Protein S, a development-specific protein of Myxococcus xanthus is produced only during fruiting body formation. More than 15% of total protein synthesis during this period is accounted for by the production of protein S. The genes for protein S were identified and cloned with the use of mixed probes consisting of eight synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (tetradecamers) which correspond to a carboxyl-terminal portion of protein S. The two genes are oriented in the same direction and are separated approximately 1.2 kilobases. The DNA sequences of the carboxyl-terminal portions of the two genes reveal that both can code for the identical eleven amino acid sequence which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal end of protein S. However, there are a few base substitutions upstream of these regions. This duplication of genes in M. xanthus may facilitate the extremely rapid synthesis of protein S during fruiting body formation."
https://openalex.org/W1513879847,"The oxi2 gene of yeast mitochondrial DNA was previously shown to code for subunit 3 of cytochrome oxidase (Thalenfeld, B.E., and Tzagoloff, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6173-6180). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B, a 3.6-kilobase (kb) transcript has been mapped to the oxi2 region of mitochondrial DNA. This transcript, presumed to be the messenger RNA of subunit 3, has been characterized by Northern hybridization analysis and by S1 nuclease mapping. The 3.6-kb transcript has a 5' untranslated leader of 490 nucleotides followed by a 807-nucleotide long coding sequence and a 3' extension of approximately 2450 nucleotides. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region in the 3.6-kb transcript is identical with the gene sequence, thus excluding the presence of introns in the oxi2 gene. Analysis of mitochondrial RNA in cytoplasmic petite mutants containing the oxi2 gene, but with varying lengths of flanking sequences, suggest the presence of a common promoter for oxi2 and the upstream valine tRNA. The promoter has been mapped to a 400-nucleotide long region located on the 5' side of the tRNA gene. Generation of the mature subunit 3 mRNA must, therefore, involve the excision of the tRNA from the primary transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1594864094,"The effect of diadenosine 5', 5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) on the time course and acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis was studied in undamaged and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-treated human lymphocytes. Analysis of protein acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) revealed that treatment with Ap4A stimulated ADP-ribosylation of bands at molecular weights of 96,000, 79,000, and 62,000. Pulse-chase studies showed that these bands were produced as a result of an effect of Ap4A on the processing of ADP-ribosylated proteins rather than on the synthesis of newly ADP-ribosylated proteins. By incubating permeabilized cells in the absence or presence of Ap4A and purified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase auto-ADP-ribosylated with [32P]NAD+, we showed that the Mr = 96,000, 79,000, and 62,000 bands were derivatives of the prelabeled enzyme. Our results indicate that normal human lymphocytes process auto-ADP-ribosylated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to specific lower molecular weight products and that this processing is stimulated by Ap4A."
https://openalex.org/W1494976285,"Recombinant RF (replicate form) I DNAs containing the bacteriophage phi X174 gene A protein-recognition sequence are cleaved by the phi X A protein yielding a phi X RF II X A protein complex (Zipursky, S.L., Reinberg, D., and Hurwitz, J. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 5182-5186). Such complexes support DNA synthesis in both RF I leads to SS(c) and RF I leads to RF I phi X DNA replication reactions in vitro. Two phi X A protein-recognition sequences were inserted into plasmid pBR322. Both sequences were contiguous with the same strand of the vector DNA and separated by 667 and 4275 base pairs. This recombinant plasmid (G27-4) was cleaved by the phi X A protein at either insert and both inserts support the initiation of RF leads to SS(c) DNA synthesis. This was verified by the finding that replication products were circular molecules of 667 and 4275 nucleotides. This finding is in keeping with the multifunctional activities associated with the phi X A protein; these include the site-specific nicking of RF I DNA which initiates DNA synthesis and site-specific termination resulting in the circularization of the displaced DNA strand. The phi X A protein and the Escherichia coli rep and SSb proteins catalyze the unwinding of phi X RF I DNA in vitro (Scott, J.F., Eisenberg, S., Bertsch, L.L., and Kornberg, A. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 193-197). Recombinant plasmid G27-4 RF I DNA was also unwound in vitro by this enzyme system; in this case, both circular and linear single-stranded DNA molecules of 667 and 4275 nucleotides, as well as full length circular single-stranded DNA were formed. Full length linear DNA was not detected. The two single-stranded circular DNA products formed as leading strands in RF leads to SS(c) reaction mixtures containing G27-4 RF I DNA differed in their ability to support lagging strand DNA synthesis. It was shown that the large single-stranded circular product included DNA sequences homologous to a replication factor Y effector sequence required for RF leads to RF and SS(c) leads to RF replication (Zipursky, S.L., and Marians, K.J. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 6521-6525). The 4275-nucleotide, but not the 667-nucleotide, single-stranded circular DNA product was converted to a duplex structure."
https://openalex.org/W1525765116,"We have constructed phage M13mp7 clones each containing the coding strand from one of three restriction fragments which collectively span the mouse 28 S rRNA gene with the exception of the 3'-terminal approximately 500 base pairs. When hybridized to 28 S rRNA, only the fragment containing the 5'-terminal 1400 nucleotides of the gene inhibited the annealing of 5.8 S rRNA to the 28 S rRNA. The same results were obtained when either the 5'- or 3'-terminal fragment of 5.8 S rRNA was used in lieu of intact 5.8 S rRNA, each of which had been shown to contain an independent 28 S rRNA contact site. However, alpha-sarcin, a cytotoxin that inhibits protein synthesis by hydrolyzing a phosphodiester bond near the 3' end of 28 S rRNA, produces a 3'-terminal 488-nucleotide fragment which exhibits a marginal capacity to anneal to 5.8 S rRNA. These results indicate that 5.8 S rRNA interacts predominantly with a structural domain near the 5' end of 28 S rRNA. This conclusion is consistent with base-pairing interactions between 5.8 S rRNA and 28 S rRNA based on the proposed secondary structures for Escherichia coli 23 S and yeast 26 S rRNAs. However, alpha-sarcin treatment of ribosomes affects the stability of the binding of 5.8 S rRNA to the 28 S rRNA, even though the toxin hydrolyzes a phosphodiester bond several thousand nucleotides from the proposed contact regions. Finally, mouse 5.8 S rRNA was shown to lack two internal nucleotides reported to be present in rat 5.8 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532066043,"The chicken hepatic lectin, a receptor for partially deglycosylated serum glycoproteins, has been identified as a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation was detected by incorporation of 32P into the protein in cultured hepatocytes and by two-dimensional gel analysis of protein purified from liver tissue. In addition, forms of the receptor containing one, two, and three sialic acid residues have been detected, with the disialylated form predominating. The site of phosphorylation has been identified as Ser7 in the complete amino acid sequence of the receptor (Drickamer, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5827-5839). The presence of a protein kinase target site near the NH2-terminal of the receptor, a stretch of 25 uncharged, hydrophobic residues in positions 24 through 48, and a site of glycosylation at position 67 suggests that the chicken hepatic lectin is probably a transmembrane protein, oriented with COOH-terminal outside the cell and NH2-terminal in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1635306069,"The regulation of endogenous protein phosphorylation by parathyroid hormone (PTH) was investigated using confluent monolayer cultures of chick kidney cells. Homogenates and subcellular fractions of PTH (bovine 1-34)-treated cells were subjected to an endogenous protein phosphorylation assay using ((gamma- 32P]ATP in the presence or absence of 2.0 microM cAMP or 0.5 mM Ca2+ with 25 micrograms/ml of phosphatidylserine and reactions terminated with sodium dodecyl sulfate. In other experiments, cultures were incubated in a phosphate-free 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline containing 50 muCi/ml of [32P]PO4 and incubations were terminated with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Protein phosphorylation was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cyclic AMP stimulated 32P incorporation into proteins having molecular weights of 17,000, 22,000, 35,000, 42,000, 54,000, 75,000, 80,000, 120,000, and 143,000. Calcium-phosphatidylserine stimulated the phosphorylation of proteins of 20,000, 52,000, 58,000, 60,000, and 143,000. The protein phosphorylation patterns in cultured kidney cells and freshly isolated kidney tissue were quite similar. Treatment of cultured cells with 5-50 ng/ml of PTH resulted in stimulated phosphorylation of the 35,000 and 42,000 dalton proteins as assessed by endogenous phosphorylation in homogenates. In intact cells incubated with [32P]PO4, PTH stimulated most noticeably the phosphorylation of the 35,000-dalton protein. Based on studies with cultured and fresh kidney cells, the majority of the substrate proteins for cAMP and calcium-dependent protein kinases were located in the cytoplasm with the exception of the 42,000-dalton protein which was located in the brush-border-plasma membrane fraction. The cytoplasmic cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was responsible for the majority of PTH-stimulated protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1560324688,"The reaction of nitromalondialdehyde with the arginine residues of glucagon results in the conversion of the 2 arginine residues in the peptide to delta-(5-nitro-2-pyrimidyl)ornithine to form di[delta-(5-nitro-2-pyrimidyl)ornithine 17,18]glucagon (NP-glucagon). The modified peptide does not exhibit any loss in ability to activate adenylate cyclase of rat liver plasma membranes or to stimulate glycogenolysis in cortisone-primed rabbits relative to the native hormone despite this marked alteration in structure. The CD of dilute solutions of NP-glucagon is similar to that of the native hormone. In the absence of salt, the CD of NP-glucagon is independent of peptide concentration, but structures of higher helical content are observed in concentrated peptide solutions in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and in methanol. The extent of helix formation under these conditions is greater than that given by glucagon. Results from viscosity and proton magnetic resonance spectra confirm and extend previous studies to indicate that this fully active derivative is in a compact folded conformation."
