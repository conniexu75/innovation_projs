This growth factor is a polypeptide of 13,300 molecular weight and is homogeneous when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, carboxymethyl-Sephadex gradient elution chromatography, and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. The yield of growth factor is 5 mg per kg of pituitary. It is active in stimulating DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells at concentrations as low as 2 times 10-13 M with saturation at 1 times 10-10 M."

https://openalex.org/W1973571832,"An analysis of the methylated constituents of L cell mRNA by a combination of chromatographic methods and enzymatic treatments indicates that they comprise both 2'-O-methyl nucleosides and N6-methyl adenine, and/or 1-methyl adenine, and suggests that the 2'-O-methyl nucleotides, Ym, are part of an unusual class of sequences forming the 5' terminus of mRNA. These sequences seem to contain two 2'-O-methyl residues and a terminal residue that is not phosphorylated but, nevertheless, is blocked with respect to polynucleotid kinase reactivity. A strong candidate is a sequence of the type XppY1mpY2mpZp..., where X represents a blocking group which is itself occasionally methylated. The sequences isolated from total poly(A)+ mRNA contain all four species of 2'-O-methylated nucleoside, indicating some variability among different mRNA species. The methylated sequences do not appear to be enriched in the mRNA which hybridizes with repetitive DNA. The average L cell mRNA molecule also contains three residues of N6-methyl adenine. These residues are not part of the poly(A) segment, but appear to be located internal to the poly(A) near the 3' end of the mRNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1482723536,"Ion exchange chromatography and preparative electrophoresis were used to examine the phosphorylation of histone f1 and f3 subfractions in synchronized Chinese hamster cells (line CHO). Three discrete f1 phosphorylation events were demonstrated to occur in sequence during the cell cycle. The first event (f1G1) commenced in G1 2 hours prior to entry of cells into S phase; the second event (f1s) commenced simultaneously with initiation of DNA synthesis; and the third event (f1M) commenced when cells entered mitosis. F1M phosphorylation occurred simultaneously with the phosphorylation of histone f3 (which is not phosphorylated during G1, S, or G2). Fractionation of f1 and f3 revealed no differences in these sequential phosphorylation patterns among the various f1 and f3 subfractions, indicating that these phosphorylations are general biochemical events of the cell cycle. Phosphorylated (f1G1) was found to accumulate in cells as they traversed THEIR CELL CYCLE. F1s was phosphorylated to twice the extent of f1G1, but f1s did not accumulate in the cells as they passed through interphase. F1M was phosphorylated to about 4 times the extent of the first phosphorylated form (f1G1). A model of the relationship of histone phosphorylation to the cell cycle is presented which suggests that (a) f1G1 phosphorylation is involved with chromatin structural changes necessary for cell proliferation; (b) f1s phosphorylation is involved with DNA replication; (c) F1M and f3 phosphorylations are involved in chromosome condensation."
https://openalex.org/W1510104226,"The activation of the action potential Na+ ionophore by veratridine and batrachotoxin is time- and concentration-dependent and completely reversible. Batrachotoxin acts more slowly than veratridine. The concentration dependence of activation at equilibrium suggests reversible interaction of each toxin with a single class of independent sites having dissociation constants at physiologic ion concentrations of 80 plus or minus 13 muM for veratridine and 0.4 plus or minus muM for batrachotoxin. The maximum velocity of Na+ uptake at 50 mM Na+ is 128 plus or minus 12 nmol/min/mg in the presence of batrachotoxin compared to 48 plus or minus 4 nmol/min/mg in the presence of veratridine. Treatment of cells with excess veratridine in addition to batrachotoxin inhibits batrachotoxin-dependent 22-Na+ uptake. The concentration dependence of this inhibition suggests that it reflects competitive displacement of batrachotoxin from its binding site by veratridine. The activation by veratridine and batrachotoxin is inhibited in a competitive manner by divalent cations. The inhibition by divalent cations exhibits significant ion specificity with Mn-2+ greater than Co-2+ greater than Ni-2+ greater than Ca-2+ greater than Mg-2+ greater than Sr-2+. The inhibition constants (KI) for Ca-2+ are 0.84 mM for veratridine-dependent 22-Na+ uptake and 1.2 mM for batrachotoxin-dependent 22-Na+ uptake. The activation by veratridine and batrachotoxin is inhibited in a noncompetitive manner by tetrodotoxin. The apparent KD for tetrodotoxin as 11 plus or minus 1 nM in the presence of 150 mM Na+ and approximately 8.5 nM in 50 mM Na+. Divalent cations do not affect the apparent KD for tetrodotoxin. A hypothesis is presented which suggests that batrachotoxin, veratridine, and divalent cations interact with an activation site associated with the action potential Na+ ionophore, whereas tetrodotoxin interacts with a physically and functionally independent site involved in the transport of monovalent cations by the ionophore."
https://openalex.org/W2162758977,"Complementary DNA (cDNA) has been transcribed by viral reverse transcriptase from poly(A)-containing nuclear RNA prepared from growing mouse Friend cells (clone M2). Annealing experiments with this cDNA have demonstrated that a large proportion of the poly(A) tracts in M2 cell nuclear RNA are adjacent to RNA sequences which are transcribed from nonrepetitive DNA in the mouse genome. The kinetics of hybridization of cDNA to template RNA indicate that nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA consists of at least two abundance classes, the more complex of which is transcribed from approximately 3% of the genome. Thus there are at least 5 times more unique DNA sequences represented in nuclear polyadenylated RNA than in polysomal polyadenylated RNA. Moreover, there is evidence for posttranscriptional mechanisms which alter the relative concentrations of some (at least) gene transcripts between nucleus and cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1595547726,"Electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) and acyl dehydrogenases of pig liver mitochondria have been isolated in good yield by a new procedure. ETF and general acyl dehydrogenase appear homogenous, are free of reciprocal contamination, react with neither pyridine nucleotides not cytochrome c, and are completely dependent upon each other for reduction of dichlorophenol indophenol by acyl-CaA substrates. The properties of the present preparation (some of which differ significantly from those previously described) are presented. Sedimentation of ETF in 0.02 M KP-i yields a M-r for the native ETF of 58,00 plus or minus 3,000, whereas sedimentation of reduced and alkylated ETF in guanidine HCl yields a M-r of 26,000. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels in the presence or absence of mercaptoethanol gives a M-r of about 27,000 and flavin analysis gives a minimum molecular weight of about the same figure. Thus, ETF appears to contain one flavin (at least 90% FAD, by chromatographic and fluorescence characteristics) per 26,000 M-r, and therefore may be composed of two subunits with one flavin each. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of general acyl dehydrogenase in the absence of mercaptoethanol gives a band corresponding to a M-r of 84,000; in the presence of mercaptoethanol a band corresponding to a M-r of 42,000 is found. The minimum molecular weight based on flavin content is 40,500. These data considered in conjunction with previous reports from other laboratories, suggest a structure of four subunits per mol with one flavin per subunit.."

https://openalex.org/W2073122947,"By selecting variants of Chinese hamster cells that were resistant to 6-thioguanine at 39 degrees C, but which would continue to grow in HAT medium at 33 degrees C, we have isolated cell lines with thermosensitive phenotypes. These clones form colonies in HAT medium and incorporate 14-C-hypoxanthine much more efficiently at 33 degrees C than at 39 degrees C. The specific activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribo-syltransferase is at least 10 times higher in variant cells grown at 33 degrees C than in those grown in 39 degrees C, and the enzymes from the variant clones are inactivated in vitro at 39 degrees C 7-9 times more rapidly than is the enzyme from wild-type cells. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the selected clones have missense mutations in the structural gene for the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1588676476,"Antimorphine antibodies inhibit the activity of morphine conjugates of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. Conjugation of malate dehydrogenase through tyrosine and amino groups resulted in only moderate losses of enzyme activity. On conjugation through disulfide bonds the enzyme activity first increased but dropped sharply with increasing substitution. Only the former conjugates were inhibited by excess antibodies. The degree of inhibition (up to 86%) was directly related to the number of morphine residues bonded directly to amino groups. The maximum number of antibody binding sites that bind to enzyme was nearly equal to the number of haptens provided there were 16 or less haptens/enzyme. However up to 26 haptens/enzyme became completely bound by antibody on long incubation. Inhibition of enzyme activity was detectably reduced by 2 times 10 minus 9 M morphine or 2 times 10 minus 10 M codeine, thus providing a sensitive assay for these drugs. The data suggest that enzyme inhibition occurs by conformational freezing of the enzyme when antibody binds to a morphine residue attached to one specific amino group."
https://openalex.org/W2075793087,"DNA synthesis in the S phase of V79 and CHO Chinese hamster cells was examined in detail using an automated system for selection and subculturing of mitotic cells and four different assays for DNA synthesis. Flow microfluorometric (FMF) analysis showed that the selected populations were highly synchronous with few noncycling cells. In CHO cells changes in mean and modal fluorescence in the FMF suggested that DNA content increased in a saltatory fashion with 10-20% of the DNA replicated in early S, 40% in mid S, and 40-50% in late S. Pulse labeling and acid precipitation revealed a repeatable pattern of fluctuations in the rate of isotope incorporation with the maximum rate occurring late in S both V79 and CHO. Autoradiography proved to be the best means of accurately determining the beginning of S phase. Cumulative labeling from mitosis to points in S exaggerated the differences in rate between early and late S, so that significant DNA synthesis in early S might easily be overlooked using this method. In CHO cells DNA-specific fluorescence by the Kissane and Robins assay supported the isotopic incorporation data and the FMF analyses by exhibiting a stepwise increase. In V79 cells, S phase lasts only 5 or 5.5 hr, and consequently the mid S and late S steps in fluorescence are compressed. In V79, greater than 80% of the increase in DNA-specific fluorescence occurred between 4.5 and 7 hr after mitotic selection. In both cell lines, fluorescence in early S phase frequently increased transiently to maximum and then decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2029523024,"A large glycoprotein (molecular weight equals 220,000 daltons) can be isolated from the surfaces of chick embryo fibroblasts. Such a protein had been shown by others to be present on normal cells in vitro, but missing from transformed variants of these cells, suggesting a possible role in growth control. We have estimated the turnover rate of this cell surface protein (CSP) and show that it is not more rapid than that of other cell proteins. We have also examined the resynthesis of CSP after removal from cells by trypsinization. This restoration is gradual, requiring more than 24 hr, and is affected by cell density. Restoration can be blocked by cycloheximide. Using cycloheximide to maintain cells depleted of CSP, we have demonstrated that isolated CSP can be progressively reabsorbed at 37 degrees C onto these denuded cell surfaces, and that this adsorption is not observed at 4 degrees C. This information on the turnover, depletion, and restoration of CSP may provide a means of directly testing its function."

Chem. 248, 4311; STECK, T. L., AND DAWSON, G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2135), two major labels were detected on the cell surface: galactoprotein (apparent molecular weight 200,000) and galactoprotein (apparent molecular weight 130,000). The labeling in a of NIL cells was greatly suppressed by pretreating cells with a high concentration of Ricinus communis lectin or concanavalin A, whereas the label in it was greatly enhanced with a low concentration of the lectins. The label in b of NIL cells was less affected by pretreatment with lectins. In NILpy cells the label in a was absent and the lable in b was enhanced by pretreating cells with lectins at low concentrations, but it was suppressed at high concentrations. The results indicate that NIL cells mainly interact with the lectins through a, whereas NILpy cells interact with the lectins through galacto-protein b. After treatment with lectins, the glycolipids of normal NIL cells, but not NILpy cells, became exposed as evidenced by enhanced labeling, possibly because of clustering of glyco-proteins. These results support the view that specific, well defined glycoproteins are the binding sites for lectins, and that these interacting glycoproteins are qualitatively different in normal and transformed cells."

The enzyme was prepared from lyophilized and dialyzed bovine skim milk in a 4 percent solution. The course of hydrolysis for each set of enantiomers was determined by gas-liquid chromatography of the masses of the diacylglycerols remaining or monoacylglycerols released in the medium between 0 and 15 min. The majority of sets of sn-1,2- and 2,3-diacylglycerols, including an isotope-labeled true enantiomeric set which was assessed by mass spectrometry, demonstrated preference by the enzyme for lipolysis at position 1 but with less specificity than previously was shown in sn-triacylglycerol hydrolysis. The results preclude the possibility that the predominance of sn-2,3-diacylglycerol intermediates during triacylglycerol hydrolysis is due solely to a preferential breakdown of the 1,2-isomers and reinforce the conclusion that lipoprotein lipase is specific for position 1."

https://openalex.org/W2047488281,"A thermosensitive line (TS 111) was isolated from a suspension culture of Chinese hamster fibroblasts, using a BUdR suicide selection technique. In this line, cytokinesis is blocked at 39 degrees C. DNA and protein synthesis are not arrested but keep on at a steady rate. Giant cells are produced which accumulate either numerous nuclei or one big nucleus with several nucleoli and more than a hundred chromosomes. At each nuclear cycle, all the chromosomes in the cell appear to condense in a synchronous manner, although it is possible that not all the sets of chromosomes duplicate. When the culture is returned to the permissive temperature (34 degrees C) after a prolonged arrest at the restrictive temperature, cytokinesis resumes with early extrusion of karyoplasts from multinucleated cells. The division block is independent of cell density in suspension culture and is not prevented by cell contact when cells grow attached to Petri dishes. At 34 degrees C, a residual expression of the mutation is indicated by the presence of binucleate and up to 30% anucleate cells. A remarkable similarity and some synergism exists between the mutation and cytochalasin B effects."
https://openalex.org/W1597218332,"In the course of experiments on the role of the COOH-terminal residues in pancreatic deoxyribonuclease, we undertook to ascertain whether the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate would render the normally unavailable terminus susceptible to hydrolysis by carboxypeptidase A. When DNase A is dissolved in 0.005% sodium dodecyl sulfate the protein becomes enzymically inactive when assayed against DNA in the same sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration. The loss of activity caused by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate for 1 hour at 45 degrees can be fully restored if the detergent-containing solution is diluted 10-fold into 6 M guanidinium chloride and then 10-fold into a pH 7.0 buffer, 10 mM in CaCl2, prior to a 100-fold dilution for assay. The presence of Ca2+ is essential for the refolding process. If the same degree of dilution is made into sodium dodecyl sulfate-free buffer without the guanidinium chloride step, there is very little reversal of the inactivation. An almost complete loss of regenerable activity is caused by 1 hour of digestion by carboxypeptidase at 45 degrees in the presence of 0.03% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Although up to 6 amino acid residues can be removed from the COOH terminus, the loss of activity can be correlated with the removal of either 1 or 2 amino acid residues (-Leu-Thr) from the COOH-terminal sequence. Thus, DNase A is one of the several enzymes in which residues at the COOH terminus are essential to the active conformation. If the enzyme minus 2 to 6 terminal residues was mixed with a 15-residue COOH-terminal peptide (obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage), only about 2% activity could be regenerated."

https://openalex.org/W1497664349,"A quasi-elastic light-scattering technique was used to study the hydrodynamic conformations of antifreeze glycoproteins from an Antarctic fish. Antifreeze glycoprotein is composed of repeating units of Ala-Ala-Thr, with each threonine O-linked to a disaccharide, and it exists as several polymers of different numbers of this repeating unit. Molecular weights of the two major active polymers are 10,500 and 17,500 by such methods as centrifugation and osmotic pressure, but smaller than 20 by freezing-point depression. Translational diffusion coefficients at 20 degrees were 8.35 times 10-7 cm2 s-1 and 6.15 times 10-7 cm2 s-1 for the M-r-10,500 and 17,500 polymers, respectively. Measurements at -0.2 degrees in the presence of ice crystals did not indicate any conformational changes that might be related to the lowering of the freezing temperature. Lowering the temperature of these glycoprotein solutions close to temperatures of freezing caused a decrease in the effective hydrodynamic radius of both active and inactive glycoprotein components."

https://openalex.org/W2054710045,"The rate of incorporation of leucine into protein, the rate of polypeptide elongation and termination, and the relative quantity and size of polysomes were analyzed in mouse L cells grown in suspension culture at various temperatures between 0 degrees C and 36 degrees C. Between 10 degrees C and 36 degrees C protein synthesis exhibited two different apparent activation energies (39 kcal/mole, 10-25 degrees C; 14 kcal/mole, 25-36 degrees C), whereas elongation and termination had only one (16 kcal/mole). Below 36 degrees C, the polysome level and size decreased, reaching a minimum of 30% of the control 36 degrees C values at 10 degrees C; below 10 degrees C the level increased again back to control values at 0 degrees C. The polysome decline was time dependent, requiring about 5 hr to reach the equilibrium value. This decline is completely reversible within 60 min, even in the presence of 4 mug/ml of actinomycin D, and even after 15 hr of incubation at the lower temperature. The results suggest that polypeptide initiation is rate limiting, particularly below 25 degrees C; whereas above this temperature, elongation or perhaps some other process may be limiting. These results are quite different from those obtained for E. coli and rabbit reticulocyte protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1980746432,"VARIATIONS in isoaccepting tRNA populations occur in mammalian cells during development, neoplasia, and virus infection, and such changes may reflect the involvement of tRNA in regulatory processes1,2, although firm evidence to that effect is not available. Ortwerth and Liu3 have shown that in normal or neoplastic cells an isoaccepting species of lysine tRNA, tRNA4Lys, is present in dividing cells but absent from non-dividing cells. Ortwerth et al.4 determined some of the functional properties of tRNA4Lys from various tissues and obtained evidence that the species is a real isoacceptor of tRNALys rather than an artefact. Normal, proliferating cells that were examined had only relatively small amounts of tRNA4Lys; however, a larger proportion of the isoacceptor was found in neoplastic cells such as mouse leukaemia and Morris hepatoma cells. It is desirable, therefore, to establish whether the large amount of tRNA4Lys is peculiar to the neoplastic state or whether normal cells may also have large amounts of that isoacceptor under some growth conditions. Therefore, we studied isoaccepting lysyl-tRNA profiles from mouse cells in different states of proliferation: adult liver, embryo and growing and quiescent primary cultures of embryonic cells. We found that normal growing cells also have an appreciable amount of tRNA4Lys."

The heat-sensitive mutants had growth characteristics of transformed cells at 34.5 degrees C, but exhibited a normal phenotype at 39.5 degrees C. By contrast, cold-sensitive mutants displayed the characteristics of the normal cells at 34.5 degrees C and converted to a transformed phenotype at 39.5 degrees C. Transformed parent cells exhibited no obvious temperature-dependent properties. Temperature shift experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of both types of mutants was fully reversible. All of the mutants were able to grow well at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures when grown on the surface of plastic dishes. Such mutants will be useful in analysis of factors involved in the expression of the transformed state or the maintenance of the nontransformed state."

https://openalex.org/W1481621779,KF (30 mM) strongly inhibits polypeptide chain initiation in the reticulocyte lysate cell-free system.. Chain elongation is partially inhibited but proceeds to a significant extent with little initiation of new chains. Polysome breakdown is incomplete after incubations as long as 20 min. Under these conditions deacylated tRNA-Met accumulates in a fraction sedimenting faster than 120 S and thus may be associated with ribosomes bound to mRNA. Incubation of the system with KF results in the accumulation of a complex which can initiate synthesis of polypeptide chains in the presence of aurintricarboxylate; KF thus inhibits a step in initiation after that inhibited by aurintricarboxylate. The accumulation of deacylated tRNA-Met is correlated with the accumulation of the aurintricarboxylate-resistant complex. Both phenomema are dependent on KF and both are inhibited by aurintricarboxylate in the same range of concentrations which inhibit initiation of protein synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W1932445777,"Cultured dissociated cells from rat embryo cerebral hemispheres were incubated with [U-14C]ethanolamine and the resulting cellular labeled products were identified. A highly efficient uptake for ethanolamine with a Km of approximately 8.3 muM was calculated. A rapid labeling of phosphorylethanolamine was observed prior to the appearance of label in lipids. A lag period of 2.5 min for the phosphorylation reaction was observed, followed by an almost linear rate for up to 40 min. After a 1-min incubation, a plateau for free ethanolamine taken up by the cells was established. Respiratory inhibitiors such as cyanide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and N-ethylmaleimide decreased by the formation of phosphorylethanolamine. However, the amount offree ethanolamine present in the cells increased 1.6-fold after 10 min of incubation with N-ethylmaleimide. 2-Chloroethylamine, a structural analog of ethanolamine, and choline were both competitive inhibitiors with an apparent Ki of 0.1 mM and 0.36 mM, respectively. Incubations of short duration suggest that both compounds affect ethanolamine transport into the cells. Based on these studies it is suggested that ethanolamine transport and the phosphorylation reaction are independent events. Evidence based on studies with hemicholinium-3 and chloroethylamine suggest that ethanolamine uptake may proceed by a pathway independent of either choline or serine uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1615125034,"The binding to apoaspartate aminotransferase of analogs of pyridoxal phosphate bearing vinyl, cis- and trans-methylvinyl, and ethynyl groups in place of the fomyl group of the coenzyme has been studied. Details of synthesis of the ethynyl compound are given. The absorption spectra of all of the compounds have been analyzed and pKa values have been determined. The positions of the absorption bands can be related to those of pyridoxine but with bathochromic shifts induced by the ethenyl and ethynyl groups. However, this shift is almost completely lacking for the cis-methylvinyl compound suggesting nonplanarity of the molecule. Binding of the analogs to the apoenzyme is accompanied by a strong bathochromic shift which, from a study of solvent effects on the free analogs, appears to indicate a hydrophobic environment on the enzyme. Nevertheless, the analogs are bound as dipolar ions exclusively. Binding is accompanied by a distinct perturbation of the protein spectrum in the aromatic region. An effect on the spectrum of 1 or more tryptophan residues is indicated. Bands of the bound analogs exhibit positive circular dichroism except for that of the 4-vinyl analog. The 4-ethynyl analog reacts in a more complex way, giving at least two successive products in addition to the initial complex. The final product is reducible by sodium borohydride, is released from the enzyme by boiling, and appears to have the properties of a Schiff base. We postulate that the addition of an amino group of the enzyme to the ethynyl group is followed by tautomeric rearrangement to a Schiff base in which the ring is in a p-quinonoid structure."

Approximately 20 g of this antibody were obtained by multiple exchange transfusions at the peak of the antibody response. The isolated antibody was homogeneous by several antigenic and chemical criteria. The light chain was isolated and modified, and then digested with alpha-chymotrypsin or thermolysin. The resulting peptides were isolated by gel filtration, paper electrophoresis, and paper chromatography. The amino acid sequences of these peptides were determined by Edman degradation plus dansylation. This supplied sufficient information to assign approximately 90 percent of the residues in the chain. The destruction of tyrosine during acid hydrolysis of peptides which had been eluted from a paper chromatogram was investigated. This destruction is due to inpurities in the paper which contaminate the peptides. Prevention of such destruction can be achieved by predevelopment of the paper with 1 N NH4OH prior to paper chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1496476344,"Cultured dissociated cells from rat embryo cerebral hemisphere incorporate [3H]-and [U-14C]ethanolamine into cellular lipids. Nearly all radioactivity in the lipid fractions is incorporated into 1,2-diacylethanolamine phosphoglycerides and 1-alkenyl,2-acylethanolamine phosphoglycerides (plasmalogen). Kinetic data suggest that the rate of labeling of both ethanolamine phospholipids from the phosphorylethanolamine is similar. A relative increase of the plasmalogen labeling is observed when free ethanolamine is continually present in the medium. The rate of incorporation of label from ethanolamine and phosphorylethanolamine into lipids was measured using a double label technique. Based upon these studies, an independent labeling pattern of the ethanolamine moiety of plasmalogens is suggested. A relative delay for the incorporation of label in plasmalogens could be explained by the presence of a variety of cell types which may differ in their capacity for phospholipid biosynthesis. The rate of incorporation of phosphorylethanolamine into the phosphatidylethanolamine was not affected by the presence of high concentrations of either choline or serine."

Similarly, there was no toxicity to the embryo when high concentrations of the antiserum were added to cultures of 2-cell and 8- to 16-cell embryos. There was, however, a moderate inhibitory effect on fertilization in vitro, which may be attributable to a direct action of antiserum to LDH-X on sperm."
https://openalex.org/W2006403159,"The individual alpha and beta anomers of the nonmetabolized glucose analog 3-O-methyl-D-glucopyranose (3MG) were studied as protective agents against the alloxan toxicity to pancreatic beta cells in an in vivo rat model. The alpha 3MG provides greater protection than either the beta or the equilibrated compound, as indicated by plasma glucose concentrations 24 hours after the experiment. This specificity suggests that the beta cell membrane is extremely stereospecific, and that glucose or 3MG provide protection against alloxan injury directly by an interaction with the cell membrane and not by subsequent metabolism of the protecting compound."
https://openalex.org/W1548642922,"Lysozyme Ch was hydrolyzed with trypsin in 2 M urea and the resulting peptides were separated by a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Ten peptides and free lysine were produced by tryptic action. The enzyme has 5 arginine and 4 lysine residues per molecule and one of the peptides arose from a chymotryptic-like cleavage of a tyrosyl-seryl bond near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme. The entire molecule is accounted for by the tryptic peptides, which have been ordered withing the peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the molecule."
