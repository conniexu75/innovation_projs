https://openalex.org/W1487380028,"It is interesting that plants can eventually acclimate fully in response to low temperatures in the absence of inductive photoperiods (67). This suggests that there is more than one route to resistance or more than one ignition key to start the machinery. In either case, the ability of plants to acclimate in response to more than one environmental stimulus provides adaptive flexibility which enhances survival potential."

https://openalex.org/W1994376310,"High-speed movies of splash formation caused by waterdrop impact at terminal velocity in thin water layers show that splash size increases with drop size. For increasing water depth, splash size increases to a maximum at a depth of one-third drop diameter; splash size then decreases to a constant size for depths greater than three drop diameters."
https://openalex.org/W2007310992,"An early man site in highland Peru yielded a rich cultural assemblage in stratigraphic association with faunal remains, botanical remains, and campfire remnants that furnished secure radiocarbon dates. A human mandible and teeth, showing interesting patterns of occlusal wear, were found in a stratum dated by a charcoal sample to 10,610 B.C., the oldest such date in South America."
https://openalex.org/W2021019677,"If the planets formed at falling temperatures with volatile substances accreting last, the low abundance of lead, bismuth, indium, and thallium in lunar rocks implies an initial water content of no more than 370 grams per square centimeter, and probably much less. The depletion of volatile substances might be expected a priori if the moon accreted as an original satellite of the earth."

Dubinsky.

The stations finally decided upon by the Department Terrestrial Magnetism in order to provide for the proper distribution and successful study of the subject under investigation were as follows:"
