https://openalex.org/W2095337996,"Synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis produces lysis of gels of reconstituted collagen fibrils in culture and releases soluble collagenase when cultured in collagen-free medium. Collagen molecules in solution at neutral pH at 20 degrees and 27 degrees C are cleaved by the synovial enzyme into (3/4) and (1/4) length fragments. In this respect the action of synovial enzyme is similar to that of amphibian collagenase and distinct from that of bacterial collagenase. At 37 degrees C reconstituted collagen fibrils and native fibers are attacked by the enzyme and further degraded to polypeptides of low molecular weight. These polypeptides are produced only after denaturation of the larger fragments, which occurs at temperatures near 37 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W2000817025,"THE release of a transmitter substance by the nerve impulse depends on the presence of calcium, rather than sodium, on the outside of the axon membrane. There is increasing evidence that inward movement of calcium is one of the first steps in the “electro-secretory” process. This view has been strengthened by recent experiments with tetrodotoxin1–3, which eliminates the regenerative influx of sodium ions but does not interfere with the release of the transmitter by locally imposed depolarization provided calcium ions are present in the external solution."

https://openalex.org/W1574964034,"Abstract The ability of several salt solutions to dissociate the tetrameric form of the hemoglobin molecule into dimers has been studied by measuring the osmotic pressure of solutions of hemoglobin. Under most circumstances, the dissociation reactions had the normal dependence on concentration of hemoglobin, and thus values of the dissociation constants could be estimated. In all the solvents studied here, the sequence of decreasing stability of the tetramer was deoxyhemoglobin g CO hemoglobin g oxyhemoglobin ≅ cyanmethemoglobin. This result was interpreted as providing further evidence for differences in conformation, not only between the liganded hemoglobins and deoxyhemoglobin, but also among the various liganded hemoglobins. Similar studies done with iodoacetamide-treated and N-ethylmaleimide-treated hemoglobins indicated that the latter derivative differs in conformation from normal hemoglobin whereas the former does not, by these criteria. Finally, the ability of the various salts to promote dissociation did not depend only on their contribution to the ionic strength of the solvent but also, and in some cases in large part, depended on specific interactions between the salt ions and the protein molecules. The order of effectiveness of the salts in dissociating the hemoglobin tetramers was NaI g guanidinium chloride g NaClO4 g MgCl2 g NaCl ≅ CH3COONa."

https://openalex.org/W1967237898,"A biologically potent, tumor-promoting phorbol ester from Croton tiglium L. induces the appearance of transformed clones in a population of contact-inhibited fibroblasts of the mouse cell line 3T3. Mixed populations of cells with 10,000 3T3 cells and 100 virus-transformed cells were exposed to the phorbol ester and, in comparison with untreated cells, showed a marked increase in the numbers of transformed clones that grew. Exposure of 3T3 cultures to the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene alone or prior to exposure to the phorbol ester did not cause any increase in the number of transformed clones."
https://openalex.org/W1595385191,"Abstract 2,2-Bipyridine chelates 2 zinc ions of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase with a dissociation constant of 4.0 x 10-4 m. The complex shows an absorption maximum at 308 mµ with a difference extinction coefficient of 1.1 x 104 m-1 cm-1 per zinc ion. Because bipyridine binds the enzyme less tightly than o-phenanthroline, and because the principal absorption maximum of the difference spectrum appears at longer wave lengths, this reagent is preferred as a tool in the determination of the binding constants of inhibitors, substrates, and coenzymes. The dissociation constants for binary complexes of enzyme with alcohols, aldehydes, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and amides, as well as with imidazole and pyrazole, have been determined by measuring the diminution that they cause in the intensity of the enzyme-bipyridine spectrum. The competitive inhibitors ADP-ribose, AMP, ADP, and 4-biphenylcarboxylic acid do not interfere with the enzyme-bipyridine spectrum, whereas the coenzymes NAD+ and NADH diminish this spectrum. These results confirm the conclusion, previously advanced by Yonetani, that the nicotinamide moiety of the coenzyme lies near the zinc ion of the active site, and that this zinc ion is part of the substrate-binding site. Ternary complexes of enzyme, coenzyme, and inhibitor have been detected from the changes in enzyme-bipyridine spectrum; these complexes therefore require the enzymic zinc ion at the active site, or form near it, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1995740651,"The incorporation of 32P-phosphate into histone fractions isolated from normal, hepatectomized, and Novikoff hepatoma-bearing rats was investigated. Varying degrees of phosphorylation were exhibited by different histone fractions. The phosphorylation of histones is tissue specific and appears to be correlated with metabolic cell functions, that is, it decreases with increasing mitotic activity of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1528272726,"Abstract With the aid of sensitive assays for argininosuccinate synthetase, affinity constants (apparent Km and Ki) were obtained for the substrates and products in the forward and backward reactions. The values obtained were essentially the same for the purified enzyme whether prepared from steer liver or hog kidney. The Km values for citrulline, aspartate, and argininosuccinate were in the range of 3 to 4 x 10-5; for adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate, the values were 2 to 4 x 10-4; for pyrophosphate, the value was 8 x 10-5 m. Several analogues of aspartate were active as either substrate or inhibitor. Product inhibitions by pyrophosphate, adenosine monophosphate, and argininosuccinate have been characterized with respect to the substrates of the forward reaction. Studies of the reaction mechanism with enzyme at substrate level support a successive step mechanism; the evidence includes (a) a citrulline-dependent cleavage of adenosine triphosphate that leads to the formation of pyrophosphate and is limited by equivalence with the enzyme and (b) a preferential incorporation of 14C-citrulline into argininosuccinate, which indicates that citrulline activation precedes interaction with aspartate. A mechanism is postulated in which citrulline adenylate (tightly bound to the enzyme) is formed in the first of two partial reactions, and the interaction with aspartate in the second. The failure to find the 32P-pyrophosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange expected in the first partial reaction results from the tight binding of pyrophosphate in the absence of aspartate. This exchange can be demonstrated by means of the analogue α-methyl-dl-aspartate, an inhibitor of the over-all reaction. The synthetase also catalyzes an aspartate-dependent cleavage of adenosine triphosphate. This activity has been characterized and appears to be related to the manner in which aspartate promotes the dissociation of pyrophosphate."

Although the experimental lesion does not reproduce all the human features3, I have confirmed that it remains focal and discrete4,5. In recent experiments on the disposal of inhaled particles within the lung parenchyma, specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats have been used in an attempt to eliminate the complication of pulmonary infection which not infrequently affects standard laboratory rats. The response of SPF rats differed greatly from that of the standard ones used in the earlier studies."

https://openalex.org/W1640804616,"Abstract Low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance absorption spectra of randomly oriented preparations of cytochrome c peroxidase, ferrimyoglobin, ferrimyoglobin-azide, and ferrimyoglobin-fluoride are measured in various physical states. In general, the line width of resonance absorptions increases in relation to the physical state of preparation in the following order: concentrated solutions l wet polycrystalline suspensions l lyophilized preparations l dried polycrystalline preparations. The broadening of resonance absorptions caused by dehydration can be reversed by rehydration and dissolution of the dried preparation. When cytochrome c peroxidase and ferrimyoglobin-azide are dehydrated, their spin types are reversibly fixed in the state at dehydration and become temperature-independent until these compounds are rehydrated. The intensity of the high spin resonance absorption of ferrimyoglobin decreases by a factor of 10 to 20 on dehydration. The initial intensity can be restored by rehydration and dissolution of the dehydrated ferrimyoglobin. Resonance spectra of dehydrated ferrimyoglobin exhibit hitherto unreported absorptions in the high field region. These absorptions may represent a compound or compounds which may be responsible for the low spin characteristics of lyophilized ferrimyoglobin detected by Mossbauer absorption spectroscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2088552250,"IN a study of the differentiation and development of pattern and cell form in the green alga Pediastrum, difficulty in extracting pigments with organic solvents led us to examine the chemical nature of the cell wall as a preliminary to a study of wall development. Structural patterns in the cell wall of Pediastrum have been described by Moner1, and formation of the wall by Moner and Chapman2. These electron microscope studies described a network of interconnected spheres, which imparts a pattern in the continuous wall phase. Although the chemical nature of the wall was not reported, it was noted that neither the wall nor the “globular network” was noticeably affected by treatment with 17.5 per cent sodium hydroxide for 48 h, by similar treatment with ethanol–ether, or by treatment for 5 h with 70 per cent sulphuric acid. Moner1 had previously noted that little is known of the chemical nature of the wall. Early literature describes the wall of Pediastrum as two-layered3. Chodat and Huber4, on the basis of staining with chloriodide of zinc and of ammoniacal congo red, reported that there is cellulose in the inner wall layer but not the outer layer. Our attempts to identify cell wall components by routine histochemical procedures5, however, failed to give characteristic results, which suggested a possible masking of the expected wall components. We present evidence here for the presence of silica in relatively high concentration in the wall of Pediastrum. In the review on silicification by Lewin6, Pediastrum is not included among the algae which deposit silica, and to the best of our knowledge this occurrence has not been previously reported. It should be noted, however, that Pediastrum is recorded in the fossil record7, which indicates a very resistant cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W198066573,"Abstract Cultures of Clostridium perfringens produce a factor that stimulates the thyroid. The stimulating factor has been purified 300-fold by fractionation of the growth medium with ammonium sulfate, filtration on Sephadex G-100, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purified factor contains no proteolytic activity, and has been separated from neuraminidase and lecithinase C. When incubated with thyroid slices the purified factor, like thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulates glucose-1-14C oxidation, phospholipid synthesis, and the formation of intracellular colloid droplets. When injected into chicks, the factor causes the depletion of radioiodine. The factor is thought to be a protein since its activity is destroyed by treatment with Pronase. Its behavior on Sephadex G-100 suggests a molecular weight of about 30,000."

Annealing at 199°K gives an eight-line thymine-like spectrum which also has a marked angular dependence. For dry, oriented DNA, the unresolved spectrum dominates even at room temperature, and the spectra exhibit lower degrees of anisotropy."

https://openalex.org/W1643922322,"Abstract Characteristics of electron paramagnetic resonance absorption spectra of a single crystal of hemoprotein are examined at liquid nitrogen temperature and a microwave frequency of 9.250 GHz with monocrystalline samples of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin. Not only the apparent g values, as observed by Ingram and co-workers, but also the amplitudes and widths of resonance absorption lines are highly dependent on the orientation of the crystal, relative to the applied magnetic field. The amplitudes of the individual absorption lines of a single crystal of ferrimyoglobin are drastically reduced by both repeated freezing and extensive drying of the sample. However, the orientation of heme groups, with respect to the crystalline axes, is not greatly altered by these treatments. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of single crystals of cytochrome c peroxidase and its fluoride complex indicate that the structures of crystals of these compounds are far more susceptible to repeated freezing and drying than those of ferrimyoglobin. Low temperature resonance spectra of a single crystal of cytochrome c peroxidase exhibit unusual characteristics which cannot be interpreted in terms of either an ideal single crystal containing only a very small number of nonequivalent paramagnetic centers or a disordered crystal in which all the paramagnetic centers are randomly oriented. These spectral characteristics may be caused by the superposition of many absorption lines derived from paramagnetic centers partially disoriented on freezing. The cross-linking of monocrystalline samples of cytochrome c peroxidase provides excellent protection against the adverse effect of repeated freezing and drying on the crystalline structure."

The same activity can be demonstrated in the serum and plasma of human beings, pigs and rabbits, but not of frogs3. The blood pressure response to this active pressor principle (APP) was demonstrated in rats during an infusion of hypotonic glucose and compared with the hypertensive effect of synthetic angiotensin1. Because APP seems to be different from known hypertensive polypeptides and renin1, further purification of it is of interest."
