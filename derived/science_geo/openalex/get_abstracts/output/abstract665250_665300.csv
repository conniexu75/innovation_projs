https://openalex.org/W3028201343,"Owing the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an advanced open source to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for screening. However, thus far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although realistic and high-risk attacks using universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), a single (input image agnostic) perturbation that can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks, are available. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs. We consider non-targeted UAPs, which cause a task failure, resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to non-targeted and targeted UAPs, even in the case of small UAPs. In particular, the 2% norm of the UAPs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves &gt;85% and &gt;90% success rates for the non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Owing to the non-targeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs allow the DNN models to classify most chest X-ray images into a specified target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of DNN models against UAPs."
https://openalex.org/W3112228391,"On March 24, 2020 India implemented a national lockdown to prevent spread of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among its 1.3 billion people. As the pandemic may disproportionately impact women and girls, this study examines gender differences in knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors, as well as the adverse effects of the lockdown among adolescents and young adults. A mobile phone-based survey was implemented from April 3–22, 2020 in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar among respondents randomly selected from an existing cohort study. Respondents answered questions related to demographics, COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors practiced, and impacts on social, economic and health outcomes. Descriptive analyses and linear probability regression models were performed for all participants and separately for men and women. A total of 1,666 adolescents and young adults (18–24 years old) were surveyed; 70% were women. While most participants had high awareness of disease symptoms and preventive behaviors, there was variation by gender. Compared to men, women were seven percentage points (pp) less likely to know the main symptoms of COVID-19 (coeff = -0.071; 95% confidence interval: -0.122 - -0.021). Among women, there was variation in knowledge by education level, urban residence, and household wealth. Women were 22 pp less likely to practice key preventive behaviors compared to men (coeff = -0.222; 95% CIL -0.263, -0.181). Women were also more likely to report recent depressive symptoms than men (coeff = 0.057; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.109). Our findings underscore that COVID-19 is already disproportionately impacting adolescent girls and young women and that they may require additional targeted, gender-sensitive messaging to foster behavior change. Gender-sensitive information campaigns and provision of health services must be accessible and provide women and girls with needed resources and support during the pandemic to ensure gains in public health and gender equity are not lost."
https://openalex.org/W3110706529,"Karnataka, a state in south India, reported its first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on March 8, 2020, more than a month after the first case was reported in India. We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 91 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into seven lineages (Pangolin lineages—A, B, B.1, B.1.80, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 17 contact clusters and 24 cases with no known contacts. We found 14 of the 17 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (12/17) were contained within a single district, reflecting local spread. In most of the 17 clusters, the index case (12/17) and spreaders (11/17) were symptomatic. Of the 91 sequences, 47 belonged to the B.6 lineage, including eleven of 24 cases with no known contact, indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka suggests multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution. This is the first study from India combining genomic data with epidemiological information emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to outbreak response."
https://openalex.org/W3112664830,"Social trust has been an important mechanism in overcoming crises throughout history. Several societies are now emphasizing its role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate how variations in social trust across 68 countries are related to the transmission speed of COVID-19. Specifically, using cross-national index data from the World Value Survey, the study tests how variations in social trust across countries generate different time durations at which each country reaches the peak in terms of increases in new infections of COVID-19. Using data drawn between December 31, 2019 and July 31, 2020, this study found that in countries with a high level of social trust, particularly trust among ingroup members, or with a narrower or wider range than the intermediate range of trustees, the number of new infections tended to reach the first peak within a shorter time duration than in other countries. These results imply that in such societies, on the one hand, high cooperation among people to achieve common goals and strong compliance to social norms may allow them to begin neutralizing COVID-19 faster. On the other hand, however, the low risk perception and prevalence of cohesive relationships among people may lead to speedier transmission of COVID-19 before neutralization takes place."
https://openalex.org/W3112350782,"Disease progression (DP) in interstitial lung disease (ILD) is variable and difficult to predict. In previous reports, serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) was suggested to be useful in diagnosing and predicting survival in ILD. The aim of our study was to investigate the usefulness of serum KL-6 as a predictor of DP in ILD. Clinical data of 199 patients with ILD (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: 22.8%) were prospectively collected and serum KL-6 levels were measured. DP was defined as a relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 10%, acute exacerbation, or death during follow-up. The median follow-up period was 11.1 months. The mean age of the subjects was 62.2 years, and 59.8% were male. DP occurred in 21.6% of patients. The progressed group showed lower FVC, lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, lower the minimum oxygen saturation during the 6-minute walk test, higher fibrosis scores on high-resolution computed tomography, and higher KL-6 levels (826.3 vs. 629.0 U/mL; p &lt; 0.001) than those of the non-progressed group. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, serum KL-6 levels were a significant predictor of DP in ILD (area under the curve = 0.629, p = 0.009, and the optimal cut-off level was 811 U/mL). In multivariable Cox analysis, high serum KL-6 levels (≥ 800 U/mL) were only independently associated with DP in ILD (HR 2.689, 95% CI 1.445–5.004, P = 0.002). Serum KL-6 levels might be useful to predict DP in patients with ILD."
https://openalex.org/W3112230406,"We present the results from a white-box machine learning approach to detect cardiac arrhythmias using electrocardiographic data. A C5.0 is trained to recognize four classes using common features. The four classes are (i) atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, (ii) tachycardias (iii), sinus bradycardia and (iv) sinus rhythm. Data from 10,646 subjects, 83% of whom have at least one arrhythmia and 17% of whom exhibit a normal sinus rhythm, are used. The C5.0 is trained using 10-fold cross-validation and is able to achieve a balanced accuracy of 95.35%. By using the white-box machine learning approach, a clear and comprehensible tree structure can be revealed, which has selected the 5 most important features from a total of 24 features. These 5 features are ventricular rate, RR-Interval variation, atrial rate, age and difference between longest and shortest RR-Interval. The combination of ventricular rate, RR-Interval variation and atrial rate is especially relevant to achieve classification accuracy, which can be disclosed through the tree. The tree assigns unique values to distinguish the classes. These findings could be applied in medicine in the future. It can be shown that a white-box machine learning approach can reveal granular structures, thus confirming known linear relationships and also revealing nonlinear relationships. To highlight the strength of the C5.0 with respect to this structural revelation, the results of further white-box machine learning and black-box machine learning algorithms are presented."
https://openalex.org/W3112203554,"Developing a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been challenging, primarily due to high levels of antigen polymorphism and a complex parasite lifecycle. Immunization with the P . falciparum merozoite antigens PfMSRP5, PfSERA9, PfRAMA, PfCyRPA and PfRH5 has been shown to give rise to growth inhibitory and synergistic antisera. Therefore, these five merozoite proteins are considered to be promising candidates for a second-generation multivalent malaria vaccine. Nevertheless, little is known about IgG and IgM responses to these antigens in populations that are naturally exposed to P . falciparum . In this study, serum samples from clinically immune adults and malaria exposed children from Ghana were studied to compare levels of IgG and IgM specific for PfMSRP5, PfSERA9, PfRAMA, PfCyRPA and PfRH5. All five antigens were found to be specifically recognized by both IgM and IgG in serum from clinically immune adults and from children with malaria. Longitudinal analysis of the latter group showed an early, transient IgM response that was followed by IgG, which peaked 14 days after the initial diagnosis. IgG levels and parasitemia did not correlate, whereas parasitemia was weakly positively correlated with IgM levels. These findings show that IgG and IgM specific for merozoite antigens PfMSRP5, PfSERA9, PfRAMA, PfCyRPA and PfRH5 are high in children during P . falciparum malaria, but that the IgM induction and decline occurs earlier in infection than that of IgG."
https://openalex.org/W3112964021,"Caste polymorphism in eusocial insects is based on morphological plasticity and linked to physiological and behavioral characteristics. To test the possibility that dopamine production in the brain is associated with the caste-specific morphology and behavior in female honey bees, an intermediate caste was produced via artificial rearing using different amounts of diet, before quantifying the dopamine levels and conducting behavioral tests. In field colonies, individual traits such as mandibular shape, number of ovarioles, diameter of spermatheca, and dopamine levels in the brain differed significantly between workers and queens. Females given 1.5 times the amount of artificial diet that control worker receives during the larval stage in the laboratory had characteristics intermediate between castes. The dopamine levels in the brain were positively correlated with the mandibular shape indexes, number of ovarioles, and spermatheca diameter among artificially reared females. The dopamine levels were significantly higher in females with mandibular notches than those without. In fighting experiments with the intermediate caste females, the winners had significantly higher dopamine levels in the brain than the losers. Brain levels of tyrosine were positively correlated with those of catecholamines but not phenolamines, thereby suggesting a strong metabolic relationship between tyrosine and dopamine. Thus, the caste-specific characteristics of the honey bee are potentially continuous in the same manner as those in primitively eusocial species. Dopamine production in the brain is associated with the continuous caste-specific morphology, as well as being linked to the amount of tyrosine taken from food, and it supports the aggressive behavior of queen-type females."
https://openalex.org/W3111366149,"In this paper, we propose two new families of estimators for estimating the finite population distribution function in the presence of non-response under simple random sampling. The proposed estimators require information on the sample distribution functions of the study and auxiliary variables, and additional information on either sample mean or ranks of the auxiliary variable. We considered two situations of non-response (i) non-response on both study and auxiliary variables, (ii) non-response occurs only on the study variable. The performance of the proposed estimators are compared with the existing estimators available in the literature, both theoretically and numerically. It is also observed that proposed estimators are more precise than the adapted distribution function estimators in terms of the percentage relative efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3111527338,"Objective Suicide is a leading cause of death among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Friends, family and frontline workers (for example, teachers, youth workers) are often best positioned to provide initial assistance if someone is at risk of suicide. We developed culturally appropriate expert consensus guidelines on how to provide mental health first aid to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviour and used this as the basis for a 5-hour suicide gatekeeper training course called Talking About Suicide. This paper describes the outcomes for participants in an uncontrolled trial of this training course. Methods We undertook an uncontrolled trial of the Talking About Suicide course, delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health First Aid instructors to 192 adult (i.e. 18 years of age or older) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (n = 110) and non-Indigenous (n = 82) participants. Questionnaires capturing self-report outcomes were self-administered immediately before (n = 192) and after attending the training course (n = 188), and at four-months follow-up (n = 98). Outcome measures were beliefs about suicide, stigmatising attitudes, confidence in ability to assist, and intended and actual actions to assist a suicidal person. Results Despite a high level of suicide literacy among participants at pre-course measurement, improvements at post-course were observed in beliefs about suicide, stigmatising attitudes, confidence in ability to assist and intended assisting actions. While attrition at follow-up decreased statistical power, some improvements in beliefs about suicide, stigmatising attitudes and intended assisting actions remained statistically significant at follow-up. Importantly, actual assisting actions taken showed dramatic improvements between pre-course and follow-up. Participants reported feeling more confident to assist a suicidal person after the course and this was maintained at follow-up. The course was judged to be culturally appropriate by those participants who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders. Implications The results of this uncontrolled trial were encouraging, suggesting that the Talking About Suicide course was able to improve participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and intended assisting actions as well as actual actions taken."
https://openalex.org/W3111570414,"Viral infections were investigated in American black bears ( Ursus americanus ) from Nevada and northern California with and without idiopathic encephalitis. Metagenomics analyses of tissue pools revealed novel viruses in the genera Circoviridae , Parvoviridae , Anelloviridae , Polyomaviridae , and Papillomaviridae . The circovirus and parvovirus were of particular interest due to their potential importance as pathogens. We characterized the genomes of these viruses and subsequently screened bears by PCR to determine their prevalence. The circovirus (Ursus americanus circovirus, UaCV) was detected at a high prevalence (10/16, 67%), and the chaphamaparvovirus ( Ursus americanus parvovirus, UaPV) was found in a single bear. We showed that UaCV is present in liver, spleen/lymph node, and brain tissue of selected cases by in situ hybridization (ISH) and PCR. Infections were detected in cases of idiopathic encephalitis and in cases without inflammatory brain lesions. Infection status was not clearly correlated with disease, and the significance of these infections remains unclear. Given the known pathogenicity of a closely related mammalian circovirus, and the complex manifestations of circovirus-associated diseases, we suggest that UaCV warrants further study as a possible cause or contributor to disease in American black bears."
https://openalex.org/W3113001505,"Background Primary acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare exocrine tumor of the pancreas with unclear clinical characteristics. Our goal was to determine the incidence and update the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ACC. Methods Through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 252 patients with the latest diagnosis of ACC (2004–2016). The age-adjusted incidence (AAI) was calculated using the SEER*Stat Software version 8.3.6. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to draw survival curves and differences among them were compared by the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate factors that had independent predictive effects on the overall survival. Results The AAI of pancreatic ACC was on the rise with the mean age at diagnosis of 63.79±14.79 years. Most patients (15.9%) had poorer differentiated tumors. The patients presented with distant stage were 54.4% compared with 53.1% between 1988 and 2003. The 1-, 2-, and 5-years survival rates for pancreatic ACC patients were 53.5%, 34.6%,17.5%, respectively (compared with 78.5%, 67.0%, and 42.8%, between 1988 and 2003). The multivariate COX analysis showed that the patient's age, surgery, chemotherapy, and summary stage, but not marital status were independent prognosis factors for ACC. Conclusions Pancreatic ACC is a highly malignant tumor with an increasing incidence in recent years. The rate of distant metastasis is increasing and the survival rate is worse than in the past, suggesting that it may require more aggressive treatment and follow-up. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are all effective treatments, but prospective studies are still needed to verify them."
https://openalex.org/W3111041295,"Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes diseases ranging from uncomplicated pharyngitis to life-threatening infections. It has complex epidemiology driven by the diversity, the temporal and geographical fluctuations of the circulating strains. Despite the global burden of GAS diseases, there is currently no available vaccination strategy against GAS infections. This study, based on a longitudinal population survey, aimed to understand the dynamic of GAS emm types and to give leads to better recognition of underlying mechanisms for the emergence of successful clones. From 2009 to 2017, we conducted a systematic culture-based diagnosis of GAS infections in a French Brittany population with a prospective recovery of clinical data. The epidemiological analysis was performed using emm typing combined with the structural and functional cluster-typing system for all the recovered strains. Risk factors for the invasiveness, identified by univariate analysis, were computed in a multiple logistic regression analysis, and the only independent risk factor remaining in the model was the age (OR for the entire range [CI 95% ] = 6.35 [3.63, 11.10]; p &lt;0.0001). Among the 61 different emm types identified, the most prevalent were emm 28 (16%), emm 89 (15%), emm 1 (14%), and emm 4 (8%), which accounted for more than 50% of circulating strains. During the study period, five genotypes identified as emm 44, 66, 75, 83, 87 emerged successively and belonged to clusters D4, E2, E3, and E6 that were different from those gathering “Prevalent” emm types (clusters A-C3 to 5, E1 and E4). We previously reported significant genetic modifications for emm 44, 66, 83 and 75 types resulting possibly from a short adaptive evolution. Herein we additionally observed that the emergence of a new genotype could occur in a susceptible population having specific risk factors or probably lacking a naturally-acquired cluster-specific immune cross-protection. Among emergent emm types, emm 75 and emm 87 tend to become prevalent with a stable annual incidence and the risk of a clonal expansion have to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3111243483,"Reactive oxygen species are bona fide intracellular second messengers that influence cell metabolism and aging by mechanisms that are incompletely resolved. Mitochondria generate superoxide that is dis-mutated to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn oxidises cysteine-based enzymes such as phosphatases, peroxiredoxins and redox-sensitive transcription factors to modulate their activity. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3) has been shown to participate in an oxidative relay with peroxiredoxin II but the impact of Stat3 oxidation on target gene expression and its biological consequences remain to be established. Thus, we created murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that express either WT-Stat3 or a redox-insensitive mutant of Stat3 (Stat3-C3S). The Stat3-C3S cells differed from WT-Stat3 cells in morphology, proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress; in response to cytokine stimulation, they displayed elevated Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and Socs3 expression, implying that Stat3-C3S is insensitive to oxidative inhibition. Comparative analysis of global gene expression in WT-Stat3 and Stat3-C3S cells revealed differential expression (DE) of genes both under basal conditions and during oxidative stress. Using differential gene regulation pattern analysis, we identified 199 genes clustered into 10 distinct patterns that were selectively responsive to Stat3 oxidation. GO term analysis identified down-regulated genes to be enriched for tissue/organ development and morphogenesis and up-regulated genes to be enriched for cell-cell adhesion, immune responses and transport related processes. Although most DE gene promoters contain consensus Stat3 inducible elements (SIEs), our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq analyses did not detect Stat3 binding at these sites in control or oxidant-stimulated cells, suggesting that oxidised Stat3 regulates these genes indirectly. Our further computational analysis revealed enrichment of hypoxia response elements (HREs) within DE gene promoters, implying a role for Hif-1. Experimental validation revealed that efficient stabilisation of Hif-1α in response to oxidative stress or hypoxia required an oxidation-competent Stat3 and that depletion of Hif-1α suppressed the inducible expression of Kcnb1 , a representative DE gene. Our data suggest that Stat3 and Hif-1α cooperate to regulate genes involved in immune functions and developmental processes in response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3112562317,"The molecular function of a protein relies on its structure. Understanding how variants alter structure and function in multidomain proteins is key to elucidate the generation of a pathological phenotype. However, one may fall into the logical bias of assessing protein damage only based on the variants that are visible (survivorship bias), which can lead to partial conclusions. This is the case of PNKP, an important nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme with both kinase and phosphatase function. Most variants in PNKP are confined to the kinase domain, leading to a pathological spectrum of three apparently distinct clinical entities. Since proteins and domains may have a different tolerability to variation, we evaluated whether variants in PNKP are under survivorship bias. Here, we provide the evidence that supports a higher tolerance in the kinase domain even when all variants reported are deleterious. Instead, the phosphatase domain is less tolerant due to its lower variant rates, a higher degree of sequence conservation, lower dN/dS ratios, and the presence of more disease-propensity hotspots. Together, our results support previous experimental evidence that demonstrated that the phosphatase domain is functionally more necessary and relevant for DNA repair, especially in the context of the development of the central nervous system. Finally, we propose the term ""Wald’s domain"" for future studies analyzing the possible survivorship bias in multidomain proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3112323009,"Background Recent molecular characterization of urothelial cancer (UC) has suggested potential pathways in which to direct treatment, leading to a host of targeted therapies in development for UC. In parallel, gene expression profiling has demonstrated that high-grade UC is a heterogeneous disease. Prognostic basal-like and luminal-like subtypes have been identified and an accurate transcriptome BASE47 classifier has been developed. However, these phenotypes cannot be broadly investigated due to the lack of a clinically viable diagnostic assay. We sought to develop and evaluate a diagnostic classifier of UC subtype with the goal of accurate classification from clinically available specimens. Methods Tumor samples from 52 patients with high-grade UC were profiled for BASE47 genes concurrently by RNAseq as well as NanoString. After design and technical validation of a BASE47 NanoString probeset, results from the RNAseq and NanoString were used to translate diagnostic criteria to the Nanostring platform. Evaluation of repeatability and accuracy was performed to derive a final Nanostring based classifier. Diagnostic classification resulting from the NanoString BASE47 classifier was validated on an independent dataset (n = 30). The training and validation datasets accurately classified 87% and 93% of samples, respectively. Results Here we have derived a NanoString-platform BASE47 classifier that accurately predicts basal-like and luminal-like subtypes in high grade urothelial cancer. We have further validated our new NanoString BASE47 classifier on an independent dataset and confirmed high accuracy when compared with our original Transcriptome BASE47 classifier. Conclusions The NanoString BASE47 classifier provides a faster turnaround time, a lower cost per sample to process, and maintains the accuracy of the original subtype classifier for better clinical implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3112681529,"High-risk coronary plaques have been considered predictive of adverse cardiac events. Both wall shear stress (WSS) in patients with hemodynamically significant lesions and optical coherence tomography (OCT) -verified thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) are associated with plaque rupture, the most common underlying mechanism of acute coronary syndrome. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that invasive coronary angiography-based high WSS is associated with the presence of TCFA detected by OCT in obstructive lesions. From a prospective study of patients who underwent OCT examination for angiographically obstructive lesions (Yellow II), we selected patients who had two angiographic projections to create a 3-dimensional reconstruction model to allow assessment of WSS. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence and absence of TCFA. Mean WSS was assessed in the whole lesion and in the proximal, middle and distal segments. Of 70 patients, TCFA was observed in 13 (19%) patients. WSS in the proximal segment (WSS proximal ) (10.20 [5.01, 16.93Pa]) and the whole lesion (WSS lesion ) (12.37 [6.36, 14.55Pa]) were significantly higher in lesions with TCFA compared to WSS proximal (5.84 [3.74, 8.29Pa], p = 0.02) and WSS lesion (6.95 [4.41, 11.60], p = 0.04) in lesions without TCFA. After multivariate analysis, WSS proximal was independently associated with the presence of TCFA (Odds ratio 1.105; 95%CI 1.007–1.213, p = 0.04). The optimal cutoff value of WSS proximal to predict TCFA was 6.79 Pa (AUC: 0.71; sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.63 p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate that high WSS in the proximal segments of obstructive lesions is an independent predictor of OCT-verified TCFA."
https://openalex.org/W3112715032,"Purpose To develop an equation to provide the peak power (PP) through a specific stimulus performed in an aquatic environment, as well as to correlate morphological, anthropometric and strength variables with rowing performance. Methods The sample consisted of 16 elite young rowing athletes of both sexes (15.7 ± 1.21 years). The strength of upper limbs and lower limbs was verified. To analyze the PP, a 100-m Sprint test was performed on an indoor rowing type ergometer, and after a 72-hour wash-out, the test was repeated in an aquatic environment on a vessel equipped with a global position system. Body composition was analyzed by examining bone densitometry with an X-ray source and maturation was verified by anthropometry. Results The tests for water sprint and indoor rowing showed significant reliability (ICC = 0.695; p = 0.0007). The PP aquatic showed reliability with that acquired in indoor rowing (ICC = 0.897; p&lt;0.0001) and was related to maturation (p&lt;0.05). The morphology, anthropometry and strength of the upper limbs were related to the sprint and peak strength in both tests (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion The equation for the PP in aquatic environment presented by the present study is highly reliable with an indoor ergometer digital ergometer."
https://openalex.org/W3112738423,"This study identified factors associated with adherence to a 6-month isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) course among adolescents and children living with HIV. Forty adolescents living with HIV and 48 primary caregivers of children living with HIV completed a Likert-based survey to measure respondent opinions regarding access to care, quality of care, preferred regimens, perceived stigma, and confidence in self-efficacy. Sociodemographic data were collected and adherence measured as the average of pill counts obtained while on IPT. The rates of suboptimal adherence (&lt; 95% adherent) were 22.5% among adolescents and 37.5% among the children of primary caregivers. Univariate logistic regression was used to model the change in the odds of suboptimal adherence. Independent factors associated with suboptimal adherence among adolescents included age, education level, the cost of coming to clinic, stigma from community members, and two variables relating to self-efficacy. Among primary caregivers, child age, concerns about stigma, and location preference for meeting a community-health worker were associated with suboptimal adherence. To determine whether these combined factors contributed different information to the prediction of suboptimal adherence, a risk score containing these predictors was constructed for each group. The risk score had an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.99) among adolescents and an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.90), among primary caregivers suggesting that these variables may have complementary predictive utility. The heterogeneous scope and associations of these variables in different populations suggests that interventions aiming to increase optimal adherence will need to be tailored to specific populations and multifaceted in nature. Ideally interventions should address both long-established barriers to adherence such as cost of transportation to attend clinic and more nuanced psychosocial barriers such as perceived community stigma and confidence in self-efficacy."

For a safe operation of road tunnels, it is necessary to understand a driver’s physiological indices and driving performance when driving through tunnels. In this study, the UC-Win/Road simulation software was used to build 12 tunnel models of different lengths. A simulated driving experiment was carried out in a 6-DoF motion platform. The lateral position of vehicles characterizing the driving performance was measured using the motion platform. Electrocardiogram and eye movement data of 25 recruited drivers were collected simultaneously through the experiment. The spatial changes in a driver’s heart rate (HR) growth rate, RMSSD, pupil diameter growth rate and vehicle lateral deviation within 300 m before and after the tunnel entrance and exit were analyzed to determine the variation rules in the different tunnels. The study identified the length range in the tunnel entrance and exit sections that influences the drivers. A quantitative analysis was further carried out to analyze the relationship between the physiological indices and the driving performance indicator. The results showed that a driver’s heart rate fluctuates significantly 250 m before the tunnel entrance and 50 m before the exit. In this region, the pupil diameter increases gradually, and drivers tend to shift the vehicle to the left. At the tunnel exit, the HR and RMSSD are affected significantly by the tunnel length, and the variation is higher in longer tunnels. In comparison, the tunnel length has no significant effect on the physiological indicators and driving performance of the drivers at the entrance and exit."
https://openalex.org/W3111552161,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves treatment with lower blood glucose levels and less patient effort. In combination with continuous insulin application, glycemic control improves and hypoglycemic episodes should decrease. Direct feedback of CGM to continuous subcutaneous insulin application, using an algorithm is called a closed-loop (CL) artificial pancreas system. Commercial devices stop insulin application by predicting hypoglycemic blood glucose levels through direct interaction between the sensor and pump. The prediction is usually made for about 30 minutes and insulin delivery is restarted at the previous level if a rise in blood glucose is predicted within the next 30 minutes (hybrid closed loop system, HCL this is known as a predictive low glucose suspend system (PLGS)). In a fully CL system, sensor and pump communicate permanently with each other. Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems, which require the user to estimate the meal size and provide a meal insulin basis, are commercially available in Germany at the moment. These systems result in fewer hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes with improved glucose control. Open source initiatives have provided support by building do-it-yourself CL (DIYCL) devices for automated insulin application since 2014, and are used by a tech-savvy subgroup of patients. The first commercial hybrid CL system has been available in Germany since September 2019. We surveyed 1054 patients to determine which devices are currently used, which features would be in demand by potential users, and the benefits of DIYCL systems. 9.7% of these used a DIYCL system, while 50% would most likely trust these systems but more than 85% of the patients would use a commercial closed loop system, if available. The DIYCL users had a better glucose control regarding their time in range (TIR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)."
https://openalex.org/W3111689728,"Objectives Residual cysts are relatively rare inflammatory cysts of the jaws. They are essentially radicular cysts without the presence of the offending dentition. These lesions have the ability to destroy bone within the jaws without any symptoms. Moreover, they can mimic more aggressive cysts and tumours on radiographs. The aim of this study was to describe the clinico-pathological features of residual cysts in order to discern them from other cystic lesions as well as analyse their management and recurrence patterns. Materials and methods Sixty-four histopathologically confirmed residual cysts were analysed based on their clinical, radiological and histopathological features. Their management and follow-up were also noted. Results The majority of lesions presented in elderly (46.8%), edentulous patients (60.9%) and were most commonly found in the posterior regions of the mandible (51.6%). Clinico-pathological features that aided in their diagnosis included long-standing history with slow growing swelling and presence of well-defined, unilocular cystic lesion associated with previously extracted dentition. Enucleation was a successful method in the management of residual cysts with very low recurrence rate (1.6%). Two patients (3.1%) developed squamous cell carcinoma from the cyst lining. Conclusion Residual cysts should be high on the list of differential diagnosis when elderly, edentulous patients present with cystic lesions in the jaws compared to dentate patients ( P &lt;0.01). All lesions should by biopsied and sent for histopathological examination along with radiological correlation as they have the potential to transform into primary intra-osseous squamous cell carcinoma with devastating consequences to the patient."
https://openalex.org/W3112115787,"Maize, Zea mays L., is the most abundant field crop in China. Aphids are the most economically damaging pest on maize, particularly in the maize agri-ecosystems of Jilin Province, northeastern China. Parasitic wasps are important natural enemies of aphids, but limited information exists about their species composition, richness and seasonal dynamics in northeastern China. In this study, the population dynamics of maize aphids and parasitoid wasps were assessed in relation to each other during the summer seasons of two consecutive years, 2018 and 2019. We selected maize fields in the Changchun, Songyuan, Huinan and Gongzhuling areas of Jilin Province. Four species of aphids were recorded from these maize fields: Rhopalosiphum padi (L), Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch ) , Aphis gossypii Glover and Macrosiphum miscanthi (Takahashi). The dominant species in each of the four areas were R . maids (Filch) and R . padi in Changchun, R . padi in Songyuan, A . gossypii and R . padi in Huinan, and A . gossypii and R . padi in Gongzhuling. We delineated a species complex made up of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids associated with maize aphids. The primary parasitoids Lysiphlebus testaceipes , Binodoxys communis and Aphelinus albipodus together formed approximately 85.3% of the parasitoid complex. Pachyneuron aphidis , Phaenoglyphis villosa , Syrphophagus taeniatus and Asaphes suspensus made up the hyperparasitoids. Of the primary parasitoids, L . testaceipes was the dominant species (81.31%). Of the hyperparasitoid group, P . villosa was the dominant species (68.42%). Parasitism rates followed the fluctuation of the aphid population. The highest parasitic rate was observed during the peak period of cotton aphids. In this paper, the occurrence dynamics and dominant species of aphids and the dynamics of parasitic natural enemies of aphids in maize fields in Jilin Province are, for the first time, systematically reported. This study provides important information for the establishment and promotion of aphid biological control in maize fields."
https://openalex.org/W3112471711,"Background Chronic rhinosinusitis may be associated with nasal polyposis. Recurrence of disease is often observed and may be due to an intolerance of acetylsalicylic acid. Sex hormones are known to modulate allergic reactions and inflammation. Whether they may be involved in the development and progression of nasal polyposis has not been investigated yet. Aim Examine the relationship between levels of sex hormones and nasal polyposis. Methods Hormonal levels (estradiol, testosterone and progesterone) in patients with nasal polyposis (n = 26) with or without acetylsalicylic acid-intolerance were determined and compared to hormonal levels in patients with septal deviation (n = 35). Cone-beam computed tomography scans were analysed by using scores as defined by Lund and Mackay and by Kennedy. Results Our results show a 5 times greater odds (p = 0.01) for developing nasal polyposis in the presence of lowered estradiol plasma levels than in the presence of normal / elevated levels. When analyzing females and males separately, a 6 times greater odds for females to develop nasal polyposis in the presence of lowered estradiol plasma levels was calculated (p = 0.02). Thus, females are more likely to develop nasal polyposis when they have lowered estradiol levels than males. In addition, female patients showed an increased risk for developing ASA intolerance (p = 0.01). Conclusion Variation of sex hormones may be involved in nasal polyposis. Further studies including more patients to validate the presented results are required. Significance Retrospective clinical investigation suggesting a correlation between varying sex hormones and nasal polyposis."
https://openalex.org/W3112776883,"Tissue fibrosis is a significant health issue associated with organ dysfunction and failure. Increased deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the interstitial area is a major process in tissue fibrosis. The microRNA-29 (miR-29) family has been demonstrated as anti-fibrotic microRNAs. Our recent work showed that dysregulation of miR-29 contributes to the formation of cardiac fibrosis in animal models of uremic cardiomyopathy, whereas replenishing miR-29 attenuated cardiac fibrosis in these animals. However, excessive overexpression of miR-29 is a concern because microRNAs usually have multiple targets, which could result in unknown and unexpected side effect. In the current study, we constructed a novel Col1a1-miR-29b vector using collagen 1a1 (Col1a1) promoter, which can strategically express miR-29b-3p (miR-29b) in response to increased collagen synthesis and reach a dynamic balance between collagen and miR-29b. Our experimental results showed that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF cells) transfected with Col1a1-miR-29b vector, the miR-29b expression is about 1000 times less than that in cells transfected with CMV-miR-29b vector, which uses cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a promoter for miR-29b expression. Moreover, TGF-β treatment increased the miR-29b expression by about 20 times in cells transfected with Col1a1-miR-29b, suggesting a dynamic response to fibrotic stimulation. Western blot using cell lysates and culture media demonstrated that transfection of Col1a1-miR-29b vector significantly reduced TGF-β induced collagen synthesis and secretion, and the effect was as effective as the CMV-miR-29b vector. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we found that 249 genes were significantly altered (180 upregulated and 69 downregulated, at least 2-fold change and adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) after TGF-β treatment in MEF cells transfected with empty vector. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis using GAGE R-package showed that the top 5 upregulated pathways after TGF-β treatment were mostly fibrosis-related, including focal adhesion, ECM reaction, and TGF-β signaling pathways. As expected, transfection of Col1a1-miR-29b or CMV-miR-29b vector partially reversed the activation of these pathways. We also analyzed the expression pattern of the top 100 miR-29b targeting genes in these cells using the RNA-sequencing data. We identified that miR-29b targeted a broad spectrum of ECM genes, but the inhibition effect is mostly moderate. In summary, our work demonstrated that the Col1a1-miR-29b vector can be used as a dynamic regulator of collagen and other ECM protein expression in response to fibrotic stimulation, which could potentially reduce unnecessary side effect due to excessive miR-29b levels while remaining an effective potential therapeutic approach for fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3111430521,"Background and aims Assessing algorithms of artificial pancreas systems is critical in developing automated and fault-tolerant solutions that work outside clinical settings. The development and evaluation of algorithms can be facilitated with a platform that conducts virtual clinical trials. We present in this paper a clinically validated cloud-based distributed platform that supports the development and comprehensive testing of single and dual-hormone algorithms for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods The platform is built on principles of object-oriented design and runs user algorithms in real-time virtual clinical trials utilizing a multi-threaded environment enabled by concurrent execution over a cloud infrastructure. The platform architecture isolates user algorithms located on personal machines from proprietary patient data running on the cloud. Users import a plugin into their algorithms (Matlab, Python, or Java) to connect to the platform. Once connected, users interact with a graphical interface to design experimental protocols for their trials. Protocols include trial duration in days, mealtimes and amounts, variability in mealtimes and amounts, carbohydrate counting errors, snacks, and onboard insulin levels. Results The platform facilitates development by solving the ODE model in the cloud on large CPU-optimized machines, providing a 62% improvement in memory, speed and CPU utilization. Users can easily debug &amp; modify code, test multiple strategies, and generate detailed clinical performance reports. We validated and integrated into the platform a glucoregulatory system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized with clinical data to mimic the inter and intra-day variability of glucose responses of 15 T1DM patients. Conclusion The platform utilizes the validated patient model to conduct virtual clinical trials for the rapid development and testing of closed-loop algorithms for T1DM."
https://openalex.org/W3112101931,"Objectives In patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), reduced lumbar flexion-relaxation and reduced variability of muscle activity distribution are reported as abnormal muscle activity. It is not known how abnormal muscle activity and pain-related factors are related to CLBP-based disability. Here, we performed an association rule analysis to investigated how CLBP disability, muscle activity, and pain-related factors in CLBP patients are related. Methods Surface electromyographic signals were recorded from over the bilateral lumbar erector spinae muscle with four-channel electrodes from 24 CLBP patients while they performed a trunk flexion re-extension task. We calculated the average value of muscle activities of all channels and then calculated the flexion relaxation ratio (FRR) and the spatial variability of muscle activities. We also assessed the pain-related factors and CLBP disability by a questionnaire method. A clustering association rules analysis was performed to determine the relationships among pain-related factors, the FRR, and the variability of muscle activity distribution. Results The association rules of severe CLBP disability were divisible into five classes, including ‘low FRR-related rules.’ The rules of the mild CLBP disability were divisible into four classes, including ‘high FRR-related rules’ and ‘high muscle variability-related rules.’ When we combined pain-related factors with the FRR and muscle variability, the relationship between abnormal FRR/muscle variability and CLBP disability became stronger. Discussion Our findings thus highlight the importance of focusing on not only the patients’ pain-related factors but also the abnormal motor control associated with CLBP, which causes CLBP disability."
https://openalex.org/W3112128663,"In Bangladesh, there is currently no data on the burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) amongst hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of LTBI and compare the prevalence among HCWs in two public tertiary care hospitals. Between September 2018 and August 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional study in two public tertiary care general hospitals. Using a survey and tuberculin skin test (TST), we assessed risk factors for LTBI, adjusting for known and plausible confounders. In addition, a facility assessment was undertaken to understand the implementation of relevant IPC measures. The prevalence of LTBI among HCWs was 42%. HCWs spent a median of 6 hours (SD = 1.76, IQR 2.00) per day and attended an average of 1.87 pulmonary TB patients per week. HCWs did not receive any TB IPC training, the wards lacked a symptom checklist to screen patients for TB, and no masks were available for coughing patients. Seventy-seven percent reportedly did not use any facial protection (masks or respirators) while caring for patients. In the multivariable model adjusting for hospital level clustering effect, TST positivity was significantly higher among HCWs aged 35–45 years (aOR1.36, 95% CI: 1.06–1.73) and with &gt;3 years of service (aOR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.62–1.72). HCWs working in the medicine ward had 3.65 (95% CI: 2.20–6.05) times, and HCWs in the gynecology and obstetrics ward had 2.46 (95% CI: 1.42–4.27) times higher odds of TST positivity compared to HCWs working in administrative areas. This study identified high prevalence of LTBI among HCWs. This may be due to the level of exposure to pulmonary TB patients, and/or limited use of personal protective equipment along with poor implementation of TB IPC in the hospitals. Considering the high prevalence of LTBI, we recommend the national TB program consider providing preventative therapy to the HCWs as the high-risk group, and implement TB IPC in the hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3112693584,"Abiotic stresses especially salinity, drought and high temperature result in considerable reduction of crop productivity. In this study, we identified AT4G18280 annotated as a glycine-rich cell wall protein-like (hereafter refer to as GRPL1 ) protein as a potential multistress-responsive gene. Analysis of public transcriptome data and GUS assay of pGRPL1 :: GUS showed a strong induction of GRPL1 under drought, salinity and heat stresses. Transgenic plants overexpressing GRPL1 -3HA showed significantly higher germination, root elongation and survival rate under salt stress. Moreover, the 35S :: GRPL1-3HA transgenic lines also showed higher survival rates under drought and heat stresses. GRPL1 showed similar expression patterns with Abscisic acid (ABA)-pathway genes under different growth and stress conditions, suggesting a possibility that GRPL1 might act in the ABA pathway that is further supported by the inability of ABA-deficient mutant ( aba2-1 ) to induce GRPL1 under drought stress. Taken together, our data presents GRPL1 as a potential multi-stress responsive gene working downstream of ABA."
https://openalex.org/W3110684562,"Background Expiratory flow-initiated pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (EF-initiated PC-IRV) reduces physiological dead space. We hypothesised that EF-initiated PC-IRV would be lung protective compared with volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Methods Twenty-eight men undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were enrolled in this randomised controlled trial. The EF-initiated PC-IRV group (n = 14) used pressure-controlled ventilation with the volume guaranteed mode. The inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio was individually adjusted by observing the expiratory flow-time wave. The VCV group (n = 14) used the volume control mode with a 1:2 I:E ratio. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare differences in the serum cytokine levels. Results There were no significant differences in serum IL-6 between the EF-initiated PC-IRV (median 34 pg ml -1 (IQR 20.5 to 63.5)) and VCV (31 pg ml -1 (24.5 to 59)) groups ( P = 0.84). The physiological dead space rate (physiological dead space/expired tidal volume) was significantly reduced in the EF-initiated PC-IRV group as compared with that in the VCV group (0.31 ± 0.06 vs 0.4 ± 0.07; P &lt;0.001). The physiological dead space rate was negatively correlated with the forced vital capacity (% predicted) in the VCV group (r = -0.85, P &lt;0.001), but not in the EF-initiated PC-IRV group (r = 0.15, P = 0.62). Two patients in the VCV group had permissive hypercapnia with low forced vital capacity (% predicted). Conclusions There were no differences in the lung-protective properties between the two ventilatory strategies. However, EF-initiated PC-IRV reduced physiological dead space rate; thus, it may be useful for reducing the ventilatory volume that is necessary to maintain normocapnia in patients with low forced vital capacity (% predicted) during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3111367546,"Translocated captive-bred predators are less skilled at hunting than wild-born predators and more prone to starvation post-release. Foraging in an unfamiliar environment presents many further risks to translocated animals. Knowledge of the diet and foraging behaviour of translocated animals is therefore an important consideration of reintroductions. We investigated the diet of the endangered meso-predator, the eastern quoll Dasyurus viverrinus . We also opportunistically observed foraging behaviour, enabling us to examine risks associated with foraging. Sixty captive-bred eastern quolls were reintroduced to an unfenced reserve on mainland Australia (where introduced predators are managed) over a two year period (2018, 2019). Quolls were supplementary fed macropod meat but were also able to forage freely. Dietary analysis of scats (n = 56) revealed that quolls ate macropods, small mammals, birds, invertebrates, fish, reptiles and frogs, with some between-year differences in the frequency of different diet categories. We also observed quolls hunting live prey. Quolls utilised supplementary feeding stations, indicating that this may be an important strategy during the establishment phase. Our study demonstrated that, in a novel environment, captive-bred quolls were able to locate food and hunt live prey. However, foraging was not without risks; with the ingestion of toxic substances and foraging in dangerous environments found to be potentially harmful. Knowledge of the diet of reintroduced fauna in natural landscapes is important for understanding foraging behaviour and evaluating habitat suitability for future translocations and management."
https://openalex.org/W3112798877,"Background Albuminuria develops in ~40% of subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and is often associated with malnutrition, severe comorbidities and decreased life expectancy. The association between albuminuria and altered whole body protein turnover in T2DM is currently unknown. Objective To assess whole body protein degradation and synthesis in type 2 diabetes with and without albuminuria. Methods Fourteen T2DM male subjects, with either increased [AER+] or normal [AER-] urinary albumin excretion rate, and eleven age-matched male healthy controls, were infused with phenylalanine [Phe] and tyrosine [Tyr] tracers. Post-absorptive rates of appearance (Ra) of Phe (= protein degradation) and Tyr, Phe hydroxylation to Tyr (Hy) (catabolic pathway), and Phe disposal to protein synthesis [PS], were determined. Results Phe and Tyr Ra were not different among the groups. However, in T2DM [AER+], the fraction of Phe disposal to hydroxylation was ~50% and ~25% greater than that of both controls and T2DM [AER-] (p&lt;0.006 and p = 0.17, respectively). Conversely, as compared to controls, the fractional Phe disposal to PS was ~10% lower in T2DM [AER+] (p&lt;0.006), and not different from that in T2DM [AER-]. As a consequence, in T2DM [AER+], the ratio between the fractional Phe disposal to hydroxylation and that to PS was ~70% greater (p = 0.005) than that in healthy controls, whereas in the T2DM [AER-] this ratio was ~30% greater than in controls (p = 0.19). Conclusions On the basis of the kinetics of the essential amino acid phenylalanine, T2DM subjects with increased AER exhibit a catabolic pattern of whole body protein turnover."

An intriguing new development is the virtual physician, which can diagnose and treat patients independently. Methods and findings This qualitative study of advanced degree students aimed to assess their perceptions of using a virtual primary care physician as a patient. Four focus groups were held: first year medical students, fourth year medical students, first year engineering/data science graduate students, and fourth year engineering/data science graduate students. The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and content analyses of the transcripts was performed using a data-driven inductive approach. Themes identified concerned advantages, disadvantages, and the future of virtual primary care physicians. Within those main categories, 13 themes emerged and 31 sub-themes. Discussion While participants appreciated that a virtual primary care physician would be convenient, efficient, and cost-effective, they also expressed concern about data privacy and the potential for misdiagnosis. To garner trust from its potential users, future virtual primary physicians should be programmed with a sufficient amount of trustworthy data and have a high level of transparency and accountability for patients."
https://openalex.org/W3113211783,"In a previous study, we found that students' incoming preparation in physics—crudely measured by concept inventory prescores and math SAT or ACT scores—explains 34% of the variation in Physics 1 final exam scores at Stanford University. In this study, we sought to understand the large variation in exam scores not explained by these measures of incoming preparation. Why are some students’ successful in physics 1 independent of their preparation? To answer this question, we interviewed 34 students with particularly low concept inventory prescores and math SAT/ACT scores about their experiences in the course. We unexpectedly found a set of common practices and attitudes. We found that students’ use of instructional resources had relatively little impact on course performance, while student characteristics, student attitudes, and students’ interactions outside the classroom all had a more substantial impact on course performance. These results offer some guidance as to how instructors might help all students succeed in introductory physics courses."
https://openalex.org/W3111222983,"Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a naturally occurring appetite stimulant, associated with anxiety, stress, and excitement regulation. Neuropeptide S serves as a hypothalamic energy regulator that enhances food intake with a reduced level of satiety. NPS activates fat angiogenesis and the proliferation of new adipocytes in obesity. NPS has an established role in energy regulation by many pre-clinical investigations; however we have limited data available to support this notion in humans. We found significant association of Neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR1) Asn107Ile (rs324981, A&gt;T) polymorphism with obese male participants. The current investigation carried out genotype screening of NPSR1 allele to assess the spectrum of the Asn107Ile polymorphism in obese and healthy Pakistani individuals. We revealed a significant (p = 0.04) difference between AA vs TT + AT genotype distribution of NPSR1 (SNP rs324981,) between obese and healthy individuals ( p = 0.04). In this genotype analysis of (SNP rs324981) of the NPSR1 gene, T allele was marked as risk allele with higher frequency in the obese (38%) compared to its frequency in the controls (25%). Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP, rs324981) Asn107Ile of NPSR1gene, that switches an amino acid from Asn to Ile, has been found associated with increased susceptibility to obesity in Pakistani individuals. Furthermore, molecular simulation studies predicted a lower binding affinity of NPSR1 Asn107Ile variant to NPS than the wild-type consistent with the genotype studies. These molecular simulation studies predict a possible molecular mechanism of this interaction by defining the key amino acid residues. However, a significantly ( p &lt;0.0001) lower concentration of NPS was recorded independent of genotype frequencies in obese subjects compared to healthy controls. We believe that large scale polymorphism data of population for important gene players including NPSR1 will be more useful to understand obesity and its associated risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3111297177,"Background The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), commonly estimated using the serum creatinine value, often fluctuates throughout the serial measurement. The clinical significance of GFR variation among the general population with normal renal function has not yet been demonstrated. Thus, we explored the impact of GFR variability on adverse clinical outcomes. Methods A nationwide retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance System database was performed. National health screening examinees who underwent creatinine measurement ≥3 times between 2012 and 2016 were considered. Those with eGFR under 60 mL/min/m 2 were excluded. The fluctuation of eGFR was represented with variability independent of the mean (VIM) index; which was calculated by the standard deviation divided by the exponent of the regression coefficient of the mean. Then, the risks of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and death were assessed according to the quartiles of the VIM Results Of total 3,538,500 participants, 0.29% of myocardial infarction (MI), 0.14% of stroke, 0.36% of deaths were observed during the median follow up of 3.27 years. Participants with the highest VIM index, which represents the highest eGFR variability, were significantly associated with an increased risk of MI (hazard ratio [HR]; 1.10, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]; 1.04–1.16), stroke (HR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.09–1.23), and death (HR: 1.18; 95% CI 1.12–1.24). The elevated risk of adverse events was consistent after the multivariate adjustment with potential confounding factors, except the risk of MI (HR 1.06; 95% 1.00–1.06). Conclusions Increased eGFR variability exhibited an association with major clinical outcomes, indicating that monitoring eGFR variability might be a useful parameter for predicting the adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3111630241,"Baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) are increasingly being used to evaluate and monitor reef communities. Many BRUVS studies compare multiple sites sampled at single time points that may differ from the sampling time of another site. As BRUVS use grows in its application to provide data relevant to sustainable management, marine protected area success, and overall reef health, understanding repeatability of sampling results is vital. We examined the repeatability of BRUVS results for the elasmobranch community both within and between seasons and years, and explored environmental factors affecting abundances at two sites in Indonesia. On 956 BRUVS, 1139 elasmobranchs (69% rays, 31% sharks) were observed. We found consistent results in species composition and abundances within a season and across years. However, elasmobranch abundances were significantly higher in the wet season. The elasmobranch community was significantly different between the two sites sampled, one site being more coastal and easily accessed by fishermen. Our results demonstrate that while BRUVS are a reliable and repeatable method for surveying elasmobranchs, care must be taken in the timing of sampling between different regions to ensure that any differences observed are due to inherent differences amongst sampling areas as opposed to seasonal dissimilarities."
https://openalex.org/W3112980463,"The connexin 37 (Cx37) channel is clustered at gap junctions between cells in the renal vasculature or the renal tubule where it is abundant in basolateral cell interdigitations and infoldings of epithelial cells in the proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct; however, physiological data regarding its role are limited. In this study, we investigated the role of Cx37 in fluid homeostasis using mice with a global deletion of Cx37 (Cx37-/- mice). Under baseline conditions, Cx37-/- had ~40% higher fluid intake associated with ~40% lower urine osmolality compared to wild-type (WT) mice. No differences were observed between genotypes in urinary adenosine triphosphate or prostaglandin E2, paracrine factors that alter renal water handling. After 18-hours of water deprivation, plasma aldosterone and urine osmolality increased significantly in Cx37-/- and WT mice; however, the latter remained ~375 mmol/kg lower in Cx37-/- mice, an effect associated with a more pronounced body weight loss despite higher urinary AVP/creatinine ratios compared to WT mice. Consistent with this, fluid intake in the first 3 hours after water deprivation was 37% greater in Cx37-/- vs WT mice. Cx37-/- mice showed significantly lower renal AQP2 abundance and AQP2 phosphorylation at serine 256 than WT mice in response to vehicle or dDAVP, suggesting a partial contribution of the kidney to the lower urine osmolality. The abundance and responses of the vasopressin V2 receptor, AQP3, NHE3, NKCC2, NCC, H+-ATPase, αENaC, γENaC or Na+/K+-ATPase were not significantly different between genotypes. In summary, these results demonstrate that Cx37 is important for body water handling."

The aim of this study was to enhance the identification of patients at risk for deterioration through an accurate model using electrolyte, metabolite, and acid-base parameters near the end of patients’ intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Methods This retrospective study included 5157 adult patients during the last 72 hours of their ICU stays. The patients from the MIMIC-III database who had serum lactate, pH, bicarbonate, potassium, calcium, glucose, chloride, and sodium values available, along with the times at which those data were recorded, were selected. Survivor data from the last 24 hours before discharge and four sets of nonsurvivor data from 48–72, 24–48, 8–24, and 0–8 hours before death were analyzed. Deep learning (DL), random forest (RF) and generalized linear model (GLM) analyses were applied for model construction and compared in terms of performance according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A DL backcasting approach was used to assess predictors of death vs. discharge up to 72 hours in advance. Results The DL, RF and GLM models achieved the highest performance for nonsurvivors 0–8 hours before death versus survivors compared with nonsurvivors 8–24, 24–48 and 48–72 hours before death versus survivors. The DL assessment outperformed the RF and GLM assessments and achieved discrimination, with an AUC of 0.982, specificity of 0.947, and sensitivity of 0.935. The DL backcasting approach achieved discrimination with an AUC of 0.898 compared with the DL native model of nonsurvivors from 8–24 hours before death versus survivors with an AUC of 0.894. The DL backcasting approach achieved discrimination with an AUC of 0.871 compared with the DL native model of nonsurvivors from 48–72 hours before death versus survivors with an AUC of 0.846. Conclusions The DL backcasting approach could be used to simultaneously monitor changes in the electrolyte, metabolite, and acid-base parameters of patients who develop physiological instability during ICU treatment and predict the risk of death over a period of hours to days."
https://openalex.org/W3111161742,"Allowing members of the crowd to propose novel microtasks for one another is an effective way to combine the efficiencies of traditional microtask work with the inventiveness and hypothesis generation potential of human workers. However, microtask proposal leads to a growing set of tasks that may overwhelm limited crowdsourcer resources. Crowdsourcers can employ methods to utilize their resources efficiently, but algorithmic approaches to efficient crowdsourcing generally require a fixed task set of known size. In this paper, we introduce *cost forecasting* as a means for a crowdsourcer to use efficient crowdsourcing algorithms with a growing set of microtasks. Cost forecasting allows the crowdsourcer to decide between eliciting new tasks from the crowd or receiving responses to existing tasks based on whether or not new tasks will cost less to complete than existing tasks, efficiently balancing resources as crowdsourcing occurs. Experiments with real and synthetic crowdsourcing data show that cost forecasting leads to improved accuracy. Accuracy and efficiency gains for crowd-generated microtasks hold the promise to further leverage the creativity and wisdom of the crowd, with applications such as generating more informative and diverse training data for machine learning applications and improving the performance of user-generated content and question-answering platforms."

Many studies have been devoted to optimizing spatial distribution of crops, to improve light interception and increase photosynthetic assimilation. However, finding an optimal solution based on field experiments is almost impossible since the large number of combinations of factors that are related, and the cost in terms of finances and time are prohibitive. A new optimization strategy was proposed in this study, integrating a Functional-Structural Model of rice with a workflow based on a Mixed Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm. The 3D modelling platform GroIMP was used to implement the model and optimization workflow. MPSO is a new Particle Swarm Optimization-based algorithm with multistage disturbances, which has improved abilities to get rid of local optima and to explore solution space. Spacing between plants was used as optimization target in the first example. An optimal plant spacing was obtained within the model framework of current environmental settings together with the functional and structural modules. Simulation results indicate that the optimized plant spacing could increase rice yield, and that the optimization results remain stable."
https://openalex.org/W3111504526,"The active cervical range of motion (aROM) is assessed by clinicians to inform their decision-making. Even with the ability of neck motion to discriminate injured from non-injured subjects, the mechanisms to explain recovery or persistence of WAD remain unclear. There are few studies of ROM examinations with precision tools using kinematics as predictive factors of recovery rate. The present paper will evaluate the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) using kinematic variables to predict the overall change of aROM after a period of rehabilitation in WAD patients. To achieve this goal the neck kinematics of a cohort of 1082 WAD patients (55.1% females), with mean age 37.68 (SD 12.88) years old, from across Spain were used. Prediction variables were the kinematics recorded by the EBI ® 5 in routine biomechanical assessments of these patients. These include normalized ROM, speed to peak and ROM coefficient of variation. The improvement of aROM was represented by the Neck Functional Holistic Analysis Score (NFHAS). A supervised multi-layer feed-forward ANN was created to predict the change in NFHAS. The selected architecture of the ANN showed a mean squared error of 308.07–272.75 confidence interval for a 95% in the Monte Carlo cross validation. The performance of the ANN was tested with a subsample of patients not used in the training. This comparison resulted in a medium correlation with R = 0.5. The trained neural network to predict the expected difference in NFHAS between baseline and follow up showed modest results. While the overall performance is moderately correlated, the error of this prediction is still too large to use the method in clinical practice. The addition of other clinically relevant factors could further improve prediction performance."
https://openalex.org/W3111981782,"C/EBPα is required for formation of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) and also participates in B lymphopoiesis. The common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) and preproB populations but not proB cells express Cebpa , and pan-hematopoietic deletion of the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer using Mx1-Cre leads not only to reduced GMP but also to 2-fold reduced marrow preproB and &gt;15-fold reduced proB and preB cells. We now show that IL7Rα-Cre-mediated deletion of the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer, which occurs in 89% of Ly6D + and 65% of upstream Ly6D - CLP, leads to a 2-fold reduction of both preproB and proB cells, and a 3-fold reduction in preB cells, with no impact on GMP numbers. These data support a direct role for C/EBPα during B lineage development, with reduced enhancer deletion in Ly6D - CLP mediated by IL7Rα-Cre diminishing the effect on B lymphopoiesis compared to that seen with Mx1-Cre. Amongst mRNAs encoding key transcriptional regulators that initiate B lymphoid specification (PU.1, E2A, IKAROS, EBF1, FOXO1, and BACH2), only Ebf1 levels are altered in CLP upon Mx1-Cre-mediated Cebpa enhancer deletion, with Ebf1 reduced ~40-fold in Flt3 + Sca-1 int c-kit int IL7Rα + CLP. In addition, Cebpa and Ebf1 RNAs were 4- and 14-fold higher in hCD4 + versus hCD4 - CLP from Cebpa -hCD4 transgenic mice. Histone modification ChIP-Seq data for CLP indicate the presence of active, intronic Ebf1 enhancers located 270 and 280 kb upstream of the transcription start sites. We identified a cis element in this region that strongly binds C/EBPα using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Mutation of this C/EBPα-binding site in an Ebf1 enhancer-TK-luciferase reporter leads to a 4-fold reduction in C/EBPα-mediated trans-activation. These findings support a model of B lymphopoiesis in which induction of Ebf1 by C/EBPα in a subset of CLP contributes to initiation of B lymphopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W3113274294,"High frequency words play a key role in language acquisition, with recent work suggesting they may serve both speech segmentation and lexical categorisation. However, it is not yet known whether infants can detect novel high frequency words in continuous speech, nor whether they can use them to help learning for segmentation and categorisation at the same time. For instance, when hearing “ you eat the biscuit ”, can children use the high-frequency words “ you ” and “ the ” to segment out “ eat ” and “ biscuit ”, and determine their respective lexical categories? We tested this in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we familiarised 12-month-old infants with continuous artificial speech comprising repetitions of target words , which were preceded by high-frequency marker words that distinguished the targets into two distributional categories. In Experiment 2, we repeated the task using the same language but with additional phonological cues to word and category structure. In both studies, we measured learning with head-turn preference tests of segmentation and categorisation, and compared performance against a control group that heard the artificial speech without the marker words (i.e., just the targets). There was no evidence that high frequency words helped either speech segmentation or grammatical categorisation. However, segmentation was seen to improve when the distributional information was supplemented with phonological cues (Experiment 2). In both experiments, exploratory analysis indicated that infants’ looking behaviour was related to their linguistic maturity (indexed by infants’ vocabulary scores) with infants with high versus low vocabulary scores displaying novelty and familiarity preferences, respectively. We propose that high-frequency words must reach a critical threshold of familiarity before they can be of significant benefit to learning."
https://openalex.org/W3111192215,"Background Prognostic biomarker, which can inform the treatment outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after complete resection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is urgently needed for the personalized treatment of these patients. Patients and methods The prognostic value of gene expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) on the effect of ACT in completely resected NSCLC was investigated in the present study. Two independent datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with a total of 309 patients were included in this study. The prognostic value of ER gene expression on ACT’s efficacy was evaluated by survival analysis and Cox hazards models. Results We found a consistent and significant prognostic value of ERβ (ESR2) expression for ACT’s efficacy in completely resected NSCLC in both of the two independent cohorts. After multivariate adjustment, a significant survival benefit of ACT was observed in patients with low expression of ESR2, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.19 (95%CI 0.05–0.82, p = 0.026) in the discovery cohort and an HR of 0.27 (95%CI 0.10–0.76, p = 0.012) in the validation group. No significant benefit of ACT in the subgroup of patients with high expression of ESR2 was observed, with an HR of 0.80 (95%CI 0.31–2.09, p = 0.644) in the discovery cohort and an HR of 1.05 (95%CI 0.48–2.29, p = 0.896) in the validation group. Conclusion A significant survival benefit from ACT was observed in patients with low ESR2 expression. No significant survival benefit was observed in patients with high ESR2 expression. Detection of ESR2 expression in NSCLC may help personalize its treatment after complete resection."
https://openalex.org/W3111722255,"Continued drought during the late growth stage of super hybrid rice (SHR) markedly reduces yield, and management practices that use water more efficiently can contribute greatly to high and stable yields from SHR. The absolute temperature differences (ATDs) between the rice plant and the atmosphere and between the soil and the atmosphere are believed to be important determinants of grain yield. However, it has not previously been determined whether these ATDs have any effect on SHR yields under water-saving cultivation. A two-year field experiment involving two SHR varieties, Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ) and Y-Liangyou 9000 (YLY900), evaluated the effects of reducing water supply from mid-booting to maturity on grain yield, canopy relative humidity (CRH), leaf area index (LAI), and ATDs between the ambient temperature and the leaf surface, panicles, canopy, and soil. Grain yield increased significantly under shallow water irrigation (SW), by 8.84% (YLY900) and 12.26% (LYPJ), but decreased significantly under mild water stress (MS, −20 to −30 kPa), by 14.36% (YLY900) and 9.47% (LYPJ), as well as severe water stress (SS, −40 to −50 kPa), by 35.06% (YLY900) and 28.74% (LYPJ). As water supply decreased, so did the CRH and the ATDs, with significant decreases under MS and SS. The temperature differences were significantly and positively correlated with grain yield ( P &lt; 0.01) in both cultivars. LAI was increased under SW conditions, but was significantly decreased under MS and SS. Our study suggests that the dual goal of saving water while maintaining high yield can be achieved by applying SW irrigation from mid-booting to maturity and by adopting cultivation measures that maintain high CRH and high plant–atmosphere and soil–atmosphere ATDs in order to alleviate water stress. YLY900 has a higher yield potential than LYPJ under SW conditions, suggesting that its wide cultivation may help achieve this dual goal."
https://openalex.org/W3112790134,"Background High levels of plasma marine n-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) are associated with improved patient and graft survival in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of a new food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to estimate marine n-3FA consumption in future epidemiological research. Methods We developed an FFQ with a simple design of 10 questions to assess intake of marine sources of n-3FAs. RTRs included in the recent ORENTRA trial (n = 132) completed the study FFQ at the baseline visit eight weeks after engraftment and at the end of study visit one year post-transplant. We measured the reference biomarker plasma phospholipid (PL) marine n-3FA levels by gas chromatography at the same time points to evaluate association and degree of agreement between FFQ based marine n-3FA consumption estimates and the biomarker. Results The median plasma PL marine n-3FA level was 6.0 weight percentage (wt)% (interquartile range [IQR] 4.7 to 7.3) at baseline and 6.3 wt% (IQR 4.8 to 7.4) at end of study. Median FFQ based marine n-3FA consumption estimates were 22.8 g/month (IQR 13.0 to 34.0) at baseline and 20.3 g/month (IQR 14.5 to 32.3) at end of study. FFQ based marine n-3FA consumption estimates showed a moderate correlation with plasma PL marine n-3FA levels at baseline (Spearman’s correlation coefficient r s = 0.43, p&lt;0.001) and a stronger correlation at end of study (r s = 0.62, p&lt;0.001). Bland Altman plots showed a reasonable degree of agreement between the two methods at both time points. Conclusions Marine n-3FA consumption estimates based on the FFQ showed a moderate correlation with the reference biomarker plasma PL marine n-3FA levels. The FFQ might be useful in epidemiological studies where resources are limited."
https://openalex.org/W3112798302,"A bilevel programming problem with multiple objectives at the leader’s and/or follower’s levels, known as a bilevel multiobjective programming problem (BMPP), is extraordinarily hard as this problem accumulates the computational complexity of both hierarchical structures and multiobjective optimisation. As a strongly NP-hard problem, the BMPP incurs a significant computational cost in obtaining non-dominated solutions at both levels, and few studies have addressed this issue. In this study, an evolutionary algorithm is developed using surrogate optimisation models to solve such problems. First, a dynamic weighted sum method is adopted to address the follower’s multiple objective cases, in which the follower’s problem is categorised into several single-objective ones. Next, for each the leader’s variable values, the optimal solutions to the transformed follower’s programs can be approximated by adaptively improved surrogate models instead of solving the follower’s problems. Finally, these techniques are embedded in MOEA/D, by which the leader’s non-dominated solutions can be obtained. In addition, a heuristic crossover operator is designed using gradient information in the evolutionary procedure. The proposed algorithm is executed on some computational examples including linear and nonlinear cases, and the simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach."
https://openalex.org/W3113355506,"Recently, Flavell et al. (2019) demonstrated that an object’s motion fluency (how smoothly and predictably it moves) influences liking of the object itself. Though the authors demonstrated learning of object-motion associations, participants only preferred fluently associated objects over disfluently associated objects when ratings followed a moving presentation but not a stationary presentation. In the presented experiment, we tested the possibility that this apparent failure of associative learning / evaluative conditioning was due to stimulus choice. To do so we replicate part of the original work but change the ‘naturally stationary’ household object stimuli with winged insects which move in a similar way to the original motions. Though these more ecologically valid stimuli should have facilitated object to motion associations, we again found that preference effects were only apparent following moving presentations. These results confirm the potential of motion fluency for ‘in the moment’ preference change, and they demonstrate a critical boundary condition that should be considered when attempting to generalise fluency effects across contexts such as in advertising or behavioural interventions."
