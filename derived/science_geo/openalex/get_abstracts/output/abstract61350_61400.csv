https://openalex.org/W1485128548,"Abstract This paper describes a method for the purification of Escherichia coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is rapid, reproducible, high in yield, and able to handle preparations using from 1 g to 3 kg of cells. The method involves disruption of the bacterial cells with glass beads in a Waring Blendor, digestion with DNase I, centrifugation to remove ribosomes and debris, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, phosphocellulose, and Bio-Gel A-1.5m. Addition of 5% glycerol and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol to all buffers substantially increases the stability of the enzyme throughout the purification. Depending on how cells are grown, 100 to 300 mg of polymerase are obtained from 1 kg of cells. The polymerase is greater than 98% pure and free of contaminating nucleases."

https://openalex.org/W1524162190,"Abstract This paper presents studies on the subunit structure of Escherichia coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Phosphocellulose column purified enzyme is denatured and its polypeptide chains separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid compositions, molecular weights, NH2 terminal amino acids, and molar ratios of these polypeptide chains are presented. It is concluded that phosphocellulose enzyme has the structure α2ββ' where the molecular weights of the chains α, β, and β' are 39,000 ± 5%, 155,000 ± 10%, and 165,000 ± 10%, respectively. In addition, a small protein component, ω, with molecular weight of 9,000 ± 10% is observed. These subunits are not joined together by disulfide linkages. From these data one can compute a molecular weight of 400,000 ± 10% for the monomeric form of the phosphocellulose purified polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1582220782,"Abstract The membrane-localized lactose permease protein of Escherichia coli (M protein), which is the product of the y gene of the lac operon, was specifically labeled with radioactive N-ethylmaleimide. The labeled protein was effectively extracted from the particulate, membrane-containing fraction only in the presence of detergents, one of the most effective of which was sodium dodecyl sulfate. During electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, the labeled M protein ran as a single peak. Under these conditions, which promote the dissociation of many proteins into subunits, its molecular weight is about 30,000 as determined from its relative electrophoretic mobility. Chromatography of extracts of membrane proteins on Sephadex G-150 equilibrated with buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulfate was found to be a useful method of fractionation, which also leads to an effective separation of phospholipid from these proteins. Analysis on Sephadex G-150 confirms the value of about 30,000 for the molecular weight of the labeled M protein in buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amount of M protein in cells grown on labeled amino acids, using gel electrophoresis to locate the protein, was estimated to be about twice that of thiogalactoside acetylase."

This protein (30S-15) is the same protein that is functionally altered in ribosomes resistant to streptomycin.
https://openalex.org/W1555966296,"Abstract Inhibition of the nonenzymatic binding of phenylalanyl transfer RNA to polyuridylic acid-coded ribosomes at 20 mm magnesium was used as an assay to determine whether the tetranucleotide ribothymidylyl-pseudouridylyl-cytidylyl-guanosine 3'-phosphate possessed any specific ability to bind to ribosomes. Inhibition of binding at the peptidyl site was studied by adding tetracycline to block aminoacyl site binding activity, and aminoacyl site activity was examined in the presence of excess deacylated tRNA to suppress peptidyl site binding. Deacylated tRNA was bound competitively with aminoacyl-tRNA at the peptidyl site, but was without effect at the aminoacyl site. At both of these sites, T-ψ-C-Gp was more inhibitory than any other oligonucleotide tested. At the peptidyl site, T-ψ-C-Gp was 10 times more active than A-A-A-Gp, and 3 times more active than (A, U, C)Gp. At the aminoacyl site, T-ψ-C-Gp was again 3 times more active than (A, U, C)Gp and 20 times more active than A-A-Gp or (A,C)Gp. Alkaline hydrolysis destroyed the inhibitory activity and cyanoethylation of the pseudouridine residue with acrylonitrile decreased the activity to 50% although a control treated with propionitrile was fully active. Inhibitory activity was resistant to boiling. Inhibition by T-ψ-C-Gp was not competitive with free phenylalanyl-tRNA nor affected by ribosome concentration. However, T-ψ-C-Gp does act at the ribosomal level since ammonium chloride-washed particles were 4 times more sensitive to T-ψ-C-Gp inhibition, and aging of these particles further increased their sensitivity. Variation of the polyuridylic acid or Mg++ concentration was without effect. Since T-ψ-C-Gp was able to block aminoacyl-tRNA binding sites on ribosomes more effectively than other similar nucleotides this sequence probably represents part of the normal ribosome binding site in tRNA. The failure to compete with unbound aminoacyl-tRNA and the effect of ammonium chloride washing on the ribosomes suggests that the actual reaction mechanism is complex."

https://openalex.org/W1554753165,"Abstract An endonuclease activity was purified about 150-fold from T4 phage-infected Escherichia coli B. This enzyme has been named T4 endonuclease IV and introduces breaks preferentially into single stranded DNA. The enzyme produces oligonucleotides as small as 150 nucleotides long from fd DNA. These oligonucleotides contain 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate termini. T4 endonuclease IV produces breaks exclusively adjacent to cytosine residues in both fd and denatured λ DNA. This enzyme has no effect on denatured T4 DNA, whether glucosylated or nonglucosylated, and may therefore be involved in the breakdown of host cell DNA which occurs after T4 phage infection."

https://openalex.org/W1641442195,"An extracellular nuclease was isolated from Serratia marcescens culture fluid which rapidly hydrolyzed DNA and RNA at approximately the same rate. The activity of the enzyme was purified 2600-fold with a final recovery of 25%. The ratio of enzymatic activity with RNA as substrate to that with DNA as substrate remained approximately constant throughout the purification and in all studies of the properties of the enzyme, leading to the conclusion that both activities are associated with a single protein. The enzyme required Mg++ or Mn++ for activity, and had a pH optimum of 8.5. Heating the enzyme to 44° or higher reduced enzymatic activity; after 40 min at 44°, all activity was abolished. The nuclease could be stored in glass-sealed ampules at 4° for up to 3 months without loss of activity. These properties, in conjunction with the specificity reported in the accompanying paper, make this enzyme potentially useful as a reagent for the study of nucleic acid structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1536095480,"Abstract The amino-terminal fragment, comprising the first 24 residues, has been isolated from rat and human serum albumins after limited peptic digestion. The complete sequence of each fragment has been deduced from the tryptic peptides alone by taking advantage of overlapping peptides resulting from incomplete cleavage. A comparison of the structure of the (1–24) peptides of rat and human albumins with that obtained from bovine serum albumin (J. Biol. Chem., 242, 5451 (1967)) indicates a high degree of similarity. The rat fragment differs from the bovine at three sites, whereas the human fragment differs at four sites. There is a single replacement at Residue 2 common to the rat and human peptides. Because production of this fragment by limited proteolysis must be indicative of certain conformational parameters in the region of Residue 24, it may be concluded that the rat, human, and bovine serum albumin molecules are closely homologous in primary and three-dimensional structure in the amino-terminal region."

https://openalex.org/W1566986900,Abstract Salmonella typhimurium strain LT-2 produces very little histidase and urocanase upon induction by l-histidine or imidazolepropionic acid. Rare mutants were isolated that could be induced to form these enzymes. By further mutations strains specifically deficient in the ability to form histidase or urocanase and strains capable of forming these enzymes in the absence of inducer were obtained. It could be shown by transduction that the parent organism possesses the genetic information required for the production of histidase and urocanase. The genetic sites responsible for the formation and control of the enzymes are closely linked to one another and are located on the bacterial chromosome near the site responsible for galactose fermentation. The genetic site responsible for the inability of the parent strain to produce the enzymes is located between the gene for urocanase and the gene determining response to induction.
https://openalex.org/W1515039279,"Abstract The increased protein turnover that accompanies amino acid starvation was examined in isogenic auxotrophs of Escherichia coli K-12 which differ only in the genetic locus responsible for control of RNA synthesis under conditions of amino acid starvation. The multiple auxotrophs investigated were CP78 (stringent RNA control) and CP79 (relaxed RNA control). The protein degradation which occurs following amino acid starvation in the stringent CP78 consists of two processes. (a) A chloramphenicol-insensitive breakdown which plays a large role early in the starvation period due to the presence of a pool of labile proteins, and (b) a chloramphenicol-sensitive proteolysis which causes the bulk of the observed protein degradation. Under normal conditions of amino acid starvation, there is considerably less protein degradation in the relaxed CP79 relative to the stringent CP78. This decreased level of degradation in the relaxed CP79 appears to result from a deficiency in the chloramphenicol-sensitive proteolytic process. However, under conditions of simultaneous starvation for both glucose and amino acids, proteolysis occurs to the same extent in CP78 and CP79. Whereas the withdrawal of glucose from the starvation medium has no effect on proteolysis in the stringent CP78, it increases degradation in CP79 to the level occurring in CP78. These results are discussed in terms of the pleiotropic nature of the control exercised by the RNA control locus."
https://openalex.org/W1645304953,"Abstract Salmonella typhimurium strain 15–59 can use l-histidine as a source of nitrogen, except when glucose is the major source of carbon. Upon induction by histidine the organism produces histidase and urocanase. The formation of these enzymes is strongly repressed by glucose. A series of mutants, either deficient in the ability to metabolize histidine or altered in the control of the formation of the histidine-degrading enzymes, was isolated. It could be shown that the genetic sites for control (constitutive formation of the enzymes, or resistance to repression by glucose, or inability to form both histidase and urocanase) are closely linked to the sites where mutation results in the specific inability to produce either histidase or urocanase. The mutation to constitutivity affects not only histidase and urocanase, but also another enzyme required for the degradation of histidine, formiminoglutamate hydrolase; mutation to resistance to repression by glucose affects only histidase and urocanase. The actual inducer appears to be urocanic acid and not histidine. However, urocanic acid cannot be used for induction since it fails to penetrate the cell. There is coordinate control of the synthesis of histidase and urocanase; the close linkage of the genes responsible for the formation of these enzymes suggests that they belong to a single operon."

https://openalex.org/W1597656668,"Abstract Perfusion of tissue with a medium containing two metabolically related compounds, each labeled with a different isotope, and measurement of isotopic concentrations at the steady state were used to calculate the rates at which the perfused tracers enter and leave the tissue. This novel experimental design was applied to the study of the dynamics of uptake of estrogens and androgens by human endometrium. Endometrial curettings were sliced and perfused with a buffer solution containing a mixture of 3H-17β-estradiol, 14C-estrone, 3H-testosterone and 14C-4-androstene-3,17-dione. An isotopic steady state was achieved while the tissue maintained its viability. Extensive interconversion between estrone and estradiol, and between testosterone and androstenedione, was observed. The fraction of a perfused tracer that entered the tissue slices was not affected by its concentration in the range tested and was practically equal for estrone, estradiol, testosterone, and androstenedione, when perfused as a mixture. It was, however, reduced when plasma was used instead of buffer solution. More than one-half of estrone (or androstenedione) entering the tissue was released back into the medium. Only a small fraction of estradiol (or testosterone) that entered the slices was discharged into the medium; it left the tissue mainly as estrone (or androstenedione). It was estimated that the fraction of the tracer present in the tissue in a diffusible form was about 20% for androstenedione, 5% for estrone, and less than 1% for estradiol and testosterone."
https://openalex.org/W255279818,"Abstract β-Hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase from E. coli has been shown to have a molecular weight of 36,000 by ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and amino acid composition. Electrophoretic behavior, however, suggests that the protein molecule is composed of two equal, if not identical, polypeptide chains of molecular weight 18,000. The enzyme also contains 4 half-cystinyl residues per 36,000 g of protein. A variety of chemical modifications, including photooxidation, alkylation, and nitration, lead to the conclusion that 1 histidyl and 1 tyrosyl residue are essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The pH-kcat profile for the isomerization reaction is consistent with the participation of these two amino acids in the catalytic process. Evidence is presented that 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a specific dehydrase inhibitor, reacts covalently with the same histidyl residue and protects the enzyme against the modifying active site-directed reagents. Conversely, nitrated or alkylated enzyme has lost the ability to react with the acetylenic inhibitor. No treatment has been found which will dissociate dehydration from isomerization activity, supporting the concept that the dehydrase is a truly multifunctional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1521287392,"Previous studies have shown that putrescine can be synthesized by two pathways (Fig. 1) and that the rate of urea production by whole cells of Escherichia coli reflects the rate of conversion of arginine to putrescine (Pathway II). In this paper, we make use of the latter observation to assess the relative functioning of the two pathways of putrescine synthesis in vivo. In cells growing in unsupplemented minimal medium, the route from ornithine to putrescine (Pathway I) is preferred. On the other hand, when cells are provided exogenous arginine, Pathway II is utilized almost exclusively. Under both conditions of arginine nutrition, the total rate of putrescine synthesis is identical. The degree of utilization of Pathway I in minimal medium is a strain-specific phenomenon, depending on the level of the arginine biosynthetic enzymes. In strains with low levels of ornithine transcarbamylase, greater than 95% of the cellular putrescine is synthesized via Pathway I. In cells with high levels, the preference for Pathway I is less striking or in the extreme case, nonexistent. The mechanism for this modulation of putrescine pathway selection by the levels of the enzymes of arginine biosynthesis is related to the intracellular pool sizes of ornithine and arginine. Whereas the intracellular arginine level remains relatively invariant, there is a direct correlation between the intracellular ornithine pool and the proportion of putrescine synthesized via Pathway I. Possible mechanisms for this pathway selection are discussed."

When supplemented with mammalian transfer factor T2, bacterial factor T substituted on reticulocyte ribosomes for the corresponding mammalian transfer factor T1 in polymerization of phenylalanyl-tRNA into polyphenylalanine, but E. coli factor G did not replace mammalian T2. In reverse, with E. coli ribosomes, reticulocyte factor T1 did not substitute for bacterial factor T."
https://openalex.org/W1578401140,"Abstract The enzyme, β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthetase, which catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP from acetyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP, has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. The molecular weight, determined from equilibrium centrifugation studies, is 66,000. Amino acid analysis after performic acid oxidation indicates that it contains 8 moles of cysteic acid per mole of protein. Titration with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) after protein denaturation with sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates 7.2 —SH groups per mole of protein. The enzyme is inhibited by iodoacetamide when 1 mole of cysteine per mole of protein is alkylated, and acetyl-ACP protects the enzyme against alkylation. The enzyme reacts with acetylACP to form an acetyl enzyme intermediate, and the properties of this intermediate suggest that the acetyl group is bound to a cysteine residue as an acyl thioester. Acetyl enzyme is active in transferring the acetyl group either to ACP to form acetyl-ACP or to malonyl-ACP to form acetoacetyl-ACP."
https://openalex.org/W1592484600,"Abstract Several lines of evidence are presented which, together with previous data that arginine decarboxylase (mol wt = 820,000; s020,w = 23.3 S) contains an integral multiple of five subunits, indicate that the enzyme is composed of 10 identical or very nearly identical polypeptide chains. (a) Acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol gives a single band containing a material having a molecular weight of approximately 96,000. (b) In denaturing solvents, 6.7 moles of sulfhydryl groups react per 82,000 g of protein with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Since 7.0 residues of cysteic acid were found after performic acid oxidation, the molecule contains no disulfide bonds. In the native (23 S) enzyme, none of the sulfhydryl groups are reactive, while in the dissociated (mol wt = 160,000, s020,w = 8.0 S) form of the enzyme, 0.9 mole of sulfhydryl groups reacts per 82,000 g. Similar results were obtained for the dissociated species by reaction with both p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. Thus, the dissociated (8 S) species has 1 mole of uniquely reactive sulfhydryl residue per 82,000 g. (c) Amino-terminal analysis by the isocyanate procedure gives 6 to 8 moles of methionine residues per 820,000 g; this result was confirmed by dinitrophenylation. Digestion with carboxypeptidase A releases 10.3 moles of alanine per 820,000 g and hydrazinolysis gives 5 to 6 moles of alanine. (d) Peptide maps of tryptic hydrolysates have 54 to 58 ninhydrin-positive spots; the expected number, for 10 identical polypeptide chains, is 61. (e) Isoelectric focusing of arginine decarboxylase which had been reassociated from the 8 S to the 23 S species gave a single peak with a pI of 4.44. A revised purification procedure, suitable for preparing large quantities of enzyme, is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1529188376,"Abstract The fluxes of radioactive pantothenate between the cellular components 4'-phosphopantetheine, coenzyme A, and acyl carrier protein (ACP) and the medium have been measured in a pantothenate auxotroph of Escherichia coli. Radioactive fluxes generated with two alternate computer models for pantothenate metabolism were compared with the experimental data. One model was consistent with all the data with the same set of rate constants; the other model was not. The successful model has CoA as the immediate precursor of ACP and features rapid turnover of the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic groups of ACP and of CoA in exponentially growing cells; such turnover was directly observable under certain conditions. The rate of ACP turnover was four times the rate of growth of the ACP pool."

The final steps in the purification procedure utilized preparative disc gel electrophoresis, and the most highly purified preparation appeared to be homogeneous with respect to particle size, sedimentation velocity, and electrophoretic mobility. The enzyme phosphorylated deoxythymidine monophosphate, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridylic acid, and deoxyuridine monophosphate, in that order of activity, with ATP as the phosphate donor. Several other nucleoside triphosphates could serve less effectively as phosphate donors in the reaction. Magnesium ion, which could be replaced partially by either manganese or cobalt, was an absolute requirement. 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridylic acid and dUMP were competitive inhibitors of the phosphorylation of dTMP. ATP, deoxycytidine triphosphate, or deoxythymidine triphosphate in excess of the stoichiometrically equivalent concentration of Mg++ strongly inhibited the reaction. The inhibitory effect of ATP and dCTP was abolished when the Mg++ concentration was increased to equal the total nucleoside triphosphate concentration. dTTP inhibited the reaction about 30% even when Mg++ was present in excess of the total concentration of triphosphates."

https://openalex.org/W1505971704,"Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, one of the three enzymes comprising the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, consists of 24 identical polypeptide chains that are linked by noncovalent bonds. There appear to be 3 tyrosyl residues per chain of molecular weight about 40,000. Treatment of the transacetylase with increasing amounts of N-acetylimidazole resulted in gradual loss of enzymatic activity and concomitant O-acetylation of tyrosyl residues. This treatment also caused the enzyme to dissociate into subunits. The partially inactivated transacetylase was separated into two classes of subunits, with sedimentation coefficients of 4 to 7 S and 11 to 15 S, by gel filtration and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The former class of subunits contained a species with a molecular weight of about 120,000. Both classes of subunits exhibited approximately the same specific activity. It appears that inactivation and dissociation of the transacetylase are parallel, rather than sequential, phenomena. The various subunits retained the capacity to combine with pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, forming complexes capable of catalyzing the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The smallest functional unit had a molecular weight of about 500,000."

Requirements for the reaction include bicarbonate, ATP, and Mg2+, as well as 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid. The ureido carbonyl group of dethiobiotin was exclusively labeled when the reaction was carried out in the presence of NaH14CO3.

The 3H:14C ratio in the isolated amines indicated that more amines had been formed from the exogenous arginine than from the arginine formed endogenously from citrulline. In contrast, there was little, or no, preference for either type of arginine in the synthesis of cellular protein. These data suggest that, in E. coli growing under these conditions, exogenous arginine was accessible to arginine decarboxylase before mixing with the arginine that was synthesized endogenously. Thus, one may conclude that exogenous and endogenous arginine are partially separated functionally within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1504470156,"Abstract The enzyme anthranilate synthase catalyzes the formation of anthranilic acid from chorismate and glutamine or chorismate and NH3 in the biosynthesis of tryptophan in bacteria and in yeast. A purification procedure involving the solubilization of this enzyme and several additional steps led to a preparation that is homogeneous as judged by gel filtrations, sedimentation pattern, and gel electrophoresis. The final yield was at least 25%. Several properties of the purified enzyme were studied. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 137,000. The stoichiometry of the reaction with glutamine or ammonia as amino donor was determined. The pH optimum for glutamine was found to be 7.5 and for NH3 8.7. The Michaelis constant for chorismate is 3.3 x 10-6 m at pH 7.5, and the Michaelis constants for glutamine and NH3 are 5 and 8.5 x 10-4 m, respectively, at their individual pH optima. NH3 rather than NH4+ seems to be the active aminating species. A series of inhibitors was found which affected the activity of the enzyme either with glutamine or with ammonia or with both. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the structure of the enzyme. Inhibition by the end product, tryptophan, was competitive with chorismate, and the kinetic behavior of the inhibition was allosteric in nature. No cooperative effects could be demonstrated with chorismate as substrate in the absence of the feedback inhibitor. The inhibition with tryptophan was complete."

https://openalex.org/W1579353873,"Abstract Bacteriophage T4 DNA was used in vitro as a template for RNA and protein synthesis with ribosomes and supernatant enzymes prepared from uninfected Escherichia coli. Protein synthesis in this system was previously shown to result in synthesis de novo of an enzymatically active β-glucosyltransferase, an early T4-specific protein not detectable in uninfected cells. E. coli cells treated with trimethoprim were used to prepare extracts with decreased levels of N10-formyltetrahydrofolic acid. T4 DNA-dependent β-glucosyltransferase synthesis in such systems was stimulated markedly both by exogenously added folinic acid and by purified N-formylmethionyl transfer RNA. These experiments suggest that early enzyme synthesis in T4-infected cells utilizes the same chain initiator as the uninfected host. E. coli cells infected with T4 were found to retain preinfection levels of formylmethionine-specific tRNA as well as the enzymes needed to charge and formylate that species of tRNA."

This complex is unstable, having a half-life of about 26 min at 25° and pH 7.0.

https://openalex.org/W1539517404,"Abstract The presence of arginine in the growth medium of an Escherichia coli W mutant leads to the simultaneous induction of acetylornithine δ-transaminase and repression of acetylornithinase and ornithine transcarbamylase. In order for either induction or repression by arginine to occur, a functional regulatory gene, argR, must be present. An analogue of arginine, homoarginine, which does not inhibit the growth of this mutant, has been used to study these two types of control mechanisms. Homoarginine will partially repress the synthesis of acetylornithinase and ornithine transcarbamylase but will not induce transaminase synthesis; however, homoarginine will delay the onset of induction of the transaminase by arginine. Repression of acetylornithinase and ornithine transcarbamylase by homoarginine also requires the presence of a functional regulatory gene. Homoarginine does not function as substrate for arginyl transfer RNA synthetase, suggesting that charged arginyl-tRNA is not necessary for regulation of synthesis of the arginine biosynthetic enzymes. The data indicate that homoarginine combines with the regulatory gene product to bring about partial repression, but this interaction will not induce the synthesis of transaminase. Although the product of the regulatory gene functions in both induction and repression, it appears that the functional groups involved in regulation may differ for these two processes."

These strains are characterized by the production of sex-pili by the majority of the cells in the culture and by the cells' ability to transfer their R-factors to R−recipients at high frequency. Transfer rates per donor cell of 10−1 to 10−2 often occur, as compared with a rate of transfer from a repressed strain of about 10−4 to 10−5 (refs. 1–3)."
