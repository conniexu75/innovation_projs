https://openalex.org/W2152083180,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are inhibitors of gene expression capable of controlling processes in normal development and cancer. In mammals, miRNAs use a seed sequence of 6-8 nucleotides (nt) to associate with 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs and inhibit their expression. Intriguingly, occasionally not only the miRNA-targeting site but also sequences in its vicinity are highly conserved throughout evolution. We therefore hypothesized that conserved regions in mRNAs may serve as docking platforms for modulators of miRNA activity. Here we demonstrate that the expression of dead end 1 (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), counteracts the function of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by binding mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target sites. These effects of Dnd1 are mediated through uridine-rich regions present in the miRNA-targeted mRNAs. Thus, our data unravel a novel role of Dnd1 in protecting certain mRNAs from miRNA-mediated repression."

https://openalex.org/W2126117361,"Large brain size is one of the defining characteristics of modern humans. Seckel syndrome (MIM 210600), a disorder of markedly reduced brain and body size, is associated with defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling. Only a single hypomorphic mutation of ATR has been identified in this genetically heterogeneous condition. We now report that mutations in the gene encoding pericentrin (PCNT)--resulting in the loss of pericentrin from the centrosome, where it has key functions anchoring both structural and regulatory proteins--also cause Seckel syndrome. Furthermore, we find that cells of individuals with Seckel syndrome due to mutations in PCNT (PCNT-Seckel) have defects in ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, providing the first evidence linking a structural centrosomal protein with DNA damage signaling. These findings also suggest that other known microcephaly genes implicated in either DNA repair responses or centrosomal function may act in common developmental pathways determining human brain and body size."
https://openalex.org/W2017565236,"Rhythmic production of vertebral precursors, the somites, causes bilateral columns of embryonic segments to form. This process involves a molecular oscillator--the segmentation clock--whose signal is translated into a spatial, periodic pattern by a complex signalling gradient system within the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). In mouse embryos, Wnt signalling has been implicated in both the clock and gradient mechanisms, but how the Wnt pathway can perform these two functions simultaneously remains unclear. Here, we use a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-based, real-time imaging system in mouse embryos to demonstrate that clock oscillations are independent of beta-catenin protein levels. In contrast, we show that the Wnt-signalling gradient is established through a nuclear beta-catenin protein gradient in the posterior PSM. This gradient of nuclear beta-catenin defines the size of the oscillatory field and controls key aspects of PSM maturation and segment formation, emphasizing the central role of Wnt signalling in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2115084515,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an often debilitating mental illness that is characterized by recurrent distressing memories of traumatic events. PTSD is associated with hypoactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hyperactivity in the amygdala and reduced volume in the hippocampus, but it is unknown whether these neuroimaging findings reflect the underlying cause or a secondary effect of the disorder. To investigate the causal contribution of specific brain areas to PTSD symptoms, we studied a unique sample of Vietnam War veterans who suffered brain injury and emotionally traumatic events. We found a substantially reduced occurrence of PTSD among those individuals with damage to one of two regions of the brain: the vmPFC and an anterior temporal area that included the amygdala. These results suggest that the vmPFC and amygdala are critically involved in the pathogenesis of PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2071483422,"Methionine-rich motifs have an important role in copper trafficking factors, including the CusF protein. Here we show that CusF uses a new metal recognition site wherein Cu(I) is tetragonally displaced from a Met2His ligand plane toward a conserved tryptophan. Spectroscopic studies demonstrate that both thioether ligation and strong cation-pi interactions with tryptophan stabilize metal binding. This novel active site chemistry affords mechanisms for control of adventitious metal redox and substitution chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1993419851,"NOTCH signaling is a key regulator of cell fate decisions in prenatal skeletal development and is active during adult tissue renewal. In addition, its association with neoplasia suggests that it is a candidate therapeutic target. We find that attenuated NOTCH signaling enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo by a combination of molecular mechanisms. First, deletion of Notch1-3 in bone marrow macrophages directly promotes their commitment to the osteoclast phenotype. These osteoclast precursors proliferate more rapidly than the wild type in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor and are sensitized to RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, undergoing enhanced differentiation in response to low doses of either cytokine. Conforming with a role for NOTCH in this process, presentation of the NOTCH ligand JAGGED1 blunts the capacity of wild-type bone marrow macrophages to become osteoclasts. Combined, these data establish that NOTCH suppresses osteoclastogenesis via ligand-mediated receptor activation. Although NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 collaborate in regulating osteoclast formation, NOTCH1 is the dominant paralog. In addition, NOTCH1 deficiency promotes osteoclastogenesis indirectly by enhancing the ability of osteoblast lineage cells to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. This is achieved by decreasing the osteoprotegerin/RANKL expression ratio. Thus, NOTCH1 acts as a net inhibitor of bone resorption, exerting its effect both directly in osteoclast precursors and indirectly via osteoblast lineage cells. These observations raise caution that therapeutic inhibition of NOTCH signaling may adversely accelerate bone loss in humans.

NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that profoundly impacts mammalian development by regulating survival, proliferation, and cell fate decision in a context-dependent manner. It contributes to tissue maintenance and/or renewal in the adult intestine (1van Es J.H. van Gijn M.E. Riccio O. van den Born M. Vooijs M. Begthel H. Cozijnsen M. Robine S. Winton D.J. Radtke F.

The receptors and ligands are single-pass transmembrane proteins expressed on the surface of adjacent cells. Activation of NOTCH signaling requires cell/cell contact because ligand binding to specific epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular domain of NOTCH receptors must induce a conformational change (13Gordon W.R.

This complex is responsible for the transcription of NOTCH target genes, including those of HES (hairy and enhancer of split) and the HES-related transcription factor HEY (16Fischer A. Gessler M.

Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar).NOTCH signaling plays a critical role in somitogenesis (18Gridley T. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2330-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, mice deficient in presinilin-1, the catalytic component of γ-secretase, develop deformed vertebrae (19Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the NOTCH ligand Jagged2 results in cleft palate and syndactyly in mice (20Jiang R. Lan Y. Chapman H.D. Shawber C. Norton C.R. Serreze D.V. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). More important, patients bearing mutations of the NOTCH ligand DLL3, the modifier Fng, or the target Mesp2 also have severe deformities of the axial skeleton (18Gridley T. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2330-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Bulman M.P. Kusumi K. Frayling T.M. McKeown C. Garrett C. Lander E.S. Krumlauf R. Hattersley A.T. Ellard S. Turnpenny P.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Due to the contribution of NOTCH signaling to somitogenesis and fetal skeletal development, attention has turned to skeletal cells (22Zamurovic N.

Chem. 2005; 280: 15842-15848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Regarding the impact of NOTCH on osteoblast differentiation, these efforts have yielded disparate results. Whereas some investigators report that NOTCH signaling dampens osteoblastogenesis (22Zamurovic N. Cappellen D. Rohner D. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37704-37715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Deregowski V. Gazzerro E. Priest L. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol.

NOTCH signaling has also been reported to negatively impact osteoclastogenesis in vitro via a mechanism involving osteoclast precursors per se as well as regulatory stromal cells (23Yamada T. Yamazaki H. Yamane T. Yoshino M. Okuyama H. Tsuneto M. Kurino T. Hayashi S. Sakano S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2227-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Although these efforts have been informative, genetic assessment of the role of NOTCH signaling in osteoblast and osteoclast formation and function is not in hand. Most important, no information exists regarding the role of NOTCH in maintaining the mature skeleton, a highly plastic tissue, in vivo and how it would respond to inhibition of NOTCH signaling in the adult.Osteoclasts differentiate from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in response to RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (27Teitelbaum S.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recruitment of these resorptive polykaryons is physiologically restricted by osteoprotegerin (OPG) (27Teitelbaum S.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Molecules that modulate the resorptive process often do so by regulating expression of these osteoblast-produced cytokines. Alternatively, osteoclastogenesis is also governed by direct targeting of osteoclast precursors by agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α (28Kitaura H. Zhou P. Kim H.J. Novack D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).In this study, we focused on mice with individual and combined deletions of Notch1-3 and found that the selective absence of Notch1 in either osteoclast or osteoblast lineage cells enhances osteoclastogenesis by different mechanisms, resulting in stimulated bone resorption. Thus, NOTCH1 signaling limits postnatal bone degradation. These observations identify osteoporosis as a potential complication of therapeutic inhibition of NOTCH activity in humans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—The generation of Notch1flox/flox, Notch2flox/flox, and Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox mice has been described (29Pan Y. Lin M.-H. Tian X. Cheng H.-T. Gridley T. Shen J. Kopan R. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Notch3-/- B6.129P2-Lyzstm1(cre)Ifo/J (also known as LysMcre) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice transgenic for Col1-cre, which expresses Cre under the control of a 2.3-kb promoter sequence of the murine Colα1(I) gene and which was shown previously to function effectively in more committed osteoblasts, were provided by Dr. Henry Kronenberg (Massachusetts General Hospital) (30Miao D. He B. Jiang Y. Kobayashi T. Soroceanu M.A. Zhao J. Su H. Tong X. Amizuka N. Gupta A. Genant H.K. Kronenberg H.M. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2402-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in the animal care unit of the Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, and were maintained according to guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All animal experimentation was approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine. 6-8-week-old mice were used in all circumstances.Reagents—Recombinant murine M-CSF was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Glutathione S-transferase-RANKL was expressed in our laboratory as described (31McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was obtained from Covance Research Products (Princeton, NJ). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The plasmid transfection reagent FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Applied Science.Plasmids and Transfection—Turbo-cre was cloned into the pMX vector to generate retroviruses. NICD1 was amplified from a mouse macrophage cDNA library by PCR and cloned into the pMX vector linked to a HA tag at the C terminus. Mutant Nicd1 (referred to as M2) (32Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned from a mouse full-length Notch1 plasmid by PCR into the pMX vector. For transfection, cells were plated into 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 24 h, and 8 μg of plasmid was transfected according to the protocol of Roche Applied Science.Western Blotting—HA-tagged Nicd1 and M2 in the pMX vector were transfected into Plat-E cells to generate retroviruses. BMMs from C57B/6 mice were infected with the viruses and selected by blasticidin. Anti-HA antibody was used to detect the expression levels of these proteins. Anti-NOTCH1 and anti-NOTCH3 antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).Osteoclast Lineage Cells—Macrophages/osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts were generated from bone marrow precursors as described (33Wang M.W. Wei S. Faccio R. Takeshita S. Tebas P. Powderly W.G. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Characterization of Osteoclasts—BMMs were cultured in 96-well cell culture dishes in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml or the doses detailed in the figure legends). Media were changed on day 3. On day 5, osteoclast-like cells were characterized by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. The number of osteoclasts was counted as described previously (33Wang M.W. Wei S. Faccio R. Takeshita S. Tebas P. Powderly W.G. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Primary Osteoblast and Macrophage Co-culture Assay—Primary osteoblasts were extracted from 3-5-day-old neonatal calvariae. Macrophages were extracted from bone marrow. The cells (5 × 104 of each type/well) were mixed and cultured in α-10 cell culture medium in 24-well plates with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (10-8 m) for 7 days. The osteoblasts were lifted by collagenase, and the remaining cells were stained for TRAP activity.Bone Resorption Assay in Vitro—Osteoclasts were generated on whale dentin slices from BMMs in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. On day 7, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for TRAP activity. To visualize resorption lacunae, cells were removed from the dentin slices with 0.5 m ammonium hydroxide and mechanical agitation. Dentin slides were stained with toluidine blue.Cell Stimulation and Immunoblotting—For M-CSF and RANKL/RANK signaling experiments, BMMs were starved for 6 h, following which RANKL (100 ng/ml) or M-CSF (50 ng/ml) was added to the media. The cells were lysed over time, and the lysate was subjected to immunoblotting.Mineralized Bone Nodule Formation—Osteoblasts were cultured in osteoblast differentiation medium for 14 days (34Zou W. Kitaura H. Reeve J. Long F. Tybulewicz V.L. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with and incubated in 0.4% alizarin red S solution at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then washed, dehydrated in ethanol, and air-dried.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. PCR was performed with 1 μl of cDNA reaction mixture using Taq polymerase and appropriate primers in a volume of 50 μl. The genes to be tested were amplified in a PCR Express Thermal Cycler (Thermo Hybaid, Ulm, Germany). The cDNA was denatured at 94 °C for 5 min and subsequently subjected to various amplification cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The primers used were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGCAGCGAACTTTATTGATG-3′; β-actin, 5′-ATGGATGACGATATCGCTG-3′ and 5′-ATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGT-3′; M-CSF, 5′-GACTTCATGCCAGATTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGCTTTAGGGTACAGG-3′; OPG, 5′-CCACTCTTATACGGACAGCT-3′ and 5′-TCTCGGCATTCACTTTGGTC-3′; RANKL, 5′-CAGGTTTGCAGGACTCGAC-3′ and 5′-AGCAGGGAAGGGTTGGACA-3′; TLR2, 5′-GGAGACTCTGGAAGCAGGCG-3′ and 5′-GGCTTCCTCTTGGCCTGGAG-3′; c-Fms, 5′-TGAATGGCTCTGATGTCCTG-3′ and 5′-TTCTCATTGTAGGGCAACTG-3′; and RANK, 5′-CCAGTCAGCAAGAAGTGTGT-3′ and 5′-TCTGTTGAGTTGGAGCTGAC-3′.Proliferation Assay—BMMs (plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 5000 cells/well) were maintained for 2 days in α-10 medium with 20 ng/ml M-CSF and labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for the last 4 h of culture. BrdUrd incorporation was determined using the Biotrak ELISA system (Amersham Biosciences).Media C-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Bone Collagen (CTx) Assay—BMMs were cultured on dentin in 96-well plates with RANKL and M-CSF for 4 days. α-10 medium was changed 1 day before harvesting. The media CTx concentration was determined using a CrossLaps for Culture ELISA kit (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S, Herlev, Denmark).Serum CTx Assay—RANKL (100 μg/mouse/day) or PBS was injected subcutaneously daily for 7 days. 2 days after the final injection, serum was collected. The CTx concentration was determined by using a RatLaps ELISA kit (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S). For parathyroid hormone (PTH)-based experiments, 10 μg of synthetic human PTH-(1-34) (Bachem California Inc., Torrance, CA) in 25 μl of vehicle (1 mm HCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) or vehicle alone was injected four times/day for 4 days into supracalvarial subcutaneous tissue.RANKL-stimulated Bone Loss in Vivo—RANKL (100 μg/mouse/day) or PBS was injected subcutaneously once per day for 7 days. 2 days after the final injection, the mice were killed, and the tibias (devoid of soft tissue) were used to determine trabecular bone volume by micro-computerized tomography.Statistics—Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and representative data are presented.RESULTSNotch1-3 Deletion Promotes Osteoclast Differentiation—To avoid ambiguity due to possible redundancy among NOTCH paralogs and to circumvent embryonic lethality associated with loss of Notch1 or Notch2 (35Huppert S.S.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), we generated compound mice lacking all three receptors in osteoclast lineage cells. Thus, we mated Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox Notch3-/- mice with animals transgenic for Cre recombinase driven by the myeloid-specific lyzs promoter, producing offspring bearing the LysMcre(+)Notch1flox/+ Notch2flox/+ Notch3+/- genotype. These animals served as controls in all experiments relating to the absence of Notch1-3 in osteoclasts. They were also backcrossed with Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox Notch3-/- mice. One product of this mating, viz. LysMcre(+) Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox Notch3+/-, were then bred with Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox Notch3-/- animals to generate LysMcre(+)Notch1flox/flox Notch2flox/flox Notch3-/- mice whose osteoclast lineage cells were deleted of all three Notch genes (hereafter referred to as Notch1,2,3OC-/-).Using these compound mice, we investigated whether loss of NOTCH signaling in osteoclast lineage cells impacts their capacity to differentiate into mature resorptive polykaryons. Osteoclast precursors in the form of BMMs isolated from Notch1,2,3OC-/- and control mice were cultured with increasing amounts of M-CSF and/or RANKL. After 4 days, the cells were stained for TRAP activity as a marker of osteoclast differentiation. Compared with control cells, Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs differentiated into more and larger osteoclasts in response to cytokines (Fig. 1). The enhancement of osteoclast number was particularly evident at lower concentrations of M-CSF or RANKL, indicating that global Notch deficiency sensitizes BMMs to osteoclastogenic cytokines.Notch1-3 Deletion Increases Osteoclast Resorptive Activity in Vitro and in Vivo—To determine whether the stimulated differentiation of Notch1,2,3OC-/- osteoclasts translates into increased bone resorption, we maintained BMMs on dentin in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL (100 ng/ml). Similar to plating on plastic, the abundance of dentin-residing Notch1,2,3OC-/- osteoclasts was substantially increased compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Consequent to their enhanced numbers, Notch1,2,3OC-/- cells generated greater numbers of resorption lacunae on dentin, identified by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 2B). The augmented levels of the resorption marker CTx in the medium conditioned by Notch1,2,3OC-/- osteoclasts on dentin slices confirmed that matrix degradation was enhanced (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Notch deletion enhances osteoclast resorptive function in vitro and in vivo. Equal numbers of control and Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs were cultured on dentin slides in the presence of RANKL (100 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 7 days to generate mature osteoclasts. A, osteoclasts were identified by TRAP staining, and the number/slice was counted. B, following removal of osteoclasts, the dentin slides were stained with toluidine blue to visualize resorptive lacunae. C, 6 days after initiation of culture, the medium was changed. 24 h later, the medium was collected, and CTx content was assessed as a marker of resorption. D, histological sections of calvariae from 6-8-week-old control and Notch1,2,3OC-/- mice were stained for TRAP activity, and the number of osteoclasts/mm of bone surface was histomorphometrically quantitated. E, control and Notch1,2,3OC-/- mice were injected with PBS or 100 mg of RANKL each day for 7 days. The next day, the mice were killed, and serum CTx levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. F, the trabecular bone volume of tibias from mice detailed in E was determined by micro-computerized tomography. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that global Notch deletion in osteoclast lineage cells also stimulates resorption in vivo, we prepared TRAP-stained histological sections of calvariae from Notch1,2,3OC-/- and control mice. Consistent with our in vitro findings, absence of Notch1-3 in osteoclast lineage cells promoted increased numbers of bone-resorptive cells in vivo (Fig. 2D). For a more quantitative assessment of global bone resorption, we injected control or Notch1,2,3OC-/- mice with RANKL (100 μg/day) for 7 days and measured serum CTx 24 h later. Again, in keeping with our in vitro observations, circulating CTx was increased by 2-fold in RANKL-treated Notch1,2,3OC-/- mice, demonstrating a sensitized response in vivo (Fig. 2E). The enhanced resorptive activity in RANKL-treated Notch1,2,3OC-/- mice resulted in accelerated skeletal loss as shown by μCT-determined trabecular bone volume (Fig. 2F).Notch1-3 Deletion Stimulates Osteoclast Precursor Proliferation—Enhanced osteoclastogenesis of Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs may reflect accelerated proliferation in response to M-CSF in addition to their sensitized response to cytokine. To examine this possibility, we treated cytokine-starved Notch1,2,3OC-/- and control BMMs with 20 ng/ml M-CSF. We measured their proliferative rate after 24 h by BrdUrd incorporation. As shown in Fig. 3A, Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs incorporated 3-fold more BrdUrd than did their control counterparts, indicating a larger fraction of cells in S phase. This observation may be explained by the observation that Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs (lacking all three NOTCH paralogs) expressed increased amounts of c-Fms, the receptor of M-CSF (Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was no appreciable difference in RANK expression (data not shown). Thus, NOTCH signaling inhibits the response to M-CSF-induced precursor proliferation, which is likely to contribute to the stimulated osteoclastogenesis evident in Notch1,2,3OC-/- osteoclast lineage cells.FIGURE 3Notch deletion accelerates BMM proliferation. A, control and Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs were starved for 6 h and then exposed to M-CSF (20 mg/ml) for 4 h. Proliferation was determined as a function of BrdUrd incorporation. B, control (Con) and Notch1,2,3OC-/- BMMs were assayed for c-Fms expression (arrowheads) by immunoblotting of total cell lysate.

To investigate whether NOTCH1 activation inhibits osteoclastogenesis, we retrovirally transduced wild-type (WT) BMMs with HA-tagged Nicd1 or the transcriptionally inactive Nicd1 mutant, M2 (Fig. 4A) (32Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The infected cells were then exposed to M-CSF and RANKL for 5 days. As shown in Fig. 4B, empty vector-transduced BMMs, but not those expressing NICD1, readily differentiated into osteoclasts. Hence, NOTCH1 signaling suppresses osteoclast differentiation. Interestingly, M2-transfected BMMs produced more and larger osteoclasts than those bearing empty vector. Because M2 can bind to CSL but cannot assemble a transcription complex (39Lubman O.Y. Korolev S.V. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 619-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), its effect on osteoclast formation is consistent with a weak dominant-negative effect on endogenous NOTCH receptors.FIGURE 4NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoclastogenesis. A, WT BMMs were retrovirally transduced with the pMX vector, HA-Nicd1, or HA-M2.

https://openalex.org/W2144611722,"Dysfunctions of Ca2+ homeostasis and of mitochondria have been studied in immortalized striatal cells from a commonly used Huntington disease mouse model. Transcriptional changes in the components of the phosphatidylinositol cycle and in the receptors for myo-inositol trisphosphate-linked agonists have been found in the cells and in the striatum of the parent Huntington disease mouse. The overall result of the changes is to delay myo-inositol trisphosphate production and to decrease basal Ca2+ in mutant cells. When tested directly, mitochondria in mutant cells behave nearly normally, but are unable to handle large Ca2+ loads. This appears to be due to the increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the permeability transition pore, which dissipates the membrane potential, prompting the release of accumulated Ca2+. Harmful reactive oxygen species, which are produced by defective mitochondria and may in turn stress them, increase in mutant cells, particularly if the damage to mitochondria is artificially exacerbated, for instance with complex II inhibitors. Mitochondria in mutant cells are thus peculiarly vulnerable to stresses induced by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species. The observed decrease of cell Ca2+ could be a compensatory attempt to prevent the Ca2+ stress that would irreversibly damage mitochondria and eventually lead to cell death."

However, the use of gammaretroviral vectors in these trials led to insertional activation of nearby oncogenes and leukemias in some study subjects, prompting studies of modified or alternative vector systems5. Here we describe the use of foamy virus vectors to treat canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD). Four of five dogs with CLAD that received nonmyeloablative conditioning and infusion of autologous, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced by a foamy virus vector expressing canine CD18 had complete reversal of the CLAD phenotype, which was sustained more than 2 years after infusion. In vitro assays showed correction of the lymphocyte proliferation and neutrophil adhesion defects that characterize CLAD. There were no genotoxic complications, and integration site analysis showed polyclonality of transduced cells and a decreased risk of integration near oncogenes as compared to gammaretroviral vectors. These results represent the first successful use of a foamy virus vector to treat a genetic disease, to our knowledge, and suggest that foamy virus vectors will be effective in treating human hematopoietic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2025520382,"In tooth morphogenesis, the dental epithelium and mesenchyme interact reciprocally for growth and differentiation to form the proper number and shapes of teeth. We previously identified epiprofin (Epfn), a gene preferentially expressed in dental epithelia, differentiated ameloblasts, and certain ectodermal organs. To identify the role of Epfn in tooth development, we created Epfn-deficient mice (Epfn-/-). Epfn-/- mice developed an excess number of teeth, enamel deficiency, defects in cusp and root formation, and abnormal dentin structure. Mutant tooth germs formed multiple dental epithelial buds into the mesenchyme. In Epfn-/- molars, rapid proliferation and differentiation of the inner dental epithelium were inhibited, and the dental epithelium retained the progenitor phenotype. Formation of the enamel knot, a signaling center for cusps, whose cells differentiate from the dental epithelium, was also inhibited. However, multiple premature nonproliferating enamel knot-like structures were formed ectopically. These dental epithelial abnormalities were accompanied by dysregulation of Lef-1, which is required for the normal transition from the bud to cap stage. Transfection of an Epfn vector promoted dental epithelial cell differentiation into ameloblasts and activated promoter activity of the enamel matrix ameloblastin gene. Our results suggest that in Epfn-deficient teeth, ectopic nonproliferating regions likely bud off from the self-renewable dental epithelium, form multiple branches, and eventually develop into supernumerary teeth. Thus, Epfn has multiple functions for cell fate determination of the dental epithelium by regulating both proliferation and differentiation, preventing continuous tooth budding and generation.

Ectodermal organ development is a complex process initiated by inductive tissue interactions (1Pispa J. Thesleff I. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The developing tooth is a classic example of such inductive processes (2Jernvall J. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev.

The dental lamina undergoes further proliferation and subsequently develops into the tooth bud. The tooth bud is formed by the invagination of the placode and the condensation of mesenchyme cells adjacent to the bud. At the bud stage (E13.5), dental epithelial cells proliferate diffusely. At the cap stage (E14.5), dental epithelial cells differentiate into several cell types: the cervical loop, stellate reticulum, stratum intermedium, outer dental epithelium, inner dental epithelium, and enamel knot. Cell death by apoptosis within the enamel knot is critical for cusp formation in molars. These epithelial cells proliferate at different dividing rates to form the unique shape of the enamel organ. For example, a nonproliferating epithelial cell mass forms the enamel knot at the center of the tooth bud. At the bell stage (E17.5), the dental mesenchyme differentiates into dentin matrix-secreting odontoblasts that form dentin, and then the inner dental epithelial cells differentiate into enamel matrix-secreting ameloblasts that form enamel.

Epiprofin (Epfn) was previously identified by differential hybridization using tooth germ cDNA microchips as a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in certain developing ectodermal tissues such as teeth, hair follicles, and limbs (18Nakamura T.

Epfn is a homologue of KLF14/Sp6, belonging to the Sp transcription factor superfamily (19Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R.

To date, there are nine Sp genes (Sp1–Sp9) in the mammalian genome. These Sp proteins regulate transcription of various genes in a positive and/or negative manner. Although all these Sp factors contain a high degree of structural conservation of the zinc finger domain, each appears to have distinctive regulatory specificity. In this report, we created Epfn-deficient mice that initially had delayed tooth development but later developed an excess number of teeth and had a complete loss of enamel and a defective dentin structure. We found that Epfn is an essential regulator for branching of tooth buds to form the proper number of teeth and for differentiation of the dental epithelium and mesenchyme. Targeting of Embryonic Stem Cells and Generation of Chimeras–A genomic clone including the epiprofin locus was isolated from a 129/SV genomic library. The targeting vector was constructed and electroporated into R1 ES cells (see Fig. 1). Three independent targeted ES cell clones produced chimeras that transmitted the mutant allele through the germline. Heterozygous progeny were generated with backcrossing to wild-type C57BL/6 for at least five generations. Animal care was given in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the Use of Laboratory and Experimental Animals. Cell Culture and Transfection–SF2 cells, a preameloblast cell line, were established as described (21Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. SF2 cells differentiated into ameloblasts in the presence of BMP2 (data not shown). SF2 cells were transfected with the Epfn expression vector (Epfn-pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (18Nakamura T.

For the ameloblastin (Ambn) promoter assay, SF2 cells, NIH3T3, or MC3T3-E1 cells were cotransfected with the Epfn vector and the Ambn promoter reporter construct containing a 2.7-kb Ambn promoter in the pNASSb-basic (Promega) vector using the Lipofectamine kit. The cytomegalovirus promoter-based pcDNA3.1/β-galactosidase vector (Invitrogen) was used as a positive control. After a 48-h transfection, β-galactosidase assays were performed using the β-galactosidase reporter gene assay chemiluminescent kit (Roche Applied Science). Tissue Sections, Immunohistochemistry, BrdUrd Labeling, and TUNEL Assays–Mouse heads in several stages of development were dissected out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Adult tooth tissues were decalcified with 250 mm EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. For histological analysis, sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin Y. For immunohistochemistry, sections were boiled with targeted retrieval solution (Dako) and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline (blocking reagent) for 1 h prior to incubation with the primary antibody. We used antibodies to ameloblastin (22Krebsbach P.H. Lee S.K. Matsuki Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody to the Epfn peptide (residues 33–51) was raised and purified by a peptide affinity column. Primary antibodies were detected by Cy-3-conjugated and Cy-5-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclear staining was performed with Hoechst dye (Sigma). Primary Epfn and phospho-pRb antibodies were detected with a biotinylated antibody against rabbit IgG and avidin-conjugated peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and visualized using diaminobenzidine as a chromogenic peroxidase substrate. To assess cell proliferation, BrdUrd (100 mg/kg of body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant females. The mice were euthanized 1 h after injection, and embryos were dissected and prepared for cryosections. To detect apoptotic cells, we used the ApopTag® Red in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon). RT-PCR–Total RNA was extracted from SF2 cells that were stably transfected with the Epfn vector and pooled using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen). After DNaseI (Sigma) treatment, 2 μg of total RNA was used for the reverse transcription to generate cDNA, which was used as a template for PCR reactions with gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1). For the semiquantitative RT-PCR, cDNA was amplified with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and then 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min.

In situ hybridization of mouse sections was performed as described previously (18Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Scanning Electron Microscope–Incisors of 12-week-old mice were fixed and decalcified in 4.13% EDTA, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and processed for embedding in LR White resin. Calcified incisors were fractured at several sites along their length, dehydrated in ethanol, critical point-dried with CO2, and examined in a JEOL JSM 5910 LV variable-pressure scanning electron microscope. Epiprofin-deficient Mice and Tooth Defects–We previously reported that Epfn is expressed in the dental epithelium from the early initiation stage to the enamel matrix secretion stage and in differentiated odontoblasts (18Nakamura T.

Epfn is also expressed in certain ectodermal tissues such as the matrix of hair follicles and the apical ectodermal ridge in limbs (18Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 626-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To identify the role of Epfn in the development of the tooth, we created mutant mice deficient for Epfn by deleting exon 2, which encodes the entire coding sequence of the Epfn gene using the conventional gene knock-out strategy (Fig. 1). Three independent targeted ES cell clones from R1 cells produced chimeras that transmitted the mutant allele through the germline. Heterozygous progeny were generated with backcrossing to wild-type C57BL/6 for at least five generations. Homozygous mice (Epfn-/-) are viable, but their body size is significantly smaller than that of wild-type or heterozygous mice. About 20% of Epfn-/- mice die at about the age of 2 months mice for an unknown cause, whereas the remaining survive with a life span similar to wild-type or heterozygous mice. Homozygous mice (Epfn-/-) are viable and have severe defects in teeth, as described below. They also have defects in skin, hair follicles, and digit formation. Development of teeth in mutant mice was delayed. Incisors and molars of mutant mice were not erupted at the age of 3 weeks, when wild-type incisors and molars were visible (Fig. 2, A and B). However, at later stages, mutant incisors had erupted with excess numbers (hyperdontia), e.g. more than 50 incisors by the age of 1 year (Fig. 2, C and D). Mutant incisors showed a chalky color, indicating a mineral defect. Radiographs also showed an excess number of molars (e.g. more than eight molars on each side of the mandible when compared with three molars on each side of the control mandible by the age of 1 year) (Fig. 2, E–H). The number of molars in Epfn-/- mice increased with age (e.g. 4–5 molars on each side of the mandible at the age of 4 weeks; data not shown). The molars had poorly developed cusps, which cause malocclusion. There were also severe defects in the dental root structure and alveolar bones (Fig. 2G). Scanning electron microscope imaging of the incisor surface of 12-week-old Epfn-/- mice showed that the entire enamel structure was completely missing (Fig. 3, A and C). Heterozygous Epfn+/- incisors had enamel, but it was wider than wild type, with an irregular and less compact structure (Fig. 3B). Dentinal tubule formation was also irregular in Epfn-/- mice when compared with that of wild-type mice, suggesting defects in deposition of dentin matrix and crystallization in dentin (Fig. 3, D–F). In the heterozygous Epfn+/- incisors, dentinal tubules were also less compact when compared with those of wild-type mice.FIGURE 3Absence of enamel and defects of dentin.

In early molar development through the bud stage (embryonic day E13.5), there was no significant morphological difference between mutant and control Epfn+/- mice. In Epfn-/- mice, a single dental placode (data not shown) and bud formed at the initial stage. However, molars were profoundly abnormal by E16.5 (Fig. 4A, panels b and f). Multiple branches of the dental epithelium invaginated into the dental mesenchyme, whereas control molars had single branching and a mesenchyme condensation area. In addition, cusp formation was inhibited in Epfn-/- molars. At postnatal day 3, in control molars, ameloblasts and odontoblasts were differentiated and well polarized, and enamel and dentin layers had formed (Fig. 4A, panel c). In contrast, in Epfn-/- mice, dental epithelial cells formed multiple cell layers in mutant molars and were not well polarized, and odontoblast differentiation was delayed and not observed at this stage (Fig. 4A, panel g). Consequently, the enamel layer was not formed, and dentin formation was delayed. Further, the dental epithelium formed multiple buds that resulted in excess future molars. In 3-week-old control molars, the enamel organ of the tooth germ was fully developed, whereas in mutant molars, the dental lamina was not separated from the oral epithelium layer, enamel was not formed, and the crown of the molars had reduced dental cusp sizes (Fig. 4A, panels d and h). In addition, several molars had developed from a single dental lamina. The initial stage of incisor development is similar to that of molars. However, in later stages, the epithelial cells only on the labial side differentiate into ameloblasts and produce enamel matrix, resulting in asymmetrical enamel formation in incisors. The continuous eruption of incisors is maintained by a continuous supply of progenitor cells in the apical bud localized in the cervical loop (Fig. 4B, panel a, cl). E16.5 control incisors formed a polarized inner dental epithelium cell layer on the labial side but not the lingual side, and odontoblasts and a thin dentin matrix layer were present on both sides. In mutant incisors at this stage, dental epithelia and mesenchyme were disorganized and undifferentiated when compared with control Epfn+/- incisors (Fig. 4B, panel f). The Epfn-/- incisor germ did not separate from the oral epithelium (Fig. 4B, panels b and g), and it developed a glove-like structure filled with undifferentiated epithelial cells and multiple buds surrounding the mesenchyme. Similar to molars, postnatal day 3 mutant incisors formed multiple apical buds, which originated from a single dental lamina, lacking enamel and dentin layers (Fig. 4B, panels g and h). At postnatal day 10, Epfn-/- incisors eventually formed dentin surrounded by a thin layer of undifferentiated epithelial cells (Fig. 4B, panels i and j). Defects in Ameloblast and Odontoblast Differentiation–We next examined the expression of tooth matrix proteins as differentiation markers in 10-day-old molars (Fig. 5). Ameloblastin and enamelin, specific to differentiated ameloblasts, were expressed by ameloblasts and secreted into the enamel matrix layer of Epfn+/- molars, whereas neither protein was detected in Epfn-/- molars (Fig. 5, A, B, E, and F). Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) was expressed by both ameloblasts and odontoblasts in Epfn+/- molars. However, in Epfn-/- molars, Dspp was negative in the epithelium and significantly reduced in odontoblasts and the dentin layer (Fig. 5, C and G). These results indicate that dental epithelial cell differentiation into ameloblasts was blocked in Epfn-/- mice and suggest that Epfn is required for ameloblast differentiation and that it regulates expression of Dspp in odontoblast differentiation. Dysregulation of Lef-1 and Shh–To address the molecular basis of tooth defects, we analyzed the expression of Lef-1 and Shh, which regulates tooth morphogenesis (Fig. 6). Deletion of Lef-1, a downstream transcription factor of Wnt/β-catenin, results in an absence of all teeth (23van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Whole-mount in situ hybridization of the E11.5 mouse mandible showed Lef-1 expression in the dental placode of the control mandible. In Epfn-/- mice, Lef-1 expression was up-regulated in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme of E11.5 maxilla and mandible processes (Fig. 6, A and E). At E14.5, Lef-1 expression was localized in the enamel knot and surrounding dental mesenchyme in control mice. However, in mutant teeth, Lef-1 expression was not localized in the enamel knot but rather extended into the inner dental epithelium layer (Fig. 6, B and F). The up-regulation of Lef-1 expression and its extended expression were also observed in the mesenchyme. Conditional deficiency of Shh in the dental epithelium inhibits differentiation of both the dental epithelium and the dental mesenchyme (25Gritli-Linde A. Bei M. Maas R. Zhang X.M. Linde A. McMahon A.P. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 5323-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In E14.5 Epfn+/- molars, Shh expression was restricted to the enamel knot. In the Epfn-/- molars, Shh expression at the enamel knot was significantly reduced, indicating that enamel knot formation was inhibited in Epfn-/- molars (Fig. 6, C and G). In control E14.5 molars, Epfn expression was observed in the inner dental epithelium (Fig. 6D). However, in Epfn-/- molars, Epfn was completely absent as expected. Defects in Rapid Proliferation of the Inner Dental Epithelium and Formation of Multiple Premature Enamel Knot-like Structures–Since we demonstrated that Epfn expression promotes cell proliferation in culture (18Nakamura T. Unda F. de-Vega S. Vilaxa A. Fukumoto S. Yamada K.M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 626-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we examined cell proliferation by immunostaining of proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA. In control E16.5 molars, Ki67 and PCNA were stained strongly in the outer and inner epithelial layers and condensing mesenchyme cells (Fig. 7, A, panels a and c). In Epfn-/- molars, staining in these cells was decreased and dispersed in the tooth germ (Fig. 7A, panels b and d). In control Epfn+/- molars, Epfn expression was restricted to the inner dental epithelial cells and the enamel knot cells at this stage (Fig. 7A, panels e and f). At E17.5, in Epfn+/- molars, the inner epithelial cell layer was expanded, and it strongly expressed Ki67 (Fig. 7B, panel a). In Epfn-/- molars, Ki67-positive cells (red) were dispersed in the whole tooth germ and also in surrounding mesenchyme cells (Fig. 7B, panel b). It is difficult to distinguish rapid and slow proliferating cells by Ki67 and PCNA immunostaining because these proteins are expressed from late G1 and have a relatively long half-life. To detect rapidly proliferating cells, we performed a short term BrdUrd incorporation assay and found that the inner dental epithelial cells were rapidly proliferating (Fig. 7B, panel c, yellow). In Epfn-/- molars, BrdUrd-positive cells were significantly reduced (Fig. 7B, panel d). The enamel knot epithelial cells normally do not proliferate and eventually die by apoptosis (26Vaahtokari A. Aberg T. Jernvall J. Keranen S. Thesleff I. Mech. Dev. 1996; 54: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In E17.5 Epfn+/- molars, there were TUNEL-positive cells in secondary enamel knots (Fig. 7B, panel e, arrowheads). In Epfn-/- molars, multiple ectopic TUNEL-positive areas were observed in the enamel organ (Fig. 7B, panel f). Unlike the enamel knots of Epfn+/- molars, Shh, one of the enamel knot markers, did not express in these areas, so these TUNEL-positive spots likely represent multiple premature enamel knots. The pRb protein plays a critical role in G1-S checkpoint control (27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). It is phosphorylated (Phos-pRb) at the end of G1 and remains so throughout S-G2. Unphosphorylated pRb prevents cell proliferation, whereas phosphorylation of pRb results in the activation of a number of genes required for S phase transition (28Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We found that in control Epfn+/- E17.5 molars, most of the inner dental epithelial cells were positive for Phos-pRb immunostaining, and enamel knot epithelial cells were negative for Phos-pRb, corresponding to the proliferative state and nonproliferative state of these cells, respectively (Fig. 7B, g and i). In Epfn-/- molars, Phos-pRb levels were lower, and the Phos-pRb-positive regions were patchy and disrupted with Phos-pRb-negative regions (Fig. 7B, panels h and j). The Phos-pRb-negative regions contained nonproliferating cells and likely represent multiple premature enamel knot-like structures. Epfn was expressed in both the inner dental epithelial layer and the secondary enamel knots in Epfn+/- molars (Fig. 7B, panel k). Our results suggest that Epfn is required for differentiation of the dental epithelium into inner and enamel knot epithelia. Epfn Promotes Differentiation of Dental Epithelial Cells in Culture–In Epfn-/- mice, ameloblast differentiation was blocked, and no enamel formed, suggesting that Epfn is required for ameloblast differentiation. To determine the activity of Epfn in dental epithelial differentiation, we transfected the Epfn expression vector into preameloblast cell line SF2, which has differentiation potential, and analyzed the expression of ameloblast markers by RT-PCR (Fig. 8A). We found that Epfn transfection increased the expression of Ambn and Dspp. Lef-1 is a marker of preameloblast cells, and its expression decreases when the cells differentiate in tooth development. Lef-1 expression was reduced in the Epfn-transfected cells, whereas fibronectin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase expression remained the same. To further confirm the differentiation-promotion activity of Epfn, we analyzed the Ambn promoter activity of an ameloblastin reporter construct in cells cotran"

Recent work showed that Dok1 negatively regulates integrin activation, presumably by competition with talin. To understand how this occurs, we used NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to investigate the molecular details of interactions with integrins. The binding affinities of β3 integrin tails for the Dok1 and talin phosphotyrosine binding domains were quantified using 15N-1H hetero-nuclear single quantum correlation titrations, revealing that the unphosphorylated integrin tail binds more strongly to talin than Dok1. Chemical shift mapping showed that unlike talin, Dok1 exclusively interacts with the canonical NPXY motif of the β3 integrin tail. Upon phosphorylation of Tyr747 in the β3 integrin tail, however, Dok1 then binds much more strongly than talin. Thus, we show that phosphorylation of Tyr747 provides a switch for integrin ligand binding. This switch may represent an in vivo mechanism for control of integrin receptor activation. These results have implications for the control of integrin signaling by proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding domains.

These results have implications for the control of integrin signaling by proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding domains. Integrins are cell surface receptors that play key roles in cell migration and adhesion by providing a physical connection between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton and transmitting signals through this connection. Thus, they have important functions in such biological processes as the immune response, leukocyte traffic, blood vessel development, hemostasis, and cancer (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6700) Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimers of an α and β subunit, each of which contains a large multidomain extracellular portion (>700 residues) and a short, largely unstructured cytoplasmic domain (13–70 residue), connected by a single transmembrane helix (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). Transmembrane signal transduction through the integrins can be conducted in either direction, in what is referred to as either outside-in or inside-out signaling. Ligand binding to the cytoplasmic tails is an important step in bidirectional signaling and can control the activation states of integrins (3Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integrin β subunit cytoplasmic tails are critical for integrin activation (4Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). They contain two NPXYorNPXY-like motifs, which have a propensity to form β turns (5Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

The talin PTB domain has, for example, been shown to bind to the NPLY motif in the β3 integrin subunit in this way. In addition, talin also uniquely recognizes a relatively independent binding site at the integrin membraneproximal region, an interaction that is key to integrin activation (7Wegener K.L.

The cytoplasmic protein Dok1 is involved in a variety of signaling pathways. It is a substrate of several other tyrosine kinases, suggesting that it has an important role in cell signaling (8Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and cell migration (9Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, Dok1 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated (10Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It has been identified as a key down-regulator of cytokine responses and is essential for suppression of leukemia (11Yasuda T. Shirakata M. Iwama A. Ishii A. Ebihara Y. Osawa M. Honda K. Shinohara H.

To date, seven members of the Dok family have been identified (13Grimm J. Sachs M. Britsch S. Di Cesare S. Schwarz-Romond T. Alitalo K. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (14Okada K. Inoue A. Okada M. Murata Y. Kakuta S. Jigami T. Kubo S. Shiraishi H. Eguchi K. Motomura M. Akiyama T. Iwakura Y. Higuchi O. Yamanashi Y. Science. 2006; 312: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), each of which is comprised of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a PTB domain and a tyrosine and proline rich sequence near the C terminus. Recently the Dok1 PTB domain has been shown to bind to β3 integrin tails (15Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the talin PTB domain, Dok1 negatively regulates integrin activation (7Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To investigate how this occurs, we set out to characterize the molecular basis of the interaction between the Dok1 PTB domain and the β3 integrin tail using NMR and x-ray crystallography. We show here that Dok1 binds specifically to the integrin NPLY motif and that this binding is positively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation has an inhibitory effect on talin binding. Thus, we show that, through opposing affinity effects, phosphorylation of β integrin Tyr747 will greatly increase the fraction of the Dok1-integrin complex while decreasing the fraction of talin-integrin complex; phosphorylation therefore could act as a “switch” that modulates integrin activation. These results have implications for other PTB domain-containing proteins and their possible interactions with β-integrin tails. Preparation and Purification of Peptides and Proteins—Peptides derived from the β3 integrin tail were synthesized commercially by EZBiolabs (Westfield, IN), GL Biochem (Shanghai, China), and GenScript (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ); they were assessed as >90% purity by high performance liquid chromatography, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. U-15N-labeled talin PTB domain and U-15N-labeled and U-15N,13C Dok1 PTB domain were expressed and purified as described previously (7Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C.

Unlabeled proteins were produced in a similar manner, but using Luria-Bertani broth rather than minimal medium. The DNA sequence of the full-length β3 integrin tail (Lys716–Thr762) was amplified and subcloned into a pET16b vector modified to contain a 3C protease cleavage site using the In-Fusion cloning system (Clontech). The U-15N-labeled β3 integrin tail was produced by Escherichia coli grown in M9 minimal medium with [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. Upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the β3 integrin tail was expressed insolubly, as inclusion bodies. The bacteria were lysed, and the integrin tail was purified under denaturing conditions (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, pH 7.0) by Talon immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Clontech), eluting the polyhistidine-tagged integrin tail in 200 mm imidazole. Further purification was performed by C4 reverse phase HPLC. The polyhistidine tag was removed by cleavage with 3C protease, and the integrin tail was further purified by HPLC, leaving a construct with the sequence of the β3 integrin tail, preceded by two amino acids from the vector (Gly-Pro). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on spectrometers equipped with Oxford Instruments super-conducting magnets (500, 600, and 750 MHz 1H operating frequencies) and GE/Omega computers. Unless otherwise indicated, all samples were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.1), containing 100 mm NaCl and 5% D2O. Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and sodium azide (final concentration 0.05%) were also present. The backbone signals of the Dok1 PTB domain were assigned using a sample of 1.5 mm [U-15N/13C]Dok1 PTB domain, employing standard techniques including three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH and CBCANH experiments. The 1H and 15N resonances of U-15N-labeled β3 integrin tail were assigned using a 1 mm sample in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and employing three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC and three-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectra. Resonance assignments were then transferred to pH 6.1 through pH titrations. Spectra were referenced in the direct dimension either to the water signal (4.766 ppm 1H ref at 25 °C) or to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt at 0 ppm, with indirect referencing in the 15N dimension using a 15N-1H frequency ratio of 0.101329118 (17Wishart D.S.

Weighted combined 1H and 15N amide shifts (Δ(H,N)) were calculated using the equation, Δ(H,N)=ΔHWH2+ΔNWN2 where WH and WN are weighting factors for the 1H and 15N amide shifts, respectively (WH = 1, WN = 0.154) (19Ayed A. Mulder F.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and Δ= δbound – δfree. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by fitting changes in backbone chemical shift with concentration, to the following equation, Δ(H,N)=Δ(H,N)0[P]+[L]+Kd-([P]+[L]+Kd)2-4[P][L]2[P] where Kd is the dissociation constant, Δ(H,N) is the weighted shift change, Δ(H,N)0 is the shift change at saturation, whereas [P] and [L] are the protein and ligand concentrations, respectively. Data from the highest signal-to-noise ratio peaks with the greatest shift changes were fit simultaneously to this equation with the program Origin (v7.0383, OriginLab Corp.), extracting a single Kd and multiple Δ(H,N)0 values. Only peaks that were well resolved throughout the titration were used. Twenty-one peaks were used for Dok1 with the β3 integrin peptide, 19 for Dok1 with pTyr747-β3 integrin, 22 for talin with β3 integrin, and 19 for talin with pTyr747-β3 integrin. For the full-length β3 integrin peptide with talin, 22 peaks were used, and seven peaks were used for the full-length β3 integrin with Dok1. Crystallization—Human Dok1 PTB domain was dialyzed into 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml. Crystals grew in 2 m NH4SO4, 2% polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, within 1 week at 20 °C. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) on beamline ID14-EH2, and the crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol as a cryo-protectant. Data were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM and then scaled and merged using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (20Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The crystal belonged to the space group C2, containing four molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 48.6%. The electron density for the four molecules was averaged using the CCP4 program DM. After averaging, the model was rebuilt using the program ARP/wARP.

The atomic coordinates of the residues of the RET peptide were copied into the coordinate file of the human Dok1 PTB domain structure, and the side chains of the RET peptide were mutated to those of the β3 integrin tail using the program COOT from the CCP4 suit. This preliminary model was energy-minimized employing a simulated annealing protocol (initial temperature 5000 K) using PHENIX Refine (Python-based hierarchical environment for integrated Xtallography) (24Adams P.D.

The coordinates of the human Dok1 PTB domain crystal structure were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the ID code 2v76. The coordinates of the modeled integrin peptide-dok1 complex are included as supplemental data. Dok1 and Talin PTB Domain Binding to Full-length β3 Integrin Tail—To understand the molecular mechanism by which Dok1 PTB negatively regulates integrin activation (7Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we set out to determine the binding mode of the human Dok1 PTB domain to the β3 integrin tail using NMR. This was done by assigning the backbone resonances of the 15N isotopically labeled full-length β3 integrin peptide in solution and then observing the amide chemical shift changes in 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra upon the addition of unlabeled Dok1 PTB domain. Fig. 1A shows that the residues surrounding the NPLY region of β3 integrin are perturbed, whereas the membrane-proximal residues are unaffected. Following the chemical shift changes, as a function of ligand concentration, shows that the Kd of this interaction is at least several millimolars (Fig. 1B). A similar titration was performed for the β3 integrin tail with the talin PTB domain, and a Kd value of 223 ± 5 μm was calculated (Fig. 1B), revealing that talin has a higher affinity for unmodified β3 integrin tails than Dok1 by at least an order of magnitude. Dok1 PTB Binding to β3 Integrin Tail and to Tyr(P)-747 β3 Integrin Tail—To determine the effect of β3 integrin tails on Dok1, similar NMR titrations were performed, this time using 15N-labeled Dok1 and synthetic unlabeled integrin tail fragments. The chemical shifts of the Dok1 PTB domain backbone atoms were first assigned in the unbound state, before titrating in β3 integrin tail-derived peptides. All NMR spectra were consistent with Dok1 existing in a monomeric state. Two peptides were tested, each having the sequence 736RAKWDTANNPLYKE749, but with the second peptide phosphorylated at Tyr-747. Titration with the unphosphorylated integrin peptide revealed chemical shift perturbations to residues from strand β5, the loop between strands β6 and β7 and along the C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2A). The pattern of perturbations is similar to that found for the talin PTB domain binding to the same peptide (16de Pereda J.M. Wegener K.L. Santelli E. Bate N. Ginsberg M.H. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8381-8386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating a similar mode of interaction, with a dissociation constant of 14.3 ± 0.80 mm (Fig. 2B). In contrast, titration with the pTyr747 phospho-peptide produced larger chemical shift changes (Fig. 2A), particularly in the region surrounding the canonical NPXY peptide binding pocket. Residue Arg222, which contacts a sulfate ion in the crystal structure (vide infra), had the greatest perturbation. The dissociation constant for this interaction was calculated as 37 ± 1.0 μm, a 400-fold increase in affinity when compared with the unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2B). Talin PTB Binding to β3 Integrin Tail and to Tyr(P)-747 β3 Integrin Tail—NMR was again used to study the effect of β-integrin Tyr747 phosphorylation on binding to the talin PTB domain. The backbone resonances of the talin PTB domain have been assigned previously (16de Pereda J.M. Wegener K.L. Santelli E. Bate N. Ginsberg M.H. Critchley D.R. Campbell I.D. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8381-8386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two 1H-15N HSQC titrations were performed using the same phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides as used in the Dok1 experiments. The phosphorylated peptide perturbed similar residues to those affected by the unmodified peptide, with the strongest chemical shifts once again observed in strand β5, the loop between strands β6 and β7 and the C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 3A). The magnitudes of the chemical shift changes suggest that the pTyr747 β3 integrin peptide binds more weakly to the talin PTB domain than to the unphosphorylated peptide. The dissociation constants were calculated to be 3.49 ± 0.047 mm for the unphosphorylated peptide and 6.53 ± 0.14 mm for the pTyr747 phosphorylated integrin peptide (Fig. 3B). Thus, in contrast to the case for the Dok1 PTB domain, phosphorylation of the β3 integrin tail has a negative effect on affinity for the talin PTB domain. Crystal Structure of the Human Dok1 PTB Domain—The crystal structure of the human Dok1 PTB domain was solved by molecular replacement at 1.6 Å. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The Dok1 PTB domain is comprised of seven β strands, a 310 turn between β strands 4 and 5, and two α-helixes, of which the first α-helix is truncated. The seven β strands form a β sandwich comprised of two almost orthogonal antiparallel β sheets. The sandwich is capped by the C-terminal α-helix, whereas the second α-helix is inserted between strands 1 and 2. This is a typical fold for a PTB domain of the IRS group (29Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The crystal asymmetric unit contains four copies of the Dok1 PTB domain, termed A, B, C, and D, super-imposing with an root mean square deviation of 0.20 Å.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData Collection Synchrotron sourceESRF ID14-EH2 s Space GroupC2 Unit cell (Å, deg)a = 76.88, b = 100.17, c = 67.10, β = 117.34 Resolution (Å)25.98-1.6 (1.68-1.6) No. of Reflections447803 No. of unique reflections59364 Completeness (%)99.7 (98.3) Multiplicity7.5 (3.6) Mean I/(I)22.3 (2.5) Rmerge (%)0.061 (0.383) Rpim (within I+/I-)0.02 (0.234)Refinement statistics R-factor (%)18.8 Rfree (%)22.4r.m.s.d. from ideal geometry Bond lengths (Å)0.017 Angles (deg)1.557Ramachandran plot Most favored region (%)93 Additionally allowed (%)7 Generously allowed (%)0 Disallowed (%)0 Open table in a new tab For chain A, electron density was observed for residues 2–104, but density was absent for residues 42–45, which are located in a loop between β-strands 3 and 4. For chain B and C, residues 5–106 were identified, and for chain D, electron density was observed for residues 5–103. Three of the four molecules (A, B, and D) associate with a sulfate ion accommodated in a positively charged pocket formed by Arg222 and Arg207 (Fig. 4A). Structural Modeling of the pTyr747 β3 Integrin Tail-Dok1 PTB Domain Interaction—Attempts to co-crystallize Dok1 PTB with the pTyr-747 β3 integrin tail produced crystals twinned to 43% and were thus not solved. To obtain a structural model of the pTyr-747 β3 integrin tail-Dok1 PTB domain interaction, we used the human Dok1 PTB domain crystal structure, as determined here, and the crystal structure of a complex between RET peptide and the mouse Dok1 PTB domain, as a template (1uef (21Shi N. Ye S. Bartlam M. Yang M. Wu J. Liu Y. Sun F. Han X. Peng X. Qiang B. Yuan J. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4962-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). The RET peptide includes an NKLpY motif that binds the mouse Dok1 PTB domain in an analogous fashion to the canonical NPXY-PTB domain recognition mode (28Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our model, the phosphate group from integrin pTyr747 is predicted to lie within hydrogen-bonding distance of the Arg222 and Arg207 of the side chains of Dok1 (Fig. 4B). These two residues, Arg222 in particular, are strongly perturbed in the NMR spectra upon the addition of the pTyr-747 integrin peptide (Fig. 2A). In the crystal structure of the native Dok1 PTB domain, this position is occupied by a sulfate ion, suggesting that this region of Dok1 is a binding pocket for negatively charged groups. The two key arginine residues that coordinate the phosphate moiety are conserved in PTB domains of the IRS-like group as classified by Uhlik et al. (29Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Exceptions to this are the talin and MIG-2 PTB domains, which have aspartic acid residues at the position corresponding to Arg222 in Dok1. This observation is consistent with the affinity values in our NMR studies of the talin PTB-β3 integrin tail interaction. Binding of β3 integrin tails to talin is the final step in integrin activation (15Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The key molecular interaction required for activation is direct contact between the talin PTB domain and the membrane-proximal region of the β3 integrin tail (7Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It has also been shown, using a cell-based functional assay, that Dok1 negatively regulates integrin activation. Here we show that the Dok1 PTB domain binds exclusively to the central NPLY motif of the wild-type full-length β3 integrin tail and does not make contact with the membrane-proximal residues. Thus, Dok1 is expected to compete with talin for the NPLY binding site but not to cause activation due to the lack of interaction with the membrane-proximal region. We have also shown here that β3 integrin tail fragments containing the NPLY region have a 3-fold higher affinity for talin than they do for Dok1. Utilizing the full integrin tail peptide increases the affinity for talin to 223 ± 5 μm due to additional interactions with membrane-proximal residues. However, tail interactions with Dok1 remain at a millimolar level. How then can Dok1 negatively regulate integrin activation? One possibility is that the effects seen in the cell-based assays were introduced by the transfection system itself. Another explanation is the involvement of phosphorylation. There is evidence from previous studies that Dok1 ligand binding is phosphorylation-dependent; for example, the Dok1 PTB domain has been proposed as a phosphorylation-dependent negative regulator of T cell receptor signaling (30Yasuda T. Bundo K. Hino A. Honda K. Inoue A. Shirakata M. Osawa M. Tamura T. Nariuchi H. Oda H. Yamamoto T. Yamanashi Y. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments also point to a phosphorylation-dependent association of Dok1 with the β3 integrin tail (31Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies have hinted at the biological importance of β3 integrin tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly at Tyr747. Mutation of Tyr747 to a non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine disrupted adhesion and clot retraction in hematopoietic cells, indicating that phosphorylation is important for normal integrin function in these cells (32Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the Y783F/Y795F β1 tail mutations in the mouse have a mild phenotype (33Czuchra A. Meyer H. Legate K.R. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the corresponding Y747F/Y759F β3 integrin knock-in mouse has demonstrated disrupted platelet signaling manifested as a bleeding defect (34Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 integrin tail decreases the affinity of αVβ3 for its extracellular ligand fibronectin (35Datta A. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3943-3949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additional studies have indicated a role for β3 tyrosine phosphorylation in Rho family GTPase signaling pathways, which play a fundamental role in cytoskeletal organization (36Gao C. Schaefer E. Lakkis M. Blystone S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15422-15429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Chandhoke S.K. Williams M. Schaefer E. Zorn L. Blystone S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data, taken together with these studies, not only highlight the role of integrin tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell but also indicate the targeted nature of this modification, manifested as a switch for integrin activation. Our peptide titration studies with β3 integrin tail fragments, containing either the phosphorylated or the unphosphorylated NPLY recognition motif, clearly show that the unphosphorylated integrin tail has a 3-fold preference for the talin PTB domain, over that of Dok1. Phosphorylation of Tyr747, however, enhances binding to Dok1 ∼400-fold (from 14.3 mm to 37 μm), whereas the binding affinity to the talin PTB domain decreases by 2-fold (from 3.49 to 6.53 mm). Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr747 switches the binding preference of the integrin tail from talin to the Dok1 PTB domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-tail thus allows Dok1 to compete strongly with talin, and this would result in down-regulation of integrin activation. These results agree with previous studies that found a phosphorylation-dependent association of Dok1 with the β3 integrin tail (31Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and suggestions that integrin β tail phosphorylation blocks talin binding (38Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar). PTB domains can be divided into three classes according to their structures and ligand binding preferences (29Uhlik M.T. Temple B. Bencharit S. Kimple A.J. Siderovski D.P. Johnson G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Both the Dok1 and the talin PTB domains fit into the IRS-1-like group, which have a basic pleckstrin homology domain core structure, when compared with the Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, which have additional α-helices, one at the N terminus and one inserted between β-strands 1 and 2. PTB domains in general show a preference for either phosphotyrosine or tyrosine in the NPXY binding motif, and domains of the IRS-1-like group tend to prefer phosphorylated ligands. Alignment of the PTB domains of various Dok homologues with other members of the IRS-1-like group (Fig. 4C) reveals several conserved arginine residues. The structural studies here suggest that Arg207 and Arg222 of that human Dok1 PTB (Fig. 4) form a pocket for negatively charged groups. Construction of a model of the interaction of phosphorylated integrin tail with Dok1 predicts that the pTyr747 phosphate group occupies this basic pocket and that the preference for phosphorylated ligands is due to these conserved arginine residues. The talin PTB domain is also structurally categorized as IRS-1-like. However, unlike other IRS-1-like PTB domains, it shows a preference for unphosphorylated ligands. Competition assays using gel filtration (38Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar) and glutathione S-transferase pull-downs (39Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) previously indicated a preference for unphosphorylated β1 integrins. Our quantitative results with β3 integrin confirm this preference. From the alignment in Fig. 4, this preference is likely to be due to the presence of an aspartic acid residue in the tyrosine binding pocket that would electrostatically disfavor phosphate binding. Evidence has recently emerged that the protein mitogen inducible gene-2 (MIG-2), also known as Kindlin-2, promotes integrin activation as well, although to a lesser degree than talin (40Shi X. Ma Y.Q. Tu Y. Chen K. Wu S. Fukuda K. Qin J. Plow E.F. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20455-20466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MIG-2, like talin, has an aspartic acid residue in the tyrosine binding pocket (Fig. 4), suggesting that MIG-2 would also bind preferentially to unphosphorylated integrin tails. This prediction is consistent with the integrin tyrosine phosphorylation switch hypothesis presented here, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation could be a common mechanism for regulating integrin activation states.

ATP hydrolysis by the peripheral V1 domain drives rotation of a rotary complex (the rotor) relative to the stationary part of the enzyme (the stator), leading to proton translocation through the integral V0 domain. One mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo involves reversible dissociation of the V1 and V0 domains. Unlike the corresponding domains in F1F0, the dissociated V1 domain does not hydrolyze ATP, and the free V0 domain does not passively conduct protons. These properties are important to avoid generation of an uncoupled ATPase activity or an unregulated proton conductance upon dissociation of the complex in vivo. Previous results (Parra, K. J., Keenan, K. L., and Kane, P. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 21761–21767) showed that subunit H (part of the stator) inhibits ATP hydrolysis by free V1. To test the hypothesis that subunit H accomplishes this by bridging rotor and stator in free V1, cysteine-mediated cross-linking studies were performed. Unique cysteine residues were introduced over the surface of subunit H from yeast by site-directed mutagenesis and used as the site of attachment of the photo-activated cross-linking reagent maleimido benzophenone. After UV-activated cross-linking, cross-linked products were identified by Western blot using subunit-specific antibodies. The results indicate that the subunit H mutant S381C shows cross-linking between subunit H and subunit F (a rotor subunit) in the free V1 domain but not in the intact V1V0 complex.

The energy from ATP hydrolysis in the hexameric A3B3 head drives rotation of the central stalk and connected ring of proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″). Rotation of the proteolipid ring relative to subunit a of the V0 domain is thought to drive transport of protons across the membrane (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Subunit a is held fixed relative to the hexameric head of V1 by the peripheral stalk, which functions as a stator in preventing unproductive rotation. Although sequence homology exists between the V and F1F0 ATP synthases in both the nucleotide binding and the proteolipid subunits, there is virtually no sequence similarity for the remaining subunits. An important mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo involves dissociation into its component V1 and V0 domains and the subsequent silencing of their respective functions (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In yeast, dissociation occurs rapidly and reversibly in response to glucose withdrawal (18Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism has been shown to regulate V-ATPase activity in cells of higher eukaryotes as well, including mammalian renal and dendritic cells and insect midgut cells (19Sautin Y.Y. Lu M. Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I.

Activation of antigen processing in dendritic cells causes assembly of the V-ATPase (20Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), which enhances proteolytic cleavage of antigen, whereas in renal cells the assembly status of the V-ATPase is also modulated by glucose (19Sautin Y.Y. Lu M. Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). V-ATPase dissociation occurs in goblet cells of the insect midgut during molting as a means to preserve energy stores and is reversed after completion of the molting process (21Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). A general property of this mechanism is that upon dissociation of the two domains, the ATPase activity of the V1 domain and the passive proton conductance of the V0 domain are blocked (22Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is critical as rapid dissipation of intracellular proton gradients would occur if V0 passively conducted protons, and cellular energy stores would be significantly depleted upon the release of an uncoupled ATPase into the cytosol. Subunit H of the V-ATPase in yeast has been shown to play an essential role in silencing ATP hydrolysis by V1. Thus, isolated V1 complexes depleted of subunit H show significant levels of ATPase activity compared with wild-type V1 complexes containing subunit H (22Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The importance of suppressing the activity of the free V1 domain is highlighted by the observation that in mutant yeast strains in which all of the V1 domains are free in the cytosol, the absence of subunit H is lethal (24Keenan Curtis K. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2716-2724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast strains bearing half the normal amount of subunit H show a conditional lethal phenotype and possess free V1 domains displaying elevated Mg-ATPase activity (25Rizzo J.M. Tarsio M. Martinez-Munoz G.A. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8521-8532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and electron microscopy studies performed on the V-ATPase from yeast and clathrin-coated vesicles suggest that subunit H is localized to the peripheral stator near the interface between the V1 and V0 domains (13Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41942-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with this localization of subunit H are co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies demonstrating the interaction between subunit H and other peripheral stator subunits, including subunit E and the N-terminal domain of subunit a (26Landolt-Marticorena C.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15906-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based upon these observations, we hypothesize that subunit H inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the free V1 domain by bridging the peripheral and central stalks, serving as a mechanical brake to prevent ATP-driven rotation. In this study we have employed cysteine-mediated cross-linking using the photo-activated cross-linking reagent maleimido benzophenone (MBP) (11Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to probe the arrangement of subunits relative to subunit H in both free V1 and fully assembled V1V0. Unique cysteine residues were introduced over the surface of subunit H by site-directed mutagenesis using the available high resolution structure of the yeast protein (29Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues were then used as the site of attachment of MBP. The results indicate that subunit H and subunit F (one of the rotor subunits) are proximal in the free V1 domain but not in the intact V1V0, supporting the hypothesis that subunit H inhibits ATP hydrolysis in V1 by bridging the rotor and stator stalks. Materials and Strains–Concanamycin A and 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine were purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. and Invitrogen, respectively. Pre-cast polyacrylamide Ready-Gels, Tween 20, SDS, nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm pore size), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Bio-Rad. Zymolyase 100T was purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. 4-(N-Maleimido)benzophenone (MBP) and most common chemicals were purchased from Sigma. PEG-maleimide (SunBio Co.) was a gift from Dr. Carol Deutsch. The chemiluminescence substrate for horseradish peroxidase was from KPL Laboratories. Kodak BioMax MR film was used for Western blotting. Amicon Ultra concentration tubes (100K) were used for buffer exchange and concentration of the V1 subcomplex. Polyvinylidene difluoride syringe filters (0.45 μm) were purchased from Millipore. The VMA13 gene in yeast encodes the H subunit. A yeast strain lacking subunit H was constructed from YPH500 by replacing the VMA13 gene with the TRP1 gene (vma13Δ:: TRP1). The strain was first selected on plates lacking tryptophan, and the growth phenotype was then assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 and 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. Antibodies–Monoclonal antibodies against subunits a, A, and B were purchased from Molecular Probes. The polyclonal antibody against subunit E (Vma4p) was a gift from Dr. Daniel Klionsky (University of Michigan). The polyclonal antibodies against subunits H, D, and F were a gift from Dr. Tom Stevens (University of Oregon). Cloning of the VMA13 Gene Encoding Subunit H–Genomic DNA was isolated from an adenine-deficient yeast strain of YPH500 and used to amplify the VMA13 gene. The following primers with unique restriction enzymes sites for SacI and KpnI (underlined) were used: forward, 5′-GGCGAGCTCGTCGCCAGGGAAGGTTACGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCGGTACCGCGCCCATTAATACCCGACT-3′. The resulting PCR product was then digested with SacI and KpnI and ligated into pRS316. Construction of Mutants–Mutations of Vma13p were performed using Promega Altered Sites II in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system. The VMA13 gene was cloned into the pALTER-1 vector using the SacI and KpnI restriction sites. To construct a cysteine-less (Cys-less) mutant of VMA13, the seven endogenous cysteine residues at positions 92, 183, 186, 290, 297, 298, and 369 were replaced with serine residues using the oligonucleotides listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotides used to generate VMA13 mutantsMutantOligonucleotide (5′→3′)C92SCAACGAAGACAGCAAAAAATCC183S and C186SGAGCAGATGGACACTAGTTACGTGAGCATCAGACTATTGC290S, C297S, and C298SAAAGTGTCCAGATTGAGCATATCCATCATCCTGCAAAGTAGCTCCACGCGCGTCAC369SCAAGTTGCTGAGCTGGTCTCCS24CTCCGTTCGAGGTGCGTGGCATGGGACS42CATTGATGCGTGTACTGCAAAA178CATTGGCAAGACGTTGTGCCCATTAATTCACTTAP121CTTCCAAGAAGACGCCAAGCAATTGGAM180CCAAAACATTGAGCAGTGCGACACTAGTTACGTGL189CTACGTGAGCATCAGATGCTTGCAAGAACTGGCCP197CGAACTGGCCGTGATATGCGAGTATCGTGACGTGQ265CGCAAACGAGCTAGTCTGCAAATACTTGAGTGATT300CCTGCAAAGTAGCTCCTGCCGCGTCAAGCAGCACS331CAGAAAGTATTGCGACGAAGAAT354CTACCAAGAATTGGCCTCCTTCGATGAS369CCAAGTTGCTGTGCTGGTCTCCS381CGGTTTCTGGTGCGATAACATTD390CGAGTTCAAGAAGGCCAACTACAAGATE400CTTTAGACAATTGATCTGCCTCTTGCAAGCAAAGG409CGGTCCGTAACTGCGACGTCAAS457CTGCTGAACCATTGCGATTCTAGGGTG Open table in a new tab Single cysteine residues were introduced into the Cys-less form of Vma13p also using Altered Sites II. The oligonucleotides for the single cysteine mutants constructed are listed in Table 1. After mutagenesis, each plasmid was digested with SacI and KpnI, and the resulting fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pRS316. The final sequence of all mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transformation and Selection–YPH500 yeast cells lacking functional endogenous Vma13p (vma13Δ::TRP1) were transformed by electroporation. The transformants were selected on uracil-minus plates, and the growth phenotypes were evaluated on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose plates buffered with KH2PO4 and 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. Preparation of the V1 Subcomplex–125 ml of yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C to an absorbance (600 nm) of ∼1.7 in selective medium and washed twice with water. After resuspension in 5 ml of alkaline buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm DTT, pH 9.4), cells were incubated with gentle agitation at 30 °C for 20 min. Cells were pelleted again, washed with YEPD medium (0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5), and resuspended with 2.5 ml of YEPD medium and 166 μg of zymolyase. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 30°C with gentle agitation. The resulting spheroplasts were washed with ice-cold 1.2 m sorbitol, resuspended in 2 ml of osmotic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and incubated on ice for 45 min. After incubation the spheroplasts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to pellet all membranes, and the supernatant was collected and forced through a Millex-HV polyvinylidene difluoride 0.45 μm syringe filter. Isolation of Vacuolar Membrane Vesicles–Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described in our previous study (14Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.7 in selective medium, pelleted, washed twice with water, and re-suspended in 50 ml of alkaline buffer (described above). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min with gentle agitation, cells were pelleted again, washed once in 25 ml of YEPD medium, and resuspended in the same YEPD medium including 2 mg of zymolyase 100T. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 30°C with gentle agitation. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuolar membranes were isolated by centrifugation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients (12 and 8%) and diluted in transport buffer (15 mm MES-Tris, 4.8% glycerol, pH 7). Photochemical Cross-linking of the Intact V1Vo ATPase or V1 Subcomplex with MBP–MBP-mediated cross-linking was performed on both the yeast cytosolic fraction, which contain the dissociated V1 subcomplex, and the vacuolar membranes, which contain the intact V1V0 complex. MBP dissolved in dimethylformamide was added to the purified vacuolar membranes or the V1 subcomplex-containing fraction suspended in 100 μl to a final concentration of 1 mm followed by incubation in the dark for 30 min at 23 °C. Unreacted MBP was quenched by the addition of 10 mm DTT. The vacuolar membranes were pelleted and washed twice with PBS-EDTA with protease inhibitors resuspended in 100 μl of PBS-EDTA. The V1-containing fractions were washed twice with PBS-EDTA using a 100K Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter and spun to a final volume of 100 μl of PBS-EDTA. Samples were then irradiated with a long wavelength (366 nm) ultraviolet lamp (Mineralight® model UVGL-25) at 4 °C for 5 min. Analysis of Cross-linked Products–After cross-linking with MBP, vacuolar membranes were solubilized with 2% polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether, and the intact V1V0 complexes were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against subunit A. The immunoprecipitated intact complexes or the cytosolic fraction containing the V1 complex were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting using antibodies specific for subunit H or other V-ATPase subunits was used to detect MBP-dependent cross-linked products as previously described (11Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl Modification with PEG-maleimide–To determine the accessibility of the sulfhydryl groups of various mutants, both isolated vacuoles and crude V1 preparations were incubated with 1 mm polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEG-Mal, 5 kDa) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and quenched with 10 mm DTT. After quenching, the samples were mixed with sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with antibodies against subunit H. Although the PEG-maleimide has a molecular mass of 5 kDa, it causes a shift in apparent mobility of 10–15 kDa, depending upon the exact site of modification. Other Procedures–Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford and Lowry methods. ATPase activity was measure using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A as described previously (30Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured using the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A as described previously (30Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Construction of Single Cysteine-containing Mutants of Vma13p and the Effect of Mutations on Growth Phenotype, ATPase Activity, and Proton Transport Activity–To determine the proximity of other V-ATPase subunits to specific sites within subunit H in both the V1 domain and the assembled V1V0 complex, we employed a cysteine mediated cross-linking strategy using the photoactivable cross-linker, MBP (11Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies allowed us to test the hypothesis that subunit H is able to interact with subunits of the central rotary stalk in V1 but not V1V0. The available crystal structure of subunit H (29Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) facilitated the introduction of single cysteine residues into structurally defined sites on the surface of subunit H. Before the construction of single cysteine-bearing mutants of subunit H, it was first necessary to prepare a construct of Vma13p (yeast subunit H) in which the endogenous cysteines were removed and replaced with serine residues. Serine residues were chosen as a substitute for cysteine because they most closely resemble cysteine in charge and size. The Cys-less mutant of subunit H was constructed by replacing each of the seven endogenous cysteine residues (which occur at positions 92, 183, 186, 290, 297, 298, and 369) with serine residues using site-directed mutagenesis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the available high-resolution crystal structure of subunit H as a guide (29Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7134-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), single cysteine residues were then introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into 17 sites over the surface of the Cys-less form of Vma13p (Fig. 1). All constructs were cloned into the pRS316 expression vector, which contains the URA3 selectable marker. Additionally, the wild-type VMA13 gene was cloned from YPH500 genomic DNA and inserted into pRS316 as well. All subsequent references to wild-type VMA13 refer to this construct in the vma13Δ yeast strain. All constructs were then transformed by electroporation into a vma13Δ strain of YPH500 yeast bearing the TRP1 marker (vma13Δ::TRP1) that had been prepared by homologous recombination. Wild-type VMA13 was included as a positive control for growth phenotype and activity assays (as described below), whereas the vma13Δ strain transformed with the pRS316 plasmid alone was used as a negative control. All mutants were selected from uracil-minus plates, and the growth phenotypes were assessed on YEPD plates buffered to either pH 7.5 or 5.5. The wild-type, Cys-less, and single cysteine mutants of Vma13p were all able to grow at both acid and neutral pH, indicating that each mutant can complement the vma–phenotype of the vma13Δ strain. Previous studies have shown that V-ATPase mutants that can grow at pH 7.5 have at least 20% of wild-type levels of V-ATPase activity (31Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Concanamycin-sensitive proton transport and ATPase activity were then determined for vacuolar membranes isolated from each yeast strain (Fig. 2). Vacuolar membranes from all mutants that gave identifiable cross-linked products (see below) possessed concanamycin-sensitive ATPase and proton pumping activities that were between 40 and 100% that of wild-type activity, suggesting that all of these single cysteine mutants of subunit H are able to assemble into a V-ATPase complex possessing significant function. Interestingly, the T354C mutant had higher than wild-type levels of ATPase activity but was not further pursued, as no cross-linked products were observed for this mutant.

The deduced amino acid sequence of Pv5–6 showed high homology with an Arabidopsis chloroplastic Grx and contained two CXXS putative catalytic motifs. Purified recombinant Pv5–6 exhibited glutaredoxin activity that was increased 1.6-fold by 10 mm arsenate. Site-specific mutation of Cys67 to Ala67 resulted in the loss of both GRX activity and arsenic resistance. PvGrx5 was expressed in E. coli mutants in which the arsenic resistance genes of the ars operon were deleted (strain AW3110), a deletion of the gene for the ArsC arsenate reductase (strain WC3110), and a strain in which the ars operon was deleted and the gene for the GlpF aquaglyceroporin was disrupted (strain OSBR1). Expression of PvGrx5 increased arsenic tolerance in strains AW3110 and WC3110, but not in OSBR1, suggesting that PvGrx5 had a role in cellular arsenic resistance independent of the ars operon genes but dependent on GlpF. AW3110 cells expressing PvGrx5 had significantly lower levels of arsenite when compared with vector controls when cultured in medium containing 2.5 mm arsenate. Our results are consistent with PvGrx5 having a role in regulating intracellular arsenite levels, by either directly or indirectly modulating the aquaglyceroporin.

Inorganic arsenic, including the oxidized form arsenate (As(V)) and the reduced form arsenite (As(III)), are the most prevalent in the environment (1Oremland R.S. Stolz J.F. Trends Microbio. 2005; 13: 45-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its ubiquity, arsenic ranks first on the Environmental Protection Agency Superfund List (U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Priority List of Hazardous Substances. It is a carcinogen that has been linked to cancers of bladder, liver, kidney, and lungs (2Shi H. Shi X. Liu K.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 255: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Millions of people in many parts of the world are affected by arsenic contamination in drinking water (2Shi H. Shi X. Liu K.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 255: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Ma et al. (3Ma L.Q. Komar K.M. Tu C. Zhang W. Cai Y. Kennelley E.D. Nature. 2001; 409: 579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) reported that Chinese brake fern Pteris vittata was resistant to arsenic and was capable of hyperaccumulating a large amount of arsenic in its fronds (3Ma L.Q. Komar K.M. Tu C. Zhang W. Cai Y. Kennelley E.D. Nature. 2001; 409: 579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Although most plant species are severely affected by exposure to as low as 10 mg·liter–1 arsenic in the medium, P. vittata and related ferns tolerate up to 1000 mg·liter–1 arsenic in the medium, with fronds accumulating the metalloid up to 2.3% of their dry weight (3Ma L.Q.

Hence, the potential of using P. vittata to phytoremediate arsenic-contaminated soil and water has been evaluated (7Tu C. Ma L.Q. Bondada B. J. Environ.

Despite the extraordinary ability of P. vittata in arsenic accumulation, the mechanisms underlying arsenic resistance and hyperaccumulation in this fern are not clear. Understanding arsenic metabolism in this fern is essential for fully harnessing its phytoremediation capacity. Its genes are potentially valuable for building transgenic plants and microorganisms for arsenic remediation. Novel enzymatic transformations of arsenic may also be of interest for improving arsenic cancer therapy because arsenic trioxide has been used to treat certain leukemias (9Soignet S.L. Maslak P.

When compared with an arsenic-sensitive fern Pteris ensiformis, P. vittata had significantly greater tolerance to oxidative stress, greater levels of reduced GSH, and antioxidant enzymes (15Singh N.

Using a functional cloning method, we identified P. vittata frond cDNAs involved in arsenic tolerance (13Rathinasabapathi B. Wu S. Sundaram S. Rivoal J. Srivastava M. Ma L.Q. Plant Mol.

Grxs are ubiquitous oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin family, which catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions or reduce protein-mixed glutathione disulfides. They use the reducing power of GSH to catalyze disulfide reactions in the presence of NADPH-dependent GSH reductase (17Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lönn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem.

In Escherichia coli, three bicysteinic Grxs, and in yeast, two bicysteinic and three mono cysteinic Grxs have been characterized, respectively (19Fernandes A.P. Holmgern A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), but plant genomes contain many Grxs. In Arabidopsis, there are at least 31 isoforms (20Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the functional roles for the multitude of Grxs in plants are enigmatic (20Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). So far, only a few plant Grxs have been characterized based on the localization, expression, or structural similarities (20Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. CMLS Cell. Mol.

Wu S. Sundaram S. Rivoal J. Srivastava M. Ma L.Q. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 62: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Clone Pv5–6, sequenced in both strands (Gen-Bank™ accession number EF052272), was identified based on its distinguishable arsenate tolerance on LB agar with 5 mm sodium arsenate, when compared with XL-1 Blue and vector control (pTriplEx2 without insert). The open reading frame of E. coli Grx3 was amplified using primers 5′-ATGGCCAATGTTGAAATCTATACCAAAGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTATTTCAGCAGGGGATCCAGTCCAC-3′ and E. coli XL-1 Blue genomic DNA as a template. The resulting product was verified by sequencing and cloned into pTriplEx2 between EcoRI and NotI restriction sites to obtain pTriplEx-EcGrx3. In Vitro Mutagenesis—In vitro mutagenesis of the Pv5–6 plasmid was carried out using the Gene Tailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Presumptive Grx active sites were mutated by converting the Cys67 to Ala67 or Cys108 to Ala108. The forward and reverse primers used were 5′-GGTACCAAGTTGTTTCCTCAGGCCGGATTTTCAAATACTG-3′ and 5′-CACGAGTCTGTTGGGCGGCTGCGCAGTTGTCC-3′ for the Cys67 to Ala67 mutation and 5′-GGTACCAAGTTGTTTCCTCAGGCCGGATTTTCAA-3′ and 5′-CTGAGGAAACAACTTGGTACCCTTCATGAAC-3′ for the Cys108 to Ala108 mutation. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Evaluation of Arsenic Resistance and Response to Oxyradical-generating Chemicals—E. coli strains with the vector pTriplEx2 or the recombinant pTriplEx-Pv5–6 or their mutated versions or pTriplEx-EcGrx3 were cultured in half-strength LB medium with 20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, and 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), containing different levels of sodium arsenate or sodium arsenite and 50 mg–1 carbenicillin. The cultures, inoculated with late log phase cells, were incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm, and culture turbidity was measured after 18 h. Similar assays and conditions were used when E. coli were tested for tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, methyl viologen, and cadmium chloride. Sequence Analyses—BLAST analysis (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) was used to identify sequences homologous to Pv5–6 deduced amino acid sequence. Multiple sequence comparisons were done using Clustal X (30Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) and HHpred (31Soding J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein—Pv5–6 cDNA (647 bp, including 552 bp of protein coding region and a stop codon, followed by 92 bp of 3′-untranslated region) was amplified using forward and reverse primers 5′-CCAAGCCATGGCGTCCAGGGC and 5′-GAGCTCACTGGAAATTGCAGCTACC, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into NcoI and SstI restriction sites of pET30a expression vector to obtain pET30a-Pv5–6, verified by sequencing and transformed into BL21 (DE3). This construct expressed a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Recombinants were grown at 37 °C to 0.8 A600, and expression was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 4 h. The cells from 500 ml were suspended in bug buster digestion medium (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and incubated for 2 h on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was loaded on pre-equilibrated Sephadex-G50 column (150 × 1 cm). The column was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The fractions (5 ml each) were collected with the flow rate of 30 ml h–1. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated using Centricon column-20 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and loaded onto 10 ml of ProBond resin (Invitrogen) nickel affinity column and step-eluted with 100, 150, and 250 mm imidazole. Total protein was estimated using the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Thiol Determination and N Terminus Sequencing—The content of Cys-residues was determined in purified recombinant protein, using Ellman's reagent following a spectrophotometric method (33Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). Enterokinase-digested purified protein was separated using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The N terminus was sequenced by Edman degradation using a Procise protein sequencer 494-HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Glutaredoxin and Arsenate Reductase Assays—Grx activity was determined with a coupled enzymatic reaction as described previously (34Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) by measuring the reduction of 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) in the presence of NADPH and glutathione reductase. The decrease in NADPH was monitored at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m–1 cm–1. The assay mixture contained 100 μg·ml–1 bovine serum albumin, 1 mm GSH, 6μg·ml–1 yeast glutathione reductase, 0.4 mm NADPH, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.7 mm HED in a total volume of 800 μl. Non-enzymatic NADPH-dependent reduction of HED was measured for the background. In experiments evaluating arsenate induction in vitro, non-enzymatic generation of GSSG by arsenate was subtracted as a background. This background rate was less than 2% of the Grx activity. Arsenate reductase activity was assayed using a spectrophotometric method described previously (27Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The enzyme activities were expressed as μmol mg–1 of protein min–1. Immunoblot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies were generated, using a commercial antibody production service (Gen-Script, Piscataway, NJ) in rabbit against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (named PvGrx5–50p) with the following sequence: TQHRPSWTTAQPPN. Immunoblots were done as described previously (35Fouad W.M. Rathinasabapathi B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), using 1:10,000 dilution of the primary antibody. Arsenate Metabolism—E. coli cultures were grown in half-strength LB medium with 20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, and 0.1 mm IPTG, containing 2.5 mm sodium arsenate and with appropriate antibiotic for 18 h in a shaker incubator set at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Growth was monitored by measuring turbidity at 600 nm, and the cells were centrifuged. Total arsenic and arsenite were measured in the cell pellets following their extraction in 50% (v/v) methanol in water (13Rathinasabapathi B. Wu S. Sundaram S. Rivoal J. Srivastava M. Ma L.Q. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 62: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Arsenic Speciation—Arsenate and arsenite were separated using an arsenic speciation cartridge (Metal Soft Center, Highland Park, NJ), which retains arsenate. Total arsenic and arsenite were determined by GFAAS (Varian 240Z, Zeeman Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) as described (36Chen M. Ma L.Q. J Environ. Qual. 1998; 27: 1294-1300Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Phagemids excised from a P. vittata frond cDNA library (13Rathinasabapathi B. Wu S. Sundaram S. Rivoal J. Srivastava M. Ma L.Q. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 62: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were introduced into E. coli XL-1 blue, and colonies were selected on LB agar containing 5 mm arsenate supplemented with carbenicillin 50 mg·liter–1. Clone Pv5–6 was identified based on its arsenate tolerance on the agar selection plate. pTriplEx2 vector of this construct allowed IPTG-inducible expression of the cDNA insert in all three reading frames (13Rathinasabapathi B. Wu S. Sundaram S. Rivoal J. Srivastava M. Ma L.Q. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 62: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pv5–6 Expression Confers Resistance to Arsenic in XL-1 Blue—The ability of cells of E. coli strain XL-1 Blue expressing Pv5–6 to confer resistance to arsenate and arsenite was examined. Cells expressing Pv5–6 under control of the lac promoter showed significantly greater tolerance to both arsenate and arsenite when compared with cells with vector alone (Fig. 1). Resistance to arsenite was comparatively less than to arsenate (Fig. 1). In contrast, expression of Pv5–6 did not increase tolerance to hydrogen peroxide, methyl viologen, or cadmium chloride, indicating specificity for inorganic arsenic (Fig. 2). Because Pv5–6 was identified to be a glutaredoxin (see below) and it showed high overall homology only with EcGrx3 of the E. coli proteome, it was tested whether E. coli Grx3 expressed in pTriplEx2 vector will alter arsenic tolerance. E. coli Grx3 expression did not increase arsenic tolerance (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Expression of Pv5–6 in E. coli XL1-BL increased resistance to arsenite (0.5 mm) and not to hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mm), methyl viologen (0.5 mm), cadmium chloride (0.5 mm) (closed bars) when compared with E. coli XL1-BL with an empty vector (open bars). The arsenic resistance assays and resistance to oxyradical generating agents were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” VC:XL1-BL refers to E. coli XL1-Blue transformed with pTriplEx2 vector, and Pv5–6:XL-BL refers to E. coli XL1-Blue transformed with pTriplEx-Pv5–6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pv5–6 Is a Glutaredoxin Homologue—The Pv5–6 cDNA (785 bp) encodes a 184-residue polypeptide whose sequence showed 66% identity and 78% homology with AtGRXcp, earlier reported as cation exchanger (CAX)-interacting protein (CXIP) of Arabidopsis (22Cheng N.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6503-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a member of the protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin homology domain (PICOT-HD) proteins. Fig. 3 shows a sequence alignment of Pv5–6 with AtGRXcp, E. coli Grx, and yeast GLRX5 proteins. The deduced amino acid sequence of Pv5–6 contained four cysteine residues, Cys67, Cys108, Cys162, and Cys183, and both the 67CXXS70 and the 108CGFS111 motifs recognized as probable active sites of Grxs in other organisms (20Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). ChloroP analysis (38Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 954-971Crossref Scopus (2580) Google Scholar) suggested that PvGRX5 preprotein may be cleaved between Arg68 and Ser69 (cleavage site score 7.33). Because this is part of the active site (see below), the probable cleavage site could be Arg43 and Ala44 (cleavage site score 3.92). Given the uncertainities in predicting cleavage sites for plastid-targeting peptides (38Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 954-971Crossref Scopus (2580) Google Scholar), this point needs be tested in future research. The 5′-untranslated region of Pv5–6 had a GAGA repeat motif. Recombinant Pv5–6 Has Grx Activity and Is Activated by Arsenate—The ability of recombinant affinity-purified Pv5–6 protein to catalyze Grx activity was tested. The purified protein of ∼20 kDa appeared to be homogenous by SDS-PAGE silver staining (Fig. 4, panel I), stained positively with the anti-His antibodies in immunoblots, and had four free Cys residues per subunit by chemical analysis (40.9 + 0.5 nmol per 10.3 nmol of purified recombinant protein, n = 3, mean ± S.E.). Sequence of the enterokinase-digested recombinant protein obtained AMAXXXXQTXVGLLGGXD confirmed the expected N terminus sequence AMASRAVQTSVGLLGGSD. To study the nature of the recombinant protein, polyclonal antibodies were raised against a 14-residue synthetic peptide representing Thr50 to Asn63 of the Pv5–6 deduced amino acid sequence. Protein from Pv5–6-expressing recombinant bacteria and the purified 20-kDa protein were recognized by the antibodies with no cross reaction with other bacterial proteins as shown in the vector control (Fig. 4, panel II, lane V versus lanes R and P). The recombinant Pv5–6 protein (rPv5–6) catalyzed thioldisulfide oxidoreduction as assayed by reduction of HED by GSH (Fig. 5A). The pH optimum was 8, and the Km (mm) and Vmax (μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein) values were 1.06 ± 0.6 and 54 ± 8 for HED, and 2.2 ± 0.4 and 68 ± 6 for GSH, respectively. Based on this Grx activity, the protein encoded by Pv5–6 cDNA was named PvGRX5. To examine the effect of arsenic on rPvGRX5 activity, 10 mm sodium arsenate or sodium arsenite was added before HED. A 1.6-fold increase in Grx activity was observed with the addition of arsenate (Fig. 5B) but not by arsenite (not shown). Induction by arsenate was not observed in assays where purified E. coli Grx2 was used (Fig. 5B). rPvGRX5 did not exhibit arsenate reductase activity in vitro as measured using a spectrophotometric method (data not shown). In an arsenate reductase assay of E. coli arsenate reductase, rPvGRX5 replaced E. coli Grx, but about 10-fold less effectively than E. coli Grx2 (data not shown). Grx Activity of PvGRX5 Was Linked to Cellular Arsenic Resistance—PvGrx5 had two potential motifs that may be important for Grx activity and arsenic tolerance: 67CXXS70 and 108CGFS111. In E. coli, only the first cysteine of the CXXC motif is required for arsenate resistance, and the second cysteine can be changed to serine without effect on arsenate resistance (24Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When Cys67 of PvGRX5 was mutated to an alanine residue, cellular arsenate resistance was lost (Fig. 6). Specific activities of Grx in Pv5–6A67:XL1-BL was comparable with vector control and was only 20% of Grx activity found in PvGrx5–6:XL1-BL (Fig. 6, inset), suggesting loss of Grx activity due to the mutation. When Cys108 was mutated to an alanine residue, there was partial loss of Grx activity and arsenic tolerance (data not shown). The Role of PvGrx5 in Arsenic Resistance Is Independent of ars Operon Genes—To examine whether PvGRX5 depended on the expression of the ars operon genes of E. coli to increase cellular arsenic resistance, Pv5–6 was introduced into AW3110 (Δars) (26Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and WC3110 (ΔarsC) (27Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to evaluate their arsenic tolerances. Expression of the PvGRX5 significantly increased the resistance of AW3110 and WC3110 to arsenate and arsenite when compared with vector-alone controls in these strains (Fig. 7, A and B). These increases in resistance were not greater than that found in the wild-type strain W3110 (Fig. 7, A and B). The Expression of PvGRX5 in an Aquaglyceroporin Deletion Mutant Does Not Alter Its Arsenic Tolerance—To examine whether PvGRX5 required the aquaglyceroporin for its role in arsenic tolerance, Pv5–6 was introduced into strain OSBR1, in which the glpF gene for the aquaglyceroporin responsible for arsenite uptake was disrupted in addition to deletion of the ars operon (28Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 365-3367Crossref Google Scholar). OSBR1 with and without Pv"
https://openalex.org/W2086908525,"ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) and ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2) are multidomain metalloproteinases belonging to the ADAMTS family. We have previously reported that human ADAMTS-5 has much higher aggrecanolytic activity than human ADAMTS-4. To investigate the different proteolytic activity of the two enzymes, we generated a series of chimeras by exchanging various non-catalytic domains of the two proteinases. We found that the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-5 has higher intrinsic catalytic ability than that of ADAMTS-4. The studies also demonstrated that the non-catalytic domains of ADAMTS-5 are more effective modifiers than those of ADAMTS-4, making both catalytic domains more active against aggrecan, an Escherichia coli-expressed interglobular domain of aggrecan and fibromodulin. Addition of the C-terminal thrombospondin type I motif of ADAMTS-5 to the C terminus of ADAMTS-4 increased the activity of ADAMTS-4 against aggrecan and fibromodulin severalfold. In contrast to previous reports (Kashiwagi, M., Enghild, J. J., Gendron, C., Hughes, C., Caterson, B., Itoh, Y., and Nagase, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10109–10119 and Gao, G., Plaas, A., Thompson, V. P., Jin, S., Zuo, F., and Sandy, J. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10042–10051), our detailed investigation of the role of the C-terminal spacer domain of ADAMTS-4 indicated that full-length ADAMTS-4 is ∼20-times more active against aggrecan than its spacer domain deletion mutant, even at the Glu373-Ala374 site of the interglobular domain. This discrepancy is most likely due to selective inhibition of full-length ADAMTS-4 by heparin, particularly for cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond. However, removal of the spacer domain from ADAMTS-4 greatly enhanced more general proteolytic activity against non-aggrecan substrates, e.g. E. coli-expressed interglobular domain, fibromodulin, and carboxymethylated transferrin. ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) and ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2) are multidomain metalloproteinases belonging to the ADAMTS family. We have previously reported that human ADAMTS-5 has much higher aggrecanolytic activity than human ADAMTS-4. To investigate the different proteolytic activity of the two enzymes, we generated a series of chimeras by exchanging various non-catalytic domains of the two proteinases. We found that the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-5 has higher intrinsic catalytic ability than that of ADAMTS-4. The studies also demonstrated that the non-catalytic domains of ADAMTS-5 are more effective modifiers than those of ADAMTS-4, making both catalytic domains more active against aggrecan, an Escherichia coli-expressed interglobular domain of aggrecan and fibromodulin. Addition of the C-terminal thrombospondin type I motif of ADAMTS-5 to the C terminus of ADAMTS-4 increased the activity of ADAMTS-4 against aggrecan and fibromodulin severalfold. In contrast to previous reports (Kashiwagi, M., Enghild, J. J., Gendron, C., Hughes, C., Caterson, B., Itoh, Y., and Nagase, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10109–10119 and Gao, G., Plaas, A., Thompson, V. P., Jin, S., Zuo, F., and Sandy, J. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10042–10051), our detailed investigation of the role of the C-terminal spacer domain of ADAMTS-4 indicated that full-length ADAMTS-4 is ∼20-times more active against aggrecan than its spacer domain deletion mutant, even at the Glu373-Ala374 site of the interglobular domain. This discrepancy is most likely due to selective inhibition of full-length ADAMTS-4 by heparin, particularly for cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond. However, removal of the spacer domain from ADAMTS-4 greatly enhanced more general proteolytic activity against non-aggrecan substrates, e.g. E. coli-expressed interglobular domain, fibromodulin, and carboxymethylated transferrin.

The destructive process is believed to be due to elevated activities of proteolytic enzymes that degrade macromolecules of the cartilage ECM such as aggrecan and type II collagen fibrils. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan in articular cartilage, and it forms large aggregates by interacting with hyaluronan and link protein. Aggrecan monomers consist of a core protein with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS) polysaccharide chains. The core protein consists of several segments, including an N-terminal globular domain (G1), an interglobular domain (IGD), a second globular domain (G2), a long glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment region, including KS-rich and CS-rich (CS-1 and CS-2) regions, and a C-terminal globular domain (G3) (1Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggrecans are highly hydrated because of their long negatively charged polysaccharide chains. Thus, within the collagen framework, they enable the cartilage to resist mechanical compression as a load-bearing surface. Aggrecan loss is therefore considered to be a crucial initial event in the development of arthritis, which is followed by essentially irreversible collagen degradation (2Hollander A.P. Pidoux I.

This pathological aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage is driven mainly by proteolytic enzymes termed aggrecanases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (4Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J.

Finding aggrecan fragments cleaved at the Glu373-Ala374 bond in synovial fluids and cartilage from patients with OA and rheumatoid arthritis suggested that aggrecanases play an important role in cartilage destruction (9Sandy J.D.

They are also the primary enzymes that cleave aggrecan in response to inflammatory cytokines in articular cartilage explant systems (11Sandy J.D. Neame P.J. Boynton R.E. Flannery C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8683-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gendron et al. (12Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have shown that cleavage of the Glu373-Ala374 bond in interleukin-1-stimulated cartilage explants is blocked by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), but not by other TIMPs, indicating that ADAMTSs play the major role in aggrecan degradation in this model of cartilage degradation. Among the ADAMTS enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and -5 have received most attention in the pathology of arthritic joint diseases, because they are the most efficient aggrecanases in vitro (13Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H. Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. J. Biol.

Other ADAMTSs, such as ADAMTS-1, -8, -9, -15, -16, and -18 have been shown to cleave aggrecan, but they have very weak activity (6Porter S. Clark I.M. Kevorkian L. Edwards D.R. Biochem.

This suggests that ADAMTS-5 plays a key role in aggrecan degradation, at least in these mouse models of arthritis. On the other hand, Song et al. (20Song R.H. Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Alston J.T. Yang Z. Arner E.C. Griggs D.W. Arthritis. Rheum. 2007; 56: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) recently reported that a reduction in both ADAMTS-4 and -5 expression was required to inhibit aggrecan degradation in human OA cartilage, suggesting that both ADAMTSs may play a role in human OA. Therefore, it is still not clear which aggrecanase plays the main role in pathological cartilage degradation in humans. ADAMTS-4 and -5 are multidomain metalloproteinases belonging to the adamalysin subfamily of the metallopeptidase M12 family (21Rawlings N. Morton F. Barrett A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D270-D272Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have a similar domain arrangement, consisting of a pro-domain, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like (Dis) domain, a thrombospondin type I (TS) domain, a cysteine-rich (CysR) domain and a spacer (Sp) domain. In addition, ADAMTS-5 contains an additional TS domain after the Sp domain (22Nagase H. Kashiwagi M. Arthritis. Res. Ther. 2003; 5: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the non-catalytic ancillary domains of ADAMTS-4 and -5 play a major role in regulating aggrecanase activity and substrate specificity (13Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H.

(23Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) showed that the CysR and Sp domains of ADAMTS-4 are necessary for the enzyme's interaction with the GAG chains of aggrecan, and Tortorella et al. (24Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 273: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (174) Google Scholar) reported that the TS domain of ADAMTS-4 is critical for aggrecan recognition and cleavage. However, the roles of the non-catalytic domains of ADAMTS-4 and -5 are not completely understood at present. Our recent studies showed that the aggrecanolytic activity of ADAMTS-5 was much greater than ADAMTS-4 in both the IGD and the CS-2 regions (13Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H. Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18294-18306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This provided biochemical evidence supporting the view that ADAMTS-5 is the major aggrecanase in cartilage catabolism and pathology. The study also revealed that the roles of the non-catalytic ancillary domains of the two enzymes in aggrecan digestion are significantly different. In the case of ADAMTS-4, it was shown that full-length enzyme (70 kDa) was the most effective aggrecanase, but it exhibited little activity against the Glu373-Ala374 bond (14Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J.

When the Sp domain was removed by MT4-MMP (MMP-17) or mutagenesis, the resulting 53-kDa form of ADAMTS-4 exhibited effective hydrolysis of aggrecan at the IGD site (14Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J.

Zuo F. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10042-10051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The 53-kDa form also showed new proteolytic activities against carboxymethylated transferrin (Cm-Tf), fibromodulin, and decorin (14Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Sp domain regulates certain proteolytic activities of ADAMTS-4. In contrast, the Sp domain of ADAMTS-5 does not exhibit any such regulatory activities. Further removal of CysR domain from ADAMTS-4 has a relatively minor influence on aggrecanolytic activity, but the removal of both CysR and Sp domains from ADAMTS-5 greatly reduces its aggrecanolytic activity. When the TS and Dis domains were further removed from both aggrecanases, the catalytic metalloproteinase domains alone were not active. Nonetheless, the structural basis for ADAMTS-5 being a much more efficient aggrecanase than ADAMTS-4 has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the functional difference in the catalytic and C-terminal domains of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 and to understand the reason(s) behind their extremely different proteolytic activities. For this purpose, we designed chimeras in which various domains were exchanged between ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 and measured their enzymatic activities against native bovine aggrecan, an Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant protein substrate containing the IGD of aggrecan, and fibromodulin. We also re-assessed the proteolytic activities of full-length ADAMTS-4 and C-terminal spacer domain-truncated ADAMTS-4.

To obtain recombinant protein, culture media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, penicillin, and streptomycin. Very little ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and chimeras were detected in the medium, because they bound to the cell layer. Heparin (100 μg/ml) was thus added during the culture to release recombinant ADAMTSs into the medium (13Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H. Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. J.

All chimeras bound to the Macro-Prep 25 S resin under these conditions. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3, and recombinant protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3. Finally, the buffer was exchanged for aggrecanase reaction buffer using a PD-10 desalting column. For purification of KF1, a Macro-Prep 25 S resin was also used to remove the FLAG peptide and contaminants. After application onto a Macro-Prep 25 S resin, the column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 3 m urea, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3. Finally, the buffer was exchanged for aggrecanase reaction buffer using a PD-10 desalting column. The purity of recombinant ADAMTSs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis using anti-ADAMTS-4 catalytic domain, anti-ADAMTS-5 catalytic domain, or anti-M2-FLAG antibodies. The concentrations of active recombinant ADAMTSs were determined by titration with known concentrations of N-TIMP-3. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out under reducing conditions (30Wyckoff M. Rodbard D. Chrambach A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 459-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and proteins were stained by silver (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar). For Western blotting analyses, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies recognizing FLAG M2 (1:2000 dilution), ADAMTS-4 catalytic domain (1:1000 dilution), ADAMTS-5 catalytic domain (1:1000 dilution), BC-3 neoepitope (1:200 dilution), or GELE1480 neoepitope (1:2000 dilution). The blot was then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and the protein bands were visualized using Western Blue stabilized substrate. Aggrecanase Assays—To quantify the aggrecan-degrading activity of the various ADAMTS forms, bovine aggrecan (750 nm) was incubated with ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, or chimera in aggrecanase reaction buffer at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with 50 mm EDTA, and the digestion products were deglycosylated overnight at 37 °C with chondroitinase ABC (0.01 unit/10 μg of aggrecan) and keratanase (0.01 unit/10 μg of aggrecan) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm sodium acetate and 50 mm EDTA. The aggrecan core protein was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone, and incubated at –20 °C for 1 h. The pellet was dried and dissolved in reducing SDS sample buffer. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE before Western blot analysis with the BC-3 or anti-GELE antibody as primary antibodies. For comparative studies, all polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were processed simultaneously and Western analyses were carried out under identical conditions. Aggrecan samples digested by ADAMTS-4 were used as a standard, and always applied on the same gel or blot as the other ADAMTS forms. Gels and blots were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS-710 scanning densito"
https://openalex.org/W1994761247,"Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels drives the production of the pro-inflammatory molecule leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from mast cells through a pathway involving Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2, phospholipase A2, and 5-lipoxygenase. Here we examine whether local Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane stimulates this signaling pathway. Manipulating the amplitude and spatial extent of Ca2+ entry by altering chemical and electrical gradients for Ca2+ influx or changing the Ca2+ buffering of the cytoplasm all impacted on protein kinase C and ERK activation, generation of arachidonic acid and LTC4 secretion, with little change in the bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise. Similar bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations were achieved when CRAC channels were activated in 0.25 mm external Ca2+ versus 2 mm Ca2+ and 100 nm La3+, an inhibitor of CRAC channels. However, despite similar bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+, protein kinase C activation and LTC4 secretion were larger in 2 mm Ca2+ and La3+ than in 0.25 mm Ca2+, consistent with the central involvement of a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ rise. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk coupled CRAC channel opening to protein kinase C and ERK activation. Recombinant TRPC3 channels also activated protein kinase C, suggesting that subplasmalemmal Ca2+ rather than a microdomain exclusive to CRAC channels is the trigger. Hence a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ increase in mast cells is highly versatile in that it triggers cytoplasmic responses through generation of intracellular messengers as well as long distance changes through increased secretion of paracrine signals."
https://openalex.org/W2077907131,"Here we report on the structure, expression, and function of a novel cartilage-specific gene coding for a 17-kDa small, highly charged, and secreted protein that we termed Ucma (unique cartilage matrix-associated protein). The protein is processed by a furin-like protease into an N-terminal peptide of 37 amino acids and a C-terminal fragment (Ucma-C) of 74 amino acids. Ucma is highly conserved between mouse, rat, human, dog, clawed frog, and zebrafish, but has no homology to other known proteins. Remarkable are 1-2 tyrosine sulfate residues/molecule and dense clusters of acidic and basic residues in the C-terminal part. In the developing mouse skeleton Ucma mRNA is expressed in resting chondrocytes in the distal and peripheral zones of epiphyseal and vertebral cartilage. Ucma is secreted into the extracellular matrix as an uncleaved precursor and shows the same restricted distribution pattern in cartilage as Ucma mRNA. In contrast, antibodies prepared against the processed C-terminal fragment located Ucma-C in the entire cartilage matrix, indicating that it either diffuses or is retained until chondrocytes reach hypertrophy. During differentiation of an MC615 chondrocyte subclone in vitro, Ucma expression parallels largely the expression of collagen II and decreases with maturation toward hypertrophic cells. Recombinant Ucma-C does not affect expression of chondrocyte-specific genes or proliferation of chondrocytes, but interferes with osteogenic differentiation of primary osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. These findings suggest that Ucma may be involved in the negative control of osteogenic differentiation of osteochondrogenic precursor cells in peripheral zones of fetal cartilage and at the cartilage-bone interface.

Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying chondrocyte differentiation is not only important for our understanding of skeletal development, but also of particular interest for our knowledge on the behavior of chondrocytes following articular cartilage damage during cartilage repair and treatment of degenerative cartilage diseases. Initial steps of chondrogenesis, i.e. the formation of a cartilage blastema from limb bud mesenchymal cells, include cell condensation and onset of chondrocyte differentiation marked by the expression of cartilage-specific matrix proteins such as aggrecan, collagen II, IX, and XI and others (1Cancedda R. Descalci-Cancedda F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytology. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 2Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These events are regulated by the orchestrated action of several growth factors including BMPs, Wnt factors, FGFs, and the transcription factors Sox5, 6, and 9 (3Crombrugghe de B. Lefebvre V. Nakashima K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarth. Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Further steps of chondrocyte growth, maturation, and replacement by bone in the growth plate of long bones, ribs, and vertebrae during endochondral ossification can be defined by the stepwise onset or decline of differentially expressed genes: collagen II and Sox9 for resting and proliferating, FGFR3 for proliferating and prehypertrophic, Ihh and PTHrP receptor for prehypertrophic, collagen X for hypertrophic, and Runx2, osteocalcin, and MMP13 for late hypertrophic chondrocytes (2Goldring M.B.

Similar to chondrogenesis, the steps of chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral ossification are regulated in a complex manner by BMPs, Wnt factors, and FGFs. In addition, Ihh/PTHrP, HIF-1α, thyroxine, and others are important regulators of this process (2Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 7Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Little is known, however, on the early differentiation events occurring in the distal, so-called “resting” zone of epiphyseal cartilage. In a search for further chondrocyte specific genes, we identified a novel, highly charged extracellular protein that is abundantly expressed in the upper immature zone of fetal and juvenile epiphyseal cartilage. The gene, termed Ucma, was discovered in a screen for differentially expressed genes in retinoic acid-treated mouse chondrocytes. Independently, Ucma was also identified in a human chondrocyte EST screen for candidate genes of skeletal dysplasias (8Tagariello A. Luther J. Streiter M. Didt-Koziel L. Wuelling M. Surmann-Schmitt C. Stock M. Adam N. Vortkamp A. Winterpacht A. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we report on the transient expression of Ucma in the developing mouse skeleton between day E13.5 of embryonic development and 5 months of postnatal development. Ucma is predominantly expressed in distal peripheral, non-articulating zones of fetal epiphyses and vertebrae, but not by chondrocytes of the hypertrophic zone. Ucma contains tyrosine sulfate and is cleaved by a furin-like protease into N- and C-terminal fragments of 37 and 74 amino acid residues, respectively. With specific antibodies we show that the distribution of the unprocessed form of Ucma is restricted to sites of Ucma mRNA expression, while the C-terminal fragment Ucma-C is found in almost the entire cartilage matrix. During differentiation of MC615 chondrocytes in vitro Ucma expression largely parallels the expression of collagen II, and declines with onset of hypertrophy. Furthermore, we provide evidence that recombinant Ucma-C protein suppresses osteogenic differentiation of preosteoblasts in vitro. Therefore, we postulate that this protein may have a transient function in the formation and stabilization of the juvenile cartilage matrix of epiphyseal, vertebral, and rib cartilage by suppressing osteogenic differentiation of precursor cells present in peripheral zones and perichondrium of fetal cartilage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Primary Skeletal Cells—MC615 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 2The abbreviations used are:DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flighthMSCshuman mesenchymal stem cellsRTreverse transcriptionMSmass spectrometryAAascorbic acidβ-GPβ-glycerophosphateAPalkaline phosphatase./Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and passaged before reaching confluency as outlined before (9Mallein-Gerin F.

Episomally expressed Ucma(His)6FLAG was collected from serum-free culture medium, concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM10 Amicon membrane and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitriloacetic acid Sepharose (Qiagen). Purity, integrity, and size of purified protein were tested by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody.

Digested samples were purified and concentrated using reversed phase tips, homemade Stop and Go extraction tips (16Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M.

The peptides retained from samples for MALDI-TOF MS were eluted onto dried matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) spots on Anchorchip™ target plates (Bruker) using 1-2 μl 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Samples for electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were eluted using 10 μl 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid into autosampler glass vials (Qsert, Waters). The organic solvent was evaporated, and replaced with 0.1% formic acid.The MALDI-TOF MS analyses were done with a Bruker Reflex III instrument run in linear mode with delayed extraction and an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The polarity was switched between positive and negative ion mode and 50-100 spectra were summed. Trypsin autolysis peaks at 842.5100 m/z and 2211.1046 m/z were used for internal calibration in positive ion mode. The electrospray MS analysis used a Bruker Esquire-HCT ion trap instrument equipped with an Ultimate HPLC system (LC Packings) with a Pepmap™ nano-precolumn (LC Packings, C18, 300 μm i.d. and 5 mm long) and an Atlantis™ analytical column (Waters, C18, 3 μm particles, 150 mm × 150 μm). Samples (1-10 μl) were loaded onto the precolumn and rinsed with 0.1% formic acid for 5 min. Bound peptides were eluted using a gradient consisting of solution A (3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and solution B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The elution gradient was 5-50% B solution in 30 min.The analytical column was coupled to the MS instrument using a microflow nebuliser. The equipment was controlled by HyStar software (Bruker); generated spectra were processed using DataAnalysis (Bruker) and data base searches were performed via MASCOT MS/MS Ions Search (17Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed in separate runs using either positive or negative ion mode. Ions selected in the positive mode (multiply charged ions) were run with MS/MS for identification. To detect tyrosine sulfations, which are more stable in negative ion mode, the polarity of the instrument was switched (18Onnerfjord P. Heathfield T.F. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To locate the positions of the sulfation sites the protein was digested with trypsin to generate peptides which give more detailed structural information. The peptide map identified Ucma protein with 10 peptides matching the theoretical sequence covering amino acids 68-135 of total Ucma, thus representing nearly the complete secreted form of Ucma (amino acids 65-138). The mass shifts corresponding to a sulfate group (80 Da) upon polarity switching were found by manual inspection of the data. Quantitative comparisons were made by comparing the relative peak intensities of different species in the negative ion mode.RESULTSIdentification of Ucma as a Gene Repressed in Retinoic Acid-treated Dedifferentiated Chondrocytes—Ucma was discovered as one of the genes most strongly repressed by retinoic acid-induced dedifferentiation of murine chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were obtained from 18.5 dpc murine embryos and treated with retinoic acid (3 × 10-6 m) to induce dedifferentiation. Control cells were incubated without retinoic acid. Subsequent microarray-based gene expression profiling identified the so far non-described cDNA clone XM_129985 (AW121955) as one of the most strongly retinoic acid-repressed transcripts in this study. 3U. Dietz et al., manuscript in preparation. The most complete corresponding cDNA that could be uncovered by BLAST search was RIKEN cDNA 1110017I16 (NM_026754) which is orthologous to the predicted human gene C10orf49 (AAH18068).Genomic Organization, mRNA, and Deduced Amino Acid Sequence of Ucma—The murine Ucma gene is located on chromosome 2. It is composed of five exons spanning ∼9 kb (Fig. 1A). 5′-RACE determined a transcription start site ∼60-bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of RIKEN cDNA clone 1110017I16 (Fig. 1, B and C). cDNA sequencing and annotated genomic data revealed the presence of an additional exon (exon 2) as compared with the 1110017I16 cDNA clone. The mRNA sequence thus comprises 881 nt including an open reading frame of 414 nt (Fig. 1C; GenBank™ accession number EU368184). The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 138 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 16.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a 27-amino acid signal peptide as calculated by the web-based signal peptide prediction program SignalP 3.0 (Fig. 1A). Ucma contains a RGKR/S consensus sequence predicting processing by a furin-like protease (see below).Recently, the same gene has been identified independently in an EST project as a transcript from a human fetal cartilage library (8Tagariello A. Luther J. Streiter M. Didt-Koziel L. Wuelling M. Surmann-Schmitt C. Stock M. Adam N. Vortkamp A. Winterpacht A. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the C-terminal fragment is exceptionally rich in acidic and basic amino acids: the 111 C-terminal amino acids contain 27 acidic residues and 21 basic residues. Further conserved functional domains, however, could not be identified by means of bioinformatic analyses. Murine and human mRNA and amino acid sequences exhibit a homology of ∼65 and 80%, respectively. Highly conserved orthologues of Ucma can be found in various other species including rat, dog, clawed frog, and zebra fish, among others (Fig. 1D). The putative furin cleavage site is conserved in most species analyzed. In contrast, paralogous genes or pseudogenes were not revealed after screening the published murine genome.Ucma Is Proteolytically Processed and Contains Tyrosine Sulfates—For in vitro assays on the physiologic function of Ucma, and for analysis of potential posttranslational modifications, recombinant (His)6- and FLAG-tagged Ucma protein was produced in HEK293EBNA cells. In cell lysates the anti-FLAG antibody detected a major band at about 18 kDa, corresponding to the full-length Ucma protein including His and FLAG tags (Fig. 2A, Lys) and a minor band migrating at ∼13 kDa. Ucma purified from cell culture supernatant showed only the 13-kDa band, indicating processing of Ucma during or after secretion (Fig. 2A, SN). Fig. 2B displays the purified Ucma protein in a Coomassie-stained PAA gel. The N-terminal sequence of recombinant Ucma (SPKSRDE...) as determined by amino acid sequencing indicated that Ucma was proteolytically processed by a furin-like protease into a C-terminal fragment of 74 amino acid residues (Ucma-C), containing the His-FLAG-Tag at the carboxyl end, and an N-terminal fragment of 37 amino acids (Ucma-N) (Fig. 1A) (19Duckert P. Brunak S. Blom N. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The actual molecular mass of the secreted C-terminal Ucma fragment (Ucma-C) was determined to 11510 Da using MALDI-TOF MS, matching the theoretically predicted molecular weight of its amino acid sequence including His and FLAG tags.FIGURE 2Proteolytic cleavage and generation of specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies.

In light of increasing evidence implicating this protein in the regulation of skeletal development and pathology, we investigated the role of HtrA1 in osteoblast mineralization and identified domains essential for this activity. We demonstrate increased HtrA1 expression in differentiating 2T3 osteoblasts prior to the appearance of mineralization. HtrA1 is subsequently down-regulated in fully mineralized cultures. The functional role of HtrA1 in matrix calcification was investigated using three complementary approaches. First, we transfected a full-length HtrA1 expression plasmid into 2T3 cells and showed that overexpression of HtrA1 delayed mineralization, reduced expression of Cbfa1 and collagen type I mRNA, and prevented BMP-2-induced mineralization. Second, knocking down HtrA1 expression using short interfering RNA induced mineral deposition by 2T3 cells. Third, by expressing a series of recombinant HtrA1 proteins, we demonstrated that the protease domain and the PDZ domain are essential for the inhibitory effect of HtrA1 on osteoblast mineralization. Finally, we tested whether HtrA1 cleaves specific matrix proteins that are known to regulate osteoblast differentiation, mineralization, and/or BMP-2 activity. Full-length recombinant HtrA1 cleaved recombinant decorin, fibronectin, and matrix Gla protein. Both the protease domain and the PDZ domain were necessary for the cleavage of matrix Gla protein, whereas the PDZ domain was not required for the cleavage of decorin or fibronectin. Type I collagen was not cleaved by recombinant HtrA1. These results suggest that HtrA1 may regulate matrix calcification via the inhibition of BMP-2 signaling, modulating osteoblast gene expression, and/or via the degradation of specific matrix proteins.

Mammalian HtrA1 is a member of the family of HtrA (high temperature requirement) proteins that were originally identified in bacteria (1Clausen T. Southan C. Ehrmann M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by the presence of a trypsin-like serine protease domain and either one or two PDZ domains. However, in contrast to bacterial HtrA, mammalian HtrA1 is secreted, and it also contains an IGFBP 4The abbreviations used are:IGFBPinsulin-like growth factor-binding proteinTGF-βtransforming growth factor-βMGPmatrix Gla proteinsiRNAshort interfering RNAntnucleotideBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPBSphosphate-buffered salineFBSfetal bovine serumrHtrA1recombinant full-length HtrA1BMPbone morphogenetic protein./mac25-like domain and a Kazal-type inhibitor domain at the N terminus (2Zumbrunn J.

Evidence is now accumulating to suggest that HtrA1 is involved in the development and progression of several pathologies. HtrA1 has been found to exhibit properties of a tumor suppressor protein, as its expression is down-regulated in many cancer cell lines (2Zumbrunn J. Trueb B.

We demonstrated previously that HtrA1 mRNA is up-regulated as vascular pericytes undergo osteogenic differentiation and deposit a mineralized matrix in vitro (13Doherty M. Boot-Handford R.P. Grant M.E. Canfield A.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: S410Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vitro data, HtrA1 is expressed at sites of skeletal development in mouse tissues in vivo (6Tsuchiya A. Yano M. Tocharus J. Kojima H. Fukumoto M. Kawaichi M. Oka C.

However, the potential role of HtrA1 in osteogenesis has not yet been defined. Osteogenesis is a complex process that is regulated by growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins acting in an interdependent manner (15Young M.F. Osteoporos.

Tsujimoto R. Kajikawa M. Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Ina J. Yano M. Tsuchiya A. Ueta Y. Soma A. Kanda H. Matsumoto M. Kawaichi M.

In addition, recombinant HtrA1 lacking the IGFBP/mac25 and Kazal-type inhibitor domains has been reported to degrade several proteins that have also been implicated in regulating bone formation and/or mineralization either directly or indirectly (6Tsuchiya A.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that HtrA1 regulates mineral deposition in osteoblasts and to identify the domains essential for this activity. Several complementary approaches were taken. First, we determined the expression pattern of HtrA1 in differentiating 2T3 osteoblast cells, an in vitro model system of bone formation (22Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J.

Second, the effects of overexpressing and knocking down expression of HtrA1 were assessed with respect to matrix mineralization, and the response of HtrA1 overexpressing cells to BMP-2 was determined. Third, by generating recombinant full-length HtrA1 (rHtrA1) and a series of domain-specific deletion constructs, we identified which domains were essential for the inhibitory activity of HtrA1 on mineralization, and we identified potential proteolytic substrates of HtrA1. The results of these studies highlight a novel role for HtrA1 in the regulation of mineralization. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all cell culture medium and growth additives were obtained from BioWhittaker. Puromycin hydrochloride, chondroitinase ABC, β-casein, Alizarin red S, and human plasma fibronectin were obtained from Sigma.

All secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Dako unless otherwise stated. Culture and Mineralization of 2T3 Osteoblasts—2T3 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Stephen Harris (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio) and were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For mineralization experiments, cells were plated on gelatin-coated dishes at a density of 1.6 × 104 cells/cm2 and on reaching confluency (day 3) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 5% FBS (v/v), 100 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Wako, Japan), and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. Medium was changed every 2-3 days with or without the addition of BMP-2 (10 ng/ml). Mineral deposition was confirmed by histochemical staining with 1% (w/v) Alizarin red, pH 4.2 (26Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Quantitation of 45Ca Incorporation—Mineral deposition was also quantified by measuring 45Ca incorporation into the matrix over a period of 24 or 48 h using a method adapted from Shioi et al. (27Shioi A. Nishizawa Y. Jono S. Koyama H. Hosoi M. Morii H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, 45Ca (0.5 μCi/ml) was added to 2T3 cultures either 24 or 48 h prior to analysis. At each time point, medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Perchloric acid (1.3 ml/25-cm2 flask) was added and the cell layer collected. To this, an equal volume of 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide was added, and samples were incubated at 80 °C for 1 h. Ethylene glycol (2× final volume) was mixed with cooled samples, and 1 ml of the final solution added to 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Ecoscint™ A). Samples were counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Data are expressed as the mean uptake per culture (cpm/flask) and presented as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples. Significant differences between control and experimental conditions were calculated using analysis of variance or t test as appropriate; p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Preparation of RNA and Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated with turbo DNA-free DNase I (Ambion) to remove any contaminating DNA. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA and random hexamers (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reaction efficiency was tested by performing PCR using primers for the housekeeping gene β-actin, at 95 °C for 5 min, 57 °C for 30 s, 72 for 30 s, for 30 cycles followed by 72 °C for 4 min. Forward (F) and reverse (R) primers recognizing β-actin (GenBank™ accession number NM_007393, F, AGC CAT GTA CGT AGC CAT CC; R, CTC TCA GCT GTG GTG GTG AA), Cbfa-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF010284, F, GCA GTT CCC AAG CAT TTC AT; R, CAC TCT GGC TTT GGG AAG AG), and the α1 chain of collagen type I (GenBank™ accession number U08020, F, CAC CCT CAA GAG CCT GAG TC; R, GCT TCT TTT CCT TGG GGT TC) were designed using the primer-3 program. Real time PCR analysis was then performed for β-actin, Cbfa-1, and collagen type I in a 25-μl reaction using a pre-mixed SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 15 pmol of primer pairs, and 5 μl of cDNA and the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Cycling parameters were as before but for 40 cycles. The amplification efficiencies of the test genes and the reference gene, β-actin, were approximately equal as determined by serial dilution of cDNA prepared from wild-type day 3 cultures. Each sample was run in triplicate, and each sample set was analyzed twice. Amplification curves were checked for normal base-line and threshold levels during each run. A comparative method was used to determine RNA levels in which data for test genes (Δ) were normalized to levels of β-actin (CT) within each sample, and relative mRNA levels were determined using the equation 2^(Δ-CT). Preparation of Conditioned Medium for Protein Expression Analysis—Cell cultures were washed 2-3 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h. Cells were then incubated in fresh serum-free medium for a further 24 h. The resulting conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged (5 min, 4000 × g) to remove cell debris. Supernatants were dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate over 72 h at 4 °C and freeze-dried. Protein samples were resuspended in 1× loading sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol), and total protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation of Cell Lysates for Protein Expression Analysis—Cultures were washed with PBS and proteins extracted using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1% (v/v) SDS) containing the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) for 20 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 × g at 4 °C) and protein concentrations determined in the supernatants as described above. Generation of Full-length HtrA1 cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cDNA was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. HtrA1 cDNA was generated by PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed to the full coding region of murine HtrA (GenBank™ accession number NM_019564). Expand High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and 10% Me2SO were used in all reactions. The full-length product was generated from three separate DNA fragments that were generated from two overlapping 5′ and 3′ sequences. The 5′ PCR product (515 bp) was generated using the forward primer 5′-AAC GGA TCC GTC ATG CAG TCC CTG CGT A-3′ and reverse 5′-AGT TGT ACT TAT GAC GCA AAC TGT T-3′. Cycling parameters used were 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The 3′ PCR product (1096 bp) was generated using forward and reverse primers 5′-AGC GAC GCC AAG ACC TAC ACC AAC C-3′ and 5′-AAA CGA ATT CTC CTG CCT CTG CCT AG-3′. PCR conditions used were 95 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension for 4 min at 72 °C. Both PCR products were ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequences confirmed using Big Dye™ terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and an ABI 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc). These cDNA constructs were digested with HindIII (creating fragments 1-3) and through a series of ligations generated the full-length product of 1460 bp in pCR2.1. The resulting full-length HtrA1 cDNA was first ligated into pIND (Invitrogen) as an EcoRI-digested fragment (pIND-mHtrA1) and subsequently into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 as a KpnI/XbaI fragment generating the pcDNA3.1-mHtrA1 expression plasmid. Overexpression of HtrA1 in 2T3 Osteoblasts—2T3 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-mHtrA1 expression plasmid using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). A FuGENE 6:DNA ratio of 3:1 and 1 μg of DNA/10 cm2 of cell layer was used. After 16 h, medium was replaced with fresh growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Drug-resistant colonies developed from single cells were selected either by ring cloning or by dilution cloning after 2-3 weeks. Expression of HtrA1 mRNA and protein in selected clones was determined by Western blotting of conditioned media and by Northern blotting using 15 μg total RNA and an [α-32P]CTP-labeled HtrA1 cDNA probe. Northern blotting was performed as described (28Kirton J.P. Wilkinson F.L. Canfield A.E. Alexander M.Y. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Generation of HtrA1 siRNA Expression Plasmid—HtrA1 RNA interference effector molecules were delivered using the siRNA expression vector pSUPERIOR.neo+GFP (Oligo-Engine). The HtrA1 19-nt mRNA target sequence 5′-GGU UGA GCU GAA GAA UGG A-3′ was taken from sequences provided with pre-designed siRNA 21-mer duplexes (Ambion). Preliminary experiments showed this sequence to be the most effective at knocking down the transient expression of recombinant HtrA1 in HEK293 cells. Two 60-bp oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to include the unique 19-nt sequence in both the sense and antisense direction, separated by a 9-nt spacer sequence. The sense strand of the pSuperior-HtrA1-siRNA insert is 5′-GAT CCC CGG TTG AGC TGA AGA ATG GAt tca aga gaT CCA TTC TTC AGC TCA ACC TTT TTA-3′. The 5′ end of the sense strand oligonucleotide corresponds to a BglII site and the 3′ end to a thymidine termination sequence (T5) and HindIII corresponding nucleotides. The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into BglII/HindIII linearized pSUPERIOR.neo+GFP vector, downstream of the H1 promoter, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The identities of the inserted sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection of 2T3 Cells with pSUPERIOR siRNA Plasmids—2T3 cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at 4 × 105 cells/10-cm dish. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the pSuperior-HtrA (pSupHtrA) and pSuperior-empty vector (pSupEV) plasmids using a calcium phosphate kit (Profection® kit, Promega). After 30 h, cells were passaged 1:2, and transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. Neomycin-resistant cell populations were expanded, and HtrA1 expression was assessed by Western blotting of conditioned media. To confirm that knockdown of HtrA1 was specific, samples of conditioned medium and cell lysates from both cell populations were also assessed for global protein expression and for the expression of β-actin. Cloning and Expression of HtrA1 Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant murine HtrA proteins were produced using a mammalian episomal expression vector (pCEP-His) and 293-EBNA cells (29Van Craenenbroeck K. Vanhoenacker P. Haegeman G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5665-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). pCEP-His has been modified from the pCEP-pu/AC7 vector (30Kohfeldt E. Maurer P.

HtrA1 cDNA, without the sequence encoding for its signal peptide, was amplified from pIND/mHtrA1 using the primers 5′-GCT GAC TTG CCG TCG GGG ACC GG-3′ and 5′-GTC GAC CTC CTG CCT CTG CCT AG-3′. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension for 4 min at 72 °C. A 3′-truncated HtrA1 transcript lacking the PDZ domain (HtrA1ΔPDZ) was generated using the reverse primer 5′-GTC GAC CTA CTT GGT GAC AGC TTT C-3′. Reaction times were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. The final PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and sequences confirmed. HtrA1 inserts were released by SalI digestion and cloned into XhoI-digested pCEP-His to produce pCEP-His/HtrA1 (H) and pCEP-His/HtrA1ΔPDZ (HΔP). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene), using primers 5′-CAT CAA TTA TGG AAA TGC CGG AGG CCC GTT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA ACG GGC CTC CGG CAT TTC CAT AAT TGA TG-3′ (3Hu S.I.

The resulting mutated construct pCEP-His/MutHtrA1 (MH) was used as a template to amplify MutHtrA1ΔPDZ (MHΔP) using the same primer pair and PCR conditions as for HtrA1ΔPDZ. 293-EBNA cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection in 10-cm dishes at a density of 4 × 105/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the recombinant HtrA1 expression constructs using FuGENE 6 as described above. Cells were also transfected with pCEP-His empty vector as a control. To select transfected cells, medium was replaced after 16 h with fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were maintained thereafter in medium containing 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and 250 μg/ml G418. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Matrix Gla Protein—An expression construct encoding an N-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged mouse MGP protein (N-FLAG-MGP) was generated by PCR from the template pMGPcJ, using the forward and reverse primers 5′-GCC CCG CTA GCT GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG TAC GAA TCT CAC GAA-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG ACT AGT GGA TCC CAC ACT TCA GTA A-3′. The forward primer incorporated the sequence of the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 92 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The 381-bp product was ligated as an NheI/XhoI fragment into the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu/AC7 (30Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the frame of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pCEP-Pu-MGP construct was transfected into 293-HEK cells as described above for 293-EBNA cells. Transfected cells were selected and maintained in medium containing 5 and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, respectively. Preparation and Analysis of Recombinant Proteins—To generate recombinant HtrA proteins, transfected 293-EBNAs were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, and 250 μg/ml G418. Cells were expanded into 225-cm2 tissue culture flasks, and at 90-100% confluency were prepared for conditioned media collection as described above. After 24 h, the conditioned media were centrifuged (4000 × g, 5 min) to remove cell debris. Supernatants, containing recombinant proteins, were concentrated ∼50-fold using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter columns with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Millipore), filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter, and stored at -80 °C. Medium collected from empty vector-transfected control cells was treated in the same manner. An aliquot (0.5 ml) of each concentrated conditioned medium was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, freeze-dried, resuspended in 50 μl of 1× loading sample buffer, and the total protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein"

The generated mitotic Golgi fragments are distributed into the daughter cells, where they are reassembled into new Golgi stacks. In this study, an in vitro assay has been developed using purified proteins and Golgi membranes to reconstitute the Golgi disassembly and reassembly processes. This technique provides a useful tool to delineate the mechanisms underlying the morphological change. There are two processes during Golgi disassembly: unstacking and vesiculation. Unstacking is mediated by two mitotic kinases, cdc2 and plk, which phosphorylate the Golgi stacking protein GRASP65 and thus disrupt the oligomer of this protein. Vesiculation is mediated by the COPI budding machinery ARF1 and the coatomer complex. When treated with a combination of purified kinases, ARF1 and coatomer, the Golgi membranes were completely fragmented into vesicles. After mitosis, there are also two processes in Golgi reassembly: formation of single cisternae by membrane fusion, and restacking. Cisternal membrane fusion requires two AAA ATPases, p97 and NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein), each of which functions together with specific adaptor proteins. Restacking of the newly formed Golgi cisternae requires dephosphorylation of Golgi stacking proteins by the protein phosphatase PP2A.

The interphase Golgi apparatus, as seen by light or fluorescence microscopy, is a compact juxta-nuclear reticulum, located most often in the peri-centriolar region of the cell (1Louvard D. Reggio H.

Biochemical reconstitution experiments have provided powerful tools with which to dissect biological processes. Two basic experimental approaches have been taken to reconstitute mitotic Golgi disassembly and reassembly. One involves semipermeabilized cells, in which cells are permeabilized gently with detergent (e.g. digitonin), washed with 1 m KCl to remove endogenous cytosol and peripheral membrane proteins, and then incubated in cytosol prepared from mitotic (or interphase) cells (5Kano F. Takenaka K. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. Nishida E. Murata M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells can then be processed directly for immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, or biochemical analysis of proteins. This approach has been used to test the mitotic kinases that regulate the Golgi disassembly process (5Kano F. Takenaka K. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. Nishida E. Murata M. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The second method involves purified Golgi membranes to which mitotic or interphase cytosol is added as above (7Misteli T.

Membranes can then be processed for biochemical analysis of proteins and morphological analysis of the membranes. This approach has contributed to the discovery and examination of much of the currently identified proteins that mediate Golgi membrane tethering (10Shorter J. Warren G. J.

Although the discovery of these proteins that are involved in regulation of Golgi membrane dynamics has contributed much to our understanding of the biogenesis of the Golgi apparatus, it is unclear whether these proteins are sufficient to control mitotic Golgi disassembly and reassembly, as all these studies used cytosol, or cell extract, in the reconstitution assays. Because cytosol contains many kinds of proteins, it is difficult to identify the minimal machinery or the key components that control Golgi disassembly during mitosis and reassembly afterward. This study describes for the first time an in vitro assay that reconstitutes the entire mitotic Golgi disassembly and reassembly processes using biochemically purified components. Our results show that the disassembly process is mediated by two independent but interactive processes: cisternal membrane unstacking mediated by mitotic kinases, and membrane vesiculation mediated by the COPI vesicle budding machinery. Post-mitotic Golgi reassembly also consists of two processes: membrane fusion mediated by two AAA ATPases, p97 and NSF, and cisternal membrane restacking, mediated by dephosphorylation of the Golgi stacking proteins by protein phosphatase PP2A. Our method provides a powerful tool to further dissect the molecular mechanism that regulates Golgi membrane dynamics during the cell cycle.

GRASP65 Dephosphorylation—Purified protein serine/threonine phosphatases PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) were purchased from Upstate Biotech. Purified PP1 originated from skeletal muscle and contained multiple PP1 isoforms. PP2A was purified from human red blood cells as a heterodimer of A and C subunits; the trimeric form of PP2A, called PP2A1, was purified from rabbit skeletal muscles and contained ACBα subunits. PP2B/calcineurin was purified from bovine brain. Recombinant PP2Cα and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) were expressed in bacteria and purified by chromatography. GRASP65 phosphorylation was achieved by treating Golgi membranes with mitotic cytosol, as in the Golgi disassembly assay. Briefly, 5 μg of purified rat liver Golgi membranes were mixed with 500 μg of mitotic cytosol in MEB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm glutathione, and protease inhibitors) and an ATP regeneration system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 ng/ml cytochalasin B) in a 50-μl reaction. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the membranes were pelleted through a 0.4 m sucrose layer at 55,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman). To dephosphorylate GRASP65, the membrane pellets were directly resuspended in KHM buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH7, 0.2 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm glutathione, protease inhibitors) containing 100 μg interphase cytosol, or 0.5 units of purified phosphatases (except for PP2A1, for which 0.125 milliunits was used), and then incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The membranes were solubilized in SDS buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for GRASP65. GRASP65 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were analyzed by the migration shift of GRASP65 on SDS-PAGE (17Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and Western blotting confirmed that the appropriate subunits were expressed at similar levels by the recombinant baculoviruses in each combinatorial infection. Relative equal amounts of the lysate (20 μl each) with AC, ACBα, ACB′α subunits expressed were used to treat 5 μg of mitotic Golgi fragments prepared as described above. The same amount of lysate from non-infected cells was used as a control. Okadaic acid was purchased from Calbiochem, inhibitor-2 from Upstate Biotech, and microcystin LR from Sigma. Golgi Disassembly and Reassembly Assay—All recombinant proteins used in this study were wild type. Although the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS could enhance the Golgi disassembly, the resulting Golgi fragments could not be reassembled; thus GTPγS was not used in this study. Mitotic Golgi disassembly assay was performed as previously described (9Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J.

Briefly, Golgi membranes (200 μg) were mixed with 10 mg of mitotic cytosol, or with purified coatomer (100 μg), recombinant myristoylated ARF1 (50 μg), 1 mm GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system in MEB buffer, in a final volume of 1000 μl. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, mitotic Golgi fragments (MGFs) were isolated and soluble factors were removed by centrifugation (55,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA55 rotor) through a 0.4 m sucrose cushion in KHM buffer onto a 6-μl2 m sucrose cushion. The membranes were resuspended in KHM buffer, and aliquots were succeeded to fixation and EM processing, or to reassembly reactions described below. For Golgi reassembly, 20 μg of MGFs were treated with the following combinations of proteins in 30-μl reactions: 1) 400 μl of interphase cytosol; 2) 3 μg of NSF (100 ng/μl), 0.75 μg of α-SNAP (25 ng/μl), 0.75 μg of γ-SNAP (25 ng/μl) (8Rabouille C. Kondo H. Newman R. Hui N. Freemont P. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 92: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), 0.9 μg of p115 (30 ng/μl) (10Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and 2 units of PP2A (0.07 units/μl); 3) 3 μg of p97 (100 ng/μl), 0.75 μg of p47 (14Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), 0.9 μg of p115 (30 ng/μl), and 2 units of PP2A (0.07 units/μl). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and membranes were pelleted and processed for EM. The percentage of membranes in cisternae or in vesicles was determined by the intersection method (10Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cisternae were defined as long membrane profiles with a length more than four times their width, with the width no more than 80 nm. Vesicles were defined as round profiles of ∼70 nm in diameter. The average size of the vesicles was determined by measuring the diameter of 50 vesicles. Results were quantitated from three independent experiments and the statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test. Analysis of the Contents in Golgi Remnants and Vesicles—To determine which proteins were sorted into the vesicles, Golgi disassembly reactions described above using 200 μg of Golgi treated with ARF1 and coatomer in the presence or absence of mitotic kinases were supplemented with 250 mm KCl in cold assay buffer to stop the reaction and release the vesicles. The reactions were directly loaded onto a step gradient comprised of 1.0 ml 0.5 m, 1.5 ml 0.8 m, 2 ml 1.2 m, 2 ml 1.4 m, and 2 ml 1.6 m sucrose in assay buffer containing 250 mm KCl (23Xiang Y. Seemann J. Bisel B. Punthambaker S. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membranes were centrifuged to equilibrium at 200,000 × g, 4°C for 3 h in a near vertical rotor (NVT65, Beckman Instruments, 50,000 rpm). COPI-coated vesicles typically peaked at 1.2–1.3 m sucrose, while uncoated Golgi remnants peaked at about 0.8 m sucrose (23Xiang Y. Seemann J. Bisel B. Punthambaker S. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fractions were diluted 3-fold with a buffer without sucrose and membranes in each fraction were pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 60 min followed by Western blotting analysis. The soluble proteins, most of which were found in the top two fractions, were not pelleted after this centrifugation. This allowed us to determine the distribution of only the proteins that were associated with Golgi remnants and vesicles. Six categories of proteins were analyzed: 1) COPI coat proteins ARF1 and β-COP; 2) Golgi matrix proteins GM130, GRASP65, GRASP55, and Golgin-84; 3) Golgi enzymes α-mannosidase I and II; 4) Golgi SNAREs Syntaxin 5, Gos28 and Bet1; 5) the trans-Golgi protein TGN38; and 6) a secretory cargo protein rat serum albumin (RSA). For morphological analysis, fractions containing the Golgi remnants (no. 1–3) and vesicles (no. 7–9) were pooled, diluted 3-fold using a buffer without sucrose, and pelleted by centrifugation. Membrane samples were fixed and processed for EM. Defined Golgi Disassembly—During mitosis, the Golgi apparatus undergoes continuous fragmentation, which requires ARF1 and COPI budding (23Xiang Y. Seemann J. Bisel B. Punthambaker S. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether COPI vesicle budding activity is sufficient to fragment the entire Golgi stack, we treated purified Golgi membranes with purified ARF1 and coatomer (Fig. 1B). This treatment led to fragmentation of a large fraction (40%, Fig. 1F) of the Golgi membranes into vesicles. However, a significant amount of the membranes remained as short cisternae concentrated in ministacks (Fig. 1B, arrows). These ministacks did not diminish even when increased amounts of ARF1 and coatomer were used (not shown), suggesting that vesicle budding alone is not sufficient to complete the fragmentation process of the entire Golgi stack. This result indicates that fragmentation of the Golgi during mitosis may require a COPI-independent fragmentation process, as previously proposed (7Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, since most of the observed cisternae were found in ministacks, it is possible that unstacking of the cisternae may help to improve the fragmentation process. Previous work showed that Golgi membrane stacking is mediated by GRASP65, whose oligomerization functions as a glue to hold the cisternal membrane together (17Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4921-4928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of GRASP65 is regulated by phosphorylation, which is mediated by two mitotic kinases, cdc2 (in complex with cyclin B1) and plk. GRASP65 phosphorylation disrupts its oligomerization and thus causes cisternal membrane unstacking (17Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, cdc2 and plk also mimic mitotic cytosol to phosphorylate GM130, another Golgi matrix protein whose phosphorylation during mitosis is involved in mitotic Golgi disassembly (20Lowe M. Rabouille C. Nakamura N. Watson R. Jackman M. Jamsa E. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 94: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this study, when the Golgi membranes were treated with these mitotic kinases, the Golgi membrane became unstacked and thus generated a large amount of single cisternae. However, this treatment did not vesiculate the Golgi cisternal membranes (Fig. 1C). Quantitation results showed that about 15% of the membranes were in vesicles when the Golgi membranes were treated with both mitotic kinases; thus, there is no change compared with that of untreated membranes (Fig. 1F). To test whether unstacking and vesiculation have a synergistic effect in terms of Golgi fragmentation, both sets of components, ARF1/coatomer and kinases, were combined and used to treat Golgi membranes. As expected, the result showed that fragmentation was complete; essentially all membranes were fragmented into vesicles except the elements of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) indicated by the electron-dense contents of lipoproteins (Fig. 1D, asterisks). The size of the vesicles generated by purified components was 70 ± 9 nm (Fig. 1D); no significant change was seen compared with an average diameter of 72 ± 6 nm for those generated by mitotic cytosol (Fig. 1E). Quantitation of the results showed that about 79% of membranes were vesiculated by the treatment with ARF1/coatomer in the presence of mitotic kinases cdc2 and plk, a significant increase compared with treatment with ARF1 and coatomer alone (40%), or with only the two mitotic kinases (15%) (Fig. 1F), suggesting that vesiculation and unstacking are independent but synergistic. The Golgi disassembly after this treatment was also slightly higher than with mitotic cytosol, which had ∼50% of membranes in vesicles (Fig. 1, E and F). Detailed examination of EM images at higher magnification indicated that most of the vesicles, generated by treatment with either mitotic cytosol or with ARF1 and coatomer in the presence or absence of mitotic kinases, were coated (data not shown). These results suggest that the mitotic Golgi fragmentation consists of two independent but interactive processes: unstacking, mediated by mitotic kinases that phosphorylate Golgi stacking proteins, and vesiculation, mediated by ARF1 and the COPI coat protein complex coatomer. Golgi Enzymes and SNARE Proteins Are Enriched in Vesicles—To determine which proteins are enriched in the vesicles generated by treatment with ARF1, coatomer and mitotic kinases, we fractionated the fragmented Golgi membranes on a 0.5–1.6 m sucrose gradient, as described earlier (23Xiang Y. Seemann J. Bisel B. Punthambaker S. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to equilibrium, membrane-bound proteins in each fraction were collected by high-speed centrifugation. Previous work showed that coated vesicles are enriched in a fraction equivalent to the density of 1.2 m sucrose (29Malsam J. Satoh A. Pelletier L. Warren G. Science. 2005; 307: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 31Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in this gradient, while the Golgi remnants remained on the top 3 fractions of the gradient with the density of about 0.8 m sucrose, which is consistent with the density of the Golgi membranes (23Xiang Y. Seemann J. Bisel B. Punthambaker S. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21829-21837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 286-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine which proteins had been recruited into the vesicles, a number of proteins were tested by Western blotting for their distributions in the gradient. Both ARF1 and the β-COP subunit of the coatomer were found in fractions 7–9, indicating the location of the coated vesicles in the gradient, although a subpopulation of both proteins were found on the top of the gradient where the Golgi remnants were enriched (Fig. 2A). Perhaps these were membranes undergoing a budding process. There are indications that the Golgi matrix proteins, which include the Golgin and GRASP families of cisternal stacking proteins (33Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), play a critical role in Golgi structure formation as well as in Golgi inheritance (34Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W1991234732,"The packaging of DNA with histones to form chromatin represents an important and powerful mechanism to regulate gene expression. Critical aspects of chromatin-specific contributions to gene regulation have been revealed by the comparison of the activities from DNA regulatory elements examined both as transiently transfected reporters and stably integrated reporters organized as chromatin. Using the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter as a model, we probed the structural differences between transiently transfected and stably integrated DNA templates. We demonstrated that all four core histones and the linker histone (H1) are associated with the transient template. However, whereas the core histones were present at a similar stoichiometry between the transient and the stable templates, we found that linker histone H1 molecules are fewer on the transient template. By using supercoiling assay, we show that the transient template shows intermediate levels of nucleosomal assembly. Overexpression of H1 resulted in repression of MMTV transcriptional activity and reduced accessibility to restriction endonucleases on the transient MMTV promoter. However, the addition of exogenous H1 failed to impose a normal chromatin structure on the transient template as measured by micrococcal nuclease digestion pattern. Thus, our results suggest that while transiently transfected DNA acquires a full complement of core histones, the underrepresentation of H1 on the transient template is indicative of structural differences between the two templates that may underlie the differences in the mechanisms of activation of the two templates."

Recently, macrothrombocytopenia was described in a number of sitosterolemia patients, linking hematological dysfunction to disturbed sterol metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia is an intrinsic feature of murine sitosterolemia. Abcg5-deficient (Abcg5-/-) mice showed a 68% reduction in platelet count, and platelets were enlarged compared with wild-type controls. Macrothrombocytopenia was not due to decreased numbers of megakaryocytes or their progenitors, but defective megakaryocyte development with deterioration of the demarcation membrane system was evident. Lethally irradiated wild-type mice transplanted with bone marrow from Abcg5-/- mice displayed normal platelets, whereas Abcg5-/- mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow still showed macrothrombocytopenia. Treatment with the sterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe rapidly reversed macrothrombocytopenia in Abcg5-/- mice concomitant with a strong decrease in plasma plant sterols. Thus, accumulation of plant sterols is responsible for development of macrothrombocytopenia in sitosterolemia, and blocking intestinal plant sterol absorption provides an effective means of treatment.

Plant sterols structurally differ from cholesterol only by the presence of an additional methyl or ethyl group at C-24 (campesterol and sitosterol, respectively), in some cases with an additional double bond at C-22 (brassicasterol and stigmasterol, respectively). These structural differences appear to have a major impact on their handling in the body. Despite the fact that regular Western diets contain similar amounts of cholesterol and plant sterols (intakes of ∼200–400 mg/day for both) (1Weihrauch J.L. Gardner J.M. J. Am. Diet. Assoc. 1978; 73: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar), plasma levels of plant sterols are >100 times lower than those of cholesterol in healthy individuals (2Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Geher K. Lipids. 1976; 11: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of effective systems to prevent plant sterol accumulation in the human body. It has become clear that the ATP-binding cassette half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, most abundantly present in intestine and liver, are critically involved herein. ABCG5 and ABCG8 function as an obligate heterodimer and mediate cholesterol and plant sterol transport out of intestinal and hepatic cells (3Graf G.A. Li W.P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A.

Recently, a series of subjects with Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia (low levels of abnormally large platelets) were identified as sitosterolemia patients (17Rees D.C. Iolascon A. Carella M.

Haematol. 2005; 130: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), harboring different known and new mutations in ABCG5 or ABCG8. The mechanism(s) underlying this interesting link between defective sterol metabolism and hematological abnormalities have remained unexplained so far. Here, we describe for the first time that macrothrombocytopenia is also prominent in a murine model of sitosterolemia, i.e. the Abcg5-deficient mouse. Mice lacking Abcg5 show high levels of dietary plant sterols that appear to be associated with defective megakaryocyte development and disturbed formation of the demarcation membrane system, probably underlying defective platelet formation. Macrothrombocytopenia in these mice could not be cured by transplantation of wild-type bone marrow but was rapidly reversed upon decreasing plasma plant sterol levels by treatment with ezetimibe, a clinically used intestinal sterol absorption inhibitor. These data clearly establish that plant sterols, when present in high concentrations, have profound and deleterious effects on platelet biology and therefore on blood coagulation. Animals and Diet—Abcg5-/- mice were generated by Deltagen, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) using standard gene targeting methods (18Plösch T. Bloks V.W. Terasawa Y. Berdy S. Siegler K. van der Sluijs F.

Mice homozygous for disruption of the Abcg5 gene and their heterozygous and wild-type littermates were used as indicated. Mice received standard mouse chow containing 0.017% (w/w) cholesterol (Arie Blok B. V., Woerden, The Netherlands). Where indicated, mice received chow containing 0.005% (w/w) ezetimibe (Ezetrol®, MSD UK, Hertfordshire, UK). All experiments were performed with the approval of the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Groningen. Bone Marrow Transplantation Study—Twenty-four hours after lethal irradiation (9.5 grays, IBL 637 137Cs γ-ray source; CIS Biointernational, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), Abcg5-/- mice and control littermates (11–13 weeks of age) were transplanted with 6 × 106 bone marrow cells isolated from either Abcg5-/- mice or control littermates. PCR analysis of colonies of bone marrow cells revealed that all transplanted mice had reached ≥87.5% chimeras at 12 weeks after transplantation. Agematched, non-irradiated, non-transplanted wild-type and Abcg5-/- littermates were used as controls. Blood Analysis—Blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes upon heart puncture. Subsequently, blood was analyzed using an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XE 2100) for red blood cell counts, mean cellular volume, red blood cell distribution width, hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count. For histology, blood smears were prepared from undiluted blood and stained with Wright-Giemsa stains. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Whole blood was diluted 10 times in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 units/ml EDTA and centrifuged at 200 × g for 7 min to spin down red blood cells. Platelet-rich supernatant was aspirated and centrifuged. Platelets were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse CD41 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min in the dark. Platelets were washed, and size was measured by flow cytometry. In the ezetimibe study (see Fig. 4), platelet count were determined by flow cytometry using reference beads.

Hematol. 1975; 3: 32-43PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 ng/ml recombinant rat stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (supplied by Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany), and 2 units/ml recombinant human erythropoietin. Colonies were scored at day 8. In Vitro Culture of Murine Bone Marrow and Megakaryocytes—Isolated bone marrow cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in serum-free hematopoietic progenitor growth medium (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 100 ng/ml thrombopoietin. After 8 days of culture, proplatelet formation was examined by phase-contrast microscopy. Real-time PCR—The CD41+ cell fraction was purified from spleen cells by MoFlow sorting (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Dead cells were excluded from analysis by gating on forward and sideward light scatter. A total of 100,000 CD41+ cells/mouse (n = 6) were sorted. Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously (22Plösch T. Kruit J.K. Bloks V.W. Huijkman N.C. Havinga R.

Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural analyses of megakaryocytes, spleen was collected and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy as described previously (26Houwerzijl E.J.

Characterization of Macrothrombocytopenia in Abcg5-/- Mice—An Abcg5 deficiency in mice leads to 8- and 37-fold elevated plasma concentrations of campesterol and β-sitosterol, respectively, when the animals are fed normal chow, thus providing a murine model for sitosterolemia (18Plösch T. Bloks V.W. Terasawa Y. Berdy S. Siegler K. van der Sluijs F. Kema I.P. Groen A.K. Shan B. Kuipers F. Schwarz M. Schwartz M.

Interestingly, we observed that Abcg5 deficiency was associated with a strong bleeding tendency during surgery for gallbladder cannulation or jugular vein catheterization. To assess whether the hematological phenotype reported in patients with sitosterolemia (17Rees D.C. Iolascon A. Carella M. O'Marcaigh A.S. Kendra J.R. Jowitt S.N. Wales J.K. Vora A. Makris M.

Cao L. Liu F. Bai X. Ruan C. Haematologica. 2006; 91: 1392-1395PubMed Google Scholar) is also present in Abcg5-/- mice, we analyzed several hematological parameters. Chow-fed Abcg5-/- mice showed severe thrombocytopenia, as blood platelet counts were only 32% of those observed in wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). Platelet size, based on forward scatter, was strongly increased in Abcg5-/- mice (Fig. 1B). Histological analysis confirmed the increased platelet size (Fig. 1C), establishing that Abcg5-/- mice indeed suffer from macrothrombocytopenia. Although no significant differences in red blood cell count and mean cell volume were observed between Abcg5-/- and control mice, these cells were slightly more heterogenous in size in the Abcg5-/- mice (supplemental Table 1). Strongly elevated concentrations of all plant sterols and stanols were detected in washed red blood cell fractions from Abcg5-/- mice compared with control mice, e.g. 16- and 117-fold for campesterol and β-sitosterol, respectively (supplemental Table 2). Despite this, the vulnerability of red blood cells from Abcg5-/- mice to hemolytic actions of micellar bile acid concentrations (supplemental Fig. 1A) and their osmotic fragility (supplemental Fig. 1B) were not affected. Megakaryocyte Differentiation ex Vivo Is Not Affected by Abcg5 Deficiency—Decreased platelet levels in Abcg5-/- mice can theoretically be explained by impaired megakaryocyte differentiation. The decreased platelet levels in Abcg5-/- mice were associated with increased levels of TPO (528 ± 136 versus 338 ± 57 pg/ml in wild-type mice, p < 0.05), which is an important cytokine involved in megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation (28Kaushansky K. Drachman J.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Increased TPO levels in Abcg5-/- mice corresponded with increased numbers of megakaryocyte progenitor cells in their bone marrow (36 ± 1 versus 17 ± 2 megakaryocyte colony-forming units/1 × 105 cells in wild-type mice, p < 0.05). Along with the megakaryocyte progenitors, the granulocyte/monocyte progenitor compartment was slightly increased in Abcg5-/- mice (26 ± 4 versus 20 ± 2 granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units/1 × 105 cells in wild-type mice, n = 3). In addition to bone marrow, megakaryocytes are also present in spleen. The relative weights of the spleens of Abcg5-/- mice were significantly higher than in control mice (5.6 ± 0.5 versus 3.0 ± 0.4 mg/g of body weight in wild-type mice, p < 0.05). Histological analysis revealed increased numbers of megakaryocytes to be present in the spleens of Abcg5-/- mice (data not shown), which was confirmed by flow cytometry (19.2 ± 4.7% versus 11.0 ± 6.2% CD41+ cells in wild-type mice, p < 0.05). Analysis of spleen megakaryocytes (CD41+ cells) showed no difference in DNA ploidy distribution (data not shown). In vitro culture of these megakaryocytes in the presence of TPO but in the absence of plant sterols showed that megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice were capable of forming proplatelet structures within 8 days, similar to cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). Abcg5 Deficiency Leads to Altered Cholesterol Homeostasis in the Megakaryocyte—Although Abcg5-/- mice showed no alterations in in vitro megakaryocyte differentiation, expression of cholesterol transporter genes in freshly harvested CD41+ cells from the spleen was significantly affected. The mRNA expression levels of the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes Abca1 and Abcg1, both involved in the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to high density lipoprotein particles, were decreased in megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice by 60 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 1E). Abcg5 and Abcg8 mRNA levels were below detection limits (Ct > 40) in megakaryocytes from wild-type mice. Expression of SR-BI, involved in cholesterol ester uptake from high density lipoprotein, and of the low density lipoprotein receptor, involved in low density lipoprotein particle uptake and therefore in cholesterol internalization, was increased by 68 and 185%, respectively, in megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice. The megakaryocyte mRNA levels of the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, were not affected by Abcg5 deficiency. Loss of Abcg5 Leads to Altered Megakaryocyte Structure—Electron microscopic evaluation was performed on spleen megakaryocytes from wild-type and Abcg5-/- mice (Fig. 2, A–F). Spleen megakaryocytes from wild-type mice showed the characteristic morphological features (Fig. 2A) with an extensive, open demarcation membrane system (DMS) (Fig. 2B). Megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice demonstrated an immature appearance with swollen mitochondria and multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2, D and E) and a clear perturbation of the DMS (Fig. 2, cf. B and E). In addition, in Abcg5-/- mice, the presence of extremely large platelets, which were frequently without granulae, was noted at their site of formation in spleen (Fig. 2, cf. C and F). High Plant Sterol Levels Are the Cause of Macrothrombocytopenia—To determine whether the macrothrombocytopenia in the Abcg5-/- mice resulted directly from Abcg5 deficiency or indirectly from the prevailing high plant sterol levels, bone marrow transplantation experiments were performed. Wild-type and Abcg5-/- mice were lethally irradiated and received 1-day post-irradiation bone marrow cells from either Abcg5-/- (Abcg5-/- → WT) or wild-type (WT → Abcg5-/-) donor mice. To ensure full recovery from the transplantation, blood, bone marrow, and spleen cells were analyzed at 12 weeks after transplantation. No weight differences were noted between the transplanted Abcg5-/- (WT → Abcg5-/-) and wild-type (Abcg5-/- → WT) mice or when the transplanted animals were compared with non-irradiated, non-transplanted wild-type and Abcg5-/- mice. Transplanted wild-type mice showed a small decrease in platelet numbers compared with non-transplanted wild-type mice (Fig. 3A); however, the platelets did not significantly differ in size (Fig. 3B). Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells could not rescue the macrothrombocytopenia seen in Abcg5-/- mice, as platelet levels were severely decreased, and platelet size was markedly increased in transplanted Abcg5-/- mice at 12 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 3, A and B), although not to the same extent as observed in Abcg5-/- control mice. These data strongly indicate that the absence of Abcg5 is not the primary cause of macrothrombocytopenia but that the high plant sterol levels as such affect megakaryocyte development. Ezetimibe Corrects Sitosterolemia-associated Macrothrombocytopenia in Mice—Treatment of sitosterolemia subjects (29Salen G. von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Kwiterovich P. Kane J. Patel S.B. Musliner T.

To evaluate whether ezetimibe can reduce murine sitosterolemia-associated macrothrombocytopenia, Abcg5-/- and heterozygous littermates that did not display sitosterolemia were treated with the drug (0.005% (w/w) in diet) (23Grefhorst A.

Ezetimibe treatment led to a sharp increase in platelet numbers (Fig. 4A) and a strong reduction in platelet size (Fig. 4B) within 1 week and to a full normalization of the first parameter within the 18-day treatment period. The latter coincided with a strong decrease (-64%) of plasma β-sitosterol sterol levels (Fig. 4C). Elevated plasma concentrations of other plant sterols and stanols in Abcg5-/- mice, i.e. campesterol, brassicasterol, stigmasterol, campestanol, and sitostanol, were reduced to similar extents (Table 1). Likewise, the already low plant sterol levels in the heterozygous mice were reduced by ezetimibe to very low levels (Fig. 4C and Table 1) without additional effects on platelet numbers or size (Fig. 4, A and B).TABLE 1Comparison of plasma cholesterol, plant sterol, and plant stanol concentrations in the plasma of Abcg5+/– and Abcg5–/– mice before and after treatment with ezetimibe for 18 days.

After treatment, the spleen megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice showed an increase in maturity with a more open DMS and the presence of normally sized platelets that contained granulae as revealed by electron microscopic evaluation (data not shown). However, not all abnormalities present in the megakaryocytes from Abcg5-/- mice (see Fig. 2) were corrected by ezetimibe, in line with the fact that plant sterol levels were still elevated in comparison with control values. Using an established mouse model of sitosterolemia (18Plösch T. Bloks V.W. Terasawa Y. Berdy S. Siegler K. van der Sluijs F. Kema I.P. Groen A.K. Shan B. Kuipers F. Schwarz M. Schwartz M. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 290-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we have shown that high levels of dietary plant sterols have profound and deleterious effects on platelet formation. Abcg5-deficient mice showed severely decreased platelet counts and a grossly increased platelet size, implying that these mice suffer from macrothrombocytopenia analogous to the situation described recently in sitosterolemia patients (17Rees D.C. Iolascon A. Carella M. O'Marcaigh A.S. Kendra J.R. Jowitt S.N. Wales J.K. Vora A. Makris M. Manning N. Nicolaou A. Fisher J. Mann A. Machin S.J. Clayton P.T. Gasparini P. Stewart G.W. Br. J.

Macrothrombocytopenia was not due to decreased numbers of megakaryocytes or their progenitors, as these cells were abundantly present in the bone marrow and spleens of Abcg5-/- mice, presumably as a consequence of high TPO levels. The disturbed platelet formation is likely caused by plant sterol-induced changes in megakaryocyte development, including deterioration of the DMS. We have documented that this phenotype is related to the prevailing high plant sterol levels rather than to the loss of Abcg5. First, megakaryocytes isolated from Abcg5-deficient mice were fully capable of proplatelet formation when cultured in vitro in the absence of plant sterols. Second, lethally irradiated wild-type mice that received bone marrow from Abcg5-/- mice displayed normal platelets, whereas Abcg5-/- mice harboring wild-type bone marrow still showed macrothrombocytopenia. Third and most important, treatment with the sterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe rapidly reversed macrothrombocytopenia in Abcg5-/- mice concomitant with a strong reduction in plasma plant sterol levels. These data unequivocally demonstrate that the accumulation of plant sterols in sitosterolemia is responsible for development of macrothrombocytopenia and that prevention of intestinal plant sterol absorption provides an effective means to treat this complication of the disease. Plant sterols are currently widely employed as a dietary supplement to lower plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemia subject"
https://openalex.org/W2062161492,"The Ser/Thr kinase ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) has been demonstrated to phosphorylate transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP-responsive-binding protein) and histone H3 in response to mitogenic stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF activates the MEK/ERK pathway to activate RSK2. We recently reported that receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) directly tyrosine phosphorylates RSK2 at Tyr-529, which consequently regulates RSK2 activation by facilitating inactive ERK binding to RSK2 that is required for ERK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of RSK2 (Kang, S., Dong, S., Gu, T. L., Guo, A., Cohen, M. S., Lonial, S., Khoury, H. J., Fabbro, D., Gilliland, D. G., Bergsagel, P. L., Taunton, J., Polakiewicz, R. D., and Chen, J. (2007) Cancer Cell 12, 201–214). Here we report that upon treatment of EGF, RSK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-529 and activated in 293T and COS7 cells that do not express FGFR3. In contrast to FGFR3, the receptor tyrosine kinase EGF receptor did not directly phosphorylate RSK2 at Tyr-529 in an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant RSK2 and active EGF receptor or FGFR3. By mass spectroscopy-based studies, we identified Src tyrosine kinase family members Src and Fyn as upstream kinases of RSK2 Tyr-529. Treatment of Src inhibitor PP2 effectively attenuated EGF-dependent activation and Tyr-529 phosphorylation of RSK2, suggesting that Src family members are the kinases that phosphorylate RSK2 at Tyr-529 in response to EGF. Src and Fyn were able to directly phosphorylate RSK2 at Tyr-529 in the in vitro kinase assay. In vitro reconstitution of Tyr-529 phosphorylation by Src in glutathione S-transferase-tagged RSK2 enhanced inactive ERK binding to RSK2 wild type, but not the Y529F mutant. Together, our findings suggest that Src-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-529 facilitates inactive ERK binding to RSK2, which might be a general requirement for RSK2 activation by EGF through the MEK/ERK pathway.

The Ser/Thr kinase RSK2 is a substrate of ERK and belongs to a family containing four members, RSK1–4. RSK2 has been implicated to play an active role in EGF-dependent transcriptional activation by phosphorylation and regulation of the transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP-responsive binding protein) (3Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser-133 dictates the ability of CREB to interact with the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) that mediates functional contacts with the basal transcriptional machinery (3Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). RSK2 is also required for EGF-activated phosphorylation of histone H3, which contributes to chromatin remodeling during mitosis and transcriptional activation (4Strelkov I.S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 75-78PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D.

Among the four RSK family members, RSK2 is so far the best characterized. RSK2 contains two distinct kinase domains, both of which are catalytically functional (reviewed in Refs. 6Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 7Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The C-terminal kinase domain (CTD) is responsible for autophosphorylation at Ser-386 that is critical in RSK activation, whereas the N-terminal kinase domain is believed to phosphorylate exogenous substrates of RSK (8Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of RSK2 activation remains elusive. The current model suggests that ERK-dependent activation of RSK2 involves a series of sequential events. First, inactive ERK binds to the C terminus of RSK2 in quiescent cells, and this interaction is an absolute requirement for activation of RSK2 (9Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Second, when stimulating signal such as mitogen comes, ERK is activated and phosphorylates RSK2 at Thr-577 in the activation loop of the CTD domain and Ser-369 and Thr-365 in the linker region between the two kinase domains, leading to activation of the RSK2 CTD domain. Third, activation of CTD domain results in autophosphorylation of Ser-386 in the linker region, which provides a docking site for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (12Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). PDK1 in turn phosphorylates Ser-227 in the activation loop of the N-terminal kinase domain, allowing RSK2 to phosphorylate its downstream targets (13Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Last, activated N-terminal kinase domain auto-phosphorylates Ser-749 at the C-terminal domain of RSK2, which results in dissociation of active ERK from RSK2 (11Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that FGFR3 signals through activation of RSK2 to provide proliferative and pro-survival signals in human t(4;14) multiple myeloma cells with dysregulated expression of FGFR3 (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We proposed that FGFR3 activates RSK2 by a two-step model in which, in addition to FGFR3-mediated activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, FGFR3 directly phosphorylates RSK2 at Tyr-529, which regulates the ERK-dependent activation of the serine/threonine kinase RSK2 by allowing inactive ERK to bind RSK2 in the initial step (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 of RSK2 is a specific requirement of FGFR3 signaling in hematopoietic cells or whether this might represent a more general mechanism for RSK2 activation. Here we report that upon treatment of EGF, RSK2 is tyrosine phosphorylated at Tyr-529 and activated in 293T and COS7 cells that do not express FGFR3. However, this phosphorylation was not mediated directly by activated receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR but by Src tyrosine kinase family members. Phosphorylation at Tyr-529 by Src facilitates ERK binding to RSK2, which represents a general requirement for RSK2 activation by EGF through the MEK/ERK pathway. Cells and Reagents–293T and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies against EGF, phospho-RSK (Ser-380), Pyk2, JAK2, ERK1/2, and Src were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA). Specific antibody against phospho-RSK2 (Tyr-529) was generated and provided by Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Tyr antibody (pY99) and antibodies against EGFR, RSK2 and Fyn were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against GST, HA, and β-actin were from Sigma. Src inhibitor PP2 was from Calbiochem. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B and protein G-conjugated agarose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant active Src and Fyn were from Invitrogen. YOP tyrosine phosphatase was obtained from New England Biolab (Ipswich, MA). Constructs harboring various tyrosine kinases were kindly provided by Dr. Keqiang Ye, Emory University. Mass Spectrometry-based Studies–2–3 × 106 293T cells that were transiently transfected by both GST-tagged RSK2 and various tyrosine kinases were lysed 24 h post-transfection. GST-tagged RSK2 was enriched by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in a GST pulldown assay and applied to SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. RSK2 protein bands were excised and treated with trypsin, followed by analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (Cell Signaling Technology). Tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner with an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). In Vitro Kinase Assay–Recombinant RSK2 CTD and Y529F RSK2 CTD were purified as previously described (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G.

Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant RSK2 CTD variants (250 ng) were incubated with recombinant active Src or Fyn (250 ng) in the 1× kinase reaction buffer (60 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 3 μm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation of Tyr-529 RSK2 was detected by the specific phospho-antibody from Cell Signaling Technology. In Vitro Reconstitution of RSK2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation by Src–The in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation reconstitution assay was performed as previously described (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In brief, 293T cells transiently transfected with GST-tagged RSK2 constructs were lysed and GST-RSK2 variants were pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, followed by protein tyrosine phosphatase treatment at 30 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed and applied to the in vitro kinase assay with active Src kinase at 30 °C for 30 min as described above. The treated beads were washed and incubated with 293T cell lysates pretreated with 10 μm U0126 for 2 h, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RSK2 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-529 and Activated in 293T and COS7 Cells upon EGF Stimulation–We recently reported a novel two-step model that leukemogenic FGFR3 activates RSK2 by both assisting inactive ERK binding via tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2 at Tyr-529 and activating the MEK/ERK pathway (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutation at Tyr-529 resulted in decreased inactive ERK binding and consequently decreased ERK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of RSK2 (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 is a common mechanism for ERK-dependent activation of RSK2, we examined the phosphorylation status of RSK2 in response to EGF stimulation. Using a specific phospho-RSK2 antibody (Tyr-529) (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we observed that upon EGF treatment, RSK2 was tyrosine phosphorylated at Tyr-529 and activated as assessed by Ser-386 phosphorylation, which is an index of RSK2 activation, in 293T cells that do not express FGFR3 (Fig. 1). We also observed that treatment with MEK1 inhibitor U0126 effectively inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation at RSK2 Ser-386 in 293T cells but had no effects on Tyr-529 phosphorylation (Fig. 1), suggesting that EGF-dependent activation of RSK2 requires ERK activation. Similar results were obtained using COS7 cells (data not shown). EGF Treatment Promotes Inactive ERK Binding to RSK2–We have demonstrated the phosphorylation at Tyr-529 facilitates inactive ERK binding to RSK2 (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We next performed a GST pulldown assay in which the bead-bound GST-tagged RSK2 was incubated with U0126-pretreated 293T cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2, EGF induced Tyr-529 phosphorylation of GST-tagged RSK2 along with increased inactive ERK binding, compared with GST or GST-tagged RSK2 from cells in the absence of EGF treatment. Together, these data suggest that EGF-dependent Tyr-529 phosphorylation may be involved in regulation of ERK binding to RSK2 in 293T and COS7 cells that is independent of FGFR3, suggesting the existence of alternative tyrosine kinase(s). EGFR Does Not Directly Phosphorylate RSK2 at Tyr-529–Because FGFR3 directly phosphorylates RSK2 at Tyr-529 (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that EGFR as a receptor tyrosine kinase may similarly phosphorylate RSK2. We performed an in vitro kinase assay in which purified recombinant RSK2 CTD proteins (rRSK2 CTD) and RSK2 Tyr-529 mutant proteins were incubated with recombinant EGFR or FGFR3 that are constitutively activated. We observed that recombinant active EGFR was not able to phosphorylate rRSK2 CTD at Tyr-529 in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3). In contrast, active recombinant FGFR3 directly phosphorylates rRSK2 CTD as previously reported (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation was abolished in the rRSK2 Y529F mutant. EGF-induced Tyr-529 Phosphorylation Is Mediated by Src Family Members Including Src and Fyn–To identify the potential upstream tyrosine kinases of RSK2, we next performed mass spectrometry-based studies. Plasmids encoding GST-RSK2 and distinct tyrosine kinases, including HA-tagged focal adhesion kinase, HA-tagged active form of Fyn, FynA (Y528F), HA-tagged active form of Src, SrcA (Y527F), Pyk2, or a constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinase TEL-JAK2, were transiently co-transfected into 293T cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the bead-bound GST-tagged RSK2 were probed by a pan-phospho-Tyr antibody (pY99). We observed that overexpression of active Src and Fyn resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2. In contrast, RSK2 was not significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells co-transfected with focal adhesion kinase, Pyk2, or TEL-JAK2 (Fig. 4A). The RSK2 protein bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and digested with trypsin, followed by mass spectrometry-based analysis. We identified that RSK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated at a group of tyrosine sites (Table 1), including Tyr-529 (spectra presented in Fig. 4B), due to expression of the constitutively activated Src and Fyn.TABLE 1Tyrosine-phosphorylated residues of RSK2 by Src and Fyn in mass spectroscopy-based studiesRSK2 Tyr(P)Sequence containing Tyr(P) (*)Frequency of detection (Src)Frequency of detection (Fyn)Tyr-483DVY*DDGKYVYVVTELMK11Tyr-488DVYDDGKY*VYVVTELMK52Tyr-529TVEY*LHAQGVVHR11Tyr-644FSLSGGY*WNSVSDTAK12Tyr-707GAMAATY*SALNR57Tyr-470Y*GQHPNIITLK11Tyr-580AENGLLMTPCY*TANFVAPEVLK21 Open table in a new tab We next tested whether Tyr-529 is a major phosphorylation site of Src, along with the other two most frequent phosphorylation sites of RSK2 by Src or Fyn, Tyr-488 and Tyr-707 as controls, which were identified by mass spectrometry-based studies (Table 1). We performed Western blotting experiments to determine whether mutation at Tyr-488, Tyr-529, or Tyr-707 would significantly decrease the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of RSK2 by Src. The results showed that Tyr-488 is a major site of Src but mutations at Tyr-529 or Tyr-707 did not significantly decrease Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2 (Fig. 4C). However, we have previously characterized the Tyr-488 site that is also phosphorylated by FGFR3 (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and substitution of Tyr-488 did not affect RSK2 activation. In contrast, mutation at Tyr-529 significantly attenuated RSK2 activation, suggesting that Tyr-529, but not Tyr-488, contributes to regulation of RSK2 activation (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Treatment of PP2, a Specific Inhibitor of Src Family Members, Effectively Attenuates RSK2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation at Tyr-529 and Activation in 293T Cells Stimulated by EGF–We next tested whether Src is involved in EGF-dependent Tyr-529 phosphorylation of RSK2. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5, treatment of PP2, an inhibitor of Src family members, effectively decreased the phosphorylation level of RSK2 at Tyr-529 in response to EGF in 293T cells, as well as activation of RSK2 as assessed by the attenuated Ser-386 phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained using COS7 cells (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that Src tyrosine kinase family members are downstream signal transducers of EGF and involved in EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 and activation of RSK2. Src and Fyn Directly Phosphorylate RSK2 at Tyr-529–Next we examined whether Src-or Fyn-dependent RSK2 Tyr-529 phosphorylation occurs in cells. By using the specific phospho-RSK2 antibody (Tyr-529), we observed that GST-tagged RSK2 WT, but not Y529F mutant, were specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-529 in 293T cells expressing constitutively activated SrcA or FynA (Fig. 6). We then determined whether Src or Fyn phosphorylates RSK2 directly at Tyr-529 or indirectly by activating other tyrosine kinases. Purified recombinant rRSK2 CTD or CTD Y529F proteins were incubated with recombinant active Src or Fyn (rSrc or rFyn, respectively) that are constitutively activated (Invitrogen). As shown in Fig. 7, wild-type RSK2 CTD domain was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-529 by rSrc or rFyn, whereas Tyr-529 phosphorylation was abolished in the RSK2 CTD Y529F mutant. Phosphorylation of RSK2 at Tyr-529 by Src Facilitates Inactive ERK Binding–We next tested whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2 at Tyr-529 by Src precedes the inactive ERK binding to RSK2. We performed a GST pulldown assay in which the bead-bound GST-tagged RSK2 WT or Y529F mutant proteins were first dephosphorylated by protein tyrosine phosphatase to remove tyrosine phosphorylation and then treated with recombinant active rSrc, followed by incubation with U0126-treated 293T cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 8A, Tyr-529 phosphorylation was reconstituted in GST-RSK2 along with increased inactive ERK binding upon Src treatment compared with GST-RSK2 in the absence of Src treatment. However, substitution of Tyr-529, but not Tyr-488, abolished Src-dependent Tyr-529 phosphorylation and resulted in decreased ERK binding to Y529F mutant, compared with RSK2 WT and the control Y488F mutant in the presence of Src (Fig. 8B). We have previously demonstrated that the global structure as well as the intrinsic kinase property of the Y529F mutant protein were not altered compared with RSK2 WT and thus the decreased inactive ERK binding of RSK2 Y529F mutant is not due to structural alterations (14Kang S. Dong S. Gu T.L. Guo A. Cohen M.S. Lonial S. Khoury H.J. Fabbro D. Gilliland D.G. Bergsagel P.L. Taunton J. Polakiewicz R.D. Chen J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Together, our data support a novel model composed of a series of sequential events by which EGF activates RSK2 and mediates mitogenic signals in mammalian cells. The first event involves tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 of RSK2 by Src family members including Src or Fyn, but not EGFR, in response to EGF, which facilitates binding of the inactive form of ERK to RSK2 in the initial step of ERK-dependent RSK2 activation (Fig. 9). This binding, which is required for phosphorylation and activation of RSK2 by ERK, in turn promotes the next step where ERK is activated via the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway downstream of EGF, leading to ERK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of RSK2. When RSK2 is activated, active ERK readily dissociates from RSK2 (11Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). Our findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2 at Tyr-529 in response to EGF is mediated indirectly by Src tyrosine kinase family members, not directly by the activated receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR. In contrast, FGFR3 directly phosphorylates RSK2 at Tyr-529, and this phosphorylation is independent of Src due to our observation that treatment of Src inhibitor PP2 had no effects on FGFR3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of RSK2 at Tyr-529 in cells (data not shown). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 of RSK2 might represent a general mechanism for ERK-dependent activation of RSK2 in response to the mitogenic stimuli, including EGF. Tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-529 may provide an additional docking site to promote the binding of inactive ERK to the C terminus of RSK2, or stabilize such binding. Further detailed structural studies are warranted to illuminate this process."

Several lines of evidence herein described indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of InvE expression plays a key role in the temperature-dependent regulation of virulence gene expression: (i) a considerable amount of invE mRNA continues to be transcribed under low temperature conditions, where the production of InvE protein is tightly repressed; (ii) the stability of invE mRNA markedly decreases, because its decay rate is significantly increased under the repressing conditions. Strikingly, in the hfq mutant of Shigella sonnei, a considerable amount of InvE protein was produced even at low temperature. This increase in the InvE level was found to be associated with the improved stability of invE mRNA, in agreement with the finding that the RNA chaperon Hfq influences post-transcriptional regulations of various genes. Consistently, overexpression of the Hfq protein decreased the production of InvE protein even under the expressing condition at 37 °C. The binding in vitro of purified Hfq protein to invE RNA was shown to be stronger at 30 °C than at 37 °C in two experiments, gel shift analysis and surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) analysis.

The expression of TTSS is tightly regulated by temperature in such a way that it is high at 37 °C but not at 30 °C (1Maurelli A.T. Sansonetti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This regulation apparently fits the life cycle of Shigella, because the expression of virulence genes is needed for its invasion and propagation in host animals, but the expression of virulence genes might be a potential burden for its survival in natural environment. Type III secretion system isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside reverse transcription. Type III secretion system isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside reverse transcription. The TTSS-associated genes of Shigella are encoded on the virulence plasmid and controlled by two regulator proteins VirF and InvE (VirB) (3Kato J. Ito K. Nakamura A. Watanabe H. Infect.

VirF, an AraC type transcriptional regulator, activates transcription of the invE (virB) gene (3Kato J. Ito K. Nakamura A. Watanabe H. Infect.

Kato J. Nakamura A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 619-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with DNA binding activity (8Taniya T. Mitobe J. Nakayama S. Mingshan Q. Okuda K. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5158-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), activates transcription of the mxi-spa and ipa genes encoding TTSS components by replacement of a global repressor H-NS, a histone-like DNA-binding protein (9Beloin C. Dorman C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the temperature-dependent regulation of TTSS (10Dorman C.J. Porter M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For instance, a mutation of the hns gene in Shigella flexneri was reported to result in increased TTSS expression at the repressing temperature 30 °C (11Dorman C.J. Bhriain N.N. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 344: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The H-NS protein is now accepted as one of the key factors for temperature-dependent gene expression in various Gram-negative bacterias through the structural change of its oligomer formation at high temperature (12Ono S. Goldberg M.D. Olsson T. Esposito D. Hinton J.C. Ladbury J.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In fact, the hns mutation increases the expression of virF promoter-lacZ fusion, and the addition of H-NS protein into the in vitro transcription system results in decreased transcription from the virF promoter in a temperature-dependent manner (13Falconi M. Colonna B. Prosseda G. Micheli G. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7033-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the contrary, detailed analysis for transcription in vivo of virF and invE genes indicated that significant amounts of virF and invE mRNA are transcribed, albeit at a reduced level, at 30 °C in both wild-type S. flexneri and hns mutant at various growth phases (14Porter M.E. Dorman C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6537-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we isolated a cpxA mutant, in which the expression of TTSS genes was significantly decreased. Characterization of the cpxA mutant revealed that the expression of InvE protein is controlled at the post-transcriptional level. Analysis with both transcriptional and translational fusion of invE-lacZ reporter plasmids showed that a sufficient amount of invE mRNA is transcribed, but the protein expression is repressed in the cpxA mutant (15Mitobe J. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finding of the post-transcriptional regulation in InvE expression allowed us to reexamine the transcription of the invE gene under the repressing condition at 30 °C. Using the invE-lacZ transcriptional fusion plasmid, a considerable level of β-galactosidase activity was detected at 30 °C, but with use of the invE translational fusion plasmid, a similar level of the β-galactosidase activity was not detected at 30 °C. Taking the results together, we propose the concept of post-transcriptional regulation for InvE expression. Supporting this model, an RNA chaperone, Hfq, was found to exert marked influence on the expression of the invE gene. Sequencing—The hfq gene of Shigella sonnei HW383 was sequenced by ABI-PRISM™ 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using oligonucleotide primers (see supplemental Table S1) hfq1 and hfq2. The sequenced hfq gene in S. sonnei HW383 was identical to that of Escherichia coli K-12 strain, submitted to the DNA sequence data base DDBJ™ with the accession number AB293541. The upstream region of virF gene in S. sonnei HW383 was sequenced using oligonucleotide primers virF1 and virF2 (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AB300612). The sequence containing a putative transposase was fully identical to that of S. sonnei strain Ss046 (nucleotides 38934-37955 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number CP000039) and Shigella boydii strain Sb227 (nucleotides 37617-38596 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number CP000037).

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11136) Google Scholar) using the primers hfq3 and hfq4. The amplified DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and XbaI, ligated into the plasmid pTrc99A (17Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J.

The same DNA sequence was amplified with primers hfq5 and hfq6. The amplified DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI, ligated into the plasmid pET22b (Novagen, Madison, WI) without the addition of the histidine-tag sequence to produce pET-hfq. For construction of pBAD-invE, the invE sequence (nucleotides 209-1190 of Genbank™/EBI Data Bank accession number M33790) was amplified using oligonucleotide primers invE1 and invE2. The amplified DNA product was digested with the restriction enzymes NheI and HindIII, ligated into the plasmid pBAD24 (18Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) (Genbank™/EBI Data Bank Accession number X81837) to produce pBAD-invE. The integrity of the sequences in the above plasmids were checked by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 310 DNA sequencer. All primers were synthesized by Grainer Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Construction of Mutant Strains—For the construction of deletion mutants for hfq, hns, and invE genes, a PCR-based gene disruption technique was applied for wild-type S. sonnei strain MS390 as described previously (15Mitobe J. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The kanamycin-resistant gene cassette was removed as described (16Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11136) Google Scholar). Integrity of the nonpolar deletion sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For construction of the hfq::aphA deletion mutants of S. sonnei MS4835 and S. flexneri MF4835, a three-step PCR-based gene disruption technique (19Derbise A. Lesic B. Dacheux D. Ghigo J.M. Carniel E. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 38: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was applied for both wild-type strains of S. sonnei MS390 and S. flexneri 2457T (20Wei J. Goldberg M.B. Burland V. Venkatesan M.M. Deng W. Fournier G. Mayhew G.F. Plunkett G. II I Rose D.J. Darling A. Mau B. Perna N.T. Payne S.M. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Zhou S. Schwartz D.C. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2775-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), respectively, using primers hfqU1, hfqU2, hfqD1, and hfqD2. A kanamycin-resistant gene cassette aphA was amplified from pTH18ks5 (21Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yamaguchi M. Yasojima K. Tsujimura A. Wakabayashi Y. Watanabe Y. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 241: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using Km1 and Km2 primers. For construction of the S. sonnei pinvE::paraBAD mutant MS5512, a modification of the three-step PCR-based gene replacement technique (22Roux A. Beloin C. Ghigo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was applied for MS390 using invEU1, invEU2, invED1, and invED2 primers. The gene cassette, composed of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, the araC repressor, and the promoter region for the araBAD operon (nucleotides 70188-71339 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AP009048.1), was amplified from an E. coli strain BW25113 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-araC (22Roux A. Beloin C. Ghigo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using the araC1 and araC2 primers (see Fig. 2A). After construction of all mutants, the presence of the virulence plasmid that encodes the form I antigen was confirmed by agglutination with diagnostic antiserum for S. sonnei (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) or PCR of the invE gene for S. flexneri 2457T using primers invE1 and invE2. At least two independent deletion mutants were constructed for each deletion, which showed the same results for all experiments.

Concentrations of antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 12.5 μg/ml; rifampicin, 200 μg/ml (Sigma). Usage of antibiotics is specified by the figure legends for each experiment. For all experiments, each strain was inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking (150 rpm) in a water bath. The precultures were diluted 50-fold for the 30 °C culture and 100-fold for the 37 °C culture to give similar incubation periods (2.5-3 h) in a pair of 5-ml fresh LB medium samples. The samples were incubated at both 30 and 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm, monitored for turbidity at 600 nm by a spectrophotometer (Spectronic™ 20+, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and harvested at A600 = 0.8. Each 50 μl of the whole culture was used for measurement of β-galactosidase activities as previously described (23Miller J.H. 3rd Ed. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar), or 10 μl of the whole culture was subjected to Western blotting with 10% SDS-PAGE as previously described (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002Google Scholar). IpaB and InvE proteins were detected by anti-IpaB monoclonal antibody (25Ito K. Nakajima T. Sasaki T. Watanabe H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 35: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) or anti-InvE polyclonal antibody (15Mitobe J. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hfq and H-NS proteins were detected as previously described (26Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 27Jishage M. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4953-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Detection—Each 2 ml of the whole culture was quickly mixed with 150 μl of 5% (v/v) water-saturated phenol in ethanol (28Bhagwat A.A. Phadke R.P. Wheeler D. Kalantre S. Gudipati M. Bhagwat M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2003; 55: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The bacterial cells were immediately collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and total RNA was purified by 1 ml of a phenol containing the RNA extraction reagent ISOGEN™ (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). For measurement of invE mRNA stability, S. sonnei strains were inoculated into 35 ml of LB medium without antibiotics and allowed to grow until A600 reached 0.8. After rifampicin (Sigma) was added to give a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, the culture continued to incubate at the initial temperature. An aliquot of the cultures (2 ml) was harvested every 2 min for preparation of RNA samples. The total RNA pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of nuclease-free water (Invitrogen) and measured for the concentration by spectrophotometer ND-1000™ (Nano-Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The concentration of the RNA samples was adjusted to 50 ng/μl, and then the residual DNA was digested by TURBO DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C. For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, each 100 ng of total RNA was amplified by Titan™ one-tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science). Conditions for RT-PCR were as follows: 60 °C for 30 min; 94 °C for 2 min; and 26 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. For detection of virF mRNA and 6 S RNA, two additional cycles (for a total of 28 cycles) of PCR were employed. Primers used for RT-PCR for virF mRNA were virF-RT1 and virF-RT2. Primers used for invE transcript were invE-RT1 and invE-RT2. Primers used for RT-PCR for 6 S RNA transcript were ssrS-RT1 and ssrS-RT2. Each 10 μl of the PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For real time PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA in 10 μl of Transcriptor™ first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 60 °C. Each cDNA was analyzed in a triplicated manner by ABI Prism 2000 thirmal cycler with a Perfect real time™ PCR kit (Takara Japan) in a 25-μl reaction containing 2 μl of cDNA, 120 nm concentration each of invE84F, invE156R, ssrS36F, and ssrS72R primers, and a 32 nm concentration each of invE100T and ssrS65T Taqman™ probes. Samples were amplified by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 31 s. Primers and Taqman™ probes were designed by ABI PRISM primer design software and synthesized by ABI Japan. The amounts of invE mRNA and 6 S RNA were determined by ABI prism evaluation software using a standard curve provided by five serial dilutions of cDNA from the sample of time 0 at 37 °C. The amount of invE-mRNA was normalized by the amount of 6 S RNA transcript as an internal control. Relative values against the sample of time 0 at 37 °C were blotted on the semilog plot. The RNA preparation and real time PCR analysis were repeated three times, and similar trends of results were obtained. Invasion Assay—Bacterial invasion into HeLa cells was tested using the gentamicin protection assay. Overnight precultures (2 ml of LB-ampicillin) were inoculated in 5 ml of brain-heart infusion broth (Difco). After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 or 1 mm, and the incubation was continued for an additional 80 min at 37 °C. HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips to 60% confluence in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were then infected with bacteria grown in BHI at 37 °C at a multiplicity of infection of 100 per cell and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. After cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 20 min, gentamicin (Wako) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and cells were incubated further at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 15 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. A 100-μl aliquot of the lysates was plated onto LB plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies grown on LB plates were counted. For the reliability of results, each sample determination was performed in triplicate. The result of a representative assay is shown in Table 2.TABLE 2Efficiency of invasionBacterial strainIPTGNumber of invasionsmmHW50600MS3900114 ± 16MS4831 (pTrc99A)0.1538 ± 118MS4831 (pTrc99A)1518 ± 165MS4831 (pTrc-hfq)0.1228 ± 22MS4831 (pTrc-hfq)1141 ± 54 Open table in a new tab Purification of Hfq Protein—An E. coli strain, BL21(DE3), carrying pET-hfq was grown in 1 liter of LB medium 37 °C for 4 h as described (26Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33105-33113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Hfq protein was purified with a 10-ml bed volume of Buthyl-Toyopeal™-650 hydrophobic interaction medium (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) in a 35-ml Econo Column™ (Bio-Rad) using an Econo System™ gradient maker (Bio-Rad) as described (29Vassilieva I.M. Rouzanov M.V. Zelinskaya N.V. Moll I. Blasi U. Garber M.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Analysis—Two RNA probes encoding 75- and 140-nucleotide invE sequences from the transcription start site were prepared by in vitro transcription of T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The DNA templates for the T7 transcription were prepared by PCR amplification of the invE sequence in MS390 with primer pairs of invE-T7F and invE75R (for the 75-nucleotide RNA) or invE-T7F and invE140R (for the 140-nucleotide RNA). The T7 transcription mixtures were treated by RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for digestion of the DNA template at 37 °C 15 min and purified by phenol/chloroform and a Nuc-away™ spin column (Ambion). The 5′-end of purified RNA was dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase in the Kinase Max™ labeling kit (Ambion), and 2 pmol of the RNA was labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (catalog number AA0018; GE Healthcare) with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the kit. The labeled RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform and a Nuc-away™ spin column (Ambion) equilibrated with an RNA binding buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (30Afonyushkin T. Vecerek B. Moll I. Blasi U. Kaberdin V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1678-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Each 20 fmol of the labeled RNA was used for probes of gel shift analysis. Hfq protein (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 nm calculated for the Hfq hexamer) was mixed with the probe in 10 μl of the RNA binding buffer at 30 or 37 °C for 10 min. Then the samples were mixed with 2 μl of 5× hi-Density TBE Sample Buffer™ (catalog number LC6678; Invitrogen), subjected to electrophoresis with 6% Novex™ DNA retardation gel (catalog number EC63652; Invitrogen) in 0.5× TBE at 30 °C for 80 min or 37 °C for 70 min. Electrophoresis was performed in an XCell SureLock™ mini-cell electrophoresis tank (catalog number EI0001) with a glass circulation pipe from Nihon Eido Co. (Tokyo, Japan), which was placed in a water bath with a circulation pump (Haake, Germany), heated at the indicated temperature. The gel was fixed by 10% methanol, 10% acetate and dried on filter paper. The signals on the gel were visualized on x-ray film RX-U (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) with an intensifying screen at -80 °C for 4-16 h. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) Analysis—The Biacore 2000 system and sensor chip SA (research grade; Biacore International AB) were used for the binding assay. For preparation of the RNA-immobilized sensor tip, 2 pmol of the in vitro transcribed invE RNA used for gel shift analysis (140 nucleotides) were labeled with 0.2 mm biotin-11-ATP (catalog number NEL544; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by 1 unit of E. coli poly(A) polymerase (Ambion) for 10 min at 37 °C as described (31Akabayov B. Henn A. Elbaum M. Sagi I. IEEE Trans. Nanobiosci. 2003; 2: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The labeled invE RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform, chloroform and purified by the Nuc-away™ spin column (Ambion) two times. Before binding of the RNA, the sensor tip was treated with 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 1 min three times. The invE RNA was diluted in a high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl) and captured on flow cell 2 of the streptavidin-coated sensor chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min until a change of at least 100-150 resonance units was detectable. The base line of resonance intensity was then allowed to stabilize for at least 15 min. A binding assay was performed at 30 and 37 °C. Purified Hfq protein was diluted in the binding buffer (see above) to give a final concentration of 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 nm, calculated for the Hfq hexamer, and subsequently injected for 3 min onto two flow cells (flow cell 1, blank as a control; flow cell 2, invE RNA) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The nonbinding protein was washed out from the specific RNA-protein by the flow of binding buffer for an additional 700 s. Bound Hfq protein was efficiently removed from the complex by a solution of 2 m NaCl for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The response from the reference cell (flow cell 1, blank) was subtracted from the response from flow cell 2 (biotin-invE RNA) to correct a nonspecific binding. We attempted to determine the Kd value using BIAevaluation™ version 3.1 software (Biacore International AB), but the interaction did not fit the 1:1 Langmuir fitting model because of a multimeric binding between the protein and RNA as observed in the gel shift analysis. The measurement of CD spectroscopy (32Chowdhury S. Ragaz C. Kreuger E. Narberhaus F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47915-47921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was performed by Toray Research Center (Kamakura, Japan). The 140-nucleotide invE RNA was diluted to 4 μg/ml in the same buffer used for the gel shift analysis, and 80 μl of the sample was subjected to the CD analyzer, J-820 (Nippon Bunko Inc.), in a 10-mm microcell at 30 and 37 °C; values were integrated from 16 measurements. Transcription of the virF gene encoding the upstream regulator of the invE gene was first examined in the wild-type strain of S. sonnei MS390. For the accurate measurement of intact mRNA, the whole culture was directly mixed with an acidic phenol/ethanol solution for quantitative isolation of mRNA (28Bhagwat A.A. Phadke R.P. Wheeler D. Kalantre S. Gudipati M. Bhagwat M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2003; 55: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and RT-PCR rather than Northern analysis was employed for the detection of full-length intact mRNA. The level of virF mRNA in the wild-type S. sonnei strain grown in LB medium was almost the same between 30 and 37 °C (Fig. 1A, virF-mRNA), and the level of β-galactosidase activity in wild-type S. sonnei strain MS390 encoded by a virFTL-lacZ translational fusion plasmid (7Nakayama S. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also similar between 30 and 37 °C (Fig. 1B, graph 1). Previously, however, Porter and Dorman (14Porter M.E. Dorman C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6537-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that virF transcription in S. flexneri strain 2457T at 30 °C was 15-25% of the level at 37 °C (14Porter M.E. Dorman C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6537-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the molecular basis of this difference, we sequenced the upstream region of the virF promoter of S. sonnei MS390 and found an insertion of a transposon sequence (GenBank™ accession number AB300612). The difference in temperature-dependent transcription of the virF gene between the two wild-type strains might be related to the presence or absence of this insertion sequence. In addition to the intact virF mRNA, we detected an additional band of shorter length by Northern analysis (see “Discussion”) (15Mitobe J. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Temperature-dependent regulation of the invE gene, which is under the control of VirF, was next examined by Western blotting and RT-PCR. The production of InvE protein was almost completely repressed at 30 °C (Fig. 1A, lane 1), but under the same culture conditions, a significant amount of invE mRNA was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A, invE-mRNA). The amount of invE transcript at 30 °C was then measured"

Using the Na+/proline transporter PutP of Escherichia coli as a model, the role of two conserved residues, Ser-340 and Thr-341, is investigated to obtain insights into the mechanism of transport catalyzed by members of this family. Substitution of these amino acids alters the transport kinetics of cells and proteoliposomes containing the PutP variants significantly. In particular, the apparent affinities for Na+ and Li+ are reduced by 2 orders of magnitude or more. Also proline binding is affected, albeit to a lesser extent than ion binding. Thereby, the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 341 is essential for high affinity ligand binding. Furthermore, Cys placed at position 340 or 341 reacts with sulfhydryl reagents of different polarity, indicating accessibility from the water phase. In addition, Cys cross-linking suggests proximity of the residues to other amino acids previously shown to be crucial for ligand binding. For these reasons it is suggested that Ser-340 and Thr-341 are located in a ligand translocation pathway. Furthermore, it is proposed that the side chain of Thr-341 directly participates in Na+ binding. The Na+/solute symporter family comprises more than 400 members of pro- and eukaryotic origin.

They have the capability to couple electrochemical Na+ gradients with the transport of solutes like glucose, nucleosides, proline, pantothenate, or iodide. Some transporters of the SSS family are implicated in human disease (e.g. the Na+/glucose transporter SGLT1) or play an important role in medical therapy (e.g. the human Na+/iodide symporter NIS) (6Dohan O.

Furthermore, bacterial transporters like the Na+/proline transporter PutP of Staphylococcus aureus contribute to virulence (8Schwan W.R. Lehmann L. McCormick J. Infect.

A crystal structure is not available yet for any member of the SSS family. Beside intensive trials to crystallize SSS proteins, it is obvious that information on structure-function relationships is required in addition to structure to understand the mechanism of respective transport processes at the molecular level. For this purpose we utilize PutP of Escherichia coli as a model since it can easily be genetically manipulated and produced in milligram amounts (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K.

PutP transports Na+ and proline with a 1:1 stoichiometry following an ordered binding mechanism at low proline concentrations, whereas at high concentrations binding can be unordered (11Chen C.C.

In addition, it participates in the formation of a water-filled cleft that is open to the cytoplasm in the absence of ligands and closed by proline binding in the presence of Na+ (20Pirch T. Landmeier S. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42942-42949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inspired by the three-dimensional structure of the leucine transporter LeuTAa (Na+/neurotransmitter symporter (NSS) family), which revealed an involvement of two adjacent polar residues (Thr-354, Ser-355) in Na+ binding (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), PutP was screened for a similar arrangement. Here, first evidence is presented indicating that TM IX of PutP is located close to TM II and contains residues Ser-340, Thr-341 that are particularly important for high affinity Na+ and proline binding. It is suggested that Ser-340 and Thr-341 are located in a ligand translocation pathway; thereby, Thr-341 probably directly participates in Na+ binding. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids–E. coli JM109 (endA1 recA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 supE44 relA1 Δ(lac-proAB) (F′traΔ36pro AB+ lacIq ZΔM15)) (22Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) and E. coli DH5α [F- ϕ80d lacZ ΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsd R17(rk-,mk+) phoA supE44 λ- thi-1 gyrA96 relA1) were used as carriers for the plasmids generated in this study. E. coli WG170 (F- trp lacZ rpsL thi Δ(putPA)101 proP219) (23Stalmach M.E. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 481-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), harboring given plasmids, was used for overexpression of the putP gene and transport assays. The following plasmids, derivatives of pT7-5 (24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) containing the lac promoter/operator for expression of the putP gene, were used for all gene manipulations; pT7-5/putP and pT7-5/putP(ΔCys), each of which harboring a cassette version of the putP gene encoding PutP-wild-type and an engineered transporter devoid of all five native Cys residues [PutP(ΔCys)], respectively, and a C-terminal-attached amino acid sequence resembling the FLAG epitope and a His6 tag (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Vector pTrc99a (25Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression. Site-directed Mutagenesis–Desired nucleotide substitutions in putP were generated by PCR with Taq-DNA polymerase using plasmid pT7-5/putP as a template and synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotides. Resulting PCR fragments were digested with PstI and AflII and ligated with similarly treated plasmid pT7-5/putP or pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) additionally incubated with alkaline phosphatase. The resulting plasmid DNA was verified by sequencing using an ABI 377 HT device. Double-Cys mutants were generated by restriction fragment replacement with PstI and SpeI. For overexpression, the mutated putP gene was cut out with restriction endonucleases NcoI and HindIII and ligated to similarly treated vector pTrc99a additionally incubated with alkaline phosphatase. Proline Transport in Intact Cells–Active transport was measured in E. coli WG170 (PutP-A-) harboring derivatives of plasmids pT7-5/putP or pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) encoding PutP with given amino acid replacements. The cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (26Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 439Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 25-fold and were allowed to grow up to an optical density at 420 nm (A420) of 1.0 followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 10 min and washed up to 6 times with 100 mm Tris/Mes, pH 6.0, at 4 °C to reduce the Na+ contamination below 5 μm. For transport assays cells were resuspended in the same buffer and adjusted to a total protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Transport of 10 μm l-[U-14C]proline (26 Ci/mol) (if not otherwise indicated) was assayed under standard test conditions in the presence of 20 mm d-lactate (Na+ salt) and 50 mm NaCl. Transport assays were terminated at various time points (0, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) using the rapid filtration method as described (19Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Initial rates of transport were calculated from the initial linear portion of the time course, and steady-state levels of proline accumulation were taken from time points after leveling off of the uptake curve. S.D. were determined from at least three independent experiments. Immunological Analysis–Relative amounts of PutP with given amino acid replacements in membranes of E. coli WG170 were estimated by Western blot analysis with horseradish peroxidase-linked mouse anti-FLAG IgG directed against the FLAG epitope at the C terminus of each PutP variant as described before (18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cys Accessibility Analyses–The experiments were performed with right-side-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli WG170 transformed with pTrc99a/putP(ΔCys) harboring given mutations following the protocol of Kaback (27Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Before Cys labeling, the right-side-out vesicle suspension (10 mg total membrane protein/ml) was reduced with 1 mm dithiothreitol or 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. The vesicles were washed and resuspended in 100 mm Tris/Mes buffer, pH 6.0. Two hundred-μl aliquots of the suspension (10 mg of total membrane protein/ml) were incubated with 500 μm [14C]NEM (8 μCi/μmol) at 25 °C for 10 min [PutP(ΔCys)-T341C] or 15 min [PutP(ΔCys)-S340C]. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol. When indicated, 500 μm methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES), or methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) were added before [14C]NEM. Similarly, the effect of PutP ligands on Cys accessibility was analyzed by incubation with 50 mm Na+, Li+, and/or 10 mm proline Na+/proline before [14C]NEM labeling. After labeling, PutP was solubilized by the addition of 1.5% β-dodecyl-maltoside under stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. Then PutP was purified via Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as described before (17Pirch T. Quick M. Nietschke M. Langkamp M. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8790-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After protein determination, equal amounts of protein were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned for estimation of relative amounts of protein. Radioactivity was detected with a PhosphorImager SI of GE Healthcare. The software ImageQuant was used for quantitative analysis of the images. In Situ Site-directed Cross-linking–For cross-linking experiments, 0.4 liters of E. coli WG170 transformed with pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) encoding PutP with single or double Cys replacements and an introduced double thrombin cleaving site were grown and harvested as described above. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride as the reducing compound. Before cross-linking, the membrane vesicles were washed twice and resuspended in 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.0. One hundred μg total membrane protein (1 mg total membrane protein/ml) were incubated with 0.5 mm Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) or with 2 mm concentrations of one of the homobifunctional cross-linker 1,6-bis-(maleimido) hexane (BMH) or N,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide (p-PDM). Stock solutions of 30 mm CuPh (in ethanol) and 200 mm concentrations of the maleimide reagents (in Me2SO) were prepared. Reactions were performed at 4 °C for 60 (CuPh) or 120 min (maleimide reagents) and at 25 °C for 30 or 60 min to estimate the dependence of cross-linking efficiency on thermal backbone motions. After termination with 10 mm EDTA (CuPh) or 10 mm dithiothreitol (BMH and p-PDM), the inverted membrane vesicles were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in thrombin cleavage buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% β-dodecyl-maltoside and, after a 2-fold dilution in thrombin cleavage buffer, digested overnight at 4 °C with 1.3 units of thrombin protease. The digested proteins were subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. Purification and Reconstitution of PutP–PutP was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography and reconstituted into proteoliposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipid extracts (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, Alabama) at a lipid to protein ratio of 100 to 1 (w/w) as described before (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transport Assay with Proteoliposomes–l-[14C]Proline uptake was measured with proteoliposomes containing PutP(FH) (∼2 mg of protein/ml) preloaded with 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4. The proteoliposomes were extruded through a 400 nm filter before use. Transport was started by a 400-fold dilution of aliquots of the proteoliposome suspension into the desired buffer. The following buffers were used: Na+-free 100 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4 containing 50 NaCl (creation of ΔμNa+) or 50 mm LiCl (creation of ΔμLi+) or no further additions (creation of ΔΨ); Na+-free 100 mm Tris, Mes, pH 6.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4 (creation of ΔμH+) or 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgSO4 (facilitated diffusion, control). All buffers contained 10 μm l-[14C]proline (26 Ci/mol) and 0.2 μm valinomycin. For the measurement of proline counterflow (cfl), proteoliposomes preloaded with 10 mm l-proline were diluted 400-fold into 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing l-[14C]proline at a final concentration of 25 μm (15 Ci/mol). Transport assays were terminated at various time points (0, 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 min) by quenching of the reaction with 3 ml of ice-cold 100 mm KPi, pH 6.6, 100 mm LiCl and immediate filtration using Millipore filters type GSTF 02500, 0.2-μm pore size as described (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Initial rates of transport were determined from the initial linear part of the transport curve. S.D. were determined from at least three independent experiments. Determination of Na+–Na+ concentrations in buffers used for transport assays and Cys accessibility analyses were determined with a Varian AA240 atomic absorption spectrometer. Protein Determination–Determination of protein was performed according to a modified Lowry method (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) for total membrane protein, according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) for detergent-solubilized protein, and by the Amido Black method (30Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) for protein in proteoliposomes. Conserved Amino Acids of TM IX–Searching for amino acid residues of potential structural and/or functional significance (e.g. residues involved in ligand binding), a multiple sequence alignment of members of the SSS family was performed. The analysis revealed that Ser-340 and Thr-341 of E. coli PutP are conserved within prokaryotic and eukaryotic family members irrespective of their substrate specificity (e.g. transporters for proline, pantothenate, sugars, or iodide). In fact, the transporters analyzed contained Ser at the position corresponding to Ser-340 and Ser or Thr at the position corresponding to Thr-341 of E. coli PutP (supplemental Fig. 1). The high degree of conservation suggests that both residues fulfill similar functions in all related transporters. In addition, a similar amino acid arrangement (Thr-354, Ser-355) was found to be involved in Na+ binding in the non-homologous leucine transporter LeuTAa (21Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to elucidate the role of Ser-340 and Thr-341 in PutP of E. coli. Effect of the Substitution of Ser-340 and Thr-341 on Proline Uptake and putP Expression in E. coli WG170–Ser-340 and Thr-341 were individually replaced by Ala, Cys, Thr (Ser-340) or Cys, Ser, Val (Thr-341). In addition, double mutants S340A/T341C and S340A/T341V were generated. In a first step, time courses of l-proline uptake into E. coli WG170 were recorded under standard test conditions (70 mm Na+, 10 μm l-[14C]proline) (Fig. 1A). Based on the observed activities, the mutants were divided into three groups: I) mutants with moderately reduced initial rates (S340A 20%, S340T 40%, T341S 60% of the wild-type rate) but steady-state values of l-proline accumulation close to wild-type (80–100% of the wild-type value); II) mutants with highly reduced initial rates (S340C 9%, T341C 3%, T341V 3.5% of the wild-type rate) and reduced steady-state values (S340C 60%, T341C 35%, T341V 20% of the wild-type value); III) mutants with only marginal levels of activity (<1% of the wild type) (S340A/T341C, S340A/T341V). Western blot analysis of membranes prepared from cell suspensions used for the transport assays indicated that the observed reduced proline uptake rates were not because of reduced amounts of transporter molecules in the membrane (Fig. 1B). To test whether the inhibitory effects of the Cys substitution at position 340 or 341 were due to intra- or intermolecular disulfide bridge formation (e.g. with one of the five native Cys residues), the Cys substitutions were introduced into PutP(ΔCys). Recording of time courses of transport yielded similar inhibitory effects as observed in the wild-type background (data not shown). The results suggested that the altered amino acid side chains per se and not subsequent reactions caused the detected transport defects. Taken together the results indicated that the nature of the amino acid side chains at positions 340 and 341 of PutP of E. coli was crucial for the proline uptake rate. Highest rates were observed when hydroxyl groups were retained at both positions (e.g. S340T, T341S). Overall, the steady-state value of proline accumulation was much less affected than the uptake rate. Influence of the Substitutions on the Ion Selectivity of PutP–To test for possible changes of the ion selectivity, the energetic requirements of the transport process were investigated under more defined conditions using purified and reconstituted transport protein. It should be noted that the protocol used for reconstitution yields proteoliposomes containing PutP in an inside-out orientation (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). First, determination of the initial rates of Na+-coupled (sodium motive force (smf)-driven) transport in proteoliposomes confirmed in principal the defects described above for intact cells, although individual values varied to some extent (Fig. 2). Mutants of group I (S340A, S340T, T341S) showed again the highest activities. However, differing from intact cells, neither the S340A nor the T341S substitution caused significant inhibition of transport. This difference may be attributed to the previously described functional asymmetry of the transporter (9Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Yamato I. Anraku Y. Bakker E.P. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 53-76Google Scholar). The initial rates of the mutants T341C and T341V of group II were highly reduced (about 2.5% of the wild type) as in intact cells. PutP-S340C (9% residual activity in intact cells) showed only marginal activity (<1% of the wild type) in proteoliposomes (Fig. 2). Reducing conditions were maintained during all steps of the preparation to prevent a potential participation of Cys-340 in formation of a disulfide bridge with a native Cys. Nevertheless, oxidation of Cys-340 during PutP preparation could have added to the deleterious effect of the substitution in proteoliposomes. Finally, activities of mutants of group III (S340A/T341C, S340/T341V) were reduced to marginal values (<2% of the wild type) similar as observed with intact cells (not shown). Secondly, analysis of various energetic conditions revealed that in all cases transport was strictly dependent on an inwardly directed electrochemical Na+ (smf) or Li+ gradient (lithium motive force (lmf)) (Fig. 2). ΔΨ-Driven transport of the mutants was only marginal and most likely due to Na+ impurities of buffer components (leading to Na+ concentrations in the assay of about 5–10 μm). Establishment of a H+ gradient in addition to ΔΨ (proton motive force-driven transport) did not further stimulate transport. These measurements indicated that the replacements at positions 340 or 341 did not cause a dramatic change in ion selectivity (e.g. from Na+-toH+-coupled transport). However, comparison of smf- and lmf-coupled transport of PutP-T341S (smf >90% and lmf 30% of wild-type activity) hints at subtle alterations of the ion preferences of the transporter (Fig. 2). Besides ion-coupled transport, the impact of the substitutions on proline counterflow was analyzed. This transport mode neither required a membrane potential nor an ion gradient. Instead, accumulation of externally applied l-[14C]proline in proteoliposomes was driven by downhill movement of unlabeled l-proline from preloaded proteoliposomes. Substitution of Ser-340 (by Cys or Thr) or Thr-341 (by Cys or Val) led to significantly reduced counterflow activities (remaining activities below 13% of the wild-type value) (Fig. 2). Exceptions were PutP-S340A and PutP-T341S, which catalyzed counterflow almost like the wild type. The latter results confirmed the functional significance of Ser-340 and Thr-341 and suggested that these residues are important for proline binding or transport. Kinetic Analyses–More detailed kinetic analyses revealed substantial defects in proline AND Na+ binding. Thereby, binding parameters of group II mutants were more severely affected than the ones of group I mutants. The maximum rate of proline uptake was in general less dramatically affected (reduced to maximum 50% of wild-type Vmax) than binding parameters (Table 1; Fig. 3). Transport by group III mutants (S340A/T341V; S340A/T341C) was not significantly stimulated by increasing ligand concentrations.TABLE 1Proline uptake kinetics of PutP bearing replacements of given amino acid residues To determine Km(pro) and Vmax initial rates of l-[U-14C]proline uptake by E. coli, WG170 producing either PutP wild type or PutP with given replacements were measured in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm d-lactate (Na+ salt) at proline concentrations from 0.2 to 500 μm. For determination of the ion-specific parameters (K0.5(Na+), K0.5(Li+)), transport of 10 μm l-[U-14C]proline was measured in the presence of 0.005–250 mm NaCl or LiCl at 25 °C. The resulting data were plotted according to Eadie-Hofstee.PutPKm(pro)VmaxK0.5(Na+)K0.5(Li+)μmnmol/min·mg of proteinmmmmWild type2.1 ± 0.244.5 ± 3.90.038 ± 0.007 (0.7 ± 0.09)aValues in parentheses were obtained with proteoliposomes containing the purified PutP variants0.295 ± 0.057S340A31.3 ± 3.739.5 ± 7.15.3 ± 1.0 (5.2 ± 0.49)53.0 ± 7.5S340C46.3 ± 7.853.7 ± 2.640.1 ± 5.732.3 ± 7.9S340T0.7 ± 0.219.7 ± 5.83.3 ± 0.3 (11.9 ± 1.7)32.1 ± 2.8T341C60.8 ± 7.821.6 ± 0.8NSbNS, no stimulation of proline uptake into intact cells by increasing concentrations of Na+ or Li+ (>250)>100T341S3.0 ± 1.040.2 ± 11.20.051 ± 0.0012.0 ± 0.29T341V117.1 ± 4.627.5 ± 2.0NS (>250)NSa Values in parentheses were obtained with proteoliposomes containing the purified PutP variantsb NS, no stimulation of proline uptake into intact cells by increasing concentrations of Na+ or Li+ Open table in a new tab In more detail, kinetic analysis with intact cells demonstrated that removal of the hydroxyl group at positions 340 or 341 decreased the apparent affinity for proline 15–60-fold in comparison to wild type, suggesting a defect in proline binding (Table 1, Fig. 3). Only PutP-S340T and PutP-T341S yielded Km(pro) values similar to that of the unaltered transporter. The data indicated that hydroxyl groups at positions 340 and 341 were crucial for proline binding. The apparent affinities of PutP for the coupling ions Na+ and Li+ (K0.5(Na+) and K0.5(Li+)) were even more severely affected by the amino acid replacements than the proline affinity. So, for all three PutP-S340 variants, 100–1000-fold increases of K0.5(Na+) and K0.5(Li+) were determined (Table 1, Fig. 3). The data did not hint at a specific role of the hydroxyl group at position 340 in ion binding since Ala or Thr at position 340 led to about the same decrease of the apparent ion affinity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, although PutP-T341S showed apparent ion affinities close to the wild type, proline uptake into cells catalyzed by group II mutants PutP-T341C and -T341V was no longer significantly stimulated by Na+ (T341V also not by Li+). Therefore, contrary to position 340, high affinity ion binding required a hydroxyl group at position 341. Because the lack of Na+ (Li+) stimulation of proline uptake by the latter group II mutants could be due to insufficient proline binding, the proline concentration in the ion affinity assay was raised from 10 to 250 μm. However, substitution of Thr-341 by Cys or Val again prevented a significant stimulation of transport by Na+ (and in case of T341V, also by Li+). The same elevation of the proline concentration increased the apparent Na+ and Li+ affinities of PutP-wild type and -S340C about 10-fold (other mutants not tested). These data suggested cooperative"

The budding index is a physiologically relevant “global” parameter that reflects the complex links between cell growth and division that are both coordinately and deeply affected by nutritional conditions.

Although glucose represents its favored substrate, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize a wide range of fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources. Pathways for the assimilation of alternative carbon sources are repressed in the presence of glucose that also activates glycolysis, decreases respiratory activity, increases ribosome biogenesis, and regulates growth and development through alteration in gene expression, post-transcriptional and translational regulation. For instance, a large number of yeast genes, including those required for galactose utilization, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenic genes are transcriptionally repressed by glucose (1DeRisi J.L.

A few yeast mRNAs, including the SDH2, SUC2, SPO13, PCK1, and FBP1 mRNAs have been reported to be post-transcriptionally regulated by glucose (9Lombardo A. Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Mercado J.J. Smith R. Sagliocco F.A. Brown A.J. Gancedo J.M. Eur. J.

Moreover, integrated genomic and proteomic approaches to investigate the effects of carbon source on gene expression in S. cerevisiae, exponentially growing on either fermentable and non-fermentable carbon source, have shown that in many cases mRNA abundance is not a reliable indicator of corresponding protein abundance (13Futcher B. Latter G.I. Monardo P. McLaughlin C.S. Garrels J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7357-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 14Griffin T.J. Gygi S.P. Ideker T. Rist B. Eng J. Hood L. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), suggesting that other mechanisms in addition to transcriptional control may be very important for adaptation to nutrients. In the wild, sudden transitions from one carbon source to another, as well as from conditions of large food supply to its disappearance, represent the rule and not the exception (15Winderickx J. Holsbeeks I. Lagatie O. Giots F. Thevelein J.M. de Winde H. Yeast Stress Responses, Topics in Current Genetics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 307-386Google Scholar). Thus, yeast has evolved a wide array of signal transduction pathways, coordinating the various metabolic, developmental, and cellular response pathways to carbon source availability. When inoculated into a medium rich in glucose, S. cerevisiae can convert glucose to ethanol by “fermentation”, the preferred method of yeast metabolism. Yeast utilizes other energy/carbon sources only after glucose exhaustion. The preferred energy/carbon source after glucose is exhausted is ethanol, which is available in high concentrations at that point. The shift from anaerobic fermentation of glucose to aerobic respiration of ethanol is called the “diauxic shift” and is known to be accompanied by major changes in gene expression (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar), not surprising because entire metabolic pathways need to be activated or deactivated. A wide variety of enzymes are induced during the diauxic shift. These include enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, the glyoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and respiration (16Johnston M. Carlson M. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar, 17Entian K.D. Schuller H.J. Yeast Sugar Metabolism: Biochemistry, Genetics, Biotechnology and Applications. Technomic Publishing Co., Lancaster, Basel1997: 409-434Google Scholar). Proteomics (18Boucherie H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bataille N. Thoraval D. Boucherie H. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Bataille N. Regnacq M. Boucherie H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) highlighted that three major events take place during the diauxic shift: (i) an induction of proteins involved in the general stress response; (ii) the induction of glucose-repressed proteins; and (iii) a transient arrest in the synthesis of proteins present in exponentially growing cells. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis also identified distinguishable functional clusters of genes that are co-regulated when glucose becomes limiting (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). Proteomic analysis has also been later extended to mutants in genes within the Snf1 kinase pathway, a major regulatory pathway involved in sensing of intracellular glucose and/or energy charge in yeast (21Haurie V. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reverse shift is the so-called ethanol-glucose nutritional shift-up, where cells growing on media supplemented with ethanol as a sole carbon source are fed with glucose. The pattern of macromolecular syntheses, cell mass increase, and budding dynamics defining major phases during the shift-up are schematically reported in Fig. 1, which summarizes many published results (22Kief D.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Alberghina L. Smeraldi C. Ranzi B.M. Porro D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3864-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ethanol-supplemented media, cells grow slower and are smaller. Soon after addition of glucose, overall increase in mass, detected by turbidometry, decreases dramatically for the first 2 h after the shift-up. Incorporation of radioactive precursors suggested that, in keeping with what was observed in other eukaryotic microorganisms (24Sturani E. Costantini M.G. Zippel R. Alberghina F.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 99: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the rate of RNA synthesis is stimulated before the rate of protein synthesis, both ultimately reaching the higher value, characteristic of the novel steady state condition (22Kief D.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The change in protein biosynthetic capacity brought about by increased ribosome content needs to be coordinated with cell cycle and cell division. Because G1 cells in yeast correspond approximately to unbudded cells, the budding index, i.e. the fraction of budded cells in the population, represents a sensitive physiological parameter that can be used to easily monitor population dynamics during the shift-up. During the first part of the shift-up, two major delays are observed: cells that were in G1 at the moment of the shift delay their entry into S phase, whereas cells that had already executed the G1 to S transition delay completion of the cell cycle (23Alberghina L. Smeraldi C. Ranzi B.M. Porro D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3864-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Alberghina L. Rossi R.L. Porro D. Vanoni M. Systems Biology: Definitions and Perspectives, Topics in Current Genetics. 13. Spring-Verlag, Berlin2005: 325-347Google Scholar). Accordingly, the shift-up events can be dissected in different phases, all convergent to allow a rapid transition to cells growing faster, with a higher protein content at the G1 to S transition and a shorter budding time compared with pre-shift cells. Among the ∼600 spots detected by two-dimensional PAGE, 90 spots (plus 48 that we mark as “potentially changed” because they did not pass the most rigid criteria for significance), mostly comprising proteins involved in intermediary metabolism, protein synthesis, and response to stress, showed differential expression after glucose addition. Among modulated proteins we identified a protein of previously unknown function, Gvp36, 5The abbreviations used are: Gvp36Golgi vesicle protein of 36 kDaLat-Blatrunculin-BBIbudded indexYNByeast nitrogen baseSSDsteady state in dextroseLYLucifer yellowMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightLC-MS/MSliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometricPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidCDCFDA[5-(and -6)-Carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate]. which shows a transitory increase corresponding to the drop of the fraction of budded cells. Based on bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical analysis, we propose Gvp36 as a novel yeast BAR protein involved in vesicular traffic and in nutritional adaptation. Phenotypes of gvp36Δ mutants, including general growth defects, heat shock sensitivity, and poor growth at 37 °C, sensitivity to high salt, defects in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, in endocytosis and vacuolar biogenesis, and defects in nutritional adaptation are compatible with known BAR domain functions in binding and/or bending cellular membranes.

Strains and Vectors–The S. cerevisiae haploid strain used in this study is W303-1A (Mata, ade2-1, leu2-3, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11) or its W303-CF derivative. In W303-CF, both Cln3 and Far1 proteins are tagged with a 15-Myc tag. The strain is phenotypically indistinguishable from the parent strain in a variety of growth conditions on the basis of duplication time, fraction of budded cells, average protein content, and overall morphology (26Alberghina L. Rossi R.L. Querin L. Wanke V. Vanoni M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deletion of GVP36 was performed with transformation and homologous recombination of standard auxotrophic deletion cassettes. Yeast cell transformations were performed according to standard lithium acetate method. gvp36Δ mutant was compared with the W303-1A wild type strain. The GVP36-TAP tagged strain (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 GVP36-TAP) (27Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar) was purchased from Open Biosystems. Growth Conditions–Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete (SC) medium (Bio 101 Inc.) with yeast nitrogen base (Difco) as a nitrogen source, or in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone), supplemented with 2% glucose (SCD-YPD), 2% ethanol (SCE), or 3% glycerol (SCG-YPG) as carbon source, or in minimal medium (YNB) containing yeast nitrogen base and (per liter) 5 mg of adenine, 5 mg of uracil, 5 mg of leucine, 5 mg of histidine, 5 mg of tryptophan, and supplemented with 2% glucose (YNBD). For nitrogen starvation, we used a minimal medium supplemented with yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and with 3% glycerol as carbon source (YNBG). To examine growth of yeast strains in different carbon source containing media, serially diluted cells were spotted (5 μl) on solid YP or SC medium supplemented with 2% glucose, 2% ethanol, or 3% glycerol, or on solid YNB medium supplemented with 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5% glucose. To test ethanol sensitivity and osmosensitivity, exponentially growing in YPD cells were serially diluted and spotted onto YPD solid medium either 2 or 4% ethanol, and onto YPD solid medium supplemented with different sorbitol concentrations. To test salt sensitivity, cells exponentially growing in YPD cells were serially diluted and either spotted or plated (to assessed their viability) onto YPD or YNBD solid medium supplemented with 6% NaCl or 6% MgCl2. To test thermosensitivity for growth, cells exponentially growing in YPD cells were serially diluted and plated onto YPD or YNBD solid medium, supplemented or not supplemented with 1 m sorbitol, and then incubated at 30 or 37 °C: their viability was assessed by counting colony forming units. Finally, to test heat shock resistance, confluence grown cells (about 1-2 × 108 cells/ml, grown 2 or 7 days in YPD medium) were treated at 51 °C for 5, 10, 15, or 20 min and then plated onto YPD solid medium: their viability was assessed by counting colony forming units. To study nutritional shift-up, at time 0 2% glucose was added to cells exponentially growing in ethanol or glycerol-supplemented medium and samples were collected to evaluate the percentage of budded cells; for proteomic analyses cells were collected at the times indicated in Fig. 1; a control yeast population exponentially growing on 2% glucose was also collected. For α-factor block-and-release experiments, cells were grown to exponential phase at 25 °C in YPD medium and α-factor was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. After 120 min of α-factor treatment cells were filtered, washed with 3 volumes of YP medium without glucose, and resuspended in fresh YPD medium containing 15 μg/ml nocodazole. After 150 min, when most of the cells had a very large bud, cells were filtered, washed with 5 volumes of YP medium without glucose, and resuspended in fresh YPD medium containing 2.5 μg/ml α-factor. Latrunculin-B Treatment–Sensitivity to Lat-B was performed essentially as previously described (28Blader I.J. Cope M.J. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Greenwood A.F. Drubin D.G. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells exponentially growing in YPD (105 cells) were plated onto YPD solid medium. Lat-B was diluted into Me2SO and 4 μl of vehicle or the indicated concentration of Lat-B were pipetted onto a 6-mm filter disk (Schleicher and Schuell), which was placed onto the top agar. Plates were placed at 30 °C for 24-48 h. Cell Cycle and Growth Parameters–Cells were counted after sonication with a Coulter Counter Z2. The specific growth rate (μ) was assessed by fitting the cell number against time and duplication time (Td) calculated subsequently according to equation Td = ln2/μ. The fraction of total budded cells (Fb) was calculated after microscopic examination (at least 300 cells per count were scored). Cytofluorimetric Analysis–Determination of protein and DNA contents was performed on cells fixed in 70% ethanol (v/v) as previously described (26Alberghina L. Rossi R.L. Querin L. Wanke V. Vanoni M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Total proteins were stained with fluorescein isothiocianate and total DNA with Sytox® Green (Molecular Probes). Analysis was performed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences) equipped with a Ion-Argon laser at 488 nm laser emission. Fluorescence Microscopy–Fluorescence microscopy was carried out with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Images were captured with LEICA DC350F camera controlled by Leica FW4000 software. Actin Localization–Cells were fixed by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7%. After 1 h, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (127 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm Na2HPO4, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, adjusted to pH 7.5), resuspended in 25 μl of PBS containing 2 ng/μl of rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) (from a stock solution of 100 ng/μl in methanol). After 3 h at 25 °C, cells were washed five times with PBS and mounted directly for fluorescence microscopy observation. Classification of Cells Depending on Actin Polarization State–Approximately 100 small- and medium-budded cells, exponentially grown in YPD medium, were scored as having: >90% of their actin in the bud (polarized cells); 50-90% of their actin in the bud (partially depolarized cells); or <50% of their actin in the bud (totally depolarized cells). Vacuole Staining–For FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) staining, cells exponentially grown in SCD medium were harvested and resuspended in the same medium. FM4-64 was added to 80 μm from a stock solution of 4 mm Me2SO. Cells were then incubated with shaking for 60 min at 30 °C. After this preliminary labeling step, cells were harvested, resuspended in fresh SCD medium, and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 30 °C. After a single wash with PBS, cells were placed on standard slides and observed. For CDCFDA (Molecular Probes) staining, cells exponentially grown in SCD medium were harvested and resuspended in the same medium containing 500 μm CDCFDA (added from a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO). Cells were then incubated with shaking for 30-45 min at 30 °C. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS and viewed. For Lucifer yellow (LY) accumulation experiments, cells exponentially grown in SCD medium were harvested and resuspended in the same medium, added with 10 mg/ml LY (Sigma). Cells were then incubated with shaking for 3 h at 30 °C in dark. After washing four times with ice-cold 50 mm sodium succinate buffer, pH 5, containing 20 mm sodium azide, cells were resuspended in the same buffer and viewed. Protein Extraction–Typically, 1 × 109 cells/sample were collected by filtration, washed twice with cold water, and immediately frozen at -80 °C. Samples were slowly thawed on ice. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) plus proteases inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added, and cells were broken by 10 vortex/ice cycles of 1 min each on ice. Extracts were transferred in new tubes and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Evaluation of Gvp36-TAP Expression Levels–Cultures of the Gvp36-TAP tagged strain were subjected to a nutritional shift-up and cellular samples (3 × 108 cells) were collected at regular intervals to evaluate the expression of the tagged protein. Protein extracts were prepared as described above. Rabbit anti-TAP antibodies (Open Biosystems) were used for Western blot analysis. Densitometric analysis of the bands corresponding to the tagged protein was performed using the ImageJ software. Two-dimensional PAGE–250 μg of proteins were desalted with Micro Bio-Spin Chromatography Columns Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad), dried, and then resuspended in 300 μl of a solution containing urea (7 m), thiourea (2 m), CHAPS (4% w/v), Tris (40 mm), dithioerythritol (65 mm), Resolyte pH 3-10 (0.5% v/v), and a trace of bromphenol blue. The whole yeast-diluted sample was loaded onto the IPG gel strip (pH 3-10 nonlinear, 17 cm, Bio-Rad). Hydration was performed overnight at 50 V and 20 °C in the PROTEAN IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). In the first dimension, proteins were separated using a gel containing a non-linear immobilized pH gradient (200 V for 1 h; increase to 1000 during 1 h, then to 4000 during 45 min; 4000 V for 3 h; increase to 8000 V during 1 h and 30 min; 8000 V for 3 h). The strips were equilibrated with a solution containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 2% (w/v) dithioerythritol for 15 min, and subsequently another 15 min with the same solution with 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide instead of dithioerythritol. Second dimension was performed in polyacrylamide gradient gels (7.5-16%) with the Ettan DALTsix electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 mA per gel at 8 °C. The gels were stained overnight with GelCode® (Pierce). The shift-up experiment was performed in triplicate. To assure a good comparison, for each experiment six gels were run simultaneously at the first and second dimensions. Image Capture and Analysis–Image scanning was performed on a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated imaging densitometer and the spots analyzed using PDQuest 7.1.1 (Bio-Rad). Normalization of spot volumes in gel was performed using the “total density in valid spots” option. For each protein spot, normalized spot quantity from the gel taken at t0 (supplemental Table S3) was used as a reference: the relative expression level at each later time point (i.e. t1, t2, t3, t4, and steady state in dextrose (SSD)) was calculated by dividing the normalized spot quantity in each gel by the level of the t0 reference gel. Three independent shift-up experiments were run (biological triplicate). We considered as “changed” proteins whose relative expression levels varied at least 1.5-fold in all three biological replicates. Spots showing verified changes only in two of three gels were classified as “potentially changed.” In the case of Gvp36, additional experiments using a different technique allowed to confirmation of reproducibility, moving the protein from the potentially changed to the changed class. Analysis of time-dependent changes in relative expression levels provides a further internal control, because it seems unlikely that a spot showing variations in its intensity at multiple time points can be erroneously classified as changed. Consistently, among the 90 spots designed as changed by the above criteria, only 3 showed altered expression at a single time point. Moreover, about 90% of spots designed as changed fell into a limited number of pathways, about 60% being involved in intermediary metabolism. Taken together these findings indicate that the use of a low threshold value did not result in an excessive number of spots erroneously classified as changed. Clustering–K-means clustering was performed on data obtained from bidimensional electrophoresis using the Pearson Correlation by J-Express pro 2.7 (see molmine.com for program details). In Gel Digestion–In situ digestion of the gel spots was performed with an automated protein digestion system, MassPREP Station (Waters) (29Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The gel plugs were washed three times with a mixture of 1:1 25 mm NH4HCO3/ACN. The cysteine residues were reduced with dithiothreitol at 57 °C (10 mm in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 1 h) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (25 mm in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 45 min). After dehydration with ACN, the proteins were digested in-gel with modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI; 10 μl of 12.5 ng/μl in 25 mm NH4HCO3) overnight at 37 °C. The volume of trypsin added was estimated visually according to the piece of gel size (4-6 μl). Peptide Extraction–MALDI-TOF analysis was carried out on tryptic peptides extracted with 4 μl of 35% H2O, 60% ACN, 5% HCOOH (v/v/v). For nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (nanoLC-MS/MS), a second extraction was performed with 100% ACN, the supernatants were transferred and reduced completely by evaporation and finally 7 μl of H2O (0.1% HCOOH) were added. MALDI-MS Analysis–Mass spectra from 700 to 3500 daltons were carried out on a ULTRAFLEX MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The instrument was used at a maximum accelerating potential of 20 kV and was operated in reflector positive mode. Sample preparation was performed with the dried droplet method using a mixture of 0.5 μl of sample and 0.5 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in H2O/50% ACN diluted 3 times) then the spots were washed with 1 μl of H2O. Internal calibration was performed with autolysis tryptic peptides, with, respectively, monoisotopic masses at m/z = 842.51, 1045.564, and 2211.105. NanoLC-MS Analysis–LC-MS/MS analysis of the digested proteins were performed using an CapLC capillary LC system (Micromass) coupled to a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration TOF MS/MS (Q-TOF II, Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). 6 μl of sample was loaded and concentrated onto a C18 PepMap precolumn (LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at a 30-μl/min flow rate and flushed for 3 min with 0.1% ACN before gradient elution of the peptides onto the separating column. Chromatographic separations were then performed on a 15-cm × 75-μm inner diameter column, packed with C18 PepMap (LC-Packings) stationary phase, with 200 nl/min flow. The elution was performed at 5-45% gradient B (ACN, 0.1% HCOOH, v/v) over 35 min, followed a 95% (solvent B) over 5 min and the re-equilibration of the column was carried out during 20 min by 100% of mobile phase A (H2O, 0.1% HCOOH, v/v). Mass data acquisitions were piloted by MassLynx software (Micromass) using automatic switching between MS and MS/MS modes as described (30Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The electrospray capillary voltage was set to 3.5 kV, the cone voltage set to 40 V, and the source temperature set to 120 °C. The MS survey scan was m/z 300-1500 with a scan time of 1 s and an interscan time of 0.1 s. When the intensity of a peak rose above a threshold of 10 counts, tandem mass spectra were acquired. Normalized collision energies for peptide fragmentation was set using the charge-state recognition files for +1, +2, and +3 peptide ions. The scan range for MS/MS acquisition was from m/z 50 to 1500 with a scan time of 3 s and a interscan time of 0.1 s. Fragmentation was performed using argon as the collision gas and with a collision energy profile optimized for various mass ranges of i"

Since then, two other papers4,5 has appeared which have carried the story a great deal further, and it now seems opportune to consider astonishing picture thus provided of the methoas of communication among worker bees and its far-reaching implications as to the capabilities of a bee's sense organs and brain. The zoologist may, indeed, be pardoned if at first he feels sceptical—in spite of the immense detail and thoroughness of the investigation and even though it comes from one of the most eminent living workers in these fields of study. Indeed, one experimental zoologist expressed himself to the writer as almost ""passionately un-willing"" to accept such conclusions, and probably many others feel the same—for the implications are oertainly revolutionary."

https://openalex.org/W2023841680,"IN a previous paper we have shown that the pattern of the same giant chromosomes can differ from cell to cell even in the same tissue of a Chironomus larva1. Furthermore, the same giant chromosome structure in different tissues shows normally a different pattern2–6. The latter differences are clearly greater than those of the chromosome in the same tissue. On the other hand, an examination of giant chromosomes in the mid-gut and in the salivary gland of Sciara larva led Berger to the conclusion that the pattern of the mid-gut chromosomes is identical with that of the salivary gland chromosomes7. I have investigated both these points with a different object, namely, Drosophila repleta. Giant chromosomes closely resembling those of the salivary gland can be found in various somatic tissues in the larvae of D. repleta. They are, however, smaller and have fewer cross-bands than the salivary gland chromosomes. The same phenomenon was observed in D. virilis by Makino8. Besides the salivary gland chromosomes, those in the cells at the base of the large tracheal tubes give the most satisfactory results."

As such, it can play a key role in the control of fibrosis. The aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the anti-fibrotic effects exerted by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) perindoprilat on macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM)-injured human mesangial cells can be modulated by this receptor. Addition of receptor-associated protein to MPCM-injured mesangial cells with and without ACE-I increased the amount of tissue plasminogen activator protein detected in mesangial cell culture supernatants without affecting the protein levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The ability of ACE-I to reduce fibronectin was diminished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. ACE-I induced an increase in mesangial cell MMP9 mRNA, but reduced the MMP9 enzyme activity detected in mesangial cell supernatants. Mesangial cell lysates from ACE-I-treated cells were able to bind immobilized fibronectin at higher dilutions than cell lysates from untreated cells. Flow cytometry showed that MPCM induced an increase in LRP surface expression in mesangial cells over that in control cells and that this expression was further increased by ACE-I treatment. The increase in LRP expression in response to ACE-I was also observed by Western blotting. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from cells following a 24-h exposure to MPCM with and without ACE-I demonstrated that there was no change in LRP mRNA expression upon ACE-I treatment. In conclusion, we show that ACE-I treatment is able to modulate mesangial cell-surface expression of LRP, providing an additional mechanism whereby ACE-Is can mediate anti-fibrotic actions independent of their hemodynamic actions.

Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Among its many functions, LRP modulates the turnover of proteases and protease inhibitor complexes and is known to be a clearing receptor for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (1Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 2Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LRP expression is also associated with regulating extracellular matrix deposition because it mediates fibronectin catabolism and inhibits fibronectin accumulation on cell surfaces (3Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it has been found that these receptors may play an important role in cell signaling (1Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein tissue plasminogen activator angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor macrophage-conditioned medium receptor-associated protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin reverse transcription. low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein tissue plasminogen activator angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor macrophage-conditioned medium receptor-associated protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin reverse transcription. We have shown previously that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) perindoprilat exerts anti-fibrotic effects in human mesangial cells via the bradykinin/tPA axis (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In those experiments, perindoprilat was able to reduce macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM)-induced fibronectin levels while concomitantly up-regulating tPA mRNA levels. Paradoxically, however, supernatant tPA protein levels were reduced. tPA is generally thought to be beneficial in the pathogenesis of fibrosis because of its ability to increase matrix degradation and decrease matrix accumulation (5Kitching A.R. Holdsworth S.R. Ploplis V.A. Plow E.F. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Tipping P.G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These observations led us to speculate that reduced supernatant tPA protein levels following treatment with an ACE-I could occur as a result of a faster turnover/clearance rate of the protease mediated by a receptor such as LRP. We therefore hypothesized that ACE-I treatment leads to increased binding/endocytosis of tPA, which initiates the downstream events that lead to the reduction of MPCM-induced fibronectin in human mesangial cells. The aim of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis by investigating the possible relationship between ACE-I treatment and LRP expression and the subsequent events that lead to the observed reduction of fibronectin levels in human mesangial cells. Cell Culture–Human mesangial cells were cultured from glomerular explants processed from the normal poles of nephrectomized human kidneys with renal carcinoma using standard serial sieving techniques (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All donors had given consent for post-surgical use of their kidneys, and procedures on donated kidneys had been approved by an ethical committee. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 5 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Mesangial cells from passages 2–10 were cultured in Costar Corning 75-cm2 flasks. For experiments, mesangial cells were grown to confluence in Costar Corning 24-well plates or 25-cm2 flasks and then rendered quiescent in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h prior to use. All experiments were carried out in RPMI 1640 medium and 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells of the human monocyte/macrophage cell line U937 (ECCAC 85011440) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Preparation of U937 Cell-conditioned Medium–U937 cell-conditioned medium was prepared as described previously (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates–After removal of tissue culture supernatants, cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 250 μl of 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3 m NaCl and 1% Tween 20), and then incubated at room temperature for ∼30 min. The cell scrapings were transferred to 2-ml tubes, sonicated with a 5-s burst, and centrifuged for 1 min at 11,600 × g. Sonication and centrifugation were repeated, and the lysate supernatants were assayed for total cell protein. Culture of Mesangial Cells in the Presence of MPCM–Confluent, quiescent mesangial cells were exposed to a 50% solution of MPCM in the presence or absence the ACE-I perindoprilat (40 μm; a gift from Servier, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) or in the presence or absence of 500 nm receptor-associated protein (RAP; Calbiochem). The cultures were maintained under the various conditions for 1 or 3 days. The tissue culture supernatants were harvested and stored at –20 °C for subsequent analysis. For Northern analysis, mesangial cells were exposed to 50% MPCM with or without additions for ∼18 h prior to RNA processing. Fibronectin Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)–Culture supernatants were assayed for fibronectin as described previously (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LRP Binding Assay–This assay was adapted from the protocol described by Salicioni et al. (3Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 100 μl of 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Calbiochem) was immobilized on Costar Corning 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C. 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) was coated on parallel plates to serve as a negative control. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA for 1 h. Cell lysates from mesangial cells exposed to MPCM with or without ACE-I were added to the wells at dilutions of 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 and incubated for 2 h. Cell lysates were also incubated in parallel in the presence or absence of purified 4 nm α2-macroglobulin (Serotec, Oxford, UK). After washing the plates, any LRP in the lysates that bound to immobilized fibronectin was detected using a mouse anti-CD91 monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; Serotec), followed by incubation for 2 h. Bound primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000 dilution; DakoCytomation, Ely, UK), followed by incubation for 1 h. 1,2-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (DakoCytomation) was used as the chromogenic substrate as described for the fibronectin ELISA (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry–Confluent, quiescent mesangial cells were stimulated with MPCM with and without ACE-I for 18 h. Cell monolayers were washed with PBA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide), after which the cells were detached from the flask surface using trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). The cells were then washed with 5 ml of PBA buffer before being resuspended in either 50 μl of anti-CD91 antibody (1:10 dilution) or phosphate-buffered saline only. After a 40-min incubation on ice, the cells were washed twice with PBA buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig antibody (1:50 dilution; DakoCytomation). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody alone was used as a negative control. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were washed twice with PBA buffer and resuspended in 500 μl of PBA buffer for analysis of median fluorescence on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting–Cell monolayers from each well were scraped into 150 μl of nonreducing sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained. Briefly, the membranes were blocked with a 2% solution of BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membranes were then washed once with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 prior to incubation with an anti-LRP antibody (1:100 dilution) for at least 2 h at room temperature. After three more washes, the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins for at least 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed an additional three times before addition of chromogenic substrate (SIGMAFAST™ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablets). Protein Determination–The protein content of cell lysates dissolved in 1% Igepal was determined with a commercial Bio-Rad DC protein assay using BSA standards according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gelatin Zymography–Culture supernatants were mixed 1:1 with nondenaturing sample buffer and resolved at 4 °C on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 mg/ml gelatin (electrophoresis grade, 300 bloom; Sigma). The gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for ∼1 h, after which they were incubated overnight at 37 °C in pH 7.6 developer buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) Brij). The gels were then stained with Brilliant Blue R® (Sigma) and destained with a solution of 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Destained gels were dried, and bands of lysis were scanned using a Bio-Rad Model GS-700 imaging densitometer. Fibrinogen Zymography–Culture supernatants were mixed 1:1 with nondenaturing sample buffer and resolved at 4 °C on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 12 mg of fibrinogen (Calbiochem), 10 units of plasminogen (Calbiochem), and 10 units of thrombin (Calbiochem) per 10 ml of gel. Following electrophoresis, the gels were washed, incubated in developer buffer, and stained as described above for gelatin zymography. Northern Blotting–Northern analysis was carried out using a previously described method (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR–0.5-μg aliquots of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using an avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcription system (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was amplified using ReddyMix™ PCR Mastermix (ABgene, Surrey, UK) and 50 pmol of specific sense and antisense primers. Thermocycling conditions were optimized for each primer pair. Amplicons were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% Tris acetate/EDTA-agarose gels. Oligonucleotide Primers–RT-PCR of RNA extracted from mesangial cells stimulated with MPCM was carried out using the following primers (custom-made by Invitrogen): LRP, 5′-CCT ACT GGA CGC TGA CTT TGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGC CCC CCA TGT AGA GTG T-3′ (antisense) (6Guenette S.Y. Chang Y. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); MMP9, 5′-AAG TAC TGG CGA TTC TCT GAG GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGC TTT CTC TCG GTA CTG GAA GAC-3′ (antisense) (7Yan L.

Knowlden J. Davies M. Williams J.D. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ELISAs–Imulyse™ tPA ELISA and TintElize™ plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ELISA (Alpha Laboratories Ltd., Hampshire, UK) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics–Mesangial cell fibronectin levels were corrected for cell protein. Fibronectin levels are expressed as a percentage of the levels obtained with MPCM. Representative autoradiographs of Northern blots, photographs of agarose gels, or zymograms are shown, but densitometric analysis incorporated data from all experiments. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. For comparison of means between two groups, an unpaired t test was employed. To compare values between multiple groups, an analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction was applied. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. RAP is the most avid ligand of LRP (9Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as such binds to LRP at the expense of other ligands. To examine whether ACE-Is play a role in LRP-mediated binding or endocytosis of tPA, RAP (500 nm) was added to MPCM-injured cells in the presence or absence of the ACE-I perindoprilat. As observed previously (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the culture supernatants from MPCM-injured cells treated with ACE-I contained lower tPA levels than those from untreated cells. Addition of RAP resulted in the accumulation of tPA in mesangial cell supernatants, approximately doubling the levels compared with non-RAP-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Supernatant tPA levels were typically 8.37 ± 0.82 ng/ml (0.1 ng/μg of cell protein) in MPCM-injured cells and 1.63 ± 0.17 ng/ml (0.012 ng/μg of cell protein) in control cells, whereas cell lysate tPA levels were typically 27.1 ± 4.4 ng/ml (0.32 ng/μg of cell protein) in injured cells and 6.39 ± 1.1 ng/ml (0.07 ng/μg of cell protein) in control cells. RAP did not have the same cumulative effects on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. However, RAP did reverse the perindoprilat-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 lowering effects that we reported previously (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): MPCM, 2.81 ± 0.05 ng/μg of protein; MPCM + perindoprilat, 2.44 ± 0.05; MPCM + RAP, 2.81 ± 0.04; MPCM + perindoprilat + RAP, 2.9 ± 0.2; and medium alone, 2.4 ± 0.18 (n = 2). The tPA assay data were supported by fibrinogen gel zymography on culture supernatants, which showed an accumulation of tPA activity in the presence of RAP (Fig. 2). Mesangial cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of immunoreactive tPA to assess whether the apparent ACE-I-induced reduction of tPA levels in culture supernatants could be accounted for by binding to, or uptake by, mesangial cells. The results demonstrated that tPA levels in the lysates from cells treated with ACE-I were higher than those from untreated cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that uptake of tPA by mesangial cells was enhanced in the presence of ACE-I. As observed in the supernatants, lysate tPA levels were also higher in RAP-treated cells than in cells treated with MPCM alone. However, there was no significant difference in lysate tPA levels in ACE-I-treated cells regardless of whether they had been treated with RAP or not. The ability of perindoprilat to decrease MPCM-injured mesangial cell fibronectin levels was diminished in the presence of RAP, although RAP itself appeared to have no effect on the fibronectin levels in non-ACE-I-treated cells (Fig. 3). The fact that fibronectin levels were not further reduced in the presence of accumulated tPA suggests that tPA itself is not directly responsible for the observed fibronectin degradation as a result of its own protease activity or indirectly via plasmin and the subsequent activation of zymogens such as MMP2. Rather, it suggests that uptake of tPA results in the degradation of fibronectin perhaps via a mechanism downstream of tPA binding. It is possible that RAP-mediated inhibition of tPA binding results in reduced receptor signaling and diminution of the consequent downstream events that ultimately result in fibronectin degradation. We have observed previously that addition of exogenous tPA (100 ng/ml = 40 units/ml = 1.5 nm) to MPCM-stimulated mesangial cells resulted in a 15.34 ± 2.1% reduction in MPCM-induced fibronectin levels. 3I. Z. A. Pawluczyk, S. R. Patel, and K. P. G. Harris, unpublished data. In this study, the levels of accumulated tPA were of the order of 20 ng/ml and therefore probably insufficient to induce observable fibronectin degradation. tPA is known to signal as a cytokine via LRP, causing increased transcription of MMP9 (10Wang X. Lee S.-R. Arai K. Lee S.-R. Tsuji K. Rebeck G.W. Lo E.H. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 11Hu K. Yang J. Tanaka S. Gonias S.L. Mars W.M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out to assess mesangial cell expression of MMP9 and MMP2 mRNAs in response to ACE-I treatment. RT-PCR demonstrated that MMP9 mRNA levels were up-regulated in response to ACE-I (MPCM, 0.662 ± 0.105 arbitrary densitometric units; MPCM + ACE-I, *1.35 ± 0.27; and medium alone, 0.61 ± 0.2; *, p < 0.03 versus MPCM (n = 4)), whereas MMP2 mRNA levels appeared unaffected (Fig. 4A). However, gelatin zymography on culture supernatants from MPCM-injured, ACE-I-treated mesangial cells unexpectedly showed lower MMP9 activity compared with supernatants from non-ACE-I-treated cells (with reduction in the active form of MMP9 being particularly pronounced) (Fig. 4B). Co-incubation of MPCM-injured mesangial cells with and without ACE-I in the presence of RAP was able to at least restore ACE-I-reduced MMP9 activity (Fig. 4B). Because LRP can also function as a scavenger for MMP9 clearance (12Hahn-Dantona E. Ruiz J.F. Bornstein P. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), this may explain the observed reduction of MMP9 activity in supernatants from cells grown in the presence of ACE-I. In the presence of ACE-I, active MMP2 enzyme levels were slightly increased. Treatment with RAP appeared to have no effect on MMP2 activity. To confirm the role played by LRP in the anti-fibrotic actions of ACE-I, we wished to assess whether ACE-I treatment affects the surface expression of LRP. LRP is known to have a fibronectin-binding domain within its structure (3Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This property of LRP was exploited to see whether increased levels of LRP could be detected in mesangial cell lysates following ACE-I treatment. Our data demonstrated that lysates from ACE-I-treated cells were able to bind to immobilized fibronectin at higher dilutions than lysates from non-ACE-I-treated cells (Fig. 5A). (At the 1:50 dilution, lysates from ACE-I-treated cells bound significantly more fibronectin (p < 0.03) compared with non-ACE-I-treated cells. However, at the 1:100 dilution, there was no significant difference in the binding between treatments.) In the presence of α2-macroglobulin, which competes for binding to LRP, this dilution effect was attenuated (Fig. 5B). Flow cytometry using antibodies against LRP demonstrated that MPCM-injured cells bound 37% more anti-LRP antibody than did control cells but that cells treated with ACE-I bound 50% more than did control cells (Fig. 6A). Western blotting also reflected this small increase in LRP protein expression in response to ACE-I treatment (Fig. 6B). Northern blotting carried out on RNA extracted from cells following a 24-h exposure to MPCM in the presence or absence of ACE-I demonstrated that there was no change in LRP mRNA message expression at this time point (Fig. 7), possibly suggesting that ACE-I exerted its effect at the level of protein expression.FIGURE 7Effect of ACE-I on LRP mRNA expression.

Med, medium alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Until very recently, tPA had been regarded as an important component of the plasminogen activator system involved in the attenuation of extracellular matrix accumulation, leading to the reduction of fibrosis after renal injury. Indeed, it was in such a capacity that we tentatively ascribed the role of tPA when we demonstrated that the anti-fibrotic effects of ACE-I in mesangial cells are modulated via the bradykinin/plasminogen activator system axis (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that the role of tPA is far more complex, and as a result, the functional role of tPA has been dramatically revised. It is now believed that tPA also plays an important, plasmin-independent, stimulatory, cytokine-like role responsible for a diverse number of physiological functions, including the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation (13Welling T.H. Huber T.S. Messina L.M. Stanley J.C. J. Surg. Res. 1996; 66: 36-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), modulation of neuron apoptosis (14Flavin M.P. Zhao G. Ho L.T. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and transcriptional up-regulation of MMP9 (10Wang X. Lee S.-R. Arai K. Lee S.-R. Tsuji K. Rebeck G.W. Lo E.H. Nat.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It must be said, however, that the multifarious plasmin-dependent and -independent functions of tPA are not mutually exclusive. Among its many functions, LRP is able to control the “fibrotic status” of its immediate environment. It is involved in the catabolism of extracellular matrix protein such as fibronectin (3Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as well as the homeostasis of proteases such as tPA and MMP9 (1Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). LRP-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts have been shown to exhibit increased levels of cell-surface fibronectin without the biosynthesis of the matrix protein having been altered (3Salicioni A.M.

Similarly antagonism of LRP with RAP has been shown to increase fibronectin accumulation in wild-type fibroblasts. Transfection of full-length LRP into deficient cells has also been shown to decrease fibronectin levels (3Salicioni A.M. Mizelle K.S. Loukinova E. Mikhailenko I. Strickland D.K. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16160-16166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment with ACE-I resulted in altered LRP expression, which may have occurred post-transcriptionally because no changes in LRP mRNA levels were observed 24 h post-treatment. The apparent increase in surface expression of LRP as seen in the presence of MPCM compared with the control (medium alone) may be attributed to a decreased rate of receptor cycling that can occur in the presence of an injurious agent (15Weaver A.M. McCabe M. Kim I. Allieta M.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24894-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in this case, MPCM. This phenomenon may also contribute to the observed accumulation of fibronectin in the presence of MPCM, as reduced cycling would ultimately delay fibronectin degradation. ACE-I treatment may therefore facilitate an increase in LRP cycling rates or alter the subcellular distribution such that receptors are more rapidly translocated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of the cell, such as has been found previously in vascular smooth muscle cells following treatment with epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (15Weaver A.M. McCabe M. Kim I. Allieta M.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24894-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that treatment of murine fibroblasts with RAP causes an accumulation of MMP9 due to inhibition of the ability of LRP to scavenge MMP9 (11Hu K. Yang J. Tanaka S. Gonias S.L. Mars W.M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2120-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, we did not observe an accumulation of MMP9 in the presence of RAP, but rather an accumulation of tPA, suggesting that in our system RAP was blocking the binding and endocytosis of tPA and thereby the subsequent signaling required to up-regulate the expression of MMP9. We speculate that these increased levels of intracellular tPA could be the consequence of a RAP-induced deceleration of the receptor cycling process, resulting not only in an accumulation of extracellular tPA, but also in increased intracellular tPA as a result of a reduced rate of tPA degradation. We observed a paradoxical decrease in MMP9 activity in ACE-I-treated, MPCM-injured mesangial cells, which was at least restored upon treatment with RAP. This suggests that increased LRP surface expression, as well as resulting in increased MMP9 mRNA expression, may also be responsible for an increased rate of MMP9 protein scavenging from the culture supernatants. This observation suggests that a dynamic balance exists between tPA binding and signaling, leading to the up-regulation of MMP9 expression, and tPA and MMP9 endocytosis, leading to clearance of the proteases via the same receptor. MMP2 mRNA levels did not appear to be affected by ACE-I treatment. The change in enzyme activity therefore probably represents a post-translational change in preformed zymogen levels. Whether the ACE-I-mediated effects on LRP expression are the result of a direct action of ACE-I molecules on LRP or are the consequent downstream effects of ACE-I-induced tPA acting as a cytokine via LRP remains to be determined. The dose of 40 μm perindoprilat used in this study was based upon a dose-response curve carried out for a previous study (4Pawluczyk I.Z.A. Patel S.R. Harris K.P.G. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1240-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This equates to a concentration of 14.7 μg/ml, which is higher than the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of either perindopril (prodrug) or perindoprilat typically observed following a single 4-mg dose in a human subject (64 ng/ml and 4.7 mg/ml, respectively) (16Hurst M. Jarvis B. Drugs. 2001; 61: 867-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although patients can receive up to 8 mg/day. However, direct in vivo and in vitro comparisons are problematic because the pharmacokinetics of a drug in cell culture will be different from those of the same drug in a human subject. Moreover, patients are dosed daily over long periods of time, whereas the cells in this study were exposed to a single dose for 1 or 3 days. Whether the observed in vitro effects also occur in human patients receiving perindopril is still to be fully determined. However, this study has identified LRP as a possible target of ACE-I action and provides a platform for future research. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that ACE-I treatment results in the modulation of mesangial cell-surface expression of LRP, potentially allowing for increased fibronectin catabolism and tPA binding and signaling, beneficial anti-fibrotic effects that are independent of ACE-I hemodynamic actions."
https://openalex.org/W2041539153,"THE article by Muirhead-Thomson1 on D.D.T. and Anopheles gamibiœ adds support to my belief that the same conclusions may apply to A. maculipennis varieties. During service in Italy in 1944 and 1945, I was concerned with the effect of D.D.T. in areas where A. maculipennis var. labranchiœ and var. typicus were the common varieties. Mosquito catches, and other observations, made in areas where ‘domestic’ resting places had been treated with 5 per cent D.D.T. in kerosene, suggested that control was not so complete as at first appeared. None of this evidence was conclusive, but it did indicate that the fall in mosquito numbers seen in houses treated with D.D.T. did not represent a comparable reduction in the total mosquito population of the area. It suggested to me a repellent rather than a lethal action of D.D.T."
