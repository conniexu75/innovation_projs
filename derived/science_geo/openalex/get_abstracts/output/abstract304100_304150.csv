https://openalex.org/W2026156098,"An isochoric cooling method for obtaining unprecedented tensions on liquids was used to determine the homogeneous nucleation limit for stretching of water at a variety of water densities. At densities in the range 0.55 to 0.68 gram per milliliter (g/ml), the data agree with the homogeneous nucleation temperatures measured by Skripov for superheated water at positive pressures. At densities between 0.68 and 0.93 g/ml, cavitation occurred only at negative pressures (that is, under tension). The cavitation tensions measured were in excellent agreement with those predicted by Fisher's 1948 vapor nucleation theory. A maximum tension of 140 megapascals (=1400 bars) was reached at 42°C, which lies on an extrapolation of the line of isobaric density maxima. At higher densities, cavitation of droplets that survived heterogeneous nucleation failed to occur at all unless provoked, at much lower temperatures, by freezing. This observation confirms the existence of a density maximum at 42°C and –140 megapascals and hence greatly strengthens the basis for Speedy's conjecture of a reentrant spinodal for water."
https://openalex.org/W2008504724,"Quantitative theories of superconductivity in alkali-doped C(60) require an accurate and detailed description of the Fermi surface. First-principles calculations of Fermi-surface properties and electronic parameters for K(3)C(60), the prototype fulleride-superconductor, are reported. The Fermi surface has two sheets; the first is free-electron-like, and the second is multiply-connected, forming two interlocked symmetry-equivalent pieces that never touch. The calculated (clean limit) London penetration depth is Lambda = 1600 A. Comparing the Fermi velocity with the experimental coherence length leads to a superconducting pairing strength lambda approximately 5, indicating very strong coupling. Partial nesting in the second Fermi-surface sheet may favor coupling to short-wavelength q,0,0 optic modes."
https://openalex.org/W2056330934,"The appearance of superconductivity at relatively high temperatures in alkali metal-doped C(60) fullerene provides the challenge to both understand the nature and origin of the superconductivity and to determine the upper limit of the superconducting transition temperature (T(c)). Towards the latter goal, it is shown that doping with potassium-thallium and rubidium-thallium alloys in the 400 to 430 degrees C temperature range increases the T(c) of C(60)/C(70) mixtures to 25.6 K and above 45 K, respectively. Similar increases in T(c) were also observed upon analogous doping of pure C(60). Partial substitution of potassium with thallium in interstitial sites between C(60) molecules is suggested by larger observed unit cell parameters than for the K(3)C(60) and K(4)C(60) phases. Contrary to previous results for C(60) doped with different alkali metals, such expansion does not alone account for the changes in critical temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2166348724,"There is currently considerable debate
about the treatment of natural hybrids in
conservation legislation. The hybrid policy
recently advocated by Stephen J. O'Brien and
Ernst Mayr (Perspective, 8 Mar. 1991, p.
1187) is to 'discourage hybridization between
species. This policy is based on examples of
animals in which hybridization is thought
not to have played a significant evolutionary
role. In contrast, we argue that plant hybrid
zones are hot spots of ecological and evolutionary
activity and should be conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2069630341,"Many volcanoes emerge from the flank (footwall) of normal faults in continental rift zones. Because such locations are commonly topographically high and exhibit minor compressional structures, the association is enigmatic. A simple flexing plate model shows that deformation of a flexurally supported upper crust during normal faulting generates a dilational strain field in the footwall at the base of the crust. This strain field allows cracking and tapping of preexisting melt."
https://openalex.org/W2063179904,"Most discussion of U.S. competitiveness misstates the problem, focusing on the trade deficit and on fears that an economy whose productivity lags that of its rivals will face economic disaster. In fact, strong automatic forces ensure that the U.S. economy will remain in business and indeed roughly balance its trade even if its productivity performance is dismal. The real issue is the effect of international competition on the mix of goods that the U.S. economy produces. In some industries high productivity is an effect as well as a cause of international competitiveness. There is an intellectually respectable but politically problematic case for government action to create or preserve advantage in such industries."
https://openalex.org/W2082465921,"Tiltmeters on the Arctic Ocean were used to measure flexure of the ice forced by an energetic packet of internal waves riding the crest of diurnal internal bores emanating from the Yermak Plateau, north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The waves forced an oscillatory excursion of 36 microradians in tilt of the ice, corresponding to an excursion of 16 micrometers per second in vertical velocity at the surface and of 3.5 millimeters in surface displacement. Strainmeters embedded in the ice measured an excursion of 3 x 10(-7) in strain, consistent with ice flexure rather than compression. The measured tilt is consistent with direct measurements of excursions in horizontal current near the surface (12 centimeters per second) and in vertical displacement (36 meters) of the pycnocline 100 meters below the surface."
