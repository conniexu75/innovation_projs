https://openalex.org/W2413537610,"Numerous studies signify that diets rich in phytochemicals offer many beneficial functions specifically during pathologic conditions, yet their effects are often not uniform due to inter-individual variation. The host indigenous gut microbiota and their modifications of dietary phytochemicals have emerged as factors that greatly influence the efficacy of phytoceutical-based intervention. Here, we investigated the biological activities of one such active microbial metabolite, Urolithin A (UA or 3,8-dihydroxybenzo[c]chromen-6-one), which is derived from the ellagic acid (EA). Our study demonstrates that UA potently inhibits heme peroxidases i.e. myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO) when compared to the parent compound EA. In addition, chrome azurol S (CAS) assay suggests that EA, but not UA, is capable of binding to Fe3+, due to its catechol-like structure, although its modest heme peroxidase inhibitory activity is abrogated upon Fe3+-binding. Interestingly, UA-mediated MPO and LPO inhibition can be prevented by innate immune protein human NGAL or its murine ortholog lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), implying the complex nature of host innate immunity-microbiota interactions. Spectral analysis indicates that UA inhibits heme peroxidase-catalyzed reaction by reverting the peroxidase back to its inactive native state. In support of these in vitro results, UA significantly reduced phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced superoxide generation in neutrophils, however, EA failed to block the superoxide generation. Treatment with UA significantly reduced PMA-induced mouse ear edema and MPO activity compared to EA treated mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that microbiota-mediated conversion of EA to UA is advantageous to both host and microbiota i.e. UA-mediated inhibition of pro-oxidant enzymes reduce tissue inflammation, mitigate non-specific killing of gut bacteria, and abrogate iron-binding property of EA, thus providing a competitive edge to the microbiota in acquiring limiting nutrient iron and thrive in the gut."
https://openalex.org/W2411667387,"Objective Several intervention studies have suggested that vegetarian or vegan diets have clinical benefits, particularly in terms of glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted in Asians who more commonly depend on plant-based foods, as compared to Western populations. Here, we aimed to compare the effect of a vegan diet and conventional diabetic diet on glycemic control among Korean individuals. Materials and Methods Participants diagnosed with T2D were randomly assigned to follow either a vegan diet (excluding animal-based food including fish; n = 46) or a conventional diet recommended by the Korean Diabetes Association 2011 (n = 47) for 12 weeks. HbA1c levels were measured at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and the primary study endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels over 12 weeks. Results The mean HbA1c levels at weeks 0, 4, and 12 were 7.7%, 7.2%, and 7.1% in the vegan group, and 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.2% in the conventional group, respectively. Although both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1C levels, the reductions were larger in the vegan group than in the conventional group (-0.5% vs. -0.2%; p-for-interaction = 0.017). When only considering participants with high compliance, the difference in HbA1c level reduction between the groups was found to be larger (-0.9% vs. -0.3%). The beneficial effect of vegan diets was noted even after adjusting for changes in total energy intake or waist circumference over the 12 weeks. Conclusion Both diets led to reductions in HbA1c levels; however, glycemic control was better with the vegan diet than with the conventional diet. Thus, the dietary guidelines for patients with T2D should include a vegan diet for the better management and treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of a vegan diet, and to identify potential explanations of the underlying mechanisms. Trial Registration CRiS KCT0001771"
https://openalex.org/W2418227629,"To investigate if a virtual laboratory simulation (vLAB) could be used to replace a face to face tutorial (demonstration) to prepare students for a laboratory exercise in microbiology.A total of 189 students who were participating in an undergraduate biology course were randomly selected into a vLAB or demonstration condition. In the vLAB condition students could use a vLAB at home to 'practice' streaking out bacteria on agar plates in a virtual environment. In the demonstration condition students were given a live demonstration from a lab tutor showing them how to streak out bacteria on agar plates. All students were blindly assessed on their ability to perform the streaking technique in the physical lab, and were administered a pre and post-test to determine their knowledge of microbiology, intrinsic motivation to study microbiology, and self-efficacy in the field of microbiology prior to, and after the experiment.The results showed that there were no significant differences between the two groups on their lab scores, and both groups had similar increases in knowledge of microbiology, intrinsic motivation to study microbiology, as well as self-efficacy in the field of microbiology.Our data show that vLABs function just as well as face to face tutorials in preparing students for a physical lab activity in microbiology. The results imply that vLABs could be used instead of face to face tutorials, and a combination of virtual and physical lab exercises could be the future of science education."
https://openalex.org/W2435676900,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate solubilizing Pseudomonas bacteria (PSB) could potentially interact synergistically because PSB solubilize phosphate into a form that AMF can absorb and transport to the plant. However, very little is known about the interactions between these two groups of microorganisms and how they influence the growth of each other. We tested whether different strains of bacteria, that have the capacity to solubilize phosphate, are able to grow along AMF hyphae and differentially influence the growth of AMF both outside the roots of carrot in in vitro conditions and inside the roots of potato in the presence of a microbial community. We found strong effects of AMF on the growth of the different bacterial strains. Different bacterial strains also had very strong effects on the growth of AMF extraradical hyphae outside the roots of carrot and on colonization of potato roots by AMF. The differential effects on colonization occurred in the presence of a microbial community. Our results show that these two important groups of rhizosphere microorganisms indeed interact with each other. Such interactions could potentially lead to synergistic effects between the two groups but this could depend on whether the bacteria truly solubilize phosphate in the rhizosphere in the presence of microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2416536680,"The themes of qualitative assessments that characterize the experience of family members offered the choice of observing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of a loved one have not been formally identified.In the context of a multicenter randomized clinical trial offering family members the choice of observing CPR of a patient with sudden cardiac arrest, a qualitative analysis, with a sequential explanatory design, was conducted. The aim of the study was to understand family members' experience during CPR. All participants were interviewed by phone at home three months after cardiac arrest. Saturation was reached after analysis of 30 interviews of a randomly selected sample of 75 family members included in the trial. Four themes were identified: 1- choosing to be actively involved in the resuscitation; 2- communication between the relative and the emergency care team; 3- perception of the reality of the death, promoting acceptance of the loss; 4- experience and reactions of the relatives who did or did not witness the CPR, describing their feelings. Twelve sub-themes further defining these four themes were identified. Transferability of our findings should take into account the country-specific medical system.Family presence can help to ameliorate the pain of the death, through the feeling of having helped to support the patient during the passage from life to death and of having participated in this important moment. Our results showed the central role of communication between the family and the emergency care team in facilitating the acceptance of the reality of death."
https://openalex.org/W2439556313,"Despite the importance of stony corals in many research fields related to global issues, such as marine ecology, climate change, paleoclimatogy, and metazoan evolution, very little is known about the evolutionary origin of coral skeleton formation. In order to investigate the evolution of coral biomineralization, we have identified skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) in the skeletal proteome of the scleractinian coral, Acropora digitifera, for which large genomic and transcriptomic datasets are available. Scrupulous gene annotation was conducted based on comparisons of functional domain structures among metazoans. We found that SOMPs include not only coral-specific proteins, but also protein families that are widely conserved among cnidarians and other metazoans. We also identified several conserved transmembrane proteins in the skeletal proteome. Gene expression analysis revealed that expression of these conserved genes continues throughout development. Therefore, these genes are involved not only skeleton formation, but also in basic cellular functions, such as cell-cell interaction and signaling. On the other hand, genes encoding coral-specific proteins, including extracellular matrix domain-containing proteins, galaxins, and acidic proteins, were prominently expressed in post-settlement stages, indicating their role in skeleton formation. Taken together, the process of coral skeleton formation is hypothesized as: 1) formation of initial extracellular matrix between epithelial cells and substrate, employing pre-existing transmembrane proteins; 2) additional extracellular matrix formation using novel proteins that have emerged by domain shuffling and rapid molecular evolution and; 3) calcification controlled by coral-specific SOMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2413443807,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in childhood. OS is an aggressive disease, and metastatic patients evolve with very poor clinical outcomes. Genetically, OSs are extremely complex tumors, and the related metastatic process is not well understood in terms of the biology of the disease. In this context, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators that play key roles in the invasion and metastasis of several human tumors. Here, we evaluated the expression of HULC, which is an lncRNA that is associated with the tumor metastatic process, and assessed its potential role as a prognostic marker in OS. HULC expression was evaluated in primary OS samples using real-time RT-PCR. HULC expression status was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and its association with survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The HULC expression level was not significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the OS patients. However, our data demonstrated that higher levels of expression of HULC were associated with lower survival rates in OS patients, both in terms of overall and event-free survival. Elevated HULC expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes among the OS patients, which suggests that HULC could be a potential prognostic biomarker in OS."
https://openalex.org/W2414891922,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in the treatment of oral candidiasis in a murine model using Photodithazine® (PDZ). This model of oral candidiasis was developed to allow the monitoring of the infection and the establishment of the aPDT treatment. Six-week-old female mice were immunosuppressed and inoculated with C. albicans to induce oral candidiasis. PDZ-mediated aPDT and nystatin treatment were carried out for 5 consecutive days with one application per day. The macroscopic evaluation of oral lesions was performed. After each treatment, the tongue was swabbed to recover C. albicans cells. Viable colonies were quantified and the number of CFU/ml determined. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours and 7 days after treatment and the tongues were surgically removed for histological analysis and analysis of inflammatory cytokines expression (IL-1, TNF-α and IL-6) by RT-qPCR. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. PDZ-mediated aPDT was as effective as Nystatin (NYS group) in the inactivation of C. albicans, reducing 3 and 3.2 logs10 respectively, 24 h after treatment (p<0.05). Animals underwent PDZ-mediated aPDT showed complete remission of oral lesions, while animals treated with NYS presented partial remission of oral lesions in both periods assessed. Histological evaluation revealed mild inflammatory infiltrate in the groups treated with aPDT and NYS in both periods assessed. The aPDT induced the TNF-α expression when compared with the control (P-L-) (p<0.05), 24 h and 7 days after treatment. In summary, the murine model developed here was able to mimic the infection and PDZ-mediated aPDT was effective to treat mice with oral candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2410002917,"A causal link between decreases in white matter (WM) integrity and cortical degeneration is assumed, but there is scarce knowledge on the relationship between these changes across the adult human lifespan. We investigated changes in thickness throughout the cortical mantle and WM tract integrity derived from T1 and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in 201 healthy adults aged 23–87 years over a mean interval of 3.6 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivity changes were calculated for forceps minor and major and eight major white matter tracts in each hemisphere by use of a novel automated longitudinal tractography constrained by underlying anatomy (TRACULA) approach. We hypothesized that increasing MD and decreasing FA across tracts would relate to cortical thinning, with some anatomical specificity. WM integrity decreased across tracts non-uniformly, with mean annual percentage decreases ranging from 0.20 in the Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus to 0.65 in the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus. For most tracts, greater MD increases and FA decreases related to more cortical thinning, in areas in part overlapping with but also outside the projected tract endings. The findings indicate a combination of global and tract-specific relationships between WM integrity and cortical thinning."
https://openalex.org/W2412983935,"The remote estimation of a region's population has for decades been a key application of geographic information science in demography. Most studies have used 2D data (maps, satellite imagery) to estimate population avoiding field surveys and questionnaires. As the availability of semantic 3D city models is constantly increasing, we investigate to what extent they can be used for the same purpose. Based on the assumption that housing space is a proxy for the number of its residents, we use two methods to estimate the population with 3D city models in two directions: (1) disaggregation (areal interpolation) to estimate the population of small administrative entities (e.g. neighbourhoods) from that of larger ones (e.g. municipalities); and (2) a statistical modelling approach to estimate the population of large entities from a sample composed of their smaller ones (e.g. one acquired by a government register). Starting from a complete Dutch census dataset at the neighbourhood level and a 3D model of all 9.9 million buildings in the Netherlands, we compare the population estimates obtained by both methods with the actual population as reported in the census, and use it to evaluate the quality that can be achieved by estimations at different administrative levels. We also analyse how the volume-based estimation enabled by 3D city models fares in comparison to 2D methods using building footprints and floor areas, as well as how it is affected by different levels of semantic detail in a 3D city model. We conclude that 3D city models are useful for estimations of large areas (e.g. for a country), and that the 3D approach has clear advantages over the 2D approach."
https://openalex.org/W2412641479,"Background Both intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) and moyamoya disease (MMD) are prevalent in Asians. We hypothesized that the Ring Finger protein 213 gene polymorphism (RNF213), a susceptibility locus for MMD in East Asians, is also a susceptibility gene for ICAS in patients whose diagnosis had been confirmed by conventional angiography (absence of basal collaterals) and high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI, presence of plaque). Methods We analyzed 532 consecutive patients with ischemic events in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution and relevant stenotic lesion on the distal internal carotid artery or proximal MCA, but no demonstrable carotid or cardiac embolism sources. Additional angiography was performed on 370 (69.5%) patients and HR-MRI on 283 (53.2%) patients. Results Based on angiographic and HR-MRI findings, 234 patients were diagnosed with ICAS and 288 with MMD. The RNF213 variant was observed in 50 (21.4%) ICAS patients and in 119 (69.1%) MMD patients. The variant was observed in 25.2% of patients with HR-MRI-confirmed ICAS. Similarly, 15.8% of ICAS patients in whom MMD was excluded by angiography had this variant. Among the ICAS patients, RNF213 variant carriers were younger and more likely to have a family history of MMD than non-carriers were. Multivariate testing showed that only the age of ICAS onset was independently associated with the RNF213 variant (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.944–0.99). Conclusions RNF213 is a susceptibility gene not only for MMD but also for ICAS in East Asians. Further studies are needed on RNF213 variants in ICAS patients outside East Asian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2418542973,"In staphylococci, quorum sensing regulates both biofilm formation and toxin production, moreover it has been demonstrated to be inhibited by RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP). Aim our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity and its in vivo efficacy of the combined administration of FS10, a novel RIP derivative, and tigecycline in an animal model of methicillin-resistant (MR) and methicillin-sensitive (MS) Staphylococcus aureus wound infection. Using a 1.x2 cm template, one full thickness wound was established through the panniculus carnosus on the back subcutaneous tissue of each animal. Infection was determined by inoculation of 5x107 CFU/ml of bacteria, that produced an abscess within 24 h, after this, treatment was initiated. The study included, for each strain, a control group without infection, a control infected group that did not receive any treatment and a control infected group with drug-free foam dressing, and three infected groups treated, respectively, with: FS10-soaked foam dressing (containing 20 μg FS10), daily intraperitoneal tigecycline (7 mg/Kg), FS10-soaked foam dressing (containing 20 μg FS10) and daily intraperitoneal injections of tigecycline (7 mg/Kg). The main outcome measures were quantitative culture and histological examination of tissue repair. The highest inhibition of infection was achieved in the group that received FS10-soaked and parenteral tigecycline reducing the bacterial load from 107 CFU/ml to about 103 CFU/g for MSSA and to about 104 CFU/g for MRSA. The group treated with FS10-soaked foam dressing associated with parenteral tigecycline showed, histologically, better overall healing with epithelialization and collagen scores significantly higher than those of the other groups in both strains. In conclusion, the combined use of topical FS10 with i.p. tigecycline induced positive interaction in vivo, resulting in an enhanced therapeutic benefit versus staphylococcal infections in murine wound models."
https://openalex.org/W2412789074,"CD44 is a transmembrane hyaluronic acid receptor gene that encodes over 100 different tissue-specific protein isoforms. The most ubiquitous, CD44 standard, has been used as a cancer stem cell marker in ovarian and other cancers. Expression of the epithelial CD44 variant containing exons v8-10 (CD44v8-10) has been associated with more chemoresistant and metastatic tumors in gastrointestinal and breast cancers, but its role in ovarian cancer is unknown; we therefore investigated its use as a prognostic marker in this disease. The gene expression profiles of 254 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas RNAseqV2 were analyzed for the presence of CD44 isoforms. A trend for longer survival was observed in patients with high expression of CD44 isoforms that include exons v8-10. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumors for presence of CD44v8-10 was performed on an independent cohort of 210 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer using a tumor tissue microarray. Patient stratification based on software analysis of staining revealed a statistically significant increase in survival in patients with the highest levels of transmembrane protein expression (top 10 or 20%) compared to those with the lowest expression (bottom 10 and 20%) (p = 0.0181, p = 0.0262 respectively). Expression of CD44v8-10 in primary ovarian cancer cell lines was correlated with a predominantly epithelial phenotype characterized by high expression of epithelial markers and low expression of mesenchymal markers by qPCR, Western blot, and IHC. Conversely, detection of proteolytically cleaved and soluble extracellular domain of CD44v8-10 in patient ascites samples was correlated with significantly worse prognosis (p<0.05). Therefore, presence of transmembrane CD44v8-10 on the surface of primary tumor cells may be a marker of a highly epithelial tumor with better prognosis while enzymatic cleavage of CD44v8-10, as detected by presence of the soluble extracellular domain in ascites fluid, may be indicative of a more metastatic disease and worse prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2411713875,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), often caused by a concussive impact to the head, affects an estimated 1.7 million Americans annually. With no approved drugs, its pharmacological treatment represents a significant and currently unmet medical need. In our prior development of the anti-cholinesterase compound phenserine for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, we recognized that it also possesses non-cholinergic actions with clinical potential. Here, we demonstrate neuroprotective actions of phenserine in neuronal cultures challenged with oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity, two insults of relevance to TBI. These actions translated into amelioration of spatial and visual memory impairments in a mouse model of closed head mild TBI (mTBI) two days following cessation of clinically translatable dosing with phenserine (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg BID x 5 days initiated post mTBI) in the absence of anti-cholinesterase activity. mTBI elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of oxidative stress. Phenserine counteracted this by augmenting homeostatic mechanisms to mitigate oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase [SOD] 1 and 2, and glutathione peroxidase [GPx], the activity and protein levels of which were measured by specific assays. Microarray analysis of hippocampal gene expression established that large numbers of genes were exclusively regulated by each individual treatment with a substantial number of them co-regulated between groups. Molecular pathways associated with lipid peroxidation were found to be regulated by mTBI, and treatment of mTBI animals with phenserine effectively reversed injury-induced regulations in the 'Blalock Alzheimer's Disease Up' pathway. Together these data suggest that multiple phenserine-associated actions underpin this compound's ability to ameliorate cognitive deficits caused by mTBI, and support the further evaluation of the compound as a therapeutic for TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2418185465,"The worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases is increasing, and there are global recommendations to limit consumption of certain nutrients, especially saturated lipids. Insulin resistance, a common trait occurring in obesity and type 2 diabetes, is associated with intestinal lipoprotein overproduction. However, the mechanisms by which the intestine develops insulin resistance in response to lipid overload remain unknown. Here, we show that insulin inhibits triglyceride secretion and intestinal microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression in vivo in healthy mice force-fed monounsaturated fatty acid-rich olive oil but not in mice force-fed saturated fatty acid-rich palm oil. Moreover, when mouse intestine and human Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes were treated with the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, the insulin-signaling pathway was impaired. We show that palmitic acid or palm oil increases ceramide production in intestinal cells and that treatment with a ceramide analogue partially reproduces the effects of palmitic acid on insulin signaling. In Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes, ceramide effects on insulin-dependent AKT phosphorylation are mediated by protein kinase C but not by protein phosphatase 2A. Finally, inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis improves the response of palmitic acid-treated Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes to insulin. These results demonstrate that a palmitic acid-ceramide pathway accounts for impaired intestinal insulin sensitivity, which occurs within several hours following initial lipid exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2408762395,"Lack of reliable techniques for large-scale monitoring of disease-transmitting mosquitoes is a major public health challenge, especially where advanced geo-information systems are not regularly applicable. We tested an innovative crowd-sourcing approach, which relies simply on knowledge and experiences of residents to rapidly predict areas where disease-transmitting mosquitoes are most abundant. Guided by community-based resource persons, we mapped boundaries and major physical features in three rural Tanzanian villages. We then selected 60 community members, taught them basic map-reading skills, and offered them gridded maps of their own villages (grid size: 200m×200m) so they could identify locations where they believed mosquitoes were most abundant, by ranking the grids from one (highest density) to five (lowest density). The ranks were interpolated in ArcGIS-10 (ESRI-USA) using inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, and re-classified to depict areas people believed had high, medium and low mosquito densities. Finally, we used odor-baited mosquito traps to compare and verify actual outdoor mosquito densities in the same areas. We repeated this process for 12 months, each time with a different group of 60 residents. All entomological surveys depicted similar geographical stratification of mosquito densities in areas classified by community members as having high, medium and low vector abundance. These similarities were observed when all mosquito species were combined, and also when only malaria vectors were considered. Of the 12,412 mosquitoes caught, 60.9% (7,555) were from areas considered by community members as having high mosquito densities, 28% (3,470) from medium density areas, and 11.2% (1,387) from low density areas. This study provides evidence that we can rely on community knowledge and experiences to identify areas where mosquitoes are most abundant or least abundant, even without entomological surveys. This crowd-sourcing method could be further refined and validated to improve community-based planning of mosquito control operations at low-cost."
https://openalex.org/W2416351465,"Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae strains vary considerably in their ability to cause invasive disease in humans, which is at least in part determined by the capsular serotype. Platelets have been implicated as sentinel cells in the circulation for host defence. One of their utensils for this function is the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We here aimed to investigate platelet response to S. pneumoniae and a role for TLRs herein. Platelets were stimulated using four serotypes of S. pneumonia including an unencapsulated mutant strain. In vitro aggregation and flow cytometry assays were performed using blood of healthy volunteers, or blood of TLR knock out and WT mice. For in vivo pneumonia experiments, platelet specific Myd88 knockout (Plt-Myd88-/-) mice were used. We found that platelet aggregation was induced by unencapsulated S. pneumoniae only. Whole blood incubation with all S. pneumoniae serotypes tested resulted in platelet degranulation and platelet-leukocyte complex formation. Platelet activation was TLR independent, as responses were not inhibited by TLR blocking antibodies, not induced by TLR agonists and were equally induced in wild-type and Tlr2-/-, Tlr4-/-, Tlr2/4-/-, Tlr9-/- and Myd88-/- blood. Plt-Myd88-/- and control mice displayed no differences in bacterial clearance or immune response to pneumonia by unencapsulated S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae activates platelets through a TLR-independent mechanism that is impeded by the bacterial capsule. Additionally, platelet MyD88-dependent TLR signalling is not involved in host defence to unencapsulated S. pneumoniae in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2410371869,"Food neophobia is a reaction to novel food observed in many animal species, particularly omnivores, including Rattus norvegicus. A neophobic reaction is typically characterised by avoidance of novel food and the necessity to assess both its potential value and toxicity by the animal. It has been hypothesised that this reaction is not observed in rats inhabiting a changeable environment with a high level of variability with regard to food and food sources. This study was conducted in such changeable conditions and it aims to demonstrate the behaviour of wild rats R. norvegicus in their natural habitat. The rats were studied in a farm setting, and the experimental arena was demarcated by a specially constructed pen which was freely accessible to the rats. At regular intervals, the rats were given new flavour- and smell-altered foods, while their behaviour was video-recorded. The results obtained in the study seem to confirm the hypothesis that rats inhabiting a highly changeable environment do not exhibit food neophobia. The observed reaction to novel food may be connected with a reaction to a novel object to a larger extent than to food neophobia. The value of the results obtained lies primarily in the fact that the study was conducted in the animals' natural habitat, and that it investigated their spontaneous behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2413604717,"At high latitudes, the climate has warmed at twice the rate of the global average with most changes observed in autumn, winter and spring. Increasing winter temperatures and wide temperature fluctuations are leading to more frequent rain-on-snow events and freeze-thaw cycles causing snow compaction and formation of ice layers in the snowpack, thus creating ice encasement (IE). By decreasing the snowpack insulation capacity and restricting soil-atmosphere gas exchange, modification of the snow properties may lead to colder soil but also to hypoxia and accumulation of trace gases in the subnivean environment. To test the effects of these overwintering conditions changes on plant winter survival and growth, we established a snow manipulation experiment in a coniferous forest in Northern Finland with Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings. In addition to ambient conditions and prevention of IE, we applied three snow manipulation levels: IE created by artificial rain-on-snow events, snow compaction and complete snow removal. Snow removal led to deeper soil frost during winter, but no clear effect of IE or snow compaction done in early winter was observed on soil temperature. Hypoxia and accumulation of CO2 were highest in the IE plots but, more importantly, the duration of CO2 concentration above 5% was 17 days in IE plots compared to 0 days in ambient plots. IE was the most damaging winter condition for both species, decreasing the proportion of healthy seedlings by 47% for spruce and 76% for pine compared to ambient conditions. Seedlings in all three treatments tended to grow less than seedlings in ambient conditions but only IE had a significant effect on spruce growth. Our results demonstrate a negative impact of winter climate change on boreal forest regeneration and productivity. Changing snow conditions may thus partially mitigate the positive effect of increasing growing season temperatures on boreal forest productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2412179400,"Large numbers of dead seals with characteristic spiral lesions have been washing ashore around the North Atlantic over the past two decades. Interactions with ship propellers and shark predation have been suggested as the likely causal mechanisms. However, new evidence points towards a more likely candidate: grey seal predation. An adult male grey seal was observed and recorded catching, killing and eating five weaned grey seal pups over a period of one week on the Isle of May, Scotland. A further 9 carcasses found in the same area exhibited similar injuries. Post mortem analysis of lesions indicated the wound characteristics were similar to each other and in 12 of the 14 carcasses analysed, were indistinguishable from carcasses previously attributed to propeller interaction. We therefore propose that most of the seal carcasses displaying spiral lacerations in the UK are caused by grey seal predation. Cases in other locations should be re-evaluated using the scoring system presented here to identify whether grey seal predation is a major cause of mortality in phocid seals."
https://openalex.org/W2412397707,"The chemical induction of diabetes with STZ has gained popularity because of the relative ease of rendering normal animals diabetic. Insulin substitution is required in STZ-rats in long-term studies to avoid ketoacidosis and consequently loss of animals. Aim of the present studies was to test different insulin preparations and different ways of administration in their ability to reduce blood glucose in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Single dosing of the long-acting insulin analogue glargine was able to dose-dependently reduce blood glucose over 4 h towards normoglycemia in STZ-treated rats. However, this effect was not sustained until 8 h post injection. A more sustained glucose-lowering effect was achieved using insulin-releasing implants. In STZ-rats, 1 insulin implant moderately lowered blood glucose levels 10 days after implantation, while 2 implants induced normoglycemia over the whole day. According to the glucose-lowering effect 1 as well as 2 insulin implants significantly reduced HbA1c measured after 26 days of implantation. In line with the improved glucose homeostasis due to the implants, urinary glucose excretion was also blunted in STZ-treated rats with 2 implants. Since diabetic nephropathy is one of the complications of longterm diabetes, renal function was characterized in the STZ-rat model. Increases in creatinine clearance and urinary albumin excretion resemble early signs of diabetic nephropathy. These functional abnormalities of the kidney could clearly be corrected with insulin-releasing implants 27 days after implantation. The data show that diabetic STZ-rats respond to exogenous insulin with regard to glucose levels as well as kidney parameters and a suitable dose of insulin implants for glucose control was established. This animal model together with the insulin dosing regimen is suitable to address diabetes-induced early diabetic nephropathy and also to study combination therapies with insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2418653358,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces release of inflammatory mediators both in immune and epithelial cells. We investigated whether changes of epigenetic marks, including selected histone modification and DNA methylation, may drive or accompany the activation of COX-2 gene in HT-29 human intestinal epithelial cells upon exposure to LPS. Here we describe cyclical histone acetylation (H3), methylation (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27) and DNA methylation changes occurring at COX-2 gene promoter overtime after LPS stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2410998316,"Mouthparts are among the most important sensory and feeding structures in insects and comparative morphological study may help explain differences in feeding behavior and diet breadth among species. The spotted lanternfly Lycorma delicatula (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae) is a polyphagous agricultural pest originating in China, recently established and becoming widespread in Korea, and more recently introduced into eastern North America. It causes severe economic damage by sucking phloem sap and the sugary excrement produced by nymphs and adults serves as a medium for sooty mold. To facilitate future study of feeding mechanisms in this insect, the fine-structural morphology of mouthparts focusing on the distribution of sensilla located on the labium in adult L. delicatula was observed using a scanning electron microscope. The mouthparts consist of a small cone-shaped labrum, a tubular labium and a stylet fascicle consisting of two inner interlocked maxillary stylets partially surrounded by two shorter mandibular stylets similar to those found in other hemipteran insects. The five-segmented labium is unusual (most other Fulgoromorpha have four segments) and is provided with several types of sensilla and cuticular processes situated on the apex of its distal labial segment. In general, nine types of sensilla were found on the mouthparts. Six types of sensilla and four types of cuticular processes are present on sensory fields of the labial apex. The proposed taxonomic and functional significance of the sensilla are discussed. Morphological similarities in the interlocking mechanism of the stylets suggest a relationship between Fulgoromorpha and Heteroptera."

Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) comprise the largest family of DUBs. In addition to the catalytic domain, most USPs contain auxiliary domains that are involved in substrate recognition, activity regulation, or recruitment of binding partners (1Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J.

USP4, USP11, and USP15 are a small set of closely related USPs, sharing a similar domain architecture as follows: a DUSP (domain in USP), followed by a ubiquitin-like (UBL) and a large catalytic domain, bifurcated by a second UBL domain and disordered region (Fig. 1A). Evolutionary analysis suggests the three USPs arose from gene duplication events (3Vlasschaert C. Xia X. Coulombe J. Gray D.A. Evolution of the highly networked deubiquitinating enzymes USP4, USP15, and USP11.BMC Evol. Biol. 2015; 15: 230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). USP4 and USP15 are more closely related in both sequence and function compared with USP11. Both USP4 and USP15 are implicated in mRNA processing through their interaction with spliceosome components (1Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W.

USP4 is recruited by U4/U6 small nuclear RNA recycling factor SART3 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3) to remove the Lys-63-polyubiquitin chain from pre-mRNA processing factor 3 (Prp3), and it controls the assembly of the spliceosome at distinct stages of the splicing process (4Song E.J.

The biological functions of SART3 have been summarized in a recent comprehensive review (10Whitmill A. Timani K.A. Liu Y. He J.J. Tip110: Physical properties, primary structure, and biological functions.Life Sci. 2016; 149: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SART3 is a large protein of 110 kDa and contains multiple half-a-tetratricopeptide (HAT) repeats followed by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), two RNA recognition motifs, and a C-terminal conserved LSm-interacting motif (Fig. 1A). The HAT repeat is a repetitive sequence pattern identified in proteins involved in RNA processing (11Preker P.J. Keller W. The HAT helix, a repetitive motif implicated in RNA processing.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 15-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sequentially and structurally similar to the tetratricopeptide repeats, it features two anti-parallel α-helices containing aromatic residues with conserved spacing. HAT repeats are involved in protein-protein (12Champion E.A. Lane B.H. Jackrel M.E. Regan L. Baserga S.J.

The USP15 DUSP-UBL domain has 69% sequence identity with that of USP4 and 39% with USP11. Structural details of the SART3 HAT domain and how SART3 interacts with the DUSP-UBL domain is not known. Sequence homology of SART3 to other HAT repeat-containing proteins with known structures is too low (<20%) to permit meaningful structural modeling. Here, we report the crystal structure of the first eight HAT repeats of SART3 and SART3 in complex with the DUSP-UBL domain of USP15. Structure-based sequence analysis reveals SART3 contains 12 HAT repeats that can be divided into subdomains HAT-N and HAT-C. The HAT domain dimerizes through the concave surface of HAT-C, whereas the convex surface of HAT-C binds USP15. Binding affinity measurements and mutagenesis analysis confirmed the interaction between USP15 and SART3 is bivalent and revealed that USP15 binds to SART3 20-fold stronger than USP4. DNAs encoding SART3(81–393), SART3(280–578), SART3(81–578), and DUSP-UBL domains (USP15(1–223), USP4(1–229), and USP11(78–286)) and DUSP domains (USP15(1–133), USP4(1–137), and USP11(80–196)) were subcloned into a modified pET28 vector encoding either a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (GenBankTM EF456735) or a thrombin-cleavable (GenBankTM accession number EF442785) N-terminal His6 tag. For co-expression of USP15 and SART3, a bicistronic pET28 vector was constructed by inserting a ribosomal binding site (5′-CTCGACGGAGGAATAATCAT-3′) between the genes encoding USP15(1–223) and SART3(280–578). All subclonings were completed using ligation-independent InFusionTM cloning kit (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara) and was verified by DNA sequencing. For selenomethionine labeling, a pre-packed M9 selenomethionine growth media kit (Medicilon) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were overexpressed in a BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli strain harboring a plasmid encoding tRNAs for rare codons. Expression cultures were induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. All proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), and the His6 tag was removed by TEV or thrombin proteases correspondingly. Uncleaved proteins and TEV protease were removed by another pass with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The proteins were further purified using anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (Source15Q and Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). The final concentrations of purified proteins were 10–30 mg/ml as measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm. All crystals were grown at 20 °C using the vaporization method. SART3(81–393) was crystallized in 30% PEG3350, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. SART3(81–578) was crystallized in 20% PEG3350, 0.2 m magnesium formate. For crystallization of the SART3(280–578)-USP15(1–223) complex, 2 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of well solution containing 19% PEG3350, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m MgCl2, 5% ethylene glycol, and 1 μl solution containing 0.33% (w/v) each of disodium 2,6-naphthalene-disulfonate, 2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, disodium m-benzenedisulfonate in 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.0. Crystals were cryo-protected, when required, by paratone-N (Hampton Research). X-ray diffraction data for SART3(81–393) were collected at 100 K at the Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility beamline 08ID-1 of Canadian Light Source (14Grochulski P. Fodje M.N. Gorin J.

Data for SART3(81–578) and the SART3(280–578)-USP15(1–223) complex were collected at beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

All ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C either on a VP-ITC Micro Calorimeter (Malvern) or a Nano ITC (TA Instruments). For VP-ITC, a total of 26 injections, each of 10 μl of protein except for the first injection with 5 μl of protein, were delivered into a 1.4 ml sample cell containing the other protein. For Nano ITC measurement, a total of 25 injections, each of 2 μl, were delivered into a 0.167 ml sample cell at a 180 s internal. The data were analyzed using OriginTM for ITC and NanoAnalyze softwares on the instruments, respectively, and fitted to a one-site binding model. For SEC analysis, 250 μl of each sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The column was calibrated using gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad). The absolute molar masses and mass distributions of the wild-type USP4(1–229) at different concentrations and the F42D mutant were determined using SEC-MALS. Samples were injected through a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT followed in line by a Dawn Heleos-II light scattering detector and a 2414 refractive index monitor (Waters). Molecular mass calculations were performed using ASTRA version 6.1.1.17 (Wyatt Technologies) assuming a refractive index increment, dn/dc, value of 0.185 ml·g−1. We solved the crystal structures of an N-terminal fragment of SART3 (amino acids 81–393) and a central fragment of SART3 (amino acids 280–578) in complex with the USP15 DUSP-UBL domain at 2.0 and 3.0 Å, respectively, using the SAD method (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The overlapping region (amino acids 280–393) of the two SART3 constructs superimpose well with a root mean square deviation of 0.56 Å for 114 Cα atoms. A crystal for the SART3 construct containing all the HAT repeats (amino acids 81–578), in the P22121 space group diffracted to 3.4 Å. Molecular replacement using a concatenated model containing SART3(81–393) and SART3(280–578) gave a solution that fitted well into the difference density, indicating no significant change in the conformation of SART3 in the three different crystal forms. Because of the suboptimal resolution of the SART3(81–578) dataset, we hereinafter use the concatenated model for the analysis of the SART3 HAT repeats.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSART3(81–393)SART3(280–578) + USP15(1–223)PDB code5JJX5JJWData collectionSpace groupP63P6422Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)135.1, 135.1, 43.2117.9, 117.9, 205.3α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 120.090.0, 90.0, 120.0Resolution (Å)50.0–2.050.0–3.0Rsym or Rmerge0.067 (0.968)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.0.197 (2.59)I/σI43.5 (2.3)24.6 (1.3)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)Redundancy8.3 (7.8)30.9 (31.6)RefinementResolution (Å)50.0–2.044.7–3.0No. of reflections29,83117,386Rwork/Rfree0.207/0.2390.234/0.288No. of atoms25373325Protein24153310Ligand/ion14Water12111B-factorsProtein47.791.9Ligand/ion51.162.3Water45.363.2Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0090.010Bond angles (°)1.2130.900Ramachandran plotFavored regions (%)98.395.4Allowed regions (%)1.74.6Disallowed regions (%)0.00.0a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.

The entire HAT repeat domain can be divided into two subdomains as follows: HAT-N-containing repeats 1–5 and HAT-C-containing repeats 6–12. A linker helix, Lα, connects HAT-N and HAT-C. An additional C-terminal helix, Eα, links the HAT domain to a bipartite NLS peptide (10Whitmill A. Timani K.A. Liu Y. He J.J.

We assigned the helices in the convex surface of the subdomains as αAs, and those in the concave surface as αBs, as this gives the best alignment of the sequence motifs (Fig. 1B). The alignment indicates that HAT1 and HAT12 are less conserved than other repeats. The αA and αB of repeats HAT2 to HAT11 contain conserved motifs (Fig. 1B) of aliphatic (Ψ), hydrophobic (Φ), aromatic (Ω), hydrophilic (ζ), positively charged (+), and small aliphatic residues (π) (25Aasland R. Abrams C. Ampe C. Ball L.J. Bedford M.T. Cesareni G. Gimona M. Hurley J.H. Jarchau T. Lehto V.P. Lemmon M.A. Linding R. Mayer B.J. Nagai M. Sudol M. Walter U. Winder S.J. Normalization of nomenclature for peptide motifs as ligands of modular protein domains.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Ω1 residue (usually Trp) of the αBi helix interacts with the aliphatic residues Ψ2 and π of the αAi and αAi + 1 helices, respectively, whereas the Ω2 residue (usually Tyr) of the αBi helix forms a hydrophobic core with the Ω and Φ residues of the αAi and αAi + 1 helices (Fig. 1D). A salt bridge is formed between the ζ and + residues of the αAi and αAi + 1 helices. Additionally, a salt bridge between an Arg and a Glu within the same repeat is seen for 5 out of the 10 conforming repeats. Repeats 1–8 of the SART3 HAT domain form a compact moiety that folds independently and exists as a monomer in the solution, as confirmed by SEC analysis (data not shown). The pleated arc shape composed of repeats 2–5 from the HAT-N domain forms a tight interaction with the convex surface of repeats 6–8 from the HAT-C domain through polar and hydrophobic interactions and has a buried surface area of 674 Å2 excluding the Lα helix (Fig. 1, C and E). The HAT-C subdomain exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. 2A). In the crystal structure, the two SART3 molecules dimerize through a C2 axis centered along the HAT11 repeat. Extensive interactions, mainly salt bridges between charged residues, were observed between the αB helices of repeats 7–12 and helix Eα of the two monomers. Repeats 9–12 of the two molecules form a triangular prism-like architecture (Fig. 1F), and the ridge is maintained by interaction of residues from the loops linking the αA and αB of each repeat from the two monomers. The total buried surface area of each monomer is 1155 Å2. When purifying USP15 alone, monomeric and oligomeric species eluted distinctly during anion exchange, suggesting a propensity to self-associate. SEC analysis suggests the monomeric and oligomeric forms do not convert easily in the solution (Fig. 2B). The SART3-USP15 complex used for crystallization was co-expressed using a bicistronic vector and eluted as a heterotetramer on SEC, whereas no oligomeric forms of USP15 were observed during purification (Fig. 2A). The asymmetric unit of the SART3-USP15 complex contains one molecule of each protein. The second pair of the complex can be generated by a symmetry operation. Although most of the USP15 DUSP structure is well defined in the electron density map, only 21 of 98 amino acids can be modeled for the UBL domain (Fig. 2C). USP15 binds to the convex surface of the SART3 HAT-C domain in a bivalent mode. The DUSP-UBL domain linker forms a DU finger (18Harper S. Besong T.M. Emsley J. Scott D.J. Dreveny I. Structure of the USP15 N-terminal domains: a β-hairpin mediates close association between the DUSP and UBL domains.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7995-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that occupies a hydrophobic patch formed by hydrophobic and aromatic residues from helices αA11, αB11, and αA12, while the indole ring of Trp-50 forms hydrophobic interactions with the aliphatic atoms from the side chains of Ser-439, Glu-443, and Lys-440 on the linker between αB9 and αA10 of SART3 (Figs. 2D and 3A). The DU finger and the SART3 interaction also contain strong hydrogen bonds between the main chain amide group of USP15 residues Phe-123 and Val-124 with the side chain of SART3 residue Asp-497 (Fig. 2D). Overall, USP15 has a buried surface area of 568 Å2, relatively small compared with the average 800 Å2 for “standard size” protein complexes (26Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. The atomic structure of protein-protein recognition sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). USP15, USP4, and USP11 all contain an N-terminal DUSP-UBL domain. We measured the binding affinity of different DUSP-UBL domains with SART3 using ITC. USP11 does not bind to SART3 at all, whereas the affinity of USP4 is 20-fold weaker than that of USP15 (Table 2 and Fig. 2, E and F). Sequence alignment revealed USP11 is lacking three key residues in the DU finger critical for the interaction with SART3 (Fig. 2E), although these are conserved between USP4 and USP15.TABLE 2Summary of ITC measurements of USPs and SART3 interactionSyringeCellnKDΔHΔμmkcal·mol−1cal·mol−1degrees−1USP15(1–223)SART3 (81–578)0.952 ± 0.0020.14 ± 0.01−15.03 ± 0.05−19.0USP4(1–229)SART3 (81–578)0.808 ± 0.0022.07 ± 0.04−16.39 ± 0.06−29.0USP15(1–223)SART3 (280–578)0.989 ± 0.0030.12 ± 0.01−15.24 ± 0.08−19.5USP4(1–229)SART3 (280–578)0.958 ± 0.0042.79 ± 0.10−13.32 ± 0.08−19.2SART3(280–578)USP4 (1–229)0.979 ± 0.0272.48 ± 0.25−18.41 ± 0.68−36.1SART3(280–578)aMeasurement was performed on Nano ITC (TA Instruments).USP4 (1–229)0.960 ± 0.0752.97 ± 0.98−16.14 ± 1.86−28.9USP11(78–286)SART3 (280–578)NDbND means not detected.NDUSP15(1–223) (Q2)cQ2 refers to the second peak from anion-exchange chromatography.SART3 (280–578)1.800 ± 0.11228.01 ± 6.181.95 ± 0.2127.4USP15(1–133)SART3 (280–578)0.933 ± 0.0101.42 ± 0.14−7.87 ± 0.120.4USP4(1–137)SART3 (280–578)0.881 ± 0.0062.40 ± 0.11−15.49 ± 0.14−26.2USP11(80–196)SART3 (280–578)NDNDUSP15(1–223) L24ASART3 (280–578)1.180 ± 0.0050.33 ± 0.03−10.10 ± 0.07−4.2USP15(1–223) W50ASART3 (280–578)0.870 ± 0.0191.68 ± 0.29−9.36 ± 0.28−5.0USP15(1–223) G121ASART3 (280–578)0.887 ± 0.17316.34 ± 5.53−3.72 ± 0.8510.6USP15(1–223) M122ASART3 (280–578)0.868 ± 0.0030.32 ± 0.02−13.98 ± 0.09−17.1USP15(1–223) M122KSART3 (280–578)0.888 ± 0.0010.25 ± 0.01−15.85 ± 0.03−22.9USP15(1–223) F123ASART3 (280–578)NDNDUSP15(1–223) V124ASART3 (280–578)0.821 ± 0.03511.49 ± 1.03−12.74 ± 0.73−20.1USP15(1–223) K125ASART3 (280–578)0.962 ± 0.0030.07 ± 0.01−14.77 ± 0.09−16.8USP15(1–223) H126ASART3 (280–578)1.030 ± 0.08719.49 ± 3.21−5.83 ± 0.662.0SART3(280–578)aMeasurement was performed on Nano ITC (TA Instruments).USP4 (1–229) F42D0.855 ± 0.2179.35 ± 3.76−12.14 ± 4.31−17.7USP4(1–229) L126KSART3 (280–578)0.908 ± 0.0062.87 ± 0.10−13.41 ± 0.11−19.6a Measurement was performed on Nano ITC (TA Instruments).b ND means not detected.c Q2 refers to the second peak from anion-exchange chromatography. Open table in a new tab To confirm the authenticity of the interactions, we did mutagenesis based on structural analysis and measured the binding affinities. Two kinetically stable oligomeric states of USP15 that do not interconvert at room temperature or 4 °C can be separated on an ion-exchange column, corresponding to a monomeric form and an oligomeric (dimer and tetramer) form (Fig. 2B). The monomeric form of the USP15 protein was used for ITC measurement unless otherwise indicated. Wild-type USP15 binds to the HAT-C subdomain of SART3 with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.12 μm. The HAT-N subdomain of SART3 does not interfere with the USP15 and SART3 interaction as SART3(81–578) has a similar KD value of 0.14 μm, so it is with the interaction between USP4 and SART3. Further measurement was thus carried out using the HAT-C subdomain of SART3. Mutation of residues on the USP15 DU finger, G121A, V124A, H126A, reduced the binding affinity by around 100-fold, whereas F123A abolished binding completely, suggesting the benzyl group of Phe-123 contributes most to the interaction (Table 2). Although the side chain of USP15 residue Leu-24 is within 4 Å distance from SART3 (Fig. 3A), the contribution of Leu-24 to the interaction is minimal, if any, as demonstrated by the similar binding affinity of the L24A mutant with SART3. The contribution of the USP15 Trp-50 residue to the interaction was confirmed by a 14-fold change of KD upon mutation to an alanine (Fig. 4A and Table 2). Although Met-122 in USP15 is the only residue involved in the direct interaction with SART3 that is different from USP4, the side chain of Met-122 is mostly exposed, and only the main chain interacts with SART3. M122A and M122K mutations do not affect the KD value significantly (Table 2). Similarly, mutation of the corresponding Leu-126 in USP4 to a lysine also does not change its binding affinity to SART3, suggesting the small sequence difference in the DU fingers"
https://openalex.org/W2410487570,"Skeletal muscle strength and mass, major contributors to sprint/power athletic performance, are influenced by genetics. However, to date, only a handful of genetic variants have been associated with sprint/power performance. The ACVR1B A allele (rs rs2854464) has previously been associated with increased muscle-strength in non-athletic cohort. However, no follow-up and/or replications studies have since been conducted. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the genotype distribution of ACVR1B rs2854464 between endurance athletes (E), sprint/power (S/P) athletes, mixed athletes (M), and non-athletic control participants in 1672 athletes (endurance athletes, n = 482; sprint/power athletes, n = 578; mixed athletes, n = 498) and 1089 controls (C) of both European Caucasians (Italian, Polish and Russians) and Brazilians. We have also compared the genotype distribution according to the athlete’s level of competition (elite vs. sub-elite). DNA extraction and genotyping were performed using various methods. Fisher's exact test (adjusted for multiple comparisons) was used to test whether the genotype distribution of rs2854464 (AA, AG and GG) differs between groups. The A allele was overrepresented in S/P athletes compared with C in the Caucasian sample (adjusted p = 0.048), whereas there were no differences in genotype distribution between E athletes and C, in neither the Brazilian nor the Caucasian samples (adjusted p > 0.05). When comparing all Caucasian athletes regardless of their sporting discipline to C, we found that the A allele was overrepresented in athletes compared to C (adjusted p = 0.024). This association was even more pronounced when only elite-level athletes were considered (adjusted p = 0.00017). In conclusion, in a relatively large cohort of athletes from Europe and South America we have shown that the ACVR1B rs2854464 A allele is associated with sprint/power performance in Caucasians but not in Brazilian athletes. This reinforces the notion that phenotype-genotype associations may be ethnicity-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2301268618,"Background and Objectives Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a trans-diagnostic construct involved in anxiety and related disorders. Research focused on cross-sectional reporting, manipulating attitudes toward objective and impersonal events or on treatments designed to reduce IU in clinical populations. The current paper presents an experimental procedure for laboratory manipulations of IU and tests mediation hypotheses following the Intolerance of Uncertainty Model. Methods On pre-test, undergraduate volunteers (Study 1, n = 43;68% women. Study 2, n = 169;83.8% women) were asked to provide an idiosyncratic future negative life event. State-IU, Worry, Positive and Negative Affect were assessed after that a standardized procedure was used to identify event’s potential negative consequences. The same variables were assessed on post-test, after that participants were asked to read-through increasing and decreasing IU statements. Results Temporary changes on IU were consistently reproduced in both studies. Participants receiving increasing IU instructions reported greater state-IU, Worry and Negative Affect than those receiving decreasing IU instructions. However, this latter condition was not different from a control one (Study 2). Both studies revealed significant indirect effects of IU induction instructions on Worry and Negative Affect through state-IU. Limitations Both studies used undergraduate psychology students samples, younger than average population and predominantly female. Experimental manipulation and outcome measures belongs to the same semantic domain, uncertainty, potentially limiting generalizability. Conclusions Results supported the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed IU manipulation for non-clinical sample. Findings parallel clinical research showing that state-IU preceded Worry and Negative Affect states."
https://openalex.org/W2409417208,"The relationship between the denaturation temperatures of proteins (Tm values) and the living temperatures of their host organisms (environmental temperatures: TENV values) is poorly understood. Since different proteins in the same organism may show widely different Tm's, no simple universal relationship between Tm and TENV should hold, other than Tm≥TENV. Yet, when analyzing a set of homologous proteins from different hosts, Tm's are oftentimes found to correlate with TENV's but this correlation is shifted upward on the Tm axis. Supporting this trend, we recently reported Tm's for resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins that mirror a proposed environmental cooling over long geological time, while remaining a shocking ~50°C above the proposed ancestral ocean temperatures. Here, we show that natural selection for protein kinetic stability (denaturation rate) can produce a Tm↔TENV correlation with a large upward shift in Tm. A model for protein stability evolution suggests a link between the Tm shift and the in vivo lifetime of a protein and, more specifically, allows us to estimate ancestral environmental temperatures from experimental denaturation rates for resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins. The TENV values thus obtained match the proposed ancestral ocean cooling, support comparatively high Archaean temperatures, and are consistent with a recent proposal for the environmental temperature (above 75°C) that hosted the last universal common ancestor. More generally, this work provides a framework for understanding how features of protein stability reflect the environmental temperatures of the host organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2414216739,"Nitrogen (N) deposition is a key global change factor that is increasing and affecting the structure and function of many ecosystems. To determine the influence of N deposition on specific systems, however, it is crucial to understand the temporal and spatial patterns of deposition as well as the response to that deposition. Response of the receiving plant communities may depend on the life stage-specific performance of individual species. We focus on the California oak savanna because N deposition to this system is complex-characterized by hotspots on the landscape and seasonal pulses. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the relative influence of N deposition on plant performance during early growth, peak biomass, and senescent life stages across different soil types, light, and community compositions. To represent the community we used three grass species-a native, naturalized exotic, and invasive exotic. At early growth and peak biomass stages performance was measured as height, and shoot and root biomass, and at the senescent stage as seed production. Simulated N deposition 1) increased shoot biomass and height of the native and, even more so, the naturalized exotic during early growth, 2) positively affected root biomass in all species during peak biomass, and 3) had no influence on seed production at the senescent stage. Alone, N deposition was not a strong driver of plant performance; however, small differences in performance among species in response to N deposition could affect community composition in future years. In particular, if there is a pulse of N deposition during the early growth stage, the naturalized exotic may have a competitive advantage that could result in its spread. Including spatial and temporal heterogeneity in a complex, manipulative experiment provides a clearer picture of not only where N management efforts should be targeted on the landscape, but also when."
https://openalex.org/W2409352402,"Mont Blanc, the summit of Western Europe, is a popular but demanding high-altitude ascent. Drug use is thought to be widespread among climbers attempting this summit, not only to prevent altitude illnesses, but also to boost physical and/or psychological capacities. This practice may be unsafe in this remote alpine environment. However, robust data on medication during the ascent of Mont Blanc are lacking. Individual urine samples from male climbers using urinals in mountain refuges on access routes to Mont Blanc (Goûter and Cosmiques mountain huts) were blindly and anonymously collected using a hidden automatic sampler. Urine samples were screened for a wide range of drugs, including diuretics, glucocorticoids, stimulants, hypnotics and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Out of 430 samples analyzed from both huts, 35.8% contained at least one drug. Diuretics (22.7%) and hypnotics (12.9%) were the most frequently detected drugs, while glucocorticoids (3.5%) and stimulants (3.1%) were less commonly detected. None of the samples contained PDE-5 inhibitors. Two substances were predominant: the diuretic acetazolamide (20.6%) and the hypnotic zolpidem (8.4%). Thirty three samples were found positive for at least two substances, the most frequent combination being acetazolamide and a hypnotic (2.1%). Based on a novel sampling technique, we demonstrate that about one third of the urine samples collected from a random sample of male climbers contained one or several drugs, suggesting frequent drug use amongst climbers ascending Mont Blanc. Our data suggest that medication primarily aims at mitigating the symptoms of altitude illnesses, rather than enhancing performance. In this hazardous environment, the relatively high prevalence of hypnotics must be highlighted, since these molecules may alter vigilance."
https://openalex.org/W2413087524,"Histone demethylases have recently gained interest as potential targets in cancer treatment and several histone demethylases have been implicated in the DNA damage response. We investigated the effects of siRNA-mediated depletion of histone demethylase Jarid1A (KDM5A, RBP2), which demethylates transcription activating tri- and dimethylated lysine 4 at histone H3 (H3K4me3/me2), on growth characteristics and cellular response to radiation in several cancer cell lines. In unirradiated cells Jarid1A depletion lead to histone hyperacetylation while not affecting cell growth. In irradiated cells, depletion of Jarid1A significantly increased cellular radiosensitivity. Unexpectedly, the hyperacetylation phenotype did not lead to disturbed accumulation of DNA damage response and repair factors 53BP1, BRCA1, or Rad51 at damage sites, nor did it influence resolution of radiation-induced foci or rejoining of reporter constructs. We conclude that the radiation sensitivity observed following depletion of Jarid1A is not caused by a deficiency in repair of DNA double-strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2414020212,"The purpose of this study was to generate a substantive model that accounts for the explanatory social processes of communication in which nurses were engaged in clinical settings in Korea. Grounded theory methodology was used in this study. A total of 15 clinical nurses participated in the in-depth interviews. “Assimilating to the hierarchical culture” emerged as the basic social process of communication in which the participants engaged in their work environments. To adapt to the cultures of their assigned wards, the nurses learned to be silent and engaged in their assimilation into the established hierarchy. The process of assimilation consisted of three phases based on the major goals that nurses worked to achieve: getting to know about unspoken rules, persevering within the culture, and acting as senior nurse. Seven strategies and actions utilized to achieve the major tasks emerged as subcategories, including receiving strong disapproval, learning by observing, going silent, finding out what is acceptable, minimizing distress, taking advantages as senior nurse, and taking responsibilities as senior nurse. The findings identified how the pattern of communication in nursing organizations affected the way in which nurses were assimilated into organizational culture, from individual nurses’ perspectives. In order to improve the rigid working atmosphere and culture in nursing organizations and increase members’ satisfaction with work and quality of life, managers and staff nurses need training that focuses on effective communication and encouraging peer opinion-sharing within horizontal relationships. Moreover, organization-level support should be provided to create an environment that encourages free expression."
https://openalex.org/W2415899541,"Giant Cell Glioblastoma (gcGBM) and Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) are rare astroglial tumors of the central nervous system. Although they share certain histomorphological and immunohistochemical features, they are characterized by different clinical behavior and prognosis. Nevertheless, few cases remain uncertain, as their histomorphological hallmarks and immunophenotypes do correspond to the typical pattern neither of gcGBM nor PXA. Therefore, in addition to the routinely used diagnostic histochemical and immunohistochemical markers like Gömöri, p53 and CD34, we analyzed if genetic variations like MGMT promoter methylation, mutations in the IDH1/2 genes, or BRAF mutations, which are actually used as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive molecular markers in anaplastic glial tumors, could be helpful in the differential diagnostic of both tumor entities. We analyzed 34 gcGBM and 20 PXA for genetic variations in the above-named genes and found distinct distributions between both groups. MGMT promoter hypermethylation was observed in 3 out of 20 PXA compared to 14 out of 34 gcGBM (15% vs. 41.2%, p-value 0.09). BRAF V600E mutations were detected in 50% of the PXA but not in any of the gcGBM (50% vs. 0%, p-value < 0.001). IDH1 R132 and IDH R172 mutations were not present in any of the PXA and gcGBM cases. Our data indicate, that in addition to the histological and immunohistochemical evaluation, investigation of MGMT promoter methylation and in particular BRAF V600E mutations represent reliable additional tools to sustain differentiation of gcGBM from PXA on a molecular basis. Based on these data specific BRAF kinase inhibitors could represent a promising agent in the therapy of PXA and their use should be emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2416344585,"Several countries have reported a resurgence of pertussis in the last decades. This puts infants (especially <6 months) at risk of severe complications, because they are too young to be fully protected by vaccination. The global pertussis initiative has proposed pertussis vaccination of young infants' close contacts, in order to reduce pertussis transmission and the burden of the disease on infants. Our aim is to explore the perceived determinants (barriers and facilitators) of intention to accept vaccination among the possible target groups of pertussis vaccination for cocooning. Consideration of these determinants is necessary to optimise the uptake of the vaccination.We conducted 13 focus groups and six individual semi-structured interviews with members of possible target groups for pertussis cocooning (i.e. parents, maternity assistants, midwives, and paediatric nurses) in the Netherlands. Here, both maternal pertussis vaccination as well as pertussis cocooning has not been implemented. The topic list was based on a literature review and a barrier framework. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and two researchers performed thematic content analysis.The participants' risk perception, outcome expectations, general vaccination beliefs, moral norms, opinion of others, perceived autonomy, anticipated regret, decisional uncertainty, and perceived organisational barriers were all factors that influenced the intention to accept pertussis vaccination for cocooning.This study has identified nine perceived determinants that influence the intention to accept pertussis cocooning vaccination. We add the following determinants to the literature: perceived cost-effectiveness (as a concept of outcome expectations), justice (as a concept of moral norms), anticipated regret, and decisional uncertainty. We recommend considering these determinants in vaccination programmes for pertussis cocooning vaccination. Experience, information and trust emerged as predominant themes within these determinants. These themes require particular attention in future research on vaccination acceptance, especially with regard to their role in use and implementation in policy and practice."

The trial offers a unique opportunity to gain understanding about the social and cultural factors that may facilitate sustained use of improved cookstoves. In January 2015, the use of Photovoice as a participatory research methodology was piloted at the CAPS Chikhwawa site. Photovoice is a photographic technique that allows communities (including women and marginalised groups) to share knowledge about their perspectives and priorities. Four households were given digital cameras and asked to collect images over 24–48 hours and were then interviewed on film about their selection. This resulted in over 400 images and a one hour long film that revealed community concerns and could be thematically analysed. The collection of interview data through film was useful for capturing discussion and was acceptable to participants. Photovoice is a feasible participatory research methodology that can play a valuable role in qualitative studies of improved cookstove adoption in challenging resource poor settings."
https://openalex.org/W2433549071,"Ventilator-induced or ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI/VALI) is common and there is an increasing demand for a tool that can optimize ventilator settings. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can detect changes in impedance caused by pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, but the effect of changes in the position of the body and in the placing of the electrode belt on the impedance signal have not to our knowledge been thoroughly evaluated. We therefore studied ventilation-related and perfusion-related changes in impedance during spontaneous breathing in 10 healthy subjects in five different body positions and with the electrode belt placed at three different thoracic positions using a 32-electrode EIT system. We found differences between regions of interest that could be attributed to changes in the position of the body, and differences in impedance amplitudes when the position of the electrode belt was changed. Ventilation-related changes in impedance could therefore be related to changes in the position of both the body and the electrode belt. Perfusion-related changes in impedance were probably related to the interference of major vessels. While these findings give us some insight into the sources of variation in impedance signals as a result of changes in the positions of both the body and the electrode belt, further studies on the origin of the perfusion-related impedance signal are needed to improve EIT further as a tool for the monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2411327930,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been known to be a key factor in the regulation of the immune system under numerous conditions such as tumors, infections, autoimmune diseases, and transplantations. In contrast to the proposed deleterious role of MDSCs in tumors and infections, MDSCs with their suppressive function are now proved to have the beneficial potential of suppressing the autoimmune response and promoting tolerance to transplantation. Therefore, the expansion of MDSCs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for many diseases. In this study, we aimed to identify FDA-approved drugs that could aid in the expansion of functional MDSCs. We performed a high-throughput screening (HTS) of FDA-approved drugs based on the in vitro human MDSC-differentiation system and identified finasteride (FIN) to have the best potency to aid the generation of human MDSCs. The FIN-induced MDSCs were quite similar to monocytic MDSCs with regard to their surface phenotype, morphology, immunosuppressive function, and related gene expression. Next, we aimed to determine the mechanism of action of FIN and found that FIN induced the expansion of MDSCs through up-regulation of the COX2/PGE2 pathway by enhancing the activity of COX2 promoter. In addition, the administration of indomethacin (IND), a COX2 inhibitor, abrogated the effect of FIN. Based on these results, we suggested that FIN could find applications in the future in the expansion of MDSCs. Further development of FIN-like compounds could be a novel strategy for generating functional MDSCs for immunosuppressive therapies in various immune disorder conditions."

Displacement of the conus medullaris during the unilateral and sham SLR was quantified reliably with a randomized procedure. Conus displacement in response to unilateral and sham SLRs was quantified and the results compared.The conus displaced caudally in the spinal canal by 3.54±0.87 mm (mean±SD) with unilateral (p≤.001) and proximally by 0.32±1.6 mm with sham SLR (p≤.542). Pearson correlations were higher than 0.99 for both intra- and inter-observer reliability and the observed power was 1 for unilateral SLRs and 0.054 and 0.149 for left and right sham SLR respectively.Four relevant points emerge from the presented data: i) reciprocal movements between the spinal cord and the surrounding vertebrae are likely to occur during SLR in asymptomatic subjects, ii) conus medullaris displacement in the vertebral canal with SLR is primarily due to transmission of tensile forces through the neural tissues, iii) when tensile forces are transmitted through the neural system as in the clinical SLR, the magnitude of conus medullaris displacement prevails over the amount of bone adjustment."

Despite the importance of C. miyabeanus as a disease-causing agent in wildrice, little is known about either the mechanisms of pathogenicity or host defense responses. To start bridging these gaps, the genome of C. miyabeanus strain TG12bL2 was shotgun sequenced using Illumina technology. The genome assembly consists of 31.79 Mbp in 2,378 scaffolds with an N50 = 74,921. It contains 11,000 predicted genes of which 94.5% were annotated. Approximately 10% of total gene number is expected to be secreted. The C. miyabeanus genome is rich in carbohydrate active enzymes, and harbors 187 small secreted peptides (SSPs) and some fungal effector homologs. Detoxification systems were represented by a variety of enzymes that could offer protection against plant defense compounds. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases (PKS) present were common to other Cochliobolus species. Additionally, the fungal transcriptome was analyzed at 48 hours after inoculation in planta. A total of 10,674 genes were found to be expressed, some of which are known to be involved in pathogenicity or response to host defenses including hydrophobins, cutinase, cell wall degrading enzymes, enzymes related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, PKS, detoxification systems, SSPs, and a known fungal effector. This work will facilitate future research on C. miyabeanus pathogen-associated molecular patterns and effectors, and in the identification of their corresponding wildrice defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2412582226,"Social news, unlike video games or TV programs, conveys real-life interactions. Theoretically, social news in which people help or harm each other and violate rules should influence both prosocial and violation behaviors. In two experiments, we demonstrated the spreading effects of social news in a social interaction context emphasizing social conventions and a nonsocial interaction context emphasizing moral norms. Across the two studies, the results showed that positive social news increased cooperation (decreased defection) but had no effect on cheating, whereas negative social news increased cheating but with no change in cooperation (or defection). We conclude that there is a spreading impact of positive social news in the conventional norm domain and of negative social news in the moral norm domain."
https://openalex.org/W2413173355,"The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and need to be imported from the cytosol into the mitochondria, and molecular chaperones play a key role in the efficient translocation and proper folding of these proteins in the matrix. One such molecular chaperone is the eukaryotic mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70); however, it is prone to self-aggregation and requires the presence of an essential zinc-finger protein, Hsp70-escort protein 1 (Hep1), to maintain its structure and function. PfHsp70-3, the only Hsp70 predicted to localize in the mitochondria of P. falciparum, may also rely on a Hep1 orthologue to prevent self-aggregation. In this study, we identified a putative Hep1 orthologue in P. falciparum and co-expression of PfHsp70-3 and PfHep1 enhanced the solubility of PfHsp70-3. PfHep1 suppressed the thermally induced aggregation of PfHsp70-3 but not the aggregation of malate dehydrogenase or citrate synthase, thus showing specificity for PfHsp70-3. Zinc ions were indeed essential for maintaining the function of PfHep1, as EDTA chelation abrogated its abilities to suppress the aggregation of PfHsp70-3. Soluble and functional PfHsp70-3, acquired by co-expression with PfHep-1, will facilitate the biochemical characterisation of this particular Hsp70 protein and its evaluation as a drug target for the treatment of malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2418435728,"It is well established that binding of p120 catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of surface cadherin prevents cadherin endocytosis and degradation, contributing to cell-cell adhesion. In the present work we show that p120 catenin bound to the N-cadherin precursor, contributes to its anterograde movement from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. In HeLa cells, depletion of p120 expression, or blocking its binding to N-cadherin, increased the accumulation of the precursor in the ER, while it decreased the localization of mature N-cadherin at intercellular junctions. Reconstitution experiments in p120-deficient SW48 cells with all three major isoforms of p120 (1, 3 and 4) had similar capacity to promote the processing of the N-cadherin precursor to the mature form, and its localization at cell-cell junctions. P120 catenin and protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B facilitated the recruitment of the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), an ATPase involved in vesicular trafficking, to the N-cadherin precursor complex. Dominant negative NSF E329Q impaired N-cadherin trafficking, maturation and localization at cell-cell junctions. Our results uncover a new role for p120 catenin bound to the N-cadherin precursor ensuring its trafficking through the biosynthetic pathway towards the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2433124284,"To support decision-making around diet selection choices to manage glycemia following a meal, a novel mechanistic model of intermittent gastric emptying and plasma glucose-insulin dynamics was developed. Model development was guided by postprandial timecourses of plasma glucose, insulin and the gastric emptying marker acetaminophen in infant calves fed meals of 2 or 4 L milk replacer. Assigning a fast, slow or zero first-order gastric emptying rate to each interval between plasma samples fit acetaminophen curves with prediction errors equal to 9% of the mean observed acetaminophen concentration. Those gastric emptying parameters were applied to glucose appearance in conjunction with minimal models of glucose disposal and insulin dynamics to describe postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. The final model contains 20 parameters, 8 of which can be obtained by direct measurement and 12 by fitting to observations. The minimal model of intestinal glucose delivery contains 2 gastric emptying parameters and a third parameter describing the time lag between emptying and appearance of glucose in plasma. Sensitivity analysis of the aggregate model revealed that gastric emptying rate influences area under the plasma insulin curve but has little effect on area under the plasma glucose curve. This result indicates that pancreatic responsiveness is influenced by gastric emptying rate as a consequence of the quasi-exponential relationship between plasma glucose concentration and pancreatic insulin release. The fitted aggregate model was able to reproduce the multiple postprandial rises and falls in plasma glucose concentration observed in calves consuming a normal-sized meal containing milk components."
https://openalex.org/W2409100425,"The epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, is an essential source of cells and signals for the formation of the cardiac fibrous skeleton and the coronary vasculature, and for the maturation of the myocardium during embryonic development. The molecular factors that control epicardial mobilization and differentiation, and direct the epicardial-myocardial cross-talk are, however, insufficiently understood. The T-box transcription factor gene Tbx18 is specifically expressed in the epicardium of vertebrate embryos. Loss of Tbx18 is dispensable for epicardial development, but may influence coronary vessel maturation. In contrast, over-expression of an activator version of TBX18 severely impairs epicardial development by premature differentiation of epicardial cells into SMCs indicating a potential redundancy of Tbx18 with other repressors of the T-box gene family. Here, we show that Tbx2 and Tbx20 are co-expressed with Tbx18 at different stages of epicardial development. Using a conditional gene targeting approach we find that neither the epicardial loss of Tbx2 nor the combined loss of Tbx2 and Tbx18 affects epicardial development. Similarly, we observed that the heterozygous loss of Tbx20 with and without additional loss of Tbx18 does not impact on epicardial integrity and mobilization in mouse embryos. Thus, Tbx18 does not function redundantly with Tbx2 or Tbx20 in epicardial development."
https://openalex.org/W2435509886,"Biomphalaria glabrata (B. glabrata) is an air-breathing aquatic mollusc found in freshwater habitats across the Western Hemisphere. It is most well-known for its recognized capacity to act as a major intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the human blood fluke parasite. Ionotropic receptors (IRs), a variant family of the ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR), have an evolutionary ancient function in detecting odors to initiate chemosensory signaling. In this study, we applied an array of methods towards the goal of identifying IR-like family members in B. glabrata, ultimately revealing two types, the iGluR and IR. Sequence alignment showed that three ligand-binding residues are conserved in most Biomphalaria iGluR sequences, while the IRs did exhibit a variable pattern, lacking some or all known glutamate-interactingresidues, supporting their distinct classification from the iGluRs. We show that B. glabrata contains 7 putative IRs, some of which are expressed within its chemosensory organs. To further investigate a role for the more ancient IR25a type in chemoreception, we tested its spatial distribution pattern within the snail cephalic tentacle by in situ hybridization. The presence of IR25a within presumptive sensory neurons supports a role for this receptor in olfactory processing, contributing to our understanding of the molecular pathways that are involved in Biomphalaria olfactory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2414762748,"The essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATPase Mot1 globally regulates transcription by impacting the genomic distribution and activity of the TATA-binding protein (TBP). In vitro, Mot1 forms a ternary complex with TBP and DNA and can use ATP hydrolysis to dissociate the TBP-DNA complex. Prior work suggested an interaction between the ATPase domain and a functionally important segment of DNA flanking the TATA sequence. However, how ATP hydrolysis facilitates removal of TBP from DNA is not well understood, and several models have been proposed. To gain insight into the Mot1 mechanism, we dissected the role of the flanking DNA segment by biochemical analysis of complexes formed using DNAs with short single-stranded gaps. In parallel, we used a DNA tethered cleavage approach to map regions of Mot1 in proximity to the DNA under different conditions. Our results define non-equivalent roles for bases within a broad segment of flanking DNA required for Mot1 action. Moreover, we present biochemical evidence for two distinct conformations of the Mot1 ATPase, the detection of which can be modulated by ATP analogs as well as DNA sequence flanking the TATA sequence. We also show using purified complexes that Mot1 dissociation of a stable, high affinity TBP-DNA interaction is surprisingly inefficient, suggesting how other transcription factors that bind to TBP may compete with Mot1. Taken together, these results suggest that TBP-DNA affinity as well as other aspects of promoter sequence influence Mot1 function in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2414853424,"ATP-mediated signaling is an important regulator of electrolyte transport in the kidney. The purinergic cation channel P2X6 has been previously localized to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), a nephron segment important for Mg2+ and Na+ reabsorption, but its role in ion transport remains unknown. In this study, P2x6 knockout (P2x6-/-) mice were generated to investigate the role of P2X6 in renal electrolyte transport. The P2x6-/- animals displayed a normal phenotype and did not differ physiologically from wild type mice. Differences in serum concentration and 24-hrs urine excretion of Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were not detected between P2x6+/+, P2x6+/- and P2x6-/- mice. Quantitative PCR was applied to examine potential compensatory changes in renal expression levels of other P2x subunits and electrolyte transporters, including P2x1-5, P2x7, Trpm6, Ncc, Egf, Cldn16, Scnn1, Slc12a3, Slc41a1, Slc41a3, Cnnm2, Kcnj10 and Fxyd2. Additionally, protein levels of P2X2 and P2X4 were assessed in P2x6+/+ and P2x6-/- mouse kidneys. However, significant changes in expression were not detected. Furthermore, no compensatory changes in gene expression could be demonstrated in heart material isolated from P2x6-/- mice. Except for a significant (P<0.05) upregulation of P2x2 in the heart of P2x6-/- mice compared to the P2x6+/+ mice. Thus, our data suggests that purinergic signaling via P2X6 is not significantly involved in the regulation of renal electrolyte handling under normal physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2415542331,"In Indian context, limited attempts have been made to estimate the mortality risks among people living with HIV (PLHIV). We estimated the rates of mortality among PLHIV covered under an integrated HIV-prevention cum care and support programme implemented in Karnataka state, India, and attempted to identify the key programme components associated with the higher likelihood of their survival.Retrospective programme data of 55,801 PLHIV registered with the Samastha programme implemented in Karnataka state during 2006-11 was used. Kaplan-Meier survival methods were used to estimate the ten years expected survival probabilities and Cox-proportional hazard model was used to examine the factors associated with risk of mortality among PLHIV. We also calculated mortality rates (per 1000 person-year) across selected demographic and clinical parameters.Of the total PLHIV registered with the programme, about nine percent died within the 5-years of programme period with an overall death rate of 38 per 1000 person-years. The mortality rate was higher among males, aged 18 and above, among illiterates, and those residing in rural areas. While the presence of co-infections such as Tuberculosis leads to higher mortality rate, adherence to ART was significantly associated with reduction in overall death rate. Cox proportional hazard model revealed that increase in CD4 cell counts and exposure to intensive care and support programme for at least two years can bring significant reduction in risk of death among PLHIV [(hazard ratio: 0.234; CI: 0.211-0.260) & (hazard ratio: 0.062; CI: 0.054-0.071), respectively] even after adjusting the effect of other socio-demographic, economic and health related confounders.Study confirms that while residing in rural areas and presence of co-infection significantly increases the mortality risk among PLHIV, adherence to ART and improvement in CD4 counts led to significant reduction in their mortality risk. Longer exposure to the intervention contributed significantly to reduce mortality among PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W2415968180,"Understanding negative effects of native species on introduced taxa may suggest novel ways to control the invasive species by enhancing such effects. Previous studies have reported that the larvae of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) are suppressed by competition with the larvae of native anurans in Australia, but not in North America. We conducted laboratory trials to measure the effect of exposure to the larvae of Japanese frogs (Microhyla ornata, Fejervarya sakishimensis, Rhacophorus owstoni) on rates of survival, growth and development of cane toad tadpoles in Ishigaki Island, in southern Japan. Survival rates were not affected by native species, but competition with Dicroglossids and Rhacophorids (but not Microhylids) strongly reduced rates of growth and development in the tadpoles of cane toads. Dicroglossid tadpoles also reduced the body condition to toad tadpoles in addition to effects on SVL and mass. Encouraging populations of native frogs in toad-invaded areas of Japan thus may help to reduce the numbers of invasive cane toads."
