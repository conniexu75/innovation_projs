https://openalex.org/W1551489567,"An oligosaccharide fragment corresponding to the linkage region between the polysaccharide and protein parts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 yeast mannan has been isolated. This was accomplished by the combined action of a bacterial endo-α(1→6)mannanase and an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase on the mutant mannan from S. cerevisiae X2180-1A-5 that has an unbranched polysaccharide outer chain. The mannanase removed the unbranched mannan outer chain and the glucosaminidase apparently split a di-N-acetylchitobiose unit at the point of attachment of the polysaccharide to asparagine in the protein part. This order of degradation is assumed from the facts that wild type mannan with a branched outer chain was not attacked whereas ovalbumin was degraded with the release of the expected oligosaccharide fragment terminated by N-acetylglucosamine at the reducing end. Thus, the glucosaminidase was able to act only on a partially degraded mannan chain. The linkage fragment was composed of about 12 mannose units and a single N-acetylglucosamine which was found at the reducing end. The attachment of mannose to N-acetylglucosamine was by a β(1→4) linkage as in other glycoproteins. Acetolysis of the oligosaccharide yielded mannose, mannobiose αMan(1→2)Man and αMan(1→3)Man, mannotriose with both 1→2 and 1→3 linkages, and mannotetraose, probably αMan(1→3)αMan(1→2)αMan(1→3)Man. These fragments were interlinked by α(1→6) bonds, and the oligosaccharide was attached to the N-acetylglucosamine. Another acetolysis fragment isolated, αMan(1→3)αMan(1→2)αMan(1→3)βMan(1→4)GNAc, is common to other glycoproteins. The observation that this kind of branched inner core structure is made in a yeast mutant that forms an unbranched outer chain demonstrates that the formation of these two parts of the molecule is regulated in part by different enzymes and may serve different functions in the translocation of the mannan proteins and their organization in the cell wall."

A degree of thymus dependence is involved, as shown by the aggravation of infection by neonatal thymectomy1,2, anti-thymocyte serum3 and anti-lymphocyte serum4,5. For instance, parasitaemias due to P. berghei were higher in neonatally thymectomised rats than in controls, and lasted about twice as long, with higher mortality1,2."
https://openalex.org/W1547297235,"Abstract An in vivo assay of enzyme activity has been employed to investigate the mechanism of control of enzymes synthesizing deoxyribonucleotides after bacteriophage T4 infection. The assay is based on the release of tritium from 5-labeled pyrimidine nucleotide substrates into water. At least two phage-induced early enzymes, deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase and thymidylate synthetase, which are synthesized within a few minutes after infection as measured in extracts, do not function in vivo immediately after their formation. Instead, in vivo these enzyme activities initiate about 5 min after infection at 30°. The activities initially increase exponentially, and then become linear. This exponential activation process does not require concomitant protein synthesis. A number of experiments rule against substrate limitation, feedback, or isotope dilution as an explanation of these kinetic data. Thus, the same kinetic behavior in vivo is observed on infection by mutants which are unable to synthesize T4 DNA (DO) and accumulate deoxyribonucleotides. However, amber mutants of gene 43, the structural gene for T4-induced DNA polymerase, are exceptions. Infection by these mutants clearly showed a reduced initial rate of 3H release. Concurrent measurement of DNA synthesis and of in vivo enzyme activity indicates that these two processes follow the same kinetics and coincide in time. These results suggest that the limiting factor in DNA replication is the rate of formation of the deoxyribonucleotide substrates. From these and previous studies we have postulated that dCMP hydroxymethylase and thymidylate synthetase and apparently other enzymes forming deoxyribonucleotides must, to be active in vivo, become part of a complex. We propose that the exponential activation process represents the formation of this complex from its components."

https://openalex.org/W2112878828,"Abstract Confluent quiescent cultures of 3T3 cells can be stimulated to grow—with or without a medium change—simply by shaking (20 mm excursions, 3 per sec). Shaking without medium change, or with low serum concentration in fresh medium (4%), has the greatest effect on thymidine labeling and mitotic index compared with unshaken cultures, but high serum concentration (20%) stimulates both shaken and unshaken cultures equally. Even without medium change, the majority of cells can be stimulated to incorporate thymidine and to divide over 3 days, though initial shaking for 7 hr is sufficient to initiate growth. We conclude that growth in confluent 3T3 cell cultures is limited by a diffusion barrier in the microenvironment, probably affecting uptake of a serum component. The limitation can be overcome by increased fluid velocity as an alternative to raising the serum concentration. Shaking also causes increased cell movement and a change in cell morphology (which may be partly due to alterations in serum caused by shaking). Despite increased movement in the cell sheet, emigration from the border of a wound is diminished by shaking, suggesting that chemotaxis may be involved. To test whether loss of contact between the migrating cells is essential for growth stimulation at the border of a confluent layer, wounds were made in unshaken cultures in the presence of cytochalasin B, which prevents locomotion of cells and maintains the original topography. Nevertheless, the thymidine labeling index was still increased along the wound boundary, and included cells which were near but not on the edge. This supports the view that short range effects on cell growth at discontinuities in cell populations can be due to modification of a diffusion barrier and not simply alteration in cell contacts."

https://openalex.org/W1573039719,"Abstract We have characterized two mutants of Escherichia coli in which fatty acid biosynthesis is adversely affected by elevated temperature. Under conditions which do not alter the activity of wild type cell-free extracts, virtually all of the malonyl coenzyme A-acyl carrier protein (ACP) transacylase and fatty acid synthetase activities present in mutant extracts are thermolabile. Malonyl transacylase from wild type cells restores normal fatty acid synthetase activity to inactivated mutant extracts. Furthermore, fatty acid synthesis in mutant extracts is corrected by malonyl-ACP. Malonyl transacylase and fatty acid synthetase activities are also restored in revertants which were selected for their ability to grow at elevated temperatures. These experiments furnish evidence that the mutants are altered in the structural gene for malonyl transacylase and that this is their only genetic defect. When these strains, defective in the synthesis of a substrate vital for fatty acid elongation, are grown at elevated temperatures, their phospholipids become deficient in long chain acyl groups. Supplementation of these cultures with long chain fatty acids permits sustained growth and the maintenance of a normal fatty acid composition."

https://openalex.org/W1523151979,"Abstract Oxalacetate synthesis catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase from rat liver in the absence of acetyl-CoA exhibits a pH dependence and specificity for activation by univalent and divalent cations similar to that reported previously for acetyl-CoA-dependent oxalacetate synthesis by this enzyme (Mc-Clure, W. R., Lardy, H. A., and Kneifel, H. P. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 3569–3578). Fractionation studies have provided no indication that different species are responsible for catalysis in the presence or absence of this activator. However, linear Arrhenius and van't Hoff plots are observed for the temperature dependence of oxalacetate synthesis in the absence of acetyl-CoA over the range 10–45° and Ea is obtained as 15.4 Cal per mole. In contrast in the presence of acetyl-CoA biphasic Arrhenius and van't Hoff plots are observed over this temperature range with the changes in slope occurring at approximately 25°. The values obtained for Ea above and below 25° are 9.1 and 31.5 Cal per mole, respectively. Hence the extent of activation of the maximal rate of oxalacetate synthesis by acetyl-CoA is a function of the temperature of observation. The apparent Ka describing activation of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase by acetyl-CoA is a function of [pyruvate] but shows no significant dependence on [MgATP2-] or [HCO3-]. The apparent Ka decreases from a value of 145 µm at [pyruvate] → 0 to 50 to 55 µm as the pyruvate concentration is increased to saturation. These data, which may be relevant to in vivo regulation of the pyruvate → oxalacetate flux, indicate a specific interaction between the catalytic and activator sites of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase. Examination of the specificity of activation of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase by acyl derivatives of coenzyme A and related compounds has shown that acetyl-CoA is the most potent activator of this enzyme. Effective activation is also observed in the presence of alkylacyl homologs in which the acyl chain contains 3 (propionyl-CoA) to 12 (n-dodecanoyl-CoA) carbon atoms while other derivatives, e.g. CoA-SH, adenosine 3':5'-diphosphate, and phenylacetyl-CoA, are weak activators. Carboxyacyl derivatives of coenzyme A, e.g. succinyl-CoA, and derivatives in which the phosphoadenosyl moiety is modified (e.g. acetyl-3'-dephospho-CoA, acetyldeamino-CoA, adenosine 2':5'-diphosphate) act as inhibitors of rat liver pyruvate carboxylase. The Hill coefficient describing the relationship between initial rate and activator concentration approximates 2.0 for all activators except adenosine 3':5'-diphosphate indicating that the presence of the 4'-phosphopantetheine portion of the CoA molecule is necessary for observation of cooperative interaction between activator sites. The presence of an alkylacyl moiety enhances the effectiveness of activation as indicated by an increased Vmax and, in some instances, a more favorable apparent Ka. Since longer chain alkylacyl derivatives of coenzyme A act as inhibitors of chicken liver pyruvate carboxylase these data also indicate a marked difference in the response of the chicken and rat liver enzymes to the size of the acyl moiety."

https://openalex.org/W1975539957,"Abstract The unusual nucleotide guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is synthesized in vitro by ribosomes isolated from mouse embryos, but is not formed by ribosomes isolated from adults. Analysis of specific organs shows a developmental change in detectable ppGpp-forming ability. Eleven day embryonic liver ribosomes synthesize ppGpp, but this ability is essentially lost by 14 day embryonic liver and adult liver. Eleven day embryonic brain ribosomes also synthesize ppGpp at a level comparable to that observed using E. coli ribosomes. The synthesis of ppGpp appears to be associated with the early stages of differentiation, when cell proliferation is rapid and specialized protein synthesis is low or absent. The potential role of ppGpp as an effector molecule or regulator in the eucaryotes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2013426806,"GOLDBERGER1 has drawn attention to numerous reports relating both to prokaryote and eukaryote systems in which it has been shown that an enzyme may have, in addition to its own catalytic function, a regulatory role in determining the rate of its own synthesis. He has suggested the term ‘autogenous regulation’ to describe such situations. The term ‘autoregulation’ has previously been used by others2,3 to describe this general phenomenon. Autogenous regulation is, however, itself an example of a more widespread phenomenon, whereby a protein may have a regulatory function as well as a catalytic or structural role. Thus for example, Slonimski and his coworkers4,5 have suggested that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iso-2-cytochrome c regulates the synthesis, not of itself, but of iso-1-cytochrome c, and I have proposed6 that in Aspergillus nidulans, nitrate reductase regulates not only its own synthesis, but also the syntheses of many catabolic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2031640658,"Five Hundred μg/ml tetracycline was found to inhibit the accumulation of RNA in Escherichia coli cells. RNA synthesis was not totally inhibited, however. On the contrary, by using DNA-RNA hybridization, it was found that 500 μg/ml tetracycline specifically inhibits ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis but allows messenger RNA synthesis to continue. Also, tetracycline specifically inhibits initiation of ribosomal RNA synthesis as determined from rate studies. The inhibition of rRNA synthesis at 500 μg/ml tetracycline was not due to several trivial explanations, that is, stimulation of ppGpp synthesis, inhibition of nucleoside triphosphate synthesis, nor was it due to sequestering of magnesium ion necessary for RNA polymerase action. Also, 500 μg/ml tetracycline was not inhibitory to RNA synthesis in permeabilized cells capable of normal rates of rRNA synthesis, similar to data previously obtained using ppGpp. Thus, it is proposed that tetracycline stops rRNA synthesis by inhibiting a ribosomal specific transcription factor; this factor is lost or destroyed during cell permeabilization. It is further proposed that tetracycline acts in a manner analogous to the normal rRNA regulator molecule (very likely ppGpp) at the transcriptional level."
