https://openalex.org/W2028133118,Electrophoresis measurements and electron-microscope observations with two model colloids and a polymeric flocculant show zeta-potential changes and details of floc structure. Fibers of the flocculant extend radially from the particle surface and vary in thickness from 20 to 300 angstroms. Both charge neutralization and bridging may function simultaneously.

The active material in the extracts apparently has a rather specific inhibiting effect on chlorophyll formation in seedlings of various species."

Second, the proposal to introduce live oral poliovirus vaccine by means of country-wide mass immunization programs is irresponsible in the sense that such a procedure would eliminate the possibility of a definitive evaluation of either vaccine in this country, and moreover is unlikely to accomplish more than can be accomplished by a more conservative approach. Third, even after licensing, a new vaccine product must be considered to be on trial, since new variables enter the scene when large-scale manufacture and large-scale use begin. In this connection it is of importance that the margin of safety of live-attenuated-poliovirus lots now in production is not large, as measured by the only laboratory test available-neurovirulence in monkeys. In comparison with unacceptable trial strains, about which questions of safety have been raised after field use, the acceptable strains have measurably less neurovirulence, but the differences are not great, and approval of each lot will require careful scrutiny for evidence of even slight degrees of reversion in neurovirulence during production. Finally, there is a place for both types of vaccine in the control of poliomyelitis throughout the world. How and where each type should be used is a scientific problem which can best be resolved with careful assessment of all the available evidence concerning vaccine characteristics in relation to the ecology of poliomyelitis. From the point of view of a scientific evaluation of the results of the present waccination program in this country, it appears that a quip I made in 1960 (13)-we may now have too many poliomyelitis vaccines!-has come home to roost."

https://openalex.org/W2081713931,"A convenient, practical and effective procedure of administering penicillin by mouth consists of mixing the drug with one tablespoonful of aluminum hydroxide. Substantially higher blood levels are obtained following a 50,000 and a 100,000 unit dose of penicillin with this method than after administration of the drug dissolved in water, either with or without previous ingestion of a mild antacid, such as aluminum hydroxide. Adsorption of penicillin on aluminum hydroxide appears to exert a local protective effect against that portion of gastric acid with which it comes into contact."

(2) The penicillin iodized oil has maintained its potency for 60 days at ice box, room and 37 degrees C. temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2087851988,"Galactic sources of x-rays fluctuating in intensity are explained as being small regions, of enhanced gas density and temperature, emitting thermal Coulomb bremsstrahlung of kiloelectron-volt energies. Hydromagnetic wave motions, of the magnetic fields in the galactic spiral arms, produce the enhanced regions by compressing the clouds of ionized gas to which they are tied by their high electrical conductivity. From the observed periods of fluctuation of a few months, together with the hydromagnetic velocity, it is estimated that the average size of sources does not exceed 1016 centimeters. By using the formula for Coulomb bremsstrahlung and requiring that the sources shall produce the observed x-ray fluxes, one finds a second estimate of size of sources in agreement at about 1016 centimeters. Such regions are too small to be observable radio sources with current radio telescopes."
