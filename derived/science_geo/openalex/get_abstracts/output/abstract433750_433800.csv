https://openalex.org/W2038612772,"Identification of regulatable mechanisms by which transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is repressed will allow strategies to be designed that counter drug resistance associated with its upregulation in tumours that harbour somatic mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), a gene that encodes a joint adaptor and substrate receptor for the Cul3–Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase. We now show that mouse Nrf2 contains two binding sites for β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), which acts as a substrate receptor for the Skp1–Cul1–Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Deletion of either binding site in Nrf2 decreased β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation of the transcription factor. The ability of one of the two β-TrCP-binding sites to serve as a degron could be both increased and decreased by manipulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Biotinylated-peptide pull-down assays identified DSGIS338 and DSAPGS378 as the two β-TrCP-binding motifs in Nrf2. Significantly, our pull-down assays indicated that β-TrCP binds a phosphorylated version of DSGIS more tightly than its non-phosphorylated counterpart, whereas this was not the case for DSAPGS. These data suggest that DSGIS, but not DSAPGS, contains a functional GSK-3 phosphorylation site. Activation of GSK-3 in Keap1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), or in human lung A549 cells that contain mutant Keap1, by inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway markedly reduced endogenous Nrf2 protein and decreased to 10–50% of normal the levels of mRNA for prototypic Nrf2-regulated enzymes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, glutathione S-transferases Alpha-1 and Mu-1, haem oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1. Pre-treatment of Keap1−/− MEFs or A549 cells with the LY294002 PI3K inhibitor or the MK-2206 PKB/Akt inhibitor increased their sensitivity to acrolein, chlorambucil and cisplatin between 1.9-fold and 3.1-fold, and this was substantially attenuated by simultaneous pre-treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor CT99021."
https://openalex.org/W2046965677,"Metabolites, typically recognized as small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions, provide a functional signature of phenotype that is complimentary to the upstream biochemical information obtained from genes, transcripts, and proteins. The high-level of correlation between metabolites and phenotype has created a surge of interest in the field that is reflected in the number of metabolomic publications growing from just a few articles in 1999 to over five thousand in 2011. Although relatively new compared to its genomic and proteomic predecessors, already metabolomics has led to the discovery of biomarkers for disease, fundamental insights into cellular biochemistry, and clues related to disease pathogenesis.1,2"

https://openalex.org/W1998922755,"Background Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. In the absence of specific drugs or vaccines, control focuses on suppressing the principal mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, yet current methods have not proven adequate to control the disease. New methods are therefore urgently needed, for example genetics-based sterile-male-release methods. However, this requires that lab-reared, modified mosquitoes be able to survive and disperse adequately in the field. Methodology/Principal Findings Adult male mosquitoes were released into an uninhabited forested area of Pahang, Malaysia. Their survival and dispersal was assessed by use of a network of traps. Two strains were used, an engineered ‘genetically sterile’ (OX513A) and a wild-type laboratory strain, to give both absolute and relative data about the performance of the modified mosquitoes. The two strains had similar maximum dispersal distances (220 m), but mean distance travelled of the OX513A strain was lower (52 vs. 100 m). Life expectancy was similar (2.0 vs. 2.2 days). Recapture rates were high for both strains, possibly because of the uninhabited nature of the site. Conclusions/Significance After extensive contained studies and regulatory scrutiny, a field release of engineered mosquitoes was safely and successfully conducted in Malaysia. The engineered strain showed similar field longevity to an unmodified counterpart, though in this setting dispersal was reduced relative to the unmodified strain. These data are encouraging for the future testing and implementation of genetic control strategies and will help guide future field use of this and other engineered strains."
https://openalex.org/W2042134072,"Synthetic lethality is an approach to study selective cell killing based on genotype. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that loss of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with BRCA2 deficiency, while exhibiting no impact on cell growth and viability in BRCA2-proficient cells. We now show that this same synthetically lethal relationship is evident in cells with deficiencies in BRCA1 or PALB2, which implicates BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2 in an epistatic relationship with one another. When RAD52 was depleted in BRCA1- or PALB2-deficient cells, a severe reduction in plating efficiency was observed, with many abortive attempts at cell division apparent in the double-depleted background. In contrast, when RAD52 was depleted in a BRCA1- or PALB2-wildtype background, a negligible decrease in colony survival was observed. The frequency of ionizing radiation-induced RAD51 foci formation and double-strand break-induced homologous recombination (HR) was decreased by 3- and 10-fold, respectively, when RAD52 was knocked down in BRCA1- or PALB2-depleted cells, with minimal effect in BRCA1- or PALB2-proficient cells. RAD52 function was independent of BRCA1 status, as evidenced by the lack of any defect in RAD52 foci formation in BRCA1-depleted cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that RAD52 is an alternative repair pathway of RAD51-mediated HR, and a target for therapy in cells deficient in the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2080878119,"Cells employ highly dynamic signaling networks to drive biological decision processes. Perturbations to these signaling networks may attract cells to new malignant signaling and phenotypic states, termed cancer network attractors, that result in cancer development. As different cancer cells reach these malignant states by accumulating different molecular alterations, uncovering these mechanisms represents a grand challenge in cancer biology. Addressing this challenge will require new systems-based strategies that capture the intrinsic properties of cancer signaling networks and provide deeper understanding of the processes by which genetic lesions perturb these networks and lead to disease phenotypes. Network biology will help circumvent fundamental obstacles in cancer treatment, such as drug resistance and metastasis, empowering personalized and tumor-specific cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1965509718,"Microbes of the human respiratory tract are important in health and disease, but accurate sampling of the lung presents challenges. Lung microbes are commonly sampled by bronchoscopy, but to acquire samples the bronchoscope must pass through the upper respiratory tract, which is rich in microbes. Here we present methods to identify authentic lung microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid that contains substantial oropharyngeal admixture. We studied clinical BAL samples from six selected subjects with potential heavy lung colonization. A single sample of BAL fluid was obtained from each subject along with contemporaneous oral wash (OW) to sample the oropharynx, and then DNA was extracted from three separate aliquots of each. Bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were amplified and products analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. By comparing replicates, we were able to specify the depth of sequencing needed to reach a 95% chance of identifying a bacterial lineage of a given proportion—for example, at a depth of 5,000 tags, OTUs of proportion 0.3% or greater would be called with 95% confidence. We next constructed a single-sided outlier test that allowed lung-enriched organisms to be quantified against a background of oropharyngeal admixture, and assessed improvements available with replicate sequence analysis. This allowed identification of lineages enriched in lung in some BAL specimens. Finally, using samples from healthy volunteers collected at multiple sites in the upper respiratory tract, we show that OW provides a reasonable but not perfect surrogate for bacteria carried into to the lung by a bronchoscope. These methods allow identification of microbes that can replicate in the lung despite the background due to oropharyngeal microbes derived from aspiration and bronchoscopic carry-over."
https://openalex.org/W2054506446,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent brain tumor in adults and is the most lethal form of human cancer. Despite the improvements in treatments, survival of patients remains poor. To define novel pathways that regulate susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in glioma, we have performed genome-wide expression profiling of microRNAs (miRs). We show that in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells, levels of different miRs are increased, and in particular, miR-30b/c and -21. We demonstrate that these miRs impair TRAIL-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of key functional proteins. T98G-sensitive cells treated with miR-21 or -30b/c become resistant to TRAIL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-30b/c and miR-21 target respectively the 3′ untranslated region of caspase-3 and TAp63 mRNAs, and that those proteins mediate some of the effects of miR-30 and -21 on TRAIL resistance, even in human glioblastoma primary cells and in lung cancer cells. In conclusion, we show that high expression levels of miR-21 and -30b/c are needed to maintain the TRAIL-resistant phenotype, thus making these miRs as promising therapeutic targets for TRAIL resistance in glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2118043562,"Endometrium is the inner lining of the uterus which is composed of epithelial and stromal tissue compartments enclosed by the two smooth muscle layers of the myometrium. In women, much of the endometrium is shed and regenerated each month during the menstrual cycle. Endometrial regeneration also occurs after parturition. The cellular mechanisms that regulate endometrial regeneration are still poorly understood. Using genetic fate-mapping in the mouse, we found that the epithelial compartment of the endometrium maintains its epithelial identity during the estrous cycle and postpartum regeneration. However, whereas the stromal compartment maintains its identity during homeostatic cycling, after parturition a subset of stromal cells differentiates into epithelium that is subsequently maintained. These findings identify potential progenitor cells within the endometrial stromal compartment that produce long-term epithelial tissue during postpartum endometrial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2039974469,"Modifications of skeletal muscle mitochondria following exposure to high altitude (HA) are generally studied by morphological examinations and biochemical analysis of expression. The aim of this study was to examine tangible measures of mitochondrial function following a prolonged exposure to HA. For this purpose, skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 8 lowland natives at sea level (SL) prior to exposure and again after 28 d of exposure to HA at 3454 m. High-resolution respirometry was performed on the muscle samples comparing respiratory capacity and efficiency. Exercise capacity was assessed at SL and HA. Respirometric analysis revealed that mitochondrial respiratory capacity diminished in complex I- and complex II-specific respiration in addition to a loss of maximal state-3 oxidative phosphorylation capacity from SL to HA, all independent from alterations in mitochondrial content. Leak control coupling, respiratory control ratio, and oligomycin-induced leak respiration, all measures of mitochondrial efficiency, improved in response to HA exposure. SL respiratory capacities correlated with measures of exercise capacity near SL, whereas mitochondrial efficiency correlated best with exercise capacity following HA. This data demonstrate that 1 mo of exposure to HA reduces respiratory capacity in human skeletal muscle; however, the efficiency of electron transport improves.—Jacobs, R. A., Siebenmann, C., Hug, M., Toigo, M., Meinild, A.-K., Lundby, C. Twenty-eight days at 3454-m altitude diminishes respiratory capacity but enhances efficiency in human skeletal muscle mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W1987939643,"The mechanism by which membrane proteins exhibit structural and functional duality in the same membrane or different membranes is unknown. We posit that such duality is determined by both the protein sequence and the membrane lipid composition wherein a spatial or temporal change in the latter can result in a post-assembly change in protein structure and function. To investigate whether co-existence of multiple topological conformers is dependent on the membrane lipid composition, we determined the topological organization of lactose permease in an Escherichia coli model cell system in which phosphatidylethanolamine membrane content can be systematically varied. At intermediate levels of phosphatidylethanolamine a mixture of native and topologically mis-oriented conformers co-existed. There was no threshold level of phosphatidylethanolamine determining a sharp transition from one conformer to the other. Co-existing conformers were not in rapid equilibrium at a static lipid composition indicating that duality of topology is established during an early folding step. Depletion of intermediate levels of phosphatidylethanolamine after final protein assembly resulted in complete mis-orientation of the native conformer. Combined with previous results, such topological dynamics are reversible in both directions. We propose a thermodynamically based model for how lipid-protein interactions can result in a mixed topological organization and how changes in lipid composition can result in changes in the ratio of topologically distinct conformers of proteins. These observations demonstrate a potential lipid-dependent biological switch for generating dynamic structural and functional heterogeneity for a protein within the same membrane or between different membranes in more complex eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023397802,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, are involved in many complex cellular processes. Several miRNAs are differentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and play important roles in normal differentiation, but, when aberrantly regulated, contribute to the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of leukemic cells. Recently, we reported that a small subset of miRNAs is differentially expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts and is modulated by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). In particular, PML/RARα-positive blasts from APL patients display lower levels of miRNA let-7c, a member of the let-7 family, than normal promyelocytes and its expression increases after ATRA treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of let-7c in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We found that ectopic expression of let-7c promotes granulocytic differentiation of AML cell lines and primary blasts. Moreover, we identified PBX2, a well-known homeodomain protein whose aberrant expression enhances HoxA9-dependent leukemogenesis, as a novel let-7c target that may contribute to the AML phenotype. Together, these studies raise the possibility that perturbation of the let-7c-PBX2 pathway may have a therapeutic value in AML."
https://openalex.org/W1969660254,"The prevailing model suggests that cell fate after mitotic arrest depends on two independent and competing networks that control cyclin B1 degradation and the generation of death signals. However, recent evidence for Cdk1/cyclin B1-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins suggests the existence of significant cross-talk and interdependence between these pathways. Further, the nature of the mitotic death signals has remained elusive. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that fate after mitotic arrest is dictated by the robustness of Cdk1/cyclin B1 signaling to Bcl-2 proteins and to identify signals that may represent a mitotic death signature. We show that when treated with Taxol, slippage-resistant HT29 colon carcinoma cells display robust Cdk1 activity and extensive Mcl-1/Bcl-x(L) phosphorylation and die in mitosis, whereas slippage-prone DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells display weak Cdk1 activity and partial and transient Mcl-1/Bcl-x(L) phosphorylation and die in subsequent interphase or survive. Furthermore, modulation of this signaling axis, either by inhibition of Cdk1 in slippage-resistant HT29 or by enforcing mitotic arrest in slippage-prone DLD-1 cells, evokes a switch in fate, indicating that the strength of Cdk1 signaling to Bcl-2 proteins is a key determinant of outcome. These findings provide novel insight into the pathways that regulate mitotic death, suggest that the robustness of these signaling events may be useful as a marker to define susceptibility to antimitotic drugs, and encourage a revision in the current model describing fate after mitotic arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2095500603,"Background Mouse angiogenin 4 (Ang4) has previously been described as a Paneth cell–derived antimicrobial peptide important in epithelial host defence in the small intestine. However, a source for Ang4 in the large intestine, which is devoid of Paneth cells, has not been defined. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis was performed on Ang4 expression in colonic tissue by qPCR and immunohistochemistry following infection with the large intestine dwelling helminth parasite Trichuris muris. This demonstrated an increase in expression of the peptide following infection of resistant BALB/c mice. Further, histological analysis of colonic tissue revealed the cellular source of this Ang4 to be goblet cells. To elucidate the mechanism of Ang4 expression immunohistochemistry and qPCR for Ang4 was performed on colonic tissue from T. muris infected mouse mutants. Experiments comparing C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice, which have a natural inactivating mutation of TLR4, revealed that Ang4 expression is TLR4 independent. Subsequent experiments with IL-13 and IL-4 receptor alpha deficient mice demonstrated that goblet cell expression of Ang4 is controlled either directly or indirectly by IL-13. Conclusions The cellular source of mouse Ang4 in the colon following T. muris infection is the goblet cell and expression is under the control of IL-13."
https://openalex.org/W1996336661,"The complexity of gene regulation has created obstacles to defining mechanisms that establish the patterns of gene expression characteristic of the different clinical phenotypes of breast cancer. TFAP2C is a transcription factor that has a critical role in the regulation of both estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) and c-ErbB2/HER2 (Her2). Herein, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) for TFAP2C in four breast cancer cell lines. Comparing the genomic binding sites for TFAP2C, we identified that glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) is regulated by TFAP2C through an AP-2 regulatory region in the promoter of the GPX1 gene. Knockdown of TFAP2C, but not the related factor TFAP2A, resulted in an abrogation of GPX1 expression. Selenium-dependent GPX activity correlated with endogenous GPX1 expression and overexpression of exogenous GPX1 induced GPX activity and significantly increased resistance to tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Methylation of the CpG island encompassing the AP-2 regulatory region was identified in cell lines where TFAP2C failed to bind the GPX1 promoter and GPX1 expression was unresponsive to TFAP2C. Furthermore, in cell lines where GPX1 promoter methylation was associated with gene silencing, treatment with 5′-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5′-aza-dC) (an inhibitor of DNA methylation) allowed TFAP2C to bind to the GPX1 promoter resulting in the activation of GPX1 RNA and protein expression. Methylation of the GPX1 promoter was identified in ∼20% of primary breast cancers and a highly significant correlation between the TFAP2C and GPX1 expression was confirmed when considering only those tumors with an unmethylated promoter, whereas the related factor, TFAP2A, failed to demonstrate a correlation. The results demonstrate that TFAP2C regulates the expression of GPX1, which influences the redox state and sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by peroxides. Given the established role of GPX1 in breast cancer, the results provide an important mechanism for TFAP2C to further influence oncogenesis and progression of breast carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064882455,"Recent work implicated the Escherichia coli BioC protein as the initiator of the synthetic pathway that forms the pimeloyl moiety of biotin (Lin, S., Hanson, R. E., and Cronan, J. E. (2010) Nat. Chem. Biol. 6, 682-688). BioC was believed to be an O-methyltransferase that methylated the free carboxyl of either malonyl-CoA or malonyl-acyl carrier protein based on the ability of O-methylated (but not unmethylated) precursors to bypass the BioC requirement for biotin synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. However, only indirect proof of the hypothesized enzymatic activity was obtained because the activities of the available BioC preparations were too low for direct enzymatic assay. Because E. coli BioC protein was extremely recalcitrant to purification in an active form, BioC homologues of other bacteria were tested. We report that the native form of Bacillus cereus ATCC10987 BioC functionally replaced E. coli BioC in vivo, and the protein could be expressed in soluble form and purified to homogeneity. In disagreement with prior scenarios that favored malonyl-CoA as the methyl acceptor, malonyl-acyl carrier protein was a far better acceptor of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine than was malonyl-CoA. BioC was specific for the malonyl moiety and was inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinefungin. High level expression of B. cereus BioC in E. coli blocked cell growth and fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094808636,"KRAS mutations are one of the most common driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and finding druggable target molecules to inhibit oncogenic KRAS signaling is a significant challenge in NSCLC therapy. We recently identified epiregulin (EREG) as one of several putative transcriptional targets of oncogenic KRAS signaling in both KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells and immortalized bronchial epithelial cells expressing ectopic mutant KRAS. In the current study, we found that EREG is overexpressed in NSCLCs harboring KRAS, BRAF or EGFR mutations compared with NSCLCs with wild-type KRAS/BRAF/EGFR. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting mutant KRAS, but not an siRNA targeting wild-type KRAS, significantly reduced EREG expression in KRAS-mutant and EREG-overexpressing NSCLC cell lines. In these cell lines, EREG expression was downregulated by MEK and ERK inhibitors. Importantly, EREG expression significantly correlated with KRAS expression or KRAS copy number in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. Further expression analysis using 89 NSCLC specimens showed that EREG was predominantly expressed in NSCLCs with pleural involvement, lymphatic permeation or vascular invasion and in KRAS-mutant adenocarcinomas. In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that EREG expression is an independent prognostic marker and EREG overexpression in combination with KRAS mutations was associated with an unfavorable prognosis for lung adenocarcinoma patients. In KRAS-mutant and EREG overexpressing NSCLC cells, siRNA-mediated EREG silencing inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that oncogenic KRAS-induced EREG overexpression contributes to an aggressive phenotype and could be a promising therapeutic target in oncogenic KRAS-driven NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2031738466,"Ornamental fishes are among the most popular and fastest growing categories of pets in the United States (U.S.). The global scope and scale of the ornamental fish trade and growing popularity of pet fish in the U.S. are strong indicators of the myriad economic and social benefits the pet industry provides. Relatively little is known about the microbial communities associated with these ornamental fishes or the aquarium water in which they are transported and housed. Using conventional molecular approaches and next generation high-throughput amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions, we characterized the bacterial community of aquarium water containing common goldfish (Carassius auratus) and Chinese algae eaters (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri) purchased from seven pet/aquarium shops in Rhode Island and identified the presence of potential pathogens. Our survey identified a total of 30 phyla, the most common being Proteobacteria (52%), Bacteroidetes (18%) and Planctomycetes (6%), with the top four phyla representing >80% of all sequences. Sequences from our water samples were most closely related to eleven bacterial species that have the potential to cause disease in fishes, humans and other species: Coxiella burnetii, Flavobacterium columnare, Legionella birminghamensis, L. pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, V. mimicus. V. vulnificus, Aeromonas schubertii, A. veronii, A. hydrophila and Plesiomonas shigelloides. Our results, combined with evidence from the literature, suggest aquarium tank water harboring ornamental fish are an understudied source for novel microbial communities and pathogens that pose potential risks to the pet industry, fishes in trade, humans and other species."
https://openalex.org/W2035056628,"Rho signaling is increasingly recognized to contribute to invasion and metastasis. In this study, we discovered that metastasis-associated protein S100A4 interacts with the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin, thus connecting S100A4 to the Rho pathway. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that S100A4 specifically and directly binds to Rhotekin RBD, but not the other Rho effector RBDs. S100A4 binding to Rhotekin is calcium-dependent and uses residues distinct from those bound by active Rho. Interestingly, we found that S100A4 and Rhotekin can form a complex with active RhoA. Using RNA interference, we determined that suppression of both S100A4 and Rhotekin leads to loss of Rho-dependent membrane ruffling in response to epidermal growth factor, an increase in contractile F-actin ‘stress’ fibers and blocks invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Accordingly, our data suggest that interaction of S100A4 and Rhotekin permits S100A4 to complex with RhoA and switch Rho function from stress fiber formation to membrane ruffling to confer an invasive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2084761766,"Chronic mast cell activation is a characteristic feature of asthma. BEAS-2B human airway epithelial cells (AEC) profoundly inhibit both constitutive and IgE-dependent human lung mast cell (HLMC) histamine release. The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of HLMC degranulation by primary AEC from healthy and asthmatic subjects, and investigate further the inhibitory mechanism.HLMC were co-cultured with both BEAS-2B and primary AEC grown as monolayers or air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures.Both constitutive and IgE-dependent HLMC histamine release were attenuated by BEAS-2B, primary AEC monolayers and ALI cultures. This occurred in the absence of HLMC-AEC contact indicating the presence of a soluble factor. Unlike healthy ALI AEC, asthmatic ALI-AEC did not significantly reduce constitutive histamine release. AEC inhibitory activity was transferable in primary AEC monolayer supernatant, but less active than with Transwell co-culture, suggesting that the inhibitory factor was labile. The AEC inhibitory effects were attenuated by both AEC wounding and pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of a G(0)/G(i) receptor coupled mechanism. Solid phase extraction of lipids (<10 kDa) removed the AEC inhibitory activity. The lipid derivatives resolving D1 and D2 and lipoxin A(4) attenuated HLMC histamine release in a dose-dependent fashion but were not detectable in co-culture supernatants.Primary AEC suppress HLMC constitutive and IgE-dependent histamine secretion through the release of a soluble, labile lipid mediator(s) that signals through the G(0)/G(i) receptor coupled mechanism. Manipulation of this interaction may have a significant therapeutic role in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2077833306,"Argyrins, produced by myxobacteria and actinomycetes, are cyclic octapeptides with antibacterial and antitumor activity. Here, we identify elongation factor G (EF-G) as the cellular target of argyrin B in bacteria, via resistant mutant selection and whole genome sequencing, biophysical binding studies and crystallography. Argyrin B binds a novel allosteric pocket in EF-G, distinct from the known EF-G inhibitor antibiotic fusidic acid, revealing a new mode of protein synthesis inhibition. In eukaryotic cells, argyrin B was found to target mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EF-G1), the closest homologue of bacterial EF-G. By blocking mitochondrial translation, argyrin B depletes electron transport components and inhibits the growth of yeast and tumor cells. Further supporting direct inhibition of EF-G1, expression of an argyrin B-binding deficient EF-G1 L693Q variant partially rescued argyrin B-sensitivity in tumor cells. In summary, we show that argyrin B is an antibacterial and cytotoxic agent that inhibits the evolutionarily conserved target EF-G, blocking protein synthesis in bacteria and mitochondrial translation in yeast and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998513475,"CIB1 is a 22-kDa regulatory protein previously implicated in cell survival and proliferation. However, the mechanism by which CIB1 regulates these processes is poorly defined. Here, we report that CIB1 depletion in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells promotes non-apoptotic, caspase-independent cell death that is not initiated by increased outer mitochondrial membrane permeability or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus. Instead, cell death requires nuclear GAPDH accumulation. Furthermore, CIB1 depletion disrupts two commonly dysregulated, oncogenic pathways-PI3K/AKT and Ras/MEK/ERK, resulting in a synergistic mechanism of cell death, which was mimicked by simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of both pathways, but not either pathway alone. In defining each pathway's contributions, we found that AKT inhibition alone maximally induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation, whereas MEK/ERK inhibition alone had no effect on GAPDH localization. Concurrent GAPDH nuclear accumulation and ERK inhibition were required, however, to induce a significant DNA damage response, which was critical to subsequent cell death. Collectively, our results indicate that CIB1 is uniquely positioned to regulate PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling and that simultaneous disruption of these pathways synergistically induces a nuclear GAPDH-dependent cell death. The mechanistic insights into cell death induced by CIB1 interference suggest novel molecular targets for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2012659268,"Rare polyagglutinable NOR erythrocytes contain three unique globoside (Gb4Cer) derivatives, NOR1, NOR(int), and NOR2, in which Gal(α1-4), GalNAc(β1-3)Gal(α1-4), and Gal(α1-4)GalNAc(β1-3)Gal(α1-4), respectively, are linked to the terminal GalNAc residue of Gb4Cer. NOR1 and NOR2, which both terminate with a Gal(α1-4)GalNAc- sequence, react with anti-NOR antibodies commonly present in human sera. While searching for an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of Gal(α1-4)GalNAc, we identified a mutation in the A4GALT gene encoding Gb3/CD77 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase). Fourteen NOR-positive donors were heterozygous for the C>G mutation at position 631 of the open reading frame of the A4GALT gene, whereas 495 NOR-negative donors were homozygous for C at this position. The enzyme encoded by the mutated gene contains glutamic acid instead of glutamine at position 211 (substitution Q211E). To determine whether this mutation could change the enzyme specificity, we transfected a teratocarcinoma cell line (2102Ep) with vectors encoding the consensus Gb3/CD77 synthase and Gb3/CD77 synthase with Glu at position 211. The cellular glycolipids produced by these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, high-performance thin-layer chromatography, enzymatic degradation, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Cells transfected with either vector expressed the P1 blood group antigen, which was absent from untransfected cells. Cells transfected with the vector encoding the Gb3/CD77 synthase with Glu at position 211 expressed both P1 and NOR antigens. Collectively, these results suggest that the C631G mutation alters the acceptor specificity of Gb3/CD77 synthase, rendering it able to catalyze synthesis of the Gal(α1-4)Gal and Gal(α1-4)GalNAc moieties."
https://openalex.org/W2029217292,"The recent elucidation of crystal structures of a bacterial member of the NCS1 family, the Mhp1 benzyl-hydantoin permease from Microbacterium liquefaciens, allowed us to construct and validate a three-dimensional model of the Aspergillus nidulans purine-cytosine/H(+) FcyB symporter. The model consists of 12 transmembrane α-helical, segments (TMSs) and cytoplasmic N- and C-tails. A distinct core of 10 TMSs is made of two intertwined inverted repeats (TMS1-5 and TMS6-10) that are followed by two additional TMSs. TMS1, TMS3, TMS6, and TMS8 form an open cavity that is predicted to host the substrate binding site. Based on primary sequence alignment, three-dimensional topology, and substrate docking, we identified five residues as potentially essential for substrate binding in FcyB; Ser-85 (TMS1), Trp-159, Asn-163 (TMS3), Trp-259 (TMS6), and Asn-354 (TMS8). To validate the role of these and other putatively critical residues, we performed a systematic functional analysis of relevant mutants. We show that the proposed substrate binding residues, plus Asn-350, Asn-351, and Pro-353 are irreplaceable for FcyB function. Among these residues, Ser-85, Asn-163, Asn-350, Asn-351, and Asn-354 are critical for determining the substrate binding affinity and/or the specificity of FcyB. Our results suggest that Ser-85, Asn-163, and Asn-354 directly interact with substrates, Trp-159 and Trp-259 stabilize binding through π-π stacking interactions, and Pro-353 affects the local architecture of substrate binding site, whereas Asn-350 and Asn-351 probably affect substrate binding indirectly. Our work is the first systematic approach to address structure-function-specificity relationships in a eukaryotic member of NCS1 family by combining genetic and computational approaches."

Commercial ZFNs were reported to enhance gene targeting directly in mouse zygotes, whereas similar approaches using publicly available resources have not yet been described. Here we report precise targeted mutagenesis of the mouse genome using Oligomerized Pool Engineering (OPEN) ZFNs. OPEN ZFN can be constructed using publicly available resources and therefore provide an attractive alternative for academic researchers. Two ZFN pairs specific to the mouse genomic locus gt(ROSA26)Sor were generated by OPEN selections and used for gene disruption and homology-mediated gene replacement in single cell mouse embryos. One specific ZFN pair facilitated non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated gene disruption when expressed in mouse zygotes. We also observed a single homologous recombination (HR)-driven gene replacement event when this ZFN pair was co-injected with a targeting vector. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of achieving both gene ablation through NHEJ and gene replacement by HR by using the OPEN ZFN technology directly in mouse zygotes."

It is now clear that a GPCR coupling to these pathways can be regulated selectively by ligands that differentially drive signaling down one pathway in preference to another. This concept, termed stimulus bias, is revolutionizing receptor biology and drug discovery by providing a means of selectively targeting receptor signaling pathways that have therapeutic impact. Herein, we utilized a novel quantitative method that determines stimulus bias of synthetic GPCR ligands in a manner that nullifies the impact of both the cellular background and the “natural bias” of the endogenous ligand. By applying this method to the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical GPCR, we found that mutation of key residues (Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28) in an allosteric binding pocket introduces stimulus bias in response to the atypical ligands AC-42 (4-n-butyl-1-(4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-1-butyl)piperidine HCl) and 77-LH-28-1 (1-(3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl)- 3,3-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone). By comparing stimulus bias factors among receptor internalization, G protein activation, extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, and receptor phosphorylation, we provide evidence that Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28 act either as molecular switches or as gatekeeper residues that introduce constraints limiting the active conformation of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and thereby regulate stimulus bias. Furthermore, we provide evidence that downstream signaling pathways previously considered to be related to each other (i.e. receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and activation of ERK1/2) can act independently.

https://openalex.org/W1999015605,"A DNA barcode is a preferrably short and highly variable region of DNA supposed to facilitate a rapid identification of species. In many protistan lineages, a lack of species-specific morphological characters hampers an identification of species by light or electron microscopy, and difficulties to perform mating experiments in laboratory cultures also do not allow for an identification of biological species. Thus, testing candidate barcode markers as well as establishment of accurately working species identification systems are more challenging than in multicellular organisms. In cryptic species complexes the performance of a potential barcode marker can not be monitored using morphological characters as a feedback, but an inappropriate choice of DNA region may result in artifactual species trees for several reasons. Therefore a priori knowledge of the systematics of a group is required. In addition to identification of known species, methods for an automatic delimitation of species with DNA barcodes have been proposed. The Cryptophyceae provide a mixture of systematically well characterized as well as badly characterized groups and are used in this study to test the suitability of some of the methods for protists. As species identification method the performance of blast in searches against badly to well-sampled reference databases has been tested with COI-5P and 5'-partial LSU rDNA (domains A to D of the nuclear LSU rRNA gene). In addition the performance of two different methods for automatic species delimitation, fixed thresholds of genetic divergence and the general mixed Yule-coalescent model (GMYC), have been examined. The study demonstrates some pitfalls of barcoding methods that have to be taken care of. Also a best-practice approach towards establishing a DNA barcode system in protists is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2089893679,"Platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) is frequently upregulated in various cancers and thought to function as a key player in the development and progression of tumor growth by regulating aspects of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which it is upregulated is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of two transcription factors that signal for the bone morphogenetic proteins (Smad1 and Smad5) in ovarian granulosa cells causes metastatic granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) in female mice and phenocopies human juvenile GCTs (JGCTs). Smad1/5 double conditional knockout tumors, as well as human JGCTs, are highly vascularized, hemorrhagic and mitotically active. Expression analysis of these tumors and their metastases revealed a significant upregulation of key proliferation and pro-angiogenic factors such as Pdgfa, Pdgfb and Vegf. We examined whether these genes were direct targets of SMAD1 and SMAD5. Knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in mouse primary granulosa cells and a human GCT-derived cell line (COV434) resulted in upregulation of PDGFA, but not PDGFB nor VEGF. We identified several putative SMAD1/5-binding sites in the PDGFA promoter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated that SMAD1/5 interact with the PDGFA promoter to regulate its activity. Further, SMAD1/5 antagonize the activity of the transcription factor Sp1, a well-known positive regulator of PDGFA, by inhibiting its occupancy at a key regulatory site on the proximal PDGFA promoter. Collectively, our studies establish that loss of SMAD1/5 leads to upregulation of PDGFA in ovarian granulosa cells, and that a novel regulatory interaction exists between the BR-SMADs and Sp1 in controlling PDGFA expression during granulosa cell tumorigenesis."

Hitherto, we identified GlmU from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (GlmUMtb) to be unique in possessing a 30-residue extension at the C terminus. Here, we present the crystal structures of GlmUMtb in complex with substrates/products bound at the acetyltransferase active site. Analysis of these and mutational data, allow us to infer a catalytic mechanism operative in GlmUMtb.

https://openalex.org/W2101370689,"We report on the role of hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) as an inhibitor of metastasis. HEXIM1 expression is decreased in human metastatic breast cancers when compared with matched primary breast tumors. Similarly we observed decreased expression of HEXIM1 in lung metastasis when compared with primary mammary tumors in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer, the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) transgenic mouse. Re-expression of HEXIM1 (through transgene expression or localized delivery of a small molecule inducer of HEXIM1 expression, hexamethylene-bis-acetamide) in PyMT mice resulted in inhibition of metastasis to the lung. Our present studies indicate that HEXIM1 downregulation of HIF-1α protein allows not only for inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor-regulated angiogenesis, but also for inhibition of compensatory pro-angiogenic pathways and recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs). Another novel finding is that HEXIM1 inhibits cell migration and invasion that can be partly attributed to decreased membrane localization of the 67 kDa laminin receptor, 67LR, and inhibition of the functional interaction of 67LR with laminin. Thus, HEXIM1 re-expression in breast cancer has therapeutic advantages by simultaneously targeting more than one pathway involved in angiogenesis and metastasis. Our results also support the potential for HEXIM1 to indirectly act on multiple cell types to suppress metastatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2051748173,"d-Alanyl:d-lactate (d-Ala:d-Lac) and d-alanyl:d-serine ligases are key enzymes in vancomycin resistance of Gram-positive cocci. They catalyze a critical step in the synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors that are low binding affinity targets for vancomycin. The structure of the d-Ala:d-Lac ligase VanA led to the understanding of the molecular basis for its specificity, but that of d-Ala:d-Ser ligases had not been determined. We have investigated the enzymatic kinetics of the d-Ala:d-Ser ligase VanG from Enterococcus faecalis and solved its crystal structure in complex with ADP. The overall structure of VanG is similar to that of VanA but has significant differences mainly in the N-terminal and central domains. Based on reported mutagenesis data and comparison of the VanG and VanA structures, we show that residues Asp-243, Phe-252, and Arg-324 are molecular determinants for d-Ser selectivity. These residues are conserved in both enzymes and explain why VanA also displays d-Ala:d-Ser ligase activity, albeit with low catalytic efficiency in comparison with VanG. These observations suggest that d-Ala:d-Lac and d-Ala:d-Ser enzymes have evolved from a common ancestral d-Ala:d-X ligase. The crystal structure of VanG showed an unusual interaction between two dimers involving residues of the omega loop that are deeply anchored in the active site. We constructed an octapeptide mimicking the omega loop and found that it selectively inhibits VanG and VanA but not Staphylococcus aureus d-Ala:d-Ala ligase. This study provides additional insight into the molecular evolution of d-Ala:d-X ligases and could contribute to the development of new structure-based inhibitors of vancomycin resistance enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2166024501,"We introduce the concept of metaconsensus and employ it to make high confidence predictions of early enzyme functions and the metabolic properties that they may have produced. Several independent studies have used comparative bioinformatics methods to identify taxonomically broad features of genomic sequence data, protein structure data, and metabolic pathway data in order to predict physiological features that were present in early, ancestral life forms. But all such methods carry with them some level of technical bias. Here, we cross-reference the results of these previous studies to determine enzyme functions predicted to be ancient by multiple methods. We survey modern metabolic pathways to identify those that maintain the highest frequency of metaconsensus enzymes. Using the full set of modern reactions catalyzed by these metaconsensus enzyme functions, we reconstruct a representative metabolic network that may reflect the core metabolism of early life forms. Our results show that ten enzyme functions, four hydrolases, three transferases, one oxidoreductase, one lyase, and one ligase, are determined by metaconsensus to be present at least as late as the last universal common ancestor. Subnetworks within central metabolic processes related to sugar and starch metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phospholipid metabolism, and CoA biosynthesis, have high frequencies of these enzyme functions. We demonstrate that a large metabolic network can be generated from this small number of enzyme functions."

The developmental functions of individual constituents of this subcomplex in vertebrates remain elusive. In particular, it is unknown whether Nup107 plays an important role in development of vertebrate embryos. Zebrafish nup107 is maternally expressed and its zygotic expression becomes prominent in the head region and the intestine from 24 h postfertilization (hpf) onward. In this study, we generate a zebrafish mutant line, nup107(tsu068Gt), in which the nup107 locus is disrupted by an insertion of Tol2 transposon element in the first intron and as a result it fails to produce normal transcripts. Homozygous nup107(tsu068Gt) mutant embryos exhibit tissue-specific defects after 3 days postfertilization (dpf), including loss of the pharyngeal skeletons, degeneration of the intestine, absence of the swim bladder, and smaller eyes. These mutants die at 5-6 days. Extensive apoptosis occurs in the affected tissues, which is partially dependent on p53 apoptotic pathways. In cells of the defective tissues, FG-repeat nucleoporins are disturbed and nuclear pore number is reduced, leading to impaired translocation of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our findings shed new light on developmental function of Nup107 in vertebrates."

The end-state comfort effect has been found to be a robust constraint during unimanual movements, and leads to the inference that goal-postures are represented and planned prior to movement initiation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether individuals make appropriate corrections to ensure comfortable final goal postures when faced with an unexpected change in action goal. Participants reached for a horizontal cylinder and placed the left or right end of the object into the target disk. As soon as the participant began to move, a secondary stimuli was triggered, which indicated whether the intended action goal had changed or not. Confirming previous research, participants selected initial grasp postures that ensured end-state comfort during non-perturbed trials. In addition, participants made appropriate on-line corrections to their reach-to-grasp movements to ensure end-state comfort during perturbed trials. Corrections in grasp posture occurred early or late in the reach-to-grasp phase. The results indicate that individuals plan their movements to afford comfort at the end of the movement, and that grasp posture planning is controlled via both feedforward and feedback mechanisms."

Here, we show that PIAS1, a member of the protein inhibitor of the activated STAT family of proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase activity, acts to suppress LXR ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the lipogenic program in hepatocytes. We found that liver mRNA expression levels of Pias1 and Pias3 were inversely associated with those of genes involved in lipogenesis in mouse models with diet-induced or genetic obesity. Overexpression of PIAS1 in primary hepatocytes resulted in a reduction of LXR ligand-induced fatty acid synthesis and suppression of the expression of lipogenic genes, including Srebp1c and Fas. Moreover, PIAS1 was able to interact with LXRβ and repress its transcriptional activity upon ligand stimulation, which did not require PIAS1-promoted SUMO modification of LXRβ. In addition, PIAS1 could also interact with PGC-1β and attenuate its association with LXRβ, blunting the ability of PGC-1β to co-activate LXRβ.

Locarnini S. Hepatitis C virus resistance to protease inhibitors.J. Hepatol. 2011; 55: 192-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Due to the low barrier to viral resistance, telaprevir and boceprevir cannot be used in monotherapy (1Shepard C.W. Finelli L. Alter M.J.

We considered that large peptides might provide an interesting alternative for rapid development of drug leads: they may lead to discovery of a priori binding at alternative sites, thus allowing novel binding mechanisms. Novel motifs having initially weak binding before further optimization may be discovered due to synergism of several motifs over a larger interactive surface. Drugs combining such motifs may well be less affected by HCV resistance mutations, which are reported to have developed on challenge with recent small peptidomimetic drugs. However, direct use of peptides as drugs with potentially high specific activity and low toxicity have not so far been seriously considered due to their low bioavailability (16Sato A.K. Viswanathan M. Kent R.B. Wood C.R. Therapeutic peptides: technological advances driving peptides into development.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2006; 17: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To screen for large IPs against NS3-4A, we used cosmix-plexing, a combinatorial phage display peptide library method (17Collins J. Horn N. Wadenbäck J. Szardenings M. Cosmix-plexing: a novel recombinatorial approach for evolutionary selection from combinatorial libraries.J. Biotechnol. 2001; 74: 317-338PubMed Google Scholar). This combinatorial methodology efficiently assorts parental cassettes in combination with new cassettes carrying novel motifs. In the later stages of inhibitor optimization, we applied x-ray crystallography and rational design. This led to IPs with binding constants in the subnanomolar range bearing a novel tyrosine finger structure that showed an extended coordination to an NS3 pocket remote from the active site. The activity of the NS3-4A protease was tested with a FRET assay (18Taliani M. Bianchi E. Narjes F. Fossatelli M. Urbani A. Steinkühler C. De Francesco R. Pessi A. A continuous assay of hepatitis C virus protease based on resonance energy transfer depsipeptide substrates.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In MTPs (μClear non-binding 96-well black plates, Greiner bio-one), 0.5–1 nm protease was diluted in buffer M2235 (19Misialek S. Rajagopalan R. Stevens S.K. Beigelman L. Seiwert S.D. Kossen K.

Respective inhibitors were incubated with NS3-4A protease for 10–15 min at room temperature prior adding of substrate to a final volume of 200 μl. Fluorescence increase was measured every minute for 30–60 min at 30 °C in a MTP reader (excitation, 360/40 nm; emission, 460/40 nm, Biotek Synergy 2). Each measurement was done in duplicate. Slopes of fluorescence increase were compared with that of a control. A nonlinear regression model (Equation 1) was used to fit curves with GraphPad Prism.Y=100(1+10(log IC50-X)×slope)(Eq. 1) IC50 values were converted to apparent Ki values using Equation 2 for competitive inhibitors (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 per cent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12265) Google Scholar).Ki=IC501+[S]×Km-1(Eq. 2) For affinity selection in microtiter plates (Nunc, Maxisorp), 200 ng of anti-MBP IgG in PBS were immobilized (1 h at room temperature). Wells were washed twice with 250 μl of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 350 of μl 2% (w/v) milk powder in panning buffer (PB) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20/0.5× PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 after cosmix-plexing) at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter, wells were washed twice with 250 μl of PB and an excess of MBP-NS3-4A (1 μg) was immobilized at 4 °C for 90 min. Prior to selection, 200 μl of peptide phagemid particles in PB with 2% (w/v) milk powder containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 were incubated with immobilized MBP to reduce unspecific binding and specific binding to either MBP or anti-MBP IgG. Wells with immobilized fusion protein were washed three times with PB, and pre-incubated peptide phage particles were added. Affinity selection was carried out on a platform shaker at room temperature for 150 min. Unbound phage was removed, and wells were washed at least 10 times (16–20 times after cosmix-plexing) with 250 μl of PB. Bound phage were eluted either by acidic or competitive elution. For acidic elution, 200 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2) was added and incubated for 10 min on a shaker. The eluted phage particles were removed and immediately mixed with 45 μl of neutralization buffer. For competitive elution, 200 μl of a known NS3-4A inhibitor N-1725 (Bachem) was added and incubated for 15 min on a shaker. Phage titer was determined with 10 μl of eluted phage solution. The remaining volume was used for infection of a 20-ml new grown Escherichia coli Top 10 F′ λ+ culture with an A600 of 0.5. The culture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min without and then 30 min with agitation at 180 rpm. After incubation, the cells were pelleted (4000 rpm/10 min), resuspended in 400 μl of 2×YT medium and plated onto a 2×YT agar plate (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 6 μg/ml tetracycline, 37 °C, overnight). Cells were washed from plates and used for phagemid packaging. Single colonies from the titer determination were resuspended in 150 μl of double distilled H2O and used for colony PCR with the primer FSQJCO (5′-TTCTA CAACT TGCTT GGATT-3′). PCR products were used for sequence analysis. Purified NS3-4A protease (40–90 μm) was incubated on ice with >2-fold molar excess of peptide in elution buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.3, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.6 mm lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide, 10% (w/v) glycerol) for 2 h. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min and concentrated to ∼220 μm (∼5 mg/ml) using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (10 kDa; Millipore). Peptides (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added to a final concentration of ∼500 μm. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min. Dilutions with 100 μm (2 mg/ml) and 120 μm (2.5 mg/ml) complex were prepared with 0.1 m buffer of the precipitant solution and used for crystallization. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained after several days at 19 °C by mixing equal volumes of concentrated complex solution with precipitant solution (0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, or 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.1, and 2.2 m KCl, 5% (v/v) isopropanol) by hanging-drop vapor-diffusion crystallization in 24 six-well or 15 six-well plates (EasyXtal; Qiagen). Prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen crystals were cryoprotected with 30% (w/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku MicroMax 7HF copper annode equipped with a Saturn 944+ detector (home source) or at the BESSY synchrotron beamline MX-14.1. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Figures and structure alignments were prepared using PyMOL (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). Data and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S2. To find novel scaffolds for the design of HCV PIs, we chose an approach that did not solely rely on mimicking natural substrate analogues. Initially, the large peptide library CPL19YS-2 was added to immobilized NS3-4A protease of the HCV genotype 1b. This library (supplemental Fig. S1) contains a cassette encoding for 33-aa-long peptides with 26 variable residues and a centered His-Cys dipeptide. Each variant is presented as a single copy (monovalent) on a phagemid particle carrying the gene variant that encodes it. Some five to six reiterative cycles led to enrichment of initial binding peptide clones. Two panning strategies with acidic or competitive elution led to enrichment of one dominant clone each: K5-66 for the first and K6-10 for the later strategy. Interestingly, both selected variants show a nine-amino acid N-terminal consensus sequence VY(V/L)L(D/G) (G/D)PGY, which is mainly hydrophobic, but interrupted by charged Asp-11 or Asp-12 residues in the case of K5-66 and K6-10, respectively (Table 1). The probability of this sequence homology occurring by chance (randomly) within the region responsible for higher affinity is <1 in 109. As described below, it also corresponds to the peptide region forming the most rigid interaction in the co-crystal with the NS3-4A protease. It is thus considered to be the dominant novel motif to have been discovered in this study. Peptides K5-66 and K6-10 showed NS3-4A inhibition with IC50 values of 21 and 26 nm, respectively. Truncation of K5-66 and K6-10 revealed that their N-terminal half (comprising the consensus sequence motif) is most important for inhibition (Table 1) and leads to a 6- or 9-fold reduced inhibition, respectively. Notably, neither of the C-terminal halves of these peptides inhibit NS3-4A alone, but increase inhibition by synergy with the amino-terminal sequences.TABLE 1Enriched peptides against MBP-NS3-4A protease and inhibitory effect of the peptides on NS3–4A activity Cosmix-plexing was applied (17Collins J. Horn N. Wadenbäck J. Szardenings M. Cosmix-plexing: a novel recombinatorial approach for evolutionary selection from combinatorial libraries.J. Biotechnol. 2001; 74: 317-338PubMed Google Scholar) to generate novel diversity of N- and C-terminal regions of pre-selected populations. Isolated phagemid DNA was cleaved (supplemental Fig. S1) and recombinants submitted to further affinity selection under more stringent panning conditions. A new candidate, CP5-46, was identified showing an 8-fold higher phage-ELISA signal than K5-66 (supplemental Fig. S2A), correlating with a 2-fold lower IC50 (11 nm; Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3). CP5-46 comprises the N-terminal part of K5-66 fused to a new C-terminal sequence. Cleavage of CP5-46 was examined with an excess of NS3-4A protease. After 16 h, neither a change of CP5-46 concentration nor any cleavage products were detectable in LC-MS (supplemental Table S1). With reference to the specificity of the inhibitors, we show that CP5-46 (≤50 μm) does not inhibit chymotrypsin, trypsin, or elastase (supplemental Fig. S2B). The binding mode of CP5-46 to NS3-4A was determined by the crystal structure of the inhibitor·enzyme complex. To this purpose, the activating NS4A peptide (aa 21 to 34) was fused N-terminally by a diglycine linker to the NS3 protease domain (residues 2–180) (28Dimasi N. Pasquo A. Martin F. Di Marco S. Steinkühler C. Cortese R. Sollazzo M. Engineering, characterization and phage display of hepatitis C virus NS3 protease and NS4A cofactor peptide as a single-chain protein.Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). High quality diffracting crystals were only obtained with the shorter CP5-46-A peptide, comprising the first 21 N-terminal aa of the full-length peptide (Table 1). Crystals diffracted to 2.05 Å and show P61 symmetry (supplemental Table S2). Clear electron density was observed for peptide residues 4–21 (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). CP5-46-A covers ∼800 Å2 of the protease surface. This represents some 9% of the total protease solvent-accessible surface (supplemental Table S6). The active site is totally occluded, and the uncleaved peptide (aa 4–20) is coordinated by 15 hydrogen bonds on the non-prime (S) and prime (S′) sites of NS3 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S6). Nearly fifty percent of the solvent-accessible area of CP5-46-A (1042 Å2) interacts with NS3 (supplemental Table S6), indicating tight binding, without influencing the alignment of catalytic triad residues (Fig. 1B). Several parameters seem to preclude the nucleophilic attack on the peptide backbone. The side chain of Leu-9 binds at the S1 pocket, but due to its isobutyl side chain, it sterically clashes with Phe-154 (supplemental Fig. S4C) resulting in a more remote positioning of the scissile bond. Similarly, the adjacent Leu-10, which binds to the subsite S1′, moves the peptide backbone away from the active site, although the S1′ pocket was shown to bind larger side chains than the natural P1′ serine (29Urbani A. Bianchi E. Narjes F. Tramontano A. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Pessi A. Substrate specificity of the hepatitis C virus serine protease NS3.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9204-9209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, Leu-10 causes dislocation of a nearby NS3-4A loop (Thr-38–Gln-41) (Fig. 2A). The bound peptide covers the entire active site in a lid-like fashion and holds the nearest peptide carbonyl carbons of Leu-9 or Leu-10 more than 3.5 Å away from the catalytic Ser-139 (Fig. 1B). This causes a stretched and hence unfavorable alignment for a nucleophilic attack. Interestingly, a water molecule fills the residual space (Fig. 1B). Additionally, a hydrogen bond links Leu-9 to the backbone amide of Gly-137 (supplemental Table S6), which is part of the oxyanion hole (6Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Lin C. Fox T. Dwyer M.D. Landro J.A. Chambers S.P. Markland W. Lepre C.A. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Rice C.M. Murcko M.A. Caron P.R. Thomson J.A. Crystal structure of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease domain complexed with a synthetic NS4A cofactor peptide.Cell. 1996; 87: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This presumably diminishes its charge redistribution function, reducing the stabilization of a tetrahedral intermediate and thereby further increasing the activation energy of the reaction. The N-terminal part of CP5-46-A, which binds to the non-prime (S) sites of the protease (Fig. 2B), forms an anti-parallel β-strand with the NS3 backbone (Fig. 1C). Notably, this arrangement is conserved among all peptide-based protease substrates (30Romano K.P. Ali A. Royer W.E. Schiffer C.A. Drug resistance against HCV NS3/4A inhibitors is defined by the balance of substrate recognition versus inhibitor binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20986-20991Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The inhibitor and the substrate backbone (Gly-4–Leu-6) bind likewise (Fig. 3A). Binding of CP5·46-A at the non-prime (S) sites of NS3 is similar to that reported with peptidomimetic compounds such as ITMN-191 or boceprevir (Fig. 3, B and C). The macrocyclic inhibitor ITMN-191 is spanning into the S3–S1′ subsites and has a large P2 substituent extending to the S2 subsite. The linear α-ketoamide inhibitor boceprevir binds to S4-S1 subsites of NS3-4A with similar backbone coordination. Notably, the peptide backbone of CP5-46-A is slightly shifted away from the catalytic triad, although functional groups bind to the same sites on the protease surface. The P1′ and P1 cyclopropyl group of ITMN-191 (Fig. 3B) and boceprevir, respectively (Fig. 3C), are similar to the isopropyl side chain of P1′ Leu-10 or P1 Leu-9: all are hydrophobic and similarly coordinated in the protease subsites. The P2 hydrophobic functional groups of peptidomimetic inhibitors overlap closely with the P2 residue Tyr-8 of CP5-46-A. Furthermore, their P4 tert-butyl group is akin to the isopropyl side chain of the P4 residue Leu-6 and is also located in the S4 pocket (Fig. 3, B and C). The C-terminal section of CP5-46-A is located at the protease prime (S′) site. Residues 13–17 fold back, creating a finger-like structure (aa sequence PGYDP). Interestingly, the central motif that binds to the bottom of the pocket (PGY) was also found in peptide K6-10 from the initial panning with competitive elution (Table 1). No similarly structured tyrosine finger with a PGY(D,Y)(P,A) pattern was found in the PDB using the PDBeMotif server. The sequences observed with a similar pattern do not show such an extended finger-like structure and sequester the tyrosine (supplemental Fig. S8). This tyrosine finger covers a pocket located next to the NS4A peptide and is mainly hydrogen-bonded with NS3 aa Ser-7, Ser-37, Arg-109, and several water molecules (Fig. 1D). The tyrosine finger is presumably responsible for the tight binding of IPs. This is supported by lower local atomic B-factors that match those of surrounding protease residues compared with the rest of the peptide (Fig. 2C). The tyrosine finger extends the binding of the IP at the S′ site of the protease to a region probably not probed by natural substrates. Additionally, His-19 of CP5-46-A forms an intramolecular salt bridge with Asp-11, further stabilizing the tyrosine finger and the IP. Based on the NS3-4A/CP5-46-A complex, a prognosis was made for several amino acid substitutions that might improve binding of IPs. Amino acids that may enhance binding to the S1′ and S4 subsites of the protease were replaced. Leu-10 at position P1′ was modified to Glu or Gln trying to facilitate hydrogen bond interactions with N3/4A residue Gln-51 and His-57 by occupying residual space in S1′. Additionally substitutions with Gln, Glu, or Asp of peptide residue Leu-6 at position P4 were generated. However, unfortunately none of those assayed peptides showed any inhibitory effect. We interpret this result as an indication that the original peptides are already highly accommodated and that alterations lead to disruption of steric geometry of the interaction (supplemental Table S3). Finally, alterations were considered for the constant N-terminal part of the peptide, i.e. that region which had not been subjected to randomization in the gene library, largely influenced by considerations similar to those undertaken in early work of others, based on homology to natural peptide su"
https://openalex.org/W1978668788,"Vigabatrin (VGB) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug designed to inhibit GABA-transaminase, effectively halting seizures. Unfortunately, VGB treatment is also associated with the highest frequencies of peripheral visual field constriction of any of the antiepileptic drugs and the mechanisms that lead to these visual field defects are uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated light exposure exacerbates vigabatrin-induced retinal toxicity. We further assessed this relationship by examining the effects of vigabatrin treatment on the retinal structures of mice with genetically altered photoreception. In keeping with previous studies, we detected increased toxicity in mice exposed to continuous light. To study whether cone or rod photoreceptor function was involved in the pathway to toxicity, we tested mice with mutations in the cone-specific Gnat2 or rod-specific Pde6g genes, and found the mutations significantly reduced VGB toxicity. Our results confirm light is a significant enhancer of vigabatrin toxicity and that a portion of this is mediated, directly or indirectly, by phototransduction signaling in rod and cone photoreceptors."

Virulence factors produced by invading pathogenic microbes play an important role in diseases caused by bacterial infections. These virulence factors aid in various infection processes, including quorum sensing, subverting the host immune response, and killing of host cells (1Miller M.B. Bassler B.L.

Comprising this catalytic core are separate motifs, contained within three distinct regions, which are conserved across all but one mART toxin subgroup (Fig. 1). mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase tobacco etch virus enhanced GFP Protein Data Bank. In this study, we characterize a new actin-targeting toxin as the protein product of the virulence gene (vahC), from A. hydrophila PPD134/91 (17Yu H.B. Zhang Y.L. Lau Y.L. Yao F. Vilches S. Merino S. Tomas J.M. Howard S.P. Leung K.Y. Identification and characterization of putative virulence genes and gene clusters in Aeromonas hydrophila PPD134/91.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The gene was originally annotated as vsdC for its resemblance to a Salmonella virulence gene but has been renamed to prevent confusion (18Fang F.C. Krause M. Roudier C. Fierer J. Guiney D.G. Growth regulation of a Salmonella plasmid gene essential for virulence.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6783-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we identified it with a bioinformatics strategy. The virulence factor, called VahC, is similar to the recently reported virulence factor VgrG1 from A. hydrophila ATCC7966 but lacks the N-terminal VgrG domain that mediates secretion through the Type VI secretion system (19Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. A type VI secretion system effector protein, VgrG1, from Aeromonas hydrophila that induces host cell toxicity by ADP ribosylation of actin.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). VahC, classified as a Type IV mART toxin, ADP-ribosylates actin at Arg-177 and targets all actin isoforms. Elucidation of the catalytic signature of VahC by Ala-scanning mutagenesis and a fluorescence-based kinetic assay (20Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Application of a fluorometric assay for characterization of the catalytic competency of a domain III fragment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was combined with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based cytotoxicity assay (21Turgeon Z. White D. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Merrill A.R. Yeast as a tool for characterizing mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 300: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have shown that this toxin disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells and induces caspase-mediated apoptosis. Structural insight from a 1.9 Å crystal structure reveals the nature of conserved residues among actin-targeting homologues. Uniquely, we have observed effective in vitro inhibition of VahC and similar Type IV mART toxins by novel inhibitors identified from a virtual screen method (22Turgeon Z. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Edwards P.R. Legree S. McGregor C. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Schapira M. Merrill A.R. Newly discovered and characterized antivirulence compounds inhibit bacterial mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ORF for vahC was cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of a modified pET-28a(+) vector (called pET-TEV) for expression of the vahC gene encoding a 5′ polyhistidine tag. Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) cells were transformed with the pET-TEV vector containing the vahC gene and grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Cells were incubated overnight at 15 °C after the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm. Cells were pelleted via centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in L buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl). Cells were lysed via passage twice through a French press and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were spiked to 5 mm imidazole and passed twice over a chelating Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, Canada) charged with ZnSO4. The column was washed with W buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole), and protein was eluted using E buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole) and S buffer (100 mm EDTA). Elution fractions were collected and pooled with S buffer fractions and dialyzed with 4 liters of L buffer for 24 h. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon Centriprep concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and quantified using a calculated extinction coefficient of 24,410 m−1 cm−1 at A280. Samples were assessed for purity via Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and purified as above. For crystallography, a truncated, active VahC construct, VahC-67T, lacking the first 67 N-terminal residues, was expressed and purified as described for the native protein. It was followed by the removal of the polyhistidine tag with TEV V8 protease. Subtractive nickel ion-Sepharose, and size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) was carried out to improve the purity of the VahC-67C protein. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 2 mm DTT. The VahC (4 μm) Trp emission spectra were obtained with excitation at 295 nm and the emission spectra collection from 305 to 450 nm (2.5-nm band pass for both) as described previously (23Jørgensen R. Wang Y. Visschedyk D. Merrill A.R. The nature and character of the transition state for the ADP-ribosyltransferase reaction.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). VahC-67C crystals were obtained by using hanging drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir solution consisting of 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT at room temperature with a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Needle-shaped crystals appeared within 24 h and grew to full size with dimensions of 0.7 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm in 4 days. Crystal cryoprotection was achieved by adding glycerol in the crystallization drop to a final concentration of 15% (v/v). Cryoprotected crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. The diffraction data were collected to 1.93 Å at the Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility (08ID-1) and processed in XDS (24Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11318) Google Scholar). Crystals were of the hexagonal space group, P6522, with three molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved with PHASER (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14528) Google Scholar) by molecular replacement using the related toxin SpvB (PDB entry 2GWL) as the search model. The structure was refined against 1.93 Å resolution data with PHENIX (26Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K.

Open table in a new tab β- and γ-actin were purified using a baculovirus expression system as described previously (29Yates S.P. Otley M.D. Dawson J.F. Overexpression of cardiac actin with baculovirus is promoter-dependent.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 466: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). FITC-ADP-ribose labeling detection was performed as described previously (30Visschedyk D.D. Perieteanu A.A. Turgeon Z.J. Fieldhouse R.J. Dawson J.F. Merrill A.R.

Chicken skeletal actin for kinetic assays was purified as described previously (31Spudich J.A. Watt S. The regulation of rabbit skeletal muscle contraction. I. Biochemical studies of the interaction of the tropomyosin-troponin complex with actin and the proteolytic fragments of myosin.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified using an extinction coefficient of 67,742 m−1 cm−1 at 290 nm. Activity assays were performed following a slightly modified protocol as described previously (30Visschedyk D.D. Perieteanu A.A. Turgeon Z.J. Fieldhouse R.J. Dawson J.F. Merrill A.R. Photox, a novel actin-targeting mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase from Photorhabdus luminescens.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13525-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, appropriate concentrations of VahC (62 nm) or VahC mutants (0.22–3.3 μm) were mixed with varying concentrations of ϵ-NAD+ or chicken skeletal actin (50 and 35 μm for saturating concentrations, respectively), and fluorescence emission was monitored in a stopped-flow spectrometer, model SX20-MV (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) as the reaction progressed at 25 °C (295-nm excitation, 395-nm emission cut-off filter). Inhibitor compounds were derived from a virtual screen method as described previously (22Turgeon Z. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Edwards P.R. Legree S. McGregor C. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Schapira M. Merrill A.R. Newly discovered and characterized antivirulence compounds inhibit bacterial mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays were conducted in a similar manner on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Mississauga, Canada), with reaction volumes of 70 μl. For the inhibition of VahC and SpvB, 120 μm ϵ-NAD+ and 38 μm actin were combined with 12.5 nm toxin (final concentration). For Photox, 250 μm ϵ-NAD+ and 24 μm actin were combined with 40 nm toxin. In each case, inhibition was determined by monitoring the relative decrease in activity with increasing inhibitor concentrations. Activity was measured via excitation at 305 nm and emission at 405 nm over 5 min at 25 °C. IC50 values were determined after fitting the data using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism. Ki values were calculated from these IC50 measurements using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (32Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 percent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12282) Google Scholar). NAD+ and inhibitor binding constants (KD) were experimentally determined as described previously (33Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. A fluorescence investigation of the active site of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15646-15654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with minor variations. In brief, increasing concentrations of NAD+ or inhibitor were titrated with 1 μm VahC, and Trp fluorescence quenching was monitored (295-nm excitation, 340-nm emission, 25 °C) using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. S. cerevisiae haploid strains W303 (MATa leu2 trp1 can1 ura3 ade2 his) and ACT-RA (MATa his3 leu2 ura3 tub2 act1::LEU2 (pJD301(HIS3) - ACT1 R177A)) were cultured at 30 °C on yeast-peptone-dextrose or synthetic dextrose minimal medium missing the appropriate amino acid. The vahC gene constructs were individually cloned into the modified yeast shuttle vector pRS415 and pRS416 containing the yeast CUP1 promoter (21Turgeon Z. White D. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Merrill A.R. Yeast as a tool for characterizing mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 300: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for expression in yeast. The ACT-RA strain was prepared as described previously (30Visschedyk D.D. Perieteanu A.A. Turgeon Z.J. Fieldhouse R.J. Dawson J.F. Merrill A.R. Photox, a novel actin-targeting mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase from Photorhabdus luminescens.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13525-13534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All yeast growth inhibition assays were performed as described previously (21Turgeon Z. White D. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Merrill A.R. Yeast as a tool for characterizing mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 300: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with slight modification. The vahC ORF was cloned into the MluI and NheI restriction sites of the pBI-EGFP vector. Briefly, the sequences of vahC and vahC E/E were PCR-amplified from the pET-TEV plasmid carrying the genes of interest using a set of primers containing the MluI (forward 5′-TCATACGCGTATGGAGTCCATGGCGCCGCTGG-3′) or NheI (reverse 5′-GGTCGCTAGCTCATAATACGGAAACCTCAATCAG-3′) restriction sites. The PCR products and the pBI-EGFP vector were digested with the corresponding enzymes and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids and selected for ampicillin resistance. Several colonies were tested by restriction enzyme digestion to confirm the ligation. The pBI-EGFP-vip-2 plasmid was prepared as described recently (19Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. A type VI secretion system effector protein, VgrG1, from Aeromonas hydrophila that induces host cell toxicity by ADP ribosylation of actin.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HeLa Tet-Off cells (Clontech) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% Tet approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech) under standard cell culture conditions at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Prior to electroporation, the cells were ∼70% confluent and were detached with a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) and washed twice with DMEM without serum. The cells were resuspended at a concentration of ∼5 × 106 cells/ml, and 600 μl of cells were electroporated with 5 μg of plasmid in a Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad) using 0.4-mm cuvettes and 250-V/950-microfarad/∞-ohm exponential protocol. The electroporated cells were recovered in a complete medium and grown in 6-well plates. The percentage of transfected cells was measured by examining expression of the gene encoding EGFP by flow cytometry (19Suarez G. Sierra J.C. Erova T.E. Sha J. Horneman A.J. Chopra A.K. A type VI secretion system effector protein, VgrG1, from Aeromonas hydrophila that induces host cell toxicity by ADP ribosylation of actin.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, HeLa Tet-Off cells expressing and producing various proteins were lysed in SDS-Tris-glycine buffer and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins from the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% skim milk, 1% BSA in TBS overnight. Specific mouse serum containing anti-VIP-2 antibodies (41Aktories K. Lang A.E. Schwan C. Mannherz H.G. Actin as target for modification by bacterial protein toxins.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 4526-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was used as the primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution for 2 h. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotech) at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Between steps, three washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS for 10 min were performed on the membranes. The blot was developed using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) followed by x-ray film exposure. HeLa cells expressing and producing various proteins were fixed in situ with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) for 20 min. Then the cells were scraped, washed with cytoperm wash buffer, and stained with Alexa Fluor-568 conjugated to phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed and kept in 2% paraformaldehyde. For phalloidin quantification, the suspension of cells was acquired in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) by gating on EGFP in order to exclude untransfected cells. For fluorescence microscopy, the cells in suspension were attached to a slide by cytospin at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and the coverslips were mounted with a solution that contained DAPI (Vector, Burlingame, CA). The image visualization was performed using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51/DPManager version 1.2.1.107/DP Controller version 1.2.1.108, Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.). After 24 h of transfection, cytoplasmic nucleosomes were detected by the cell death ELISA kit by following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, the supernatant from HeLa Tet-Off cells was removed, and the cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer for 20 min by continuous shaking. Cells in suspension were recovered by centrifugation and returned to the well to be lysed. After lysis, the solution was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for the ELISA. Antibodies to histone conjugated with biotin and anti-DNA conjugated with peroxidase were incubated with the 20 μl of supernatant in a streptavidin-coated plate for 2 h. The plate was washed with assay buffer three times, and the reaction was developed with 2,2″-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate. The absorbance was read at 405 nm in a VersaMax microplate reader. The colorimetric caspase-3 activity assay (Biovision Inc., Mountain View, CA) was performed as follows. 200 μg of protein (whole-cell lysate from HeLa Tet-Off cells expressing and producing different proteins), 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer, and 5 μl of peptide substrate (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-p-nitroanilide) were incubated at 37 °C between 2 and 24 h. The color reaction was measured every hour at a 405-nm wavelength in a VersaMax microplate reader. The ability of VahC to ADP-ribosylate actin isoforms was assessed using an FITC-NAD+ conjugate. Purified α-, β-, or γ-actin was incubated with VahC, and the fluorescently modified actin was visualized under UV light. VahC is capable of attaching ADP-ribose to all three major actin isoforms, indicating that it is a nonspecific actin-targeting toxin (Fig. 2A). To confirm that VahC transfers the ADP-ribose group to Arg-177 of actin, we employed a yeast-based growth inhibition assay. In this method, we control the expression of the vahC gene with the CUP1 (copper-inducible) promoter, and an active toxin will cause a growth defect phenotype in yeast (21Turgeon Z. White D. Jørgensen R. Visschedyk D. Fieldhouse R.J. Mangroo D. Merrill A.R. Yeast as a tool for characterizing mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 300: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression of the vahC gene in the W303 WT S. cerevisiae strain inhibited growth to 0.02% (Fig. 2B). However, when expressed in a mutant strain of yeast called ACT-RA, containing a plasmid-encoded actin gene with an R177A substitution, the viability of yeast cells expressing the vahC gene was largely restored (90.5% growth) (Fig. 2B). Wild-type VahC showed Michaelis-Menten mART activity with both NAD+ and actin as substrates (Km = 6 ± 0.4 and 24 ± 2 μm, respectively) with a kcat value of 22 s−1 (Table 1). To conclusively verify the mART catalytic signature of VahC, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the active site residues was performed. All catalytic mutant proteins were purified in the same manner as wild-type VahC. The folded integrity of each variant was assessed using Trp emission spectroscopy, and all mutants were similar to the wild-type fluorescence emission maximum value (332 nm). In vitro activity was monitored via a fluorescence-based kinetic assay (20Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Application of a fluorometric assay for characterization of the catalytic competency of a domain III fragment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the cell-based activity was assessed using a high throughput S. cerevisi"
https://openalex.org/W1981226477,"Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) is a hexadecameric (αβγδ)(4) complex that regulates glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle. Activity of the catalytic γ subunit is regulated by allosteric activators targeting the regulatory α, β, and δ subunits. Three-dimensional EM reconstructions of PhK show it to be two large (αβγδ)(2) lobes joined with D(2) symmetry through interconnecting bridges. The subunit composition of these bridges was unknown, although indirect evidence suggested the β subunits may be involved in their formation. We have used biochemical, biophysical, and computational approaches to not only address the quaternary structure of the β subunits within the PhK complex, i.e. whether they compose the bridges, but also their secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure of β was determined to be predominantly helical by comparing the CD spectrum of an αγδ subcomplex with that of the native (αβγδ)(4) complex. An atomic model displaying tertiary structure for the entire β subunit was constructed using chemical cross-linking, MS, threading, and ab initio approaches. Nearly all this model is covered by two templates corresponding to glycosyl hydrolase 15 family members and the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Regarding the quaternary structure of the β subunits, they were directly determined to compose the four interconnecting bridges in the (αβγδ)(4) kinase core, because a β(4) subcomplex was observed through both chemical cross-linking and top-down MS of PhK. The predicted model of the β subunit was docked within the bridges of a cryoelectron microscopic density envelope of PhK utilizing known surface features of the subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2016739922,"To evaluate the RARE (Réseau Action-Recherche sur l'Epilepsie) program, a model of managing and treating people with epilepsy (PWE) at a primary health-care level in rural areas of Mali, we assessed treatment efficacy and compliance of patients who underwent the first year follow-up.A network of rural general practitioners (GPs) settled in six rural districts of the regions of Koulikoro, Segou and Sikasso, was involved in the diagnosis, evaluation and monitoring of all the identified PWE and in the distribution of phenobarbital (PB). All the participants were included in a prospective database and followed-up by GPs at 4 months intervals during the first year. Seizure frequency, treatment doses and appearance of adverse events (AEs) were systematically recorded. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of reduction of seizures frequency while noncompliance in terms of time to study withdrawal for any cause.596 patients treated with PB were included in the analysis. Of these, 74.0% completed the first year follow-up. At the final visit, 59.6% were seizure-free: 31.0% for 12 months, 10.2% for 8 months and 18.4% for 4 months. Adults and patients with convulsive seizures were the most drug-resistant (p<0.002). Few AEs were recorded. The multivariate analysis showed that being a woman, presenting convulsive seizures, having more than 5 seizures/month and had never be treated were predictors of withdrawal (p ≤ 0.05) at 12 months.This study showed a good response and compliance to the treatment and allowed the identification of some factors associated with failure of management in a setting very near to clinical practice. Awareness campaigns are needed to assure a broader accessibility to treatment and to improve the compliance and continuity with treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W2022999014,"Mitochondrial function influences T cell dynamics and is affected by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation. We previously reported an association between African mtDNA haplogroup L2 and less robust CD4 cell recovery on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in non-Hispanic black ACTG 384 subjects. We explored whether additional T cell parameters in this cohort differed by mtDNA haplogroup.ACTG 384 randomized ART-naïve subjects to two different nucleoside regimens with efavirenz, nelfinavir, or both. CD4 and CD8 memory and activation markers were available at baseline and week 48 on most subjects. mtDNA sequencing was performed on whole blood DNA, and haplogroups were determined. We studied non-Hispanic black subjects with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL at week 48. Analyses included Wilcoxon ranksum test and linear regression.Data from 104 subjects were included. Major African mtDNA haplogroups included L1 (N=25), L2 (N=31), and L3 (N=32). Baseline age, HIV RNA, and CD4 cells did not differ between L2 and non-L2 haplogroups. Compared to non-L2 haplogroups, L2 subjects had lower baseline activated CD4 cells (median 12% vs. 17%; p=0.03) and tended toward lower activated CD8 cells (41% vs. 47%; p=0.06). At 48 weeks of ART, L2 subjects had smaller decreases in activated CD4 cells (-4% vs. -11%; p=0.01), and smaller CD4 cell increases (+95 vs. +178; p=0.002). In models adjusting for baseline age, CD4 cells, HIV RNA, and naïve-to-memory CD4 cell ratio, haplogroup L2 was associated with lower baseline (p=0.04) and 48-week change in (p=0.01) activated CD4 cells.Among ART-naïve non-Hispanic blacks, mtDNA haplogroup L2 was associated with baseline and 48-week change in T cell activation, and poorer CD4 cell recovery. These data suggest mtDNA variation may influence CD4 T cell dynamics by modulating T cell activation. Further study is needed to replicate these associations and identify mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2023086106,"Recently promising trials of innovative biomedical approaches to prevent HIV transmission have been reported. Participants' non-adherence to the prevention methods complicates the analyses and interpretation of trial results. The influence of variable sexual behaviors within and between participants of trials further obscures matters. Current methodological and statistical approaches in HIV-prevention studies, as well as ongoing debates on contradictory trial results, may fail to accurately address these topics.Through developing a cumulative probability model of infection within HIV prevention trials, we demonstrate how adherence and sexual behavior patterns impact the overall estimate of effectiveness, the effectiveness of prevention methods as a function of adherence, and conclusions about methods' true effectiveness. Applying the model to summary-level data from the CAPRISA trial, we observe markedly different values for the true method effectiveness of the microbicide, and show that if the gel would have been tested among women with slightly different sexual behavior patterns, conclusions might well have been that the gel is not effective.Relative risk and adherence analyses in HIV prevention trials overlook the complex interplay between adherence and sexual behavior patterns. Consequently, they may not provide accurate estimates of use- and method-effectiveness. Moreover, trial conclusions are contingent upon the predominant sexual behavior pattern of participants and cannot be directly generalized to other contexts. We recommend researchers to (re)examine their data and use the cumulative probability model to estimate the true method effectiveness, which might contribute to resolving current questions about contradictory trial results. Moreover, we suggest taking into account the issues raised in the design of future trials and in population models estimating the impact of large-scale dissemination of prevention methods. Comprehension of the topics described will help readers to better interpret (apparently contradictory) trial outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2045424928,"In a two stage genome-wide association study (2S-GWAS), a sample of cases and controls is allocated into two groups, and genetic markers are analyzed sequentially with respect to these groups. For such studies, experimental design considerations have primarily focused on minimizing study cost as a function of the allocation of cases and controls to stages, subject to a constraint on the power to detect an associated marker. However, most treatments of this problem implicitly restrict the set of feasible designs to only those that allocate the same proportions of cases and controls to each stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing this restriction can improve the cost advantages demonstrated by previous 2S-GWAS designs by up to 40%. Additionally, we consider designs that maximize study power with respect to a cost constraint, and show that recalculated power maximizing designs can recover a substantial amount of the planned study power that might otherwise be lost if study funding is reduced. We provide open source software for calculating cost minimizing or power maximizing 2S-GWAS designs."
https://openalex.org/W2105841071,"We previously identified Caliban (Clbn) as the Drosophila homolog of human Serologically defined colon cancer antigen 1 gene and demonstrated that it could function as a tumor suppressor in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, although its mode of action was unknown. Herein, we identify roles for Clbn in DNA damage response. We generate clbn knockout flies using homologous recombination and demonstrate that they have a heightened sensitivity to irradiation. We show that normal Clbn function facilitates both p53-dependent and -independent DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Clbn coordinates different apoptosis pathways, showing a two-stage upregulation following DNA damage. Clbn has proapoptotic functions, working with both caspase and the proapoptotic gene Hid. Finally, ecotopic expression of clbn+ in NSCLC cells suppresses tumor formation in athymic nude mice. We conclude that Caliban is a regulator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis, functioning as a tumor suppressor in both p53-dependent and -independent pathways."
