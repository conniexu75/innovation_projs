https://openalex.org/W1983194657,"This is an issue edsumm for ng1933. Identification of the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum in a marine sedimentary sequence. It shows that sea surface temperatures near the North Pole increased from roughly 18 degrees Celsius to over 23 degrees Celsius — such warm values imply the absence of ice and thus exclude the influence of ice-albedo feedbacks on this Arctic warming. SHANK3 (also known as ProSAP2) regulates the structural organization of dendritic spines and is a binding partner of neuroligins; genes encoding neuroligins are mutated in autism and Asperger syndrome. Here, we report that a mutation of a single copy of SHANK3 on chromosome 22q13 can result in language and/or social communication disorders. These mutations concern only a small number of individuals, but they shed light on one gene dosage–sensitive synaptic pathway that is involved in autism spectrum disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2015977579,"We tested whether the dominant intestinal sugar transporter GLUT2 was inhibited by intestinal luminal compounds that are inefficiently absorbed and naturally present in foods. Because of their abundance in fruits and vegetables, flavonoids were selected as model compounds. Robust inhibition of glucose and fructose transport by GLUT2 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes was produced by the flavonols myricetin, fisetin, the widely consumed flavonoid quercetin, and its glucoside precursor isoquercitrin [corrected]. IC50s for quercetin, myricetin, and isoquercitirin [corrected]were approximately 200- to 1000-fold less than glucose or fructose concentrations, and noncompetitive inhibition was observed. The two other major intestinal sugar transporters, GLUT5 and SGLT1, were unaffected by flavonoids. Sugar transport by GLUT2 overexpressed in pituitary cells and naturally present in Caco-2E intestinal cells was similarly inhibited by quercetin. GLUT2 was detected on the apical side of Caco-2E cells, indicating that GLUT2 was in the correct orientation to be inhibited by luminal compounds. Quercetin itself was not transported by the three major intestinal glucose transporters. Because the flavonoid quercetin, a food component with an excellent pharmacology safety profile, might act as a potent luminal inhibitor of sugar absorption independent of its own transport, flavonols show promise as new pharmacologic agents in the obesity epidemic."

https://openalex.org/W2042029726,"In type 1 diabetes, T cell-mediated death of pancreatic β cells produces insulin deficiency. However, what attracts or restricts broadly autoreactive lymphocyte pools to the pancreas remains unclear. We report that TRPV1+ pancreatic sensory neurons control islet inflammation and insulin resistance. Eliminating these neurons in diabetes-prone NOD mice prevents insulitis and diabetes, despite systemic persistence of pathogenic T cell pools. Insulin resistance and β cell stress of prediabetic NOD mice are prevented when TRPV1+ neurons are eliminated. TRPV1NOD, localized to the Idd4.1 diabetes-risk locus, is a hypofunctional mutant, mediating depressed neurogenic inflammation. Delivering the neuropeptide substance P by intra-arterial injection into the NOD pancreas reverses abnormal insulin resistance, insulitis, and diabetes for weeks. Concordantly, insulin sensitivity is enhanced in trpv1−/− mice, whereas insulitis/diabetes-resistant NODxB6Idd4-congenic mice, carrying wild-type TRPV1, show restored TRPV1 function and insulin sensitivity. Our data uncover a fundamental role for insulin-responsive TRPV1+ sensory neurons in β cell function and diabetes pathoetiology."

https://openalex.org/W1988960910,"The function of the subnuclear structure the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) body is unclear largely because of the functional heterogeneity of its constituents. Here, we provide the evidence for a direct link between PML, higher-order chromatin organization and gene regulation. We show that PML physically and functionally interacts with the matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding protein, special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) to organize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I locus into distinct higher-order chromatin-loop structures. Interferon γ (IFNγ) treatment and silencing of either SATB1 or PML dynamically alter chromatin architecture, thus affecting the expression profile of a subset of MHC class I genes. Our studies identify PML and SATB1 as a regulatory complex that governs transcription by orchestrating dynamic chromatin-loop architecture."

https://openalex.org/W2162262302,"Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes facilitates their accurate segregation at the first division of meiosis. Current models for crossing-over invoke an intermediate in which homologs are connected by two crossed-strand structures called Holliday junctions. Such double Holliday junctions are a prominent intermediate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis, where they form preferentially between homologs rather than between sister chromatids. In sharp contrast, we find that single Holliday junctions are the predominant intermediate in Schizosaccharomyces pombe meiosis. Furthermore, these single Holliday junctions arise preferentially between sister chromatids rather than between homologs. We show that Mus81 is required for Holliday junction resolution, providing further in vivo evidence that the structure-specific endonuclease Mus81-Eme1 is a Holliday junction resolvase. To reconcile these observations, we present a unifying recombination model applicable for both meiosis and mitosis in which single Holliday junctions arise from single- or double-strand breaks, lesions postulated by previous models to initiate recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2082734948,"Broadening antibody specificity without compromising affinity should facilitate detection and neutralization of toxin and viral subtypes. We used yeast display and a co-selection strategy to increase cross-reactivity of a single chain (sc) Fv antibody to botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A). Starting with a scFv that binds the BoNT/A1 subtype with high affinity (136 pM) and the BoNT/A2 subtype with low affinity (109 nM), we increased its affinity for BoNT/A2 1,250-fold, to 87 pM, while maintaining high-affinity binding to BoNT/A1 (115 pM). To find the molecular basis for improved cross-reactivity, we determined the X-ray co-crystal structures of wild-type and cross-reactive antibodies complexed to BoNT/A1 at resolutions up to 2.6 A, and measured the thermodynamic contribution of BoNT/A1 and A2 amino acids to wild-type and cross-reactive antibody binding. The results show how an antibody can be engineered to bind two different antigens despite structural differences in the antigen-antibody interface and may provide a general strategy for tuning antibody specificity and cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2002348069,"A major obstacle to 3-dimensional tissue engineering is incorporation of a functional vascular supply to support the expanding new tissue. This is overcome in an in vivo intrinsic vascularization model where an arteriovenous loop (AVL) is placed in a noncollapsible space protected by a polycarbonate chamber. Vascular development and hypoxia were examined from 3 days to 112 days by vascular casting, morphometric, and morphological techniques to understand the model's vascular growth and remodeling parameters for tissue engineering purposes. At 3 days a fibrin exudate surrounded the AVL, providing a scaffold to migrating inflammatory, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells. Capillaries formed between 3 and 7 days. Hypoxia and cell proliferation were maximal at 7 days, followed by a peak in percent vascular volume at 10 days (23.20+/-3.14% compared with 3.59+/-2.68% at 3 days, P<0.001). Maximal apoptosis was observed at 112 days. The protected space and spontaneous microcirculatory development in this model suggest it would be applicable for in vivo tissue engineering. A temporal window in a period of intense angiogenesis at 7 to 10 days is optimal for exogenous cell seeding and survival in the chamber, potentially enabling specific tissue outcomes to be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2072042546,"Analyses of malignant melanomas revealed a strong expression of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and their autocrine effect in promoting cell invasion and migration. Here, we report a paracrine effect of BMPs on the vascular network. Both BMP2 and BMP4 induced tube formation as well as the migratory efficiency of microvascular endothelial cells. Melanoma cells with reduced BMP activity attracted less endothelial cells in invasion assays than control cells. Furthermore, reduction of BMPs in melanoma cells had a strong effect on vasculogenic mimicry. Tube formation on matrigel was analysed for melanoma cells as well as in co-cultures of endothelial and melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with reduced BMP activity were not capable of forming cord-like structures by themselves and additionally inhibited tube formation of the endothelial cells. Genes involved in angiogenesis turned out to be strongly downregulated in these cell clones. Tumors derived from cells with impaired BMP activity showed reduced tumor growth or large necrotic areas owing to lack of angiogenesis in in vivo analyses."

https://openalex.org/W2143522907,"Proper connections between centromeres and spindle microtubules are of critical importance in ensuring accurate segregation of the genome during cell division. Using an in vitro approach based on the sequence-specific budding yeast centromere, we identified a complex of the chromosomal passenger proteins Bir1 and Sli15 (Survivin and INCENP) that links centromeres to microtubules. This linkage does not require Ipl1/Aurora B kinase, whose targeting and activation are controlled by Bir1 and Sli15. Ipl1 is the tension-dependent regulator of centromere-microtubule interactions that ensures chromosome biorientation on the spindle. Elimination of the linkage between centromeres and microtubules mediated by Bir1-Sli15 phenocopies mutations that selectively cripple Ipl1 kinase activation. These findings lead us to propose that the Bir1-Sli15-mediated linkage, which bridges centromeres and microtubules and includes the Aurora kinase-activating domain of INCENP family proteins, is the tension sensor that relays the mechanical state of centromere-microtubule attachments into local control of Ipl1 kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2162676753,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a potent lipid mediator that evokes a variety of biological responses in many cell types via its specific G protein-coupled receptors. In particular, LPA affects cell morphology, cell survival, and cell cycle progression in neuronal cells. Recently, we identified p2y9/GPR23 as a novel fourth LPA receptor, LPA4 (Noguchi, K., Ishii, S., and Shimizu, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 25600-25606). To assess the functions of LPA4 in neuronal cells, we used rat neuroblastoma B103 cells that lack endogenous responses to LPA. In B103 cells stably expressing LPA4, we observed Gq/11-dependent calcium mobilization, but LPA did not affect adenylyl cyclase activity. In LPA4 transfectants, LPA induced dramatic morphological changes, i.e. neurite retraction, cell aggregation, and cadherin-dependent cell adhesion, which involved Rho-mediated signaling pathways. Thus, our results demonstrated that LPA4 as well as LPA1 couple to Gq/11 and G12/13, whereas LPA4 differs from LPA1 in that it does not couple to Gi/o. Through neurite retraction and cell aggregation, LPA4 may play a role in neuronal development such as neurogenesis and neuronal migration.

Giepmans B.N. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). LPA plays important roles in many biological processes, such as brain development, oncogenesis, wound healing, and immune functions (2Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The effects of LPA on target cells are mediated by activation of its specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The LPA1 (3Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), LPA2 (4An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol.

Pharmacological studies suggest that both LPA1 and LPA2 couple to at least three types of G proteins, Gi/o, Gq, and G12/13, whereas LPA3 couples to Gi/o and Gq but not G12/13 (6Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Depending on the functional coupling of a given LPA receptor to G proteins, LPA activates diverse signaling cascades involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Rho family GTPase, and adenylyl cyclase (2Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). LPA is present in the brain at relatively high levels compared with other organs (8Das A.K. Hajra A.K. Lipids. 1989; 24: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). LPA influences the cell morphology of several neuronal cell lines, neural progenitors, and primary neurons (10Ye X. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Chun J. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2169-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that LPA affects electrophysiology, cell survival, and cell cycle progression in neuronal cells (10Ye X. Fukushima N. Kingsbury M.A. Chun J.

Targeted deletion of LPA1 in mice produces olfactory deficits (12Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and a behavioral abnormality (13Harrison S.M. Reavill C. Brown G. Brown J.T. Cluderay J.E. Crook B. Davies C.H. Dawson L.A.

Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use of LPA1 knockouts revealed that LPA1 is involved in the initiation of neuropathic pain (14Inoue M. Rashid M.H. Fujita R. Contos J.J. Chun J. Ueda H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Exposure of the developing cerebral cortex to LPA produces dramatic changes in the folding of the brain, which do not occur in LPA1 and LPA2 double knockouts (15Kingsbury M.A. Rehen S.K. Contos J.J. Higgins C.M. Chun J. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the LPA receptor subtypes responsible for some neuronal effects have not been identified (16Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Contos J.J. Rehen S.K. Kingsbury M.A. Kim K.Y. Chun J. Mol.

Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified p2y9/GPR23 as a fourth LPA receptor (LPA4) that is structurally distinct from the three LPA receptors of the EDG family (19Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The expressed sequence tag cDNA encoding LPA4 was originally isolated from human brain (20Janssens R. Boeynaems J.M. Godart M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21O'Dowd B.F. Nguyen T. Jung B.P. Marchese A. Cheng R. Heng H.H. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lynch K.R. George S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and LPA4 expression has been detected in rat embryonic hippocampal neurons (22Fujiwara Y. Sebok A. Meakin S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells (18Jin Rhee H. Nam J.S. Sun Y. Kim M.J. Choi H.K. Han D.H. Kim N.H. Huh S.O. Neuroreport. 2006; 17: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that LPA4 may have important roles in neurodevelopmental processes such as neurogenesis and neuronal migration. However, only very limited information is available regarding its physiological and biological functions. To assess the functional roles of LPA4 in neuronal cells, we generated B103 cells stably expressing LPA4. This study demonstrates that treatment of the LPA4-expressing cells with LPA leads to morphological changes, including cell rounding and cadherin-dependent cell adhesion following cell aggregation, both of which are mediated by the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway. The effects of LPA4 on the morphology of the neuronal cells were clearly distinct from those of LPA1, probably because LPA4 does not couple to Gi/o. Cell Culture—B103 rat neuroblastoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. J. Chun (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). B103 cells expressing each of the LPA receptors were maintained on poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Wako, Osaka, Japan). For some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA; from a 400 μg/ml stock in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2 m urea stored at 4 °C) for 12 h, 5 μm YM-254890 (a novel Gq/11 inhibitor (23Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T. Moritani Y. Hayashi K. Kobori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47438-47445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. J. Takasaki, Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan; from a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) stored at -30 °C) for 10 min, or 5 μm Y-27632 (Calbiochem; froma5mm stock in water stored at -30 °C) for 10 min. Pretreatment with vehicles of PTX and YM-254890 was used as a control. Stable Expression of LPA1 and LPA4—A DNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of LPA1 (NCBI accession number NM_001401) was first amplified from a cDNA prepared from human brain poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotides (sense primer, 5′-AAGAAAATTTGTCTCCCGTAGCTCT-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-CATGAGTTGACTTTTCTCCTCTCTC-3′). The entire open reading frame of LPA1 with an additional sequence encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the 5′-end was subsequently amplified from the resultant PCR products using KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and oligonucleotides (sense primer containing the KpnI and HA tag sequences, 5′-GGGGTACCGCCATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGCTGCCATCTCTACTTCC-3′ and antisense primer containing the SpeI sequence, 5′-GGACTAGTCTAAACCACAGAGTGGTCATT-3′). The resultant DNA fragment was digested with KpnI and SpeI and subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCXN2.1, a slightly modified version of pCXN2 (24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) with multiple cloning sites, between the KpnI and SpeI sites. HA-tagged human LPA4 cDNA was constructed and cloned into pCXN2.1 as described previously (19Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). B103 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the transient expression of the HA epitope on the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (EPICS XL, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with the 3F10 rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-rat IgG (Beckman Coulter) as the secondary antibody. Stable transfectants were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 for 26 days. After staining the drug-resistant cells as described above, a group of HA-positive cells was sorted by flow cytometry (EPICS ALTRA, Beckman Coulter) and maintained with 0.3 mg/ml G418. Three weeks later, a second round of sorting was performed; the twice-immunopurified cells were used for experiments (termed B103-LPA1 and B103-LPA4 cells). Binding Assay—Binding assay was done essentially as described previously (19Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells (4 × 106) were seeded in collagen-coated 100-mm plates (Iwaki), followed by 24 h of serum starvation. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and scraped off. After further washing with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 m sucrose), the cells were suspended in the buffer with additional protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science), sonicated three times at 15 watts for 30 s, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and resultant pellet was homogenized in ice-cold binding buffer. Binding assays were performed in 96-well plates in triplicate. 20 μg each of the membrane fractions from the twice-immunopurified cells was incubated in binding buffer containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fatty acid-free, very low endotoxin grade; Serologicals Proteins, Kankakee, IL) with 2-fold serial dilutions (50-3.125 nm) of [3H]LPA (1-oleoyl[oleoyl-9, 10-3H]LPA, 57 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min at 4 °C. The bound [3H]LPA was collected onto a Unifilter-96-GF/C (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a MicroMate 196 harvester (Packard Instrument Co.). The filter was then rinsed 10 times with ice-cold binding buffer and dried for 12 h at 50 °C. 25 μl of MicroScint-0 scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added per well. The radioactivity that remained on the filter was measured with TopCount microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Total and nonspecific bindings were evaluated in the absence and presence of 10 μm unlabeled LPA [1-oleoyl (18:1)-LPA; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), respectively. The specific binding value (disintegrations/min) was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding value (disintegrations/min) from the total binding value (disintegrations/min). A dissociation constant (Kd) and a maximum binding capacity (Bmax) were calculated by Scatchard analysis. Bmax and Kd values for B103-LPA1 cells were 0.8 pmol/mg protein and 18 nm, respectively. Those for B103-LPA4 cells were 6.0 pmol/mg protein and 58 nm. No specific binding was observed in vector-transfected B103 cells (B103-vector cells). cAMP Measurement—Cells (3.2 × 104) were seeded in collagen-coated 96-well plates (Iwaki), followed by 24 h of serum starvation. To determine whether LPA receptors mediate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, an AlphaScreen cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used as recommended in the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were washed twice with buffer A (Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 0.1% BSA (Serologicals Proteins)) and incubated in 100 μl of buffer A containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)) (from a 20 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide stored at -30 °C) (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 μl of various concentrations of LPA in buffer A with 50 μm forskolin (Wako; from a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide stored at -30 °C). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 16.6 μl of 10% Tween 20, followed by overnight storage at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, the cAMP concentration in the supernatant was measured in quadruplicate with a fusion system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine whether LPA receptors mediate the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, the cAMP Biotrak EIA system (Amersham Biosciences) was used as recommended in the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were washed twice with HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, and 5.6 mm d-glucose) containing 0.1% BSA (HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer) and incubated in 100 μl of HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer containing 0.5 mm IBMX for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of various concentrations of LPA in HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of lysis buffer. Cell lysates in a volume of 100 μl were used to determine the cAMP concentration using an enzyme immunoassay method. Ca2+ Measurement—Cells serum-starved for 24 h were detached with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, washed with HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer, and then loaded with 3 μm Fura-2 AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension (0.5 ml) was applied to a CAF-100 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), and 5 μ l of 100 μm LPA in HEPES-Tyrode’s BSA buffer was added. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured as the ratio of emission fluorescence at 500 nm in response to excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Cell Rounding Assay—Cells (1 × 104) were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates (BD Biosciences). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and serum-starved for 24 h. Three hours after a medium change, the cells were treated with 1 μm LPA for 15 min. The cells were examined for a round cell morphology lacking any neurite extensions or filopodia. Extended neurites were defined as having a length greater than the cell body. The number of rounded cells was expressed as a percentage of the observed cells (>200 cells/well). Rho Inhibition Study—Cells (5 × 105) were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes (Iwaki) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, either the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme expression vector (pEF-C3) (25Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18943-18949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. S. Narumiya, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) or the corresponding control vector (pEF-BOS) (26Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. S. Nagata, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) was cotransfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector (pEGFP-C1; Clontech) at a 4:1 weight ratio, with 3 μg of total DNA, using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 12 h and treated with 1 μm LPA for 15 min. Following fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, EGFP images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Diaphoto, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). EGFP-positive cells were examined for a round morphology without any neurite extensions or filopodia. At least 20 different fields were observed with a minimum of 100 EGFP-positive cells. The number of rounded cells was expressed as a percentage of the EGFP-positive cells. Quantification of Cell Clustering—The degree of cell clustering was quantified by observing the distribution of the cell nuclei. Cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and serum-starved for 24 h. Three hours after a medium change, the cells were treated with 1 μm LPA for 3 h, followed by fixation and staining with a Diff-Quik kit (Kokusai Shiyaku, Kobe, Japan). The distribution of the cells was mapped in rectangular areas (1710 × 1290 μm) by photographing the cultures (Cool Pix 990, Nikon). Each map was overlaid with grids at equal intervals (30 μm) and divided into 2451 unit squares. The randomness in spatial distribution was tested by counting the number of unit squares containing at least one nucleus. The intensity of the cell clustering was expressed as the percentage of the unit squares without any nuclei. Cell Dissociation Assay—The Ca2+ sensitivity of cell-cell adhesion was estimated using trypsin treatment in the presence of either CaCl2 (TC treatment) or EDTA (TE treatment) as described (27Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A. Itoh N. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Fujisawa H. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26044-26050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes (BD Biosciences) and cultured overnight. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with 1 μm LPA for 2 h and washed with HBSS containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA. The washed cells were treated with 0.01% trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C and then dissociated by pipetting 10 times gently in 1 ml of HBSS with 0.01% trypsin. The number of cell clusters was counted with a particle counter (Beckman Coulter). The degree of cell-cell adhesion was expressed as the ratio of particles in the TC condition to particles in the TE condition (TC/TE). Negative control experiments without LPA treatment were also performed. Western Blotting—Cells (4 × 106) were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm dishes. Following 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with 1 μm LPA for 3 h, washed twice with PBS, and harvested in buffer B (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 m sucrose). The cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, suspended in ice-cold buffer B containing 20 μm 4-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science), and sonicated three times for 30 s each at 4 °C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the homogenate was determined with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Five micrograms of protein sample containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk (Difco) and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against N-cadherin or E-cadherin (BD Biosciences). The bands were visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells (3 × 105) were seeded into poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottomed 35-mm dishes (Matsunami, Tokyo, Japan) and serum-starved for 24 h. Following stimulation with 1 μm LPA for 3 h at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C and rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against N-cadherin in PBS containing 1/4× permeabilization reagent (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody staining was visualized with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using an LSM510 laserscanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon laser as the light source. Statistical Analysis—All values in the figures are expressed as means ± S.E. To determine statistical significance, the values were compared by analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer test using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The differences were considered significant if p values were less than 0.05. Stable Expression of LPA1 and LPA4 in B103 Cells Results in Different Morphologies in Serum-containing Medium—To address the functional roles of LPA4 in neuronal cells, B103 rat neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected with the expression vector for either LPA1 or LPA4. B103 cells were selected because they lack endogenous responses to LPA (29Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 30Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Consistently, no specific binding was observed in B103-vector cells in the radioligand binding assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine the intrinsic gene expression profiles of LPA receptors in B103 cells, we performed a reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total cellular RNA from the cells. Although LPA4 mRNA expression was slightly detected, no mRNA expression of the other three receptors, LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3, was observed (data not shown). This finding is consistent with a recent report by Tsukahara et al. (31Tsukahara T. Tsukahara R. Yasuda S. Makarova N. Valentine W.J. Allison P. Yuan H. Baker D.L. Li Z. Bittman R. Parrill A. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3398-3407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between the expression of LPA4 and the lack of response to LPA might occur because the expression of LPA4 is too low to respond to LPA. Alternatively, post-transcriptional/translational modifications (32Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) may produce discordance between mRNA and protein expression. Thus, we discounted the low expression of LPA4 in B103 cells and took advantage of their unresponsiveness to LPA and their neuronal nature for the purpose of examining the functional roles of LPA4 in neuronal cells. For the construction of stably transfected cell lines, LPA1 and LPA4 were tagged with an HA epitope at the N terminus to enable us to determine the levels of expression on the cell surfaces. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting enriched a polyclonal population of the drug-resistant cells that expressed each LPA receptor. These populations of stable clones are free of any clonal deviation that could cause functional variations. Following two rounds of cell sorting, we observed that the fluorescence intensity of B103-LPA1 cells was higher than that of B103-LPA4 cells (Fig. 1A), although the Bmax value for B103-LPA1 cells (0.8 pmol/mg of protein) was lower than that for B103-LPA4 cells (6.0 pmol/mg of protein). The apparent discrepancy might be because of two possibilities as follows: the usage of organellar membranerich microsome fractions and the difference in HA antibody immunoreactivity to the HA epitope tagged to two receptors. To confirm that no expression of the other subtypes of LPA receptors was enhanced secondary to the transfection, reverse transcription-PCR was performed with specific primers for LPA1, LPA2, LPA3, and LPA4 in B103-vector, B103-LPA1, and B103-LPA4 cells. As in the parental B103 cells, we observed only a low expression of LPA4 and virtually no expression of the other LPA receptors in all of the transfected cell lines (data not shown). Although these stably transfected cell lines showed similar growth rates (data not shown), they showed distinctly different morphologies in serum-containing medium (Fig. 1B). As reported previously (33van Leeuwen F.N. Olivo C. Grivell S. Giepmans B.N. Collard J.G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 400-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), B103-LPA1 cells displayed a flattened and more migratory morphology compared with B103-vector cells. Interestingly, B103-LPA4 cells had an epithelial like morphology and appeared to adhere more tightly to each other than B103-vector cells. These observations suggest that LPA1 and LPA4 have distinct signaling pathways that produce different cell morphologies. LPA4 Does Not Affect Adenylyl Cyclase Activity in B103 Cells—We examined whether LPA4 mediates the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in B103 cells, as the other three LPA receptors do (30Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). In B103-LPA1 cells, LPA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity with IC50 values below 10 nm (Fig. 2A). This inhibition was completely blocked by PTX treatment, indicating the primary role of Gi/o proteins. However, LPA at concentrations up to 10 μm did not blunt the forskolin-driven rises in cAMP accumulation in either B103-vector or B103-LPA4 cells, suggesting that LPA4 does not couple to Gi/o proteins. Previously, we reported that LPA induces cAMP accumulation in LPA4-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (19Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, LPA did not elevate basal cAMP levels in either B103-LPA4 cells or B103-LPA1 cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that neither LPA1 nor LPA4 couples to Gs in B103 cells.

Surprisingly, we observed that NNRTIs potently inhibited plus-strand initiation in vitro under conditions in which little or no inhibition of minus-strand DNA synthesis was observed. In assays that recapitulated the initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis, greater inhibition was observed with an RNA PPT primer than with a DNA primer of corresponding sequence and with wild-type reverse transcriptase but not with NNRTI-resistant enzymes.

The data presented here suggest that specific inhibition of plus-strand initiation may be an important mechanism by which NNRTIs block HIV-1 replication. Reverse transcription is a highly choreographed, multistep process in which the plus-strand RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; PPT, polypurine tract; NNRTI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; AZTTP, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate; nt, nucleotide(s). is converted into a double-stranded cDNA (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1997: 121-160Google Scholar, 2Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription is catalyzed by the multifunctional, virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT), which carries out both RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerase activities and also contains a ribonuclease H activity (3Goff S.P. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1990; 3: 817-831Google Scholar). RNA-templated minus-strand synthesis initiates at a primer binding site immediately downstream of the left long terminal repeat using a tRNA primer and continues until RT reaches the 5′-end of the RNA genome. RNase H acts both concurrently and subsequently to degrade the RNA template and allow the DNA to anneal to a complementary sequence (right long terminal repeat) located at the 3′-end of the genome in a process called minus-strand transfer. Following minus-strand transfer, minus-strand synthesis is completed. In contrast to the initiation of minus-strand synthesis in which a single exogenous primer is used, plus-strand synthesis initiates from polypurine-rich RNA primers (polypurine tracts or PPTs) derived from the viral genome by the RNase H activity during and after minus-strand synthesis. The site of plus-strand initiation from the 3′-PPT primer ultimately defines the left end of the double-stranded viral DNA. The resulting sequence is required for integration by the viral integrase, and thus failure to generate these correct ends can result in products that cannot be integrated into the host genome. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are potent and highly specific inhibitors of HIV-1 RT that are widely used in the clinic for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite considerable structural diversity within this class of inhibitors, all NNRTIs bind to RT at a hydrophobic pocket ∼10 Aå from the polymerase active site in the palm subdomain of p66 (4Ding J. Das K. Tantillo C. Zhang W. Clark A.D. Jessen S. Lu X. Hsiou Y. Jacobo-Molina A. Andries K. Pauwels R. Moereels H. Koymans L. Janssen P.A.J. Smith R.H. Koepke M.K. Michejda C.J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Rather, they allosterically inhibit RT by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme that significantly reduces the rate of nucleotide transfer (7Esnouf R. Ren J.S. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 8Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting polymerase activity of RT, NNRTIs allosterically affect both the rate and pattern of RNase H cleavage in vitro (9Gopalakrishnan V. Benkovic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4110-4115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In HIV-1 viral replication assays, initiation of RNA-primed minus-strand synthesis is only slightly inhibited by NNRTIs at concentrations that greatly exceed those necessary for complete suppression of viral replication (12Quan Y.D. Rong L.W. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cell-based replication assays as well as in biochemical assays, the ability of NNRTIs to inhibit polymerization of full-length products has been shown to correlate with the length of the template (12Quan Y.D. Rong L.W. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Quan Y.D. Liang C. Inouye P. Wainberg M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5692-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of shorter replication products is not as effectively inhibited by NNRTIs as is the generation of longer products. These results have suggested that the NNRTIs act in a stochastic manner with longer templates providing more opportunities for the inhibitors to act. In this report we demonstrate that NNRTIs potently and specifically inhibit plus-strand initiation in vitro under conditions in which little or no inhibition of minus-strand DNA synthesis is observed, and we identify the structural features of the plus-strand initiation substrate that contribute to NNRTI sensitivity. Based on the observations reported here, we propose a model for the action of NNRTIs on the initiation of plus-strand viral DNA synthesis. Reagents—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies unless otherwise noted. Wild-type HIV-1 NL4.3 RT and mutant enzymes were purified as described previously (11Shaw-Reid C.A. Feuston B. Munshi V. Getty K. Krueger J. Hazuda D.J. Parniak M.A. Miller M.D. Lewis D.

RT Polymerase Assays—For all assays, HIV-1 RT (10 nm) was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with inhibitor in an assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.2% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25 μm each dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 1 μm [32P]dATP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the primer-template substrate to a final concentration of 5 nm and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The coupled assay for minus- and plus-strand synthesis utilized an RNA template comprising the HIV-1 HXB2 sequence encompassing the 3′-PPT annealed to a DNA primer (5′-ATCTTGTCTTCGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGC-3′) at its 3′-end. All other assays used as template a PAGE-purified 80-nt synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-ATCTTGTCTTCGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTCTTTTAAAAGTGGCTAAGATCTACAGCTGCCC-3′) to which was annealed either the full-length RNA complement generated by in vitro transcription, an RNA PPT primer (5′-rUrUrArArArArGrArArArArGrGrG-rGrGrG-3′), or a DNA PPT primer (5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGG-3′). For gel-based assays, reactions were quenched by the addition gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm EDTA) and heating to 70 °C for 10 min. Products were resolved by electrophoresis using 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Results were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments a homogeneous scintillation proximity assay (SPA, Amersham Biosciences) was used to characterize the effects of NNRTIs on plus-strand initiation. For this assay format, a 5′-biotinylated 80-nt DNA template of the same sequence of that described above annealed to the various PPT primers was utilized, and [3H]dATP was used as the radiolabel instead of [32P]dATP. Assay buffer was otherwise identical to that used for the gel-based assay. For the homogeneous assay format, reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. The elimination of the preincubation step in the homogeneous assay format resulted in approximately a doubling of the apparent IC50 compared with those observed with the gel-based assay. Reactions were quenched by addition of scintillant-impregnated streptavidin-coated polyvinyltoluene beads in a quench solution containing 100 mm EDTA. Plates were allowed to rest for 8 h prior to counting radioactivity using a Topcount plate reader (Packard). Ligand Binding Assay—We used an adaptation of the scintillation proximity assay described above to measure the affinity of incoming dNTPs to RT assembled on PPT primer-template substrates. For these studies, we employed dideoxy-terminated RNA and DNA primers to prevent incorporation of the incoming dNTP, and we used RT containing the D443N mutation in the RNase H activity site to preempt any degradation of the nucleic acid. 20 nm RT (D443N) and 10 nm primer-template were mixed in assay buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then streptavidin-coated SPA beads were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in assay buffer. Plates were allowed to rest for 8 h prior to counting in a Topcount plate reader as described above. Coupled Assay for Minus- and Plus-strand Synthesis—For our initial studies we employed a gel-based assay that allows tracking of several biochemical steps required for successful reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome (Fig. 1A). The assay employed as substrate an RNA template that is derived from the HIV-1 HXB2 genome and that includes the 3′-polypurine tract and a complementary DNA primer that anneals to the 3′-end of the RNA. Upon initiation of the reaction, RT catalyzed RNA-dependent DNA synthesis (minus-strand synthesis), cleavage of the RNA template to generate the PPT primer, PPT-primed DNA-dependent DNA polymerization (plus-strand synthesis), and removal of the RNA PPT primer from the nascent DNA product. A time course for the assay is shown in Fig. 1B. Within 15 s (the earliest time point measured) minus-strand replication intermediates are observed, and at 30 s after initiation, the full-length minus-strand product is visible. Minus-strand DNA synthesis is essentially complete after ∼5 min. Plus-strand DNA synthesis is delayed relative to minus-strand synthesis. The plus-strand DNA product is not visible until ∼1 min after initiation of the reaction and continues to increase for 20 min. It had been shown previously that after incorporating 12 nt, RT dissociates from the nucleic acid, cleaves the nascent DNA from the PPT primer, and then initiates synthesis anew from the 3′-end of the 12-nt DNA (15Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This 12-nt intermediate first appears ∼1 min after initiation, peaks at ∼10 min, and then apparently is chased into the 37-nt product. In similar experiments using RT with the D443N RNase H-inactivating mutation, only the minus-strand product was observed (data not shown). RT containing the D185N mutation in the polymerase active site did not yield any product (data not shown). Interestingly, when an equimolar mixture of RT D185N and RT D443N was used in the assay, plus-strand products were observed, demonstrating that the polymerase and RNase H activities could be provided in trans. Effects of NNRTI L-697661 on Reverse Transcription—The assay described above provides a tool for interrogating the effects of RT inhibitors on each of the steps required for initiation of plus-strand synthesis including the RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerase activities and the RNase H-dependent generation and removal of the PPT primer. In this assay system the aminopyridinone NNRTI L-697661 (16Carroll S.S. Olsen D.B. Bennett C.D. Gotlib L. Graham D.J. Condra J.H. Stern A.M. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has strikingly different effects on plus-strand and minus-strand syntheses (Fig. 2). Although weakly inhibiting minus-strand synthesis with an IC50 of 1400 nm, this NNRTI was significantly more potent on plus-strand synthesis (IC50 = 35 nm). No products corresponding to aborted initiation products were observed, indicating that once polymerization was initiated, it proceeded to either the 12-nt product or the 37-nt nucleotide product. This observation suggests that L-697661 does not effectively inhibit processive polymerization but rather appears to have a significant impact on the initiation of polymerization. We also observed that in the presence of L-697661 both the full-length plus-strand product and the 12-nt intermediate were extended by one or two nucleotides. These extended products presumably result from altered RNase H cleavage specificity, resulting in PPT primers that are truncated by one or two nucleotides. This observation is consistent with previous reports that NNRTIs alter the cleavage specificity of RNase H (11Shaw-Reid C.A. Feuston B. Munshi V. Getty K. Krueger J. Hazuda D.J. Parniak M.A. Miller M.D. Lewis D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). L-697661 Potently Inhibits Initiation of RNA PPT but Not DNA PPT-primed Plus-strand Synthesis—In the experiments described above, L-697661 inhibited plus-strand synthesis more effectively than minus-strand synthesis. The RNA PPT-DNA hybrid duplex has some unusual structural features including misaligned base pairs that make it resistant to cleavage by RNase H and that allow it to act as primer for plus-strand synthesis (17Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 18Kvaratskhelia M. Budihas S.R. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16689-16696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The observation that L-697661 selectively inhibited plus-strand initiation prompted us to explore the structural features of the substrate that could contribute to increased sensitivity. Specifically we tested whether the nature of the primer used to initiate synthesis contributed to the different sensitivities. We thus compared the effects of L-697661 on the initiation of plus-strand synthesis using substrates comprising a DNA template with either an RNA or a DNA PPT primer (Fig. 3). The RNA-DNA duplex substrate requires RNase H activity to generate the PPT primer in addition to the polymerase activity, whereas the latter two substrates require only a functional polymerase. Initiation of plus-strand synthesis using the RNA-DNA hybrid substrate and initiation with the RNA PPT-primed substrate were equally sensitive to inhibition by L-697661 with IC50 values of ∼150 nm. In contrast, L-697661 only weakly inhibited initiation of plus-strand synthesis when a DNA PPT-primed substrate was used (IC50 > 10 μm). Selective Inhibition of Initiation of RNA PPT-primed Plus-strand Synthesis by NNRTIs—To facilitate further characterization of the structural elements that confer increased sensitivity of RNA PPT-primed initiation to inhibition by NNRTIs, we adapted the assay described above to a scintillation proximity format. For this format we utilized an 80-nt 5′-biotinylated DNA template annealed to either an 80-nt complementary RNA, an RNA PPT primer, or a DNA PPT primer and [3H]dATP. DNA synthesis is quantified by scintillation counting following capture of the radiolabeled product with scintillant impregnated, streptavidin coated beads. Results obtained using this homogeneous assay format were qualitatively and quantitatively identical to those obtained in gel based assays. Following the observation that L-697661 selectively inhibited plus-strand initiation using an RNA PPT primer, we next tested whether initiation of plus-strand synthesis was sensitive to other NNRTIs or to other mechanistically distinct classes of RT inhibitors using the scintillation assay format. L-697661 inhibited synthesis with RNA-DNA hybrid duplex and RNA PPT-primed substrates with IC50 values of 0.23 ± 0.05 μm and 0.43 ± 0.12 μm, respectively (Table 1). Likewise, nevirapine inhibited synthesis on the same substrates with IC50 values of 0.45 ± 0.06 μm and 0.9 ± 0.4 μm, respectively. L-697661 and nevirapine did not inhibit the activity of RT containing either the K103N or Y181C NNRTI resistance-conferring mutations (IC50 > 5 μm with all substrates tested with both RT mutants). With the DNA PPT-primed substrate, neither L-697661 nor nevirapine appreciably inhibited DNA synthesis at concentrations up to 5 μm. Efavirenz inhibited synthesis using an RNA PPT-primed substrate with an IC50 of 17 nm (Fig. 4). In contrast to L-697661 and nevirapine, efavirenz also inhibited synthesis with the DNA PPT-primed substrate. However, with an IC50 of 345 nm, the activity of efavirenz was more than 20-fold less potent as an inhibitor of DNA PPT-primed synthesis compared with reactions in which an RNA PPT primer was used. Under the assay conditions used here, no significant inhibition was observed with foscarnet (IC50 > 5 μm for all substrates). With limiting dTTP concentrations, AZTTP was equally effective with all three substrates (Table 1). The mutations K103N and Y181C, which conferred resistance to L-697661 and nevirapine in this assay, had no effects on the inhibitory activity of AZTTP with any of the substrates tested. These results demonstrate that the selective inhibition of plus-strand synthesis is a property common to the NNRTIs but not to other mechanistically distinct classes of RT inhibitors.TABLE 1Inhibition of plus-strand initiation by mechanistically distinct reverse transcriptase inhibitorsRNA/DNAM duplex IC50RNA PPT primer IC50DNA PPT primer IC50nmnmnmL-697661NNRTI230 ± 50430 ± 120>5000NevirapineNNRTI450 ± 60900 ± 400>5000EfavirenzNNRTINDaND, not determined.17 ± 0350 ± 0FoscarnetPRTIbPRTI, pyrophosphate mimetic reverse transcriptase inhibitor.>5000>5000>5000AZTTPNRTI360 ± 40320 ± 50240 ± 40a ND, not determined.b PRTI, pyrophosphate mimetic reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Open table in a new tab Chimeric Replication Intermediates Are Sensitive to Inhibition by NNRTIs—Incorporation of the first two deoxyribonucleotides in the initiation of plus-strand synthesis from the RNA PPT primer has previously been shown to be rate-limiting because of a higher Km for the incoming dNTP and a corresponding decrease in the catalytic efficiency (19Gotte M. Kameoka M. McLellan N. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These rate-limiting steps could be bypassed using chimeric primers in which the first two incorporation events were bypassed. Using a series of chimeric substrates with RNA PPT primers extended at their 3′-end with up to 12 deoxyribonucleotides, we tested whether 3′ DNA extensions could reduce sensitivity to L-697661. As shown in Table 2, all of the chimeric substrates tested were equally sensitive to inhibition by the NNRTI. As noted above, L-697661 causes aberrant cleavage of the RNA PPT, yielding a primer truncated by 1 or 2 nt. To rule out the trivial possibility that the rate effect of the NNRTI on plus-strand initiation is a consequence of this miscleavage, we also conducted the assay using RT containing the RNase H active site mutation D443N, which is devoid of RNase H activity. The results obtained using the RT with the inactive RNase H were similar to those observed with the wild-type enzyme (data not shown) and indicate that the inhibition is a consequence of the effects on the polymerase activity.TABLE 2Sensitivity to inhibition by L-697661 of polymerization with chimeric substratesa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab a ND, not determined. NNRTIs Are Competitive with dNTPs on RNA PPT but Not DNA PPT Substrates—Previous studies on NNRTI mechanism of action have demonstrated that NNRTIs do not significantly affect binding of the incoming dNTP (6Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The RNA PPT-DNA hybrid duplex substrate used in these studies is distinct from those used in previous studies in that RT can bind to the substrate in either an RNase H cleavage mode or in a DNA polymerase mode, whereas with the substrate used in previous studies, the enzyme could bind to substrate only in a polymerase mode (20Palaniappan C. Kim J.K. Wisniewski M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3808-3816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We designed an assay to explore the effects of NNRTIs on the binding of incoming dNTPs to RT associated with either RNA or DNA PPT-containing DNA substrates. For this assay dideoxy-terminated PPT primers were annealed to biotinylated DNA templates. Dideoxy-terminated primers were employed to prevent incorporation of the incoming dNTP. Binding studies were performed using RT that contained the RNase H active site mutation D443N, to prevent aberrant cleavage of the RNA PPT substrate in the presence of NNRTIs as described above. In binding assays, saturable binding of [3H]dATP to RT was observed was observed with both the RNA and DNA PPT substrates (Fig. 5). Modest decreases in the affinity of the enzyme for the nucleotide were observed upon addition of L-697661 in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in apparent Kd is consistent with previous observations. No change in the number of apparent dNTP binding sites was observed. In contrast, L-697661 abrogated binding of [3H]dATP to RT associated with RNA PPT primer-DNA template substrates. In this study, we have explored the effects of NNRTIs on plus-strand initiation and have demonstrated the following. (i) NNRTIs selectively inhibit plus-strand initiation from an RNA PPT primer under conditions in which little or no inhibition of minus-strand synthesis is observed. Related substrates in which the RNA PPT primer is replaced by a DNA primer of the same sequence are at least 20-fold less sensitive to inhibition by NNRTIs. (ii) Chimeric substrates in which the RNA PPT primer has been extended by up to 12 deoxyribonucleotides remain as sensitive to NNRTI inhibition as the unextended RNA PPT primer. (iii) NNRTIs compete for binding to RT when the enzyme is associated with RNA PPT-DNA hybrid duplex substrate but not with a corresponding DNA PPT primer-DNA template substrate. These observations show that NNRTIs manifest their effects differently on an RNA PPT-primed substrate than on a corresponding DNA PPT-primed substrate. RT has previously been shown to bind RNA-DNA hybrid duplexes in different modes depending on the structure of the substrate (20Palaniappan C. Kim J.K. Wisniewski M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3808-3816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With substrates that contain a recessed DNA 3′-OH, RT engages the nucleic acid in a polymerase-dependent mode of binding where the 3′-end of the DNA is positioned in the polymerase active site poised to be extended. For RNA-DNA hybrid duplex substrates in which the 3′-end of the DNA is not recessed, RT preferentially engages substrate in a polymerase-independent mode where the 5′-end of the RNA strand, and not the 3′-end, is situated in the polymerase active site (Fig. 6). Thus, most recessed RNA oligonucleotides annealed to DNA templates do not act as efficient primers for initiation of polymerization. RNA PPT hybrid duplexes are selectively utilized as primers by RT because binding of the 3′-end of the RNA in the polymerase active site is not as disfavored as with non-RNA PPT primers. Nevertheless, RT binds RNA PPT-primed substrates preferentially in an RNase H cleavage mode with the 5′-end of the RNA situated in the polymerase active site. Previous studies have demonstrated that NNRTIs inhibit polymerization by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme that prevents the covalent coupling of the incoming dNTP to the end of the product strand but do not prevent binding of either the nucleic acid substrate or dNTP. In these studies, substrates invariably contained DNA primers annealed to either an RNA or DNA template. With the substrates used in those NNRTI mechanism-of-action studies, RT would almost exclusively bind in a polymerase-dependent mode. The effects of NNRTIs that we observed using RNA PPT-primed substrates are distinct from those observed previously in two significant ways. First, the particular sensitivity to inhibition was not altered by extending the RNA primer with oligodeoxyribonucleotides of varying lengths up to 12 nt. This observation suggests either that the unique structural features that distinguish the RNA PPT-DNA hybrid duplexes extend well beyond the 3′-end of the hybrid region or that the RNA PPT sequence acts as a trap by some other mechanism. Second, although NNRTIs do not affect binding of incoming dNTPs to DNA-primed substrates, they clearly have profound effects on the binding of the incoming dNTP with RNA PPT-primed substrates. These observations suggest that on RNA PPT-primed substrates, NNRTIs may be working by another mechanism in addition to interfering with the chemical step of dNTP incorporation. One possibility, which is consistent with all the observations described here, is that NNRTI binding stabilizes binding of RT to this substrate in an RNase H cleavage mode rather than in a polymerase-dependent mode. Such a complex would not be capable of binding incoming dNTPs. In addition, if NNRTIs stabilize binding of RT to the RNA in this mode, it provides a plausible explanation for the observation that extensions of RNA PPT do not influence the potency of the compound. Instead, the RNA PPT appears to be a trap on extended substrates. The observations described here and the model that we propose to explain them raise many questions that have not been addressed in the current study. For example, in in vitro assays to characterize the effects of NNRTIs on RT-catalyzed polymerization, it has previously been shown that generation of full-length reverse transcription products is template length-dependent (12Quan Y.D. Rong L.W. Liang C. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Quan Y.D. Liang C. Inouye P. Wainberg M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5692-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NNRTI concentrations required for effective inhibition of full-length product synthesis by RT are decreased with increasing template length. NNRTIs do not alter the apparent pattern of pause sites normally observed with both RNA and DNA heteropolymeric substrates due to stalling or dissociation at discrete sites. We propose that some component of this inhibition is the result of trapping the enzyme in a polymerase-independent RNase H-competent mode of binding. Also, in cell-based replication assay, NNRTIs have little or no effect on the production of minus-strand strong stop DNA when present at concentrations greatly exceeding those required to inhibit complete reverse transcription. These observations raise the possibility that NNRTIs may in part manifest their effect on HIV-1 replication by mechanisms other than inhibition of the chemical reaction of dNTP incorporation. In addition, the finding that different steps in the RT process can display differential sensitivity to inhibitors also suggests that there may be additional opportunities to identify other novel classes of RT inhibitors using assays that more fully replicate the complex biological process."
https://openalex.org/W2062945625,"The hair cell's mechanoreceptive organelle, the hair bundle, is highly sensitive because its transduction channels open over a very narrow range of displacements. The synchronous gating of transduction channels also underlies the active hair-bundle motility that amplifies and tunes responsiveness. The extent to which the gating of independent transduction channels is coordinated depends on how tightly individual stereocilia are constrained to move as a unit. Using dual-beam interferometry in the bullfrog's sacculus, we found that thermal movements of stereocilia located as far apart as a hair bundle's opposite edges showed high coherence and negligible phase lag. Because the mechanical degrees of freedom of stereocilia are strongly constrained, a force applied anywhere in the hair bundle deflects the structure as a unit. This feature assures the concerted gating of transduction channels that maximizes the sensitivity of mechanoelectrical transduction and enhances the hair bundle's capacity to amplify its inputs."
https://openalex.org/W1983009319,"Overexpression and/or gene amplification of c-Src and members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Although members of the EGFR family are known to form heterocomplexes with one another, c-Src has also been shown to physically interact with members of this family in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. This paper investigates the role of c-Src in modulating the physical and functional interaction between ErbB2 and ErbB3, two family members that preferentially associate with one another and together exhibit high oncogenic potential. We show that overexpressed wild-type c-Src enhances heterocomplex formation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 that results in increased basal and/or heregulin-induced activation of receptors, and their downstream intracellular effectors. Expression of a kinase-inactive form of c-Src (K(-) c-Src) or pharmacological inhibition of c-Src by PP2 negatively affects these events. Furthermore, cellular motility and anchorage-independent growth promoted by the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterocomplex are dependent upon c-Src, as demonstrated by the effects of K(-) c-Src overexpression or treatment with PP2. In contrast to previous studies that defined a role for c-Src downstream of ErbB2/ErbB3, the current work suggests an upstream mechanism, whereby c-Src enhances ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling and biological functions by positively modulating the association between ErbB2 and ErbB3."

Levels of plasma triglyceride and triglyceride accumulation in the liver were both elevated when p38 activation was blocked. Expression levels of central lipogenic genes, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and cytochrome P-450-51, were decreased in liver by fasting and in primary hepatocytes by glucagon but increased by the inhibition of p38. In addition, we have shown that p38 can inhibit insulin-induced expression of key lipogenic genes in isolated hepatocytes. Our results in hepatoma cells demonstrate that p38 plays an inhibitory role in the activation of the SREBP-1c promoter. Finally, we have shown that transcription of the PGC-1β gene, a key coactivator of SREBP-1c, was reduced in liver by fasting and in isolated hepatocytes by glucagon.

Hepatic lipogenesis is essential for maintaining energy balance (1.Cooper A.D. Ellsworth J.L. Hepatology. 1996; I: 92-130Google Scholar). Disorders of hepatic lipogenesis may lead to fatty liver, dyslipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and complications such as atherosclerosis (2.Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Lipogenesis in liver includes de novo synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterols. As a major site for synthesis of fatty acids, the liver converts excess carbohydrates into fat storage in the fed state. Fatty acids synthesized in the liver are converted into triglycerides and secreted as very low density lipoproteins, which transport fatty acids to the storage sites in adipocytes. Cholesterols synthesized in the liver are also transported to other tissues via very low density lipoproteins as essential building materials for steroid hormones and cellular membranes. However, excess production of fatty acids and cholesterols from the liver may contribute to a variety of lipid disorders. The lipogenic process in the liver is primarily regulated by central lipogenic transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TG, triglyceride; FAS, fatty acid synthase; FPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; SB, SB203580; RT, reverse transcription; HFD, high fat diet; siRNA, small interfering RNA; dn, dominant negative.2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TG, triglyceride; FAS, fatty acid synthase; FPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; SB, SB203580; RT, reverse transcription; HFD, high fat diet; siRNA, small interfering RNA; dn, dominant negative.

SREBPs regulate lipogenesis by stimulating expression of their target genes, such as liver pyruvate kinase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase (FAS), Spot14, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (reviewed in Ref. 4.Eberle D.

The function of SREBPs is primarily regulated through protein cleavage and gene expression. The “inactive” precursor form of SREBPs are integral membrane proteins of endoplasmic reticulum. Upon sterol deprivation, they are cleaved through two sequential steps to release the N terminus, which is translocated into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes (6.Hua X. Wu J.

However, the signaling pathway from hormones to the SREBP promoters, such as the identity of specific kinases, remains largely unknown. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) is one member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily.

Glucagon and Percoll were from Sigma. Antibodies against p38 and phosphorylated p38 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against SREBP-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The SREBP-1c promoter construct (pBP1c, 1.3 kb) was a kind gift from Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein (29.Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The constructs for dominant-negative p38α (p38(AF)) and MKK6E were kindly provided by Dr. Jiahua Han. Animal Experiments−To examine the role of p38 in lipid metabolism, C57BL/6 mice (10 mice/group) were fed with normal (standard) chow diet or high fat diet (Research Diets catalog number D12330: 58.0 kcal% fat, 16.0 kcal% protein, and 26 kcal% carbohydrate) as noted. Six weeks later, some mice were treated with SB (30 mg/kg body weight/day through gastric gavages) or the vehicle solution for another 2 weeks as noted. SB and vehicle were administered one dose/day. At completion of these treatments, blood samples were collected for measurements of lipids, and livers were harvested for quantification of triglyceride (TG) and analyses of target proteins and mRNAs. To further evaluate the role of p38 in expressions of lipogenic genes, C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were fasted for 24 h in the presence or absence of SB (12.4 mg/kg body weight via immunoprecipitation) as noted. SB was administered as previously described (27.Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The fed mice were used as a control. Livers were collected for the measurements of lipogenic genes. Preparation, Transfection, and Viral Infection of Primary Hepatocytes−Primary hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice fed with normal chow diet at the regular schedule were prepared as previously described (30.Seglen P.O. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1979; 5: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, under anesthesia with pentobarbital (immunoprecipitation, 30 mg/kg body weight), livers were perfused with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) at 5 ml/min for 8 min followed by continuous perfusion with serum-free Williams’ medium containing collagenase (Worthington, type II, 130 units/ml) (Invitrogen), HEPES (10 mm), and NaOH (0.004 n) at 5 ml/min for 12 min. Hepatocytes were harvested and purified with Percoll as described previously (31.Kedderis G.L. Argenbright L.S. Miwa G.T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1988; 93: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The viability of hepatocytes was examined with trypan blue exclusion. Cells with viability >95% were used. Hepatocytes were inoculated into collagen-coated 6-well plates (5 × 105/well) in Williams’ medium. Cells were incubated overnight before any experimentation. MKK6E and p38-AF-FLAG (dominant negative p38α) were introduced into primary hepatocytes with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s manuals (Invitrogen). For adenoviral infection, 50 active viral particles/cell in 1 ml of Williams’ medium with 2% fetal bovine serum were used to incubate with cells for 6 h followed by incubation with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (32.Lerin C. Montell E. Nolasco T. Clark C. Brady M.J. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2221-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At 36 h post-infection, levels of p38 and expression of genes in hepatocytes were detected by immunoblottings with appropriate antibodies and TaqMan real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, respectively. Culture and Transfection of Hepatoma Cell Line−The Hepa1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured with minimal essential α medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transient transfection of these cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Immunoblotting−Tissue or whole-cell lysates were prepared by homogenization and sonication followed by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots (5-10 μg protein/well) were resolved with mini-Tris-glycine gels (4-20%) (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Levels of p38 and SREPB-1 were detected with a 1:1000 dilution of each specific antiserum (catalog numbers 9211S and 9212 from Cell Signaling Technology and catalog number sc-8984 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (RPN5783, Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent bands were visualized with a Typhoon phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). RNA Isolation and TaqMan Real-time RT-PCR−Total RNAs from liver were prepared by using RNA purification kits from Qiagen. Real-time RT-PCR TaqMan probes and reaction agents were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reactions were performed according to manuals from the manufacturer. All results were normalized to levels of the GADPH gene. Catalog numbers for the probes are: SREBP-1 (Mm00550338_m1)), SREBP-2 (Mm01306293_m1), FAS (Mm-00662319_m1), PGC-1β (Mm00504720_ m1), HMG CoA reductase (Mm01282491-g1), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS) (Mm00830315_g1), and CYP51 (Mm0049968_m1). Measurement of SREBP-1c Promoter Activity−The SREBP-1c promoter was introduced into Hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cells together with the expression vector for β-galactosidase via transient transfection (24.Cao W. Daniel K.W. Robidoux J. Puigserver P. Medvedev A.V. Bai X. Floering L.M. Spiegelman B.M. Collins S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and stimulated as noted. SREBP-1c promoter activity was measured by luciferase assays and normalized to the internal control of transfection, β-galactosidase. Measurements of mRNA Degradation−Transcription of lipogenic genes in hepatocytes were activated by insulin and dexamethasone for 20 h and subsequently blocked by treatment with amanitin as described previously (33.Xu J. Teran-Garcia M. Park J.H. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9800-9807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with either SB or vehicle solution as noted. Levels of representatives of lipogenic genes (SREBP-1c and PGC-1β) were quantified with TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. Measurements of Liver Triglyceride Content−Livers were homogenized in a buffer containing 18 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 300 mmd-mannitol, 50 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triglycerides in the lysates were extracted using a chloroform/methanol protocol as previously described (34.Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Levels of triglycerides were quantified by using triglyceride reagents from Sigma (catalog number T2449-10ML) and normalized to protein concentration. Lipid droplets in liver slides were visualized with Oil Red O staining. Inhibition of p38 Leads to Elevation of Plasma Lipids and Fat Accumulation in Liver−During our study on the stimulatory role of p38 in hepatic gluconeogenesis (27.Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we unexpectedly observed that p38 might inhibit hepatic lipogenesis. To fully characterize this observation, we examined the effect of p38 inhibition on levels of plasma lipids and liver TG content in mice. As shown in Fig. 1A, although plasma levels of total cholesterol (T-Chol), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLChol), and TGs were not significantly changed after high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, hepatic TG content was significantly increased by HFD (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Levels of TG in both plasma and liver were significantly increased by the inhibition of p38 in the mice under either normal chow or high fat diet. (Figs. 1A and 2A). Both the number and size of the lipid droplets in the liver were increased by HFD, and these increases were further significantly aggravated by the inhibition of p38 (Fig. 2B). Levels of phosphorylated p38 in the liver were also enhanced by HFD, but this effect was blocked by SB (Fig. 2C). It was noted that treatment of animals with SB did not significantly influence either levels of plasma non-esterified fatty acids and insulin or body weight and food consumption (Fig. 1, B-E). Together, these results show that the blockade of p38 can elevate TG levels in both plasma and liver, suggesting an inhibitory role for p38 in hepatic lipogenesis.FIGURE 2The inhibition of p38 enhances fat accumulation in liver. Mice were treated in the same way as described in Fig. 1. A, levels of TG content in liver were quantified with a standard method. *, p < 0.05 compared with ND with no SB treatment. #, p < 0.01 compared with -SB under HFD. B, lipid content in liver tissue was visualized with Oil Red O staining. C, levels of p38 phosphorylation in liver were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against total or phospho-p38. Results shown represent means ± S.D. of two independent experiments. #, p < 0.05 comparing HFD to either ND or HFD + SB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Blockade of p38 Can Increase Transcript Levels of Lipogenic Genes in Fasted Liver−To investigate the possible role of p38 in suppression of hepatic lipogenesis, we chose to use fasting mice as models, because it is well known that hepatic lipogenesis is normally inhibited by fasting and p38 is activated in the liver during fasting (27.Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As expected (Fig. 3A), levels of lipogenic gene transcripts, including SREBP-1c, FAS, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, FPS, and CYP51 were decreased by fasting, and these decreases were significantly, although not completely in some cases, reversed by the inhibition of p38. SREBP-2 transcripts were not reduced by fasting but were significantly elevated upon the blockade of p38. Levels of both SREBP-1c and FAS transcripts in fed mice were also increased by SB. Phosphorylation of p38 in the liver was increased by fasting and inhibited by SB (Fig. 3B) as expected (27.Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results indicate that activation of p38 in liver is related to the reduction of transcript levels of central lipogenic genes, SREBP-1c, and its downstream target genes. p38 Plays a Suppressive Role in Transcription of Lipogenic Genes in Primary Hepatocytes−Lipogenesis is inhibited during fasting to protect the substrate supply for glucose production in liver (16.Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The predominant suppressor of lipogenesis is glucagon, which is also the major promoter of hepatic glucose production and is always significantly elevated in the blood during fasting (35.Ruderman N. Aoki T. Cahill G. Gluconeogensis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 515-532Google Scholar). Glucagon is a cAMP-producing hormone that can activate p38 in primary hepatocytes (27.Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36.Spector M.S. Auer K.L. Jarvis W.D. Ishac E.J. Gao B. Kunos G. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3556-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether p38 mediates glucagon suppression of hepatic lipogenesis, levels of key lipogenic gene transcripts and phosphorylation of p38 in primary hepatocytes were examined in the presence or absence of p38 blockade. As predicted, levels of SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, FAS, HMG CoA-R, and FPS transcripts were inhibited by glucagon (Fig. 4A). This inhibition was significantly reversed by the blockade of p38 with either SB or overexpression of dominant negative p38α (dn-p38α). To determine the role of p38 in insulin-induced transcription of key lipogenic genes, primary hepatocytes were stimulated by insulin in the presence of a p38 inhibitor or an activator. As shown in Fig. 4B, levels of key lipogenic genes SREBP-1c and FAS were elevated by insulin as expected, and this elevation was further enhanced by the inhibition of p38 with SB but prevented by the activation of p38 with MKK6E. Furthermore, levels of the SREBP-1 protein (membrane-bound) were significantly increased by all p38 inhibitors, including SB, dn-p38α, and small interfering RNA against p38α (siRNA-p38α) but decreased by glucagon (Fig. 4C). The nuclear form of SREBP-1 was also slightly elevated by the inhibition of p38. The scrambled siRNA had no effect. (Note: cells were not deprived of cholesterol in these experiments.) Phosphorylation of p38 in isolated hepatocytes was also stimulated by glucagon and blocked by either SB or siRNA-p38α (Fig. 4D). Our results indicated that the inhibition of p38 did not affect the stability of SREBP-1c mRNA (supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these results support the notion that p38 is an inhibitor of lipogenic gene expression in isolated hepatocytes. p38 Is an Inhibitor of the SREBP-1c Promoter−To further define the role of p38 in hepatic lipogenesis, we examined the role of p38 in activation of the SREBP-1c promoter, which was introduced into Hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cells via transient transfection. Because insulin is known to stimulate transcription of the SREBP-1c gene (17.Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P.

As shown in Fig. 5A, the SREBP-1c promoter was stimulated by insulin as expected, and this stimulation was further enhanced by the inhibition of p38. Similarly, the SREBP-1c promoter was suppressed by glucagon as expected, and the suppression was significantly reversed by the inhibition of p38 with either SB or siRNA (Fig. 5B). Together, these results further support an inhibitory role for p38 in the transcription of the central lipogenic gene, SREBP-1c. p38 Can Inhibit Transcription of the PGC-1β Gene in Both Liver and Isolated Hepatocytes−PGC-1β was recently shown to be a critical coactivator of lipogenic gene expression through its interaction with SREBP-1c (19.Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To examine whether transcription of the PGC-1β gene is a target for p38 in the suppression of hepatic lipogenesis, we examined levels of PGC-1β transcripts in livers from fed or fasted mice with or without treatment with SB. As shown in Fig. 6A, levels of PGC-1β transcripts in liver were decreased by fasting; this decline was significantly, although not completely, reversed by the blockade of p38. To more directly study the effect of p38 on levels of PGC-1β transcripts, primary hepatocytes were treated with glucagon in the presence or absence of p38 inhibition. As shown in Fig. 6B, levels of PGC-1β transcripts were reduced by glucagon, but the reduction was completely prevented by the blockade of p38 with either SB or dn-p38α. Similarly, insulin-induced expression of the PGC-1β gene was also enhanced by the inhibition of p38 but suppressed by the activation of p38 (Fig. 6C). To determine the possible role of p38 in the degradation of PGC-1β mRNA, the transcription of the PGC-1β gene was first stimulated by insulin and dexamethasone and then blocked by amanitin follo"
https://openalex.org/W2027298321,"Ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis is a fundamental process underlying skeletal muscle atrophy. Thus, the role of ubiquitin ligases is of great interest. There are no focused studies in muscle on the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. We first confirmed increased mRNA expression in rat soleus muscles due to 1-14 days of hind limb unloading. Nedd4 protein localized to the sarcolemmal region of muscle fibers. Hind limb unloading, sciatic nerve denervation, starvation, and diabetes led to atrophy of soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius muscles, but only unloaded and denervated muscles showed a marked increase in Nedd4 protein expression. This increase was strongly correlated with decreased Notch1 expression, a known target of Nedd4 in other cell types. Overexpression of dominant negative Nedd4 in soleus muscles completely reversed the unloading-induced decrease of Notch1 expression, indicating that Nedd4 is required for Notch1 inactivation. Overexpression of wild-type Nedd4 in soleus muscles of weight bearing rats caused a decrease in Notch1 protein, indicating that Nedd4 is sufficient for Notch1 down-regulation. To further show that Notch1 is a Nedd4 substrate in muscle, conditional overexpression of Nedd4 in C2C12 myotubes induced ubiquitination of Notch1. This is the first finding of a Nedd4 substrate in muscle and of an ubiquitin ligase, the activity of which distinguishes disuse from cachexia atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2076876639,"Tat (twin arginine translocation) systems transport folded proteins across the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and the plasma membrane of most bacteria. Tat precursors are targeted by hydrophobic cleavable signal peptides with twin arginine (RR) motifs. Bacterial precursors possess an extended consensus, (S/T)RRXFLK, of which the two arginines and the phenylalanine are essential for efficient transport. Thylakoid Tat precursors possess twin arginines but lack the consensus phenylalanine. Here, we have characterized two stages of precursor binding to the thylakoid Tat signal peptide receptor, the 700-kDa cpTatC-Hcf106 complex. The OE17 precursor tOE17 binds to the receptor by RR-dependant electrostatic interactions and partially dissociates during blue native gel electrophoresis. In addition, the signal peptide of thylakoid-bound tOE17 is highly exposed to the membrane surface, as judged by accessibility to factor Xa of cleavage sites engineered into signal peptide flanking regions. By contrast, tOE17 containing a consensus phenylalanine in place of Val–20 (V – 20F) binds the receptor more strongly and is completely stable during blue native gel electrophoresis. Thylakoid bound V – 20F is also completely protected from factor Xa at the identical sites. This suggests that the signal peptide is buried deeply in the cpTatC-Hcf106 binding site. We further provide evidence that the proton gradient, which is required for translocation, induces a tighter interaction between tOE17 and the cpTat machinery, similar to that exhibited by V – 20F. This implies that translocation involves a very intimate association of the signal peptide with the receptor complex binding site.

This implies that translocation involves a very intimate association of the signal peptide with the receptor complex binding site. The thylakoid membranes of plant chloroplasts and the cytoplasmic membranes of eubacteria and some archaea possess parallel protein translocation systems. The well characterized Sec systems transport unfolded proteins using NTPs as the energy source. The Tat (twin arginine translocation) systems are distinctive in that they transport proteins in a folded conformation, and they employ only the protonmotive force as energy source (for the most recent reviews, see Refs. 1Muller M.

Both Sec- and Tat-directed precursor proteins possess hydrophobic cleavable signal peptides, which direct targeting to the respective machineries. Tat signal peptides differ from the Sec signal peptides in that they contain an essential twin arginine motif immediately upstream of the hydrophobic core region. Bacterial Tat substrates possess an extended consensus sequence consisting of (S/T)RRXFLK (5Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Only one of the known thylakoid Tat precursor protein possesses the extended consensus (6Summer E.J. Mori H. Settles A.M. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23483-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rather, logoplot analysis of known and predicted thylakoid Tat substrates suggests a weak consensus of RRX-Hyd-Hyd, where Hyd represents a hydrophobic amino acid (7Peltier J.B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Commonly, three components are required for Tat transport: cpTatC, 2The abbreviations used are: cpTat, chloroplast Tat; IB, import buffer; (Tmd) Phe, l-4′-(3-[trifluoromethyl]-3H-diazirin-3-yl)phenylalanine; BN-PAGE, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Hcf106, and Tha4 in thylakoids and the orthologous TatC, TatB, and TatA, respectively, in bacteria. The thylakoid Tat system has been experimentally staged into several steps (8Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); the precursor protein binds to a cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex, a Tha4 oligomer assembles with the precursor-receptor complex to form the putative translocase (10Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the precursor is transported into the lumen. After transport, Tha4 dissociates from the receptor complex, resetting the system for another round of transport. Identification of precursor proteins, such as tOE17, a trun-cated variant of the OE17 precursor that bind stably to thylakoids in the absence of the proton gradient, has allowed characterization of the initial binding step (11Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, certain observations suggest that precursors bind to the receptor complex differently, possibly more tightly, under the energized conditions that exist during protein transport. First, several Tat pathway precursor proteins do not bind stably in the absence of a proton gradient but are nevertheless efficiently transported (11Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For instance, the OE23 precursor binds reversibly to thylakoids in the absence of a proton gradient, and its association with the receptor has only been detected by chemical cross-linking (9Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Second, although 150 mm KCl prevents tOE17 binding to the receptor complex in the absence of the proton gradient, 150 mm KCl does not significantly impair transport of tOE17 across energized membranes (12Ma X. Protein Targeting and Translocation on cpSec and Delta pH Pathways in Chloroplast Thylakoids. 1999; (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL)Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent study identified modified tOE17 proteins that do bind more stably to the receptor complex. Translational insertion of the photoreactive phenylalanine analog (Tmd)Phe was used in cross-linking studies to fine map interactions between tOE17 and cpTat components (13Gé;rard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that most of the Tmd(Phe)-substituted precursors that cross-linked to cpTat components formed tighter associations with the receptor that were not disrupted by salt washes. Strikingly, the most abundant cross-linking product was formed between cpTatC and tOE17 with Tmd(Phe) in place of Val–20 (V – 20Tmd(Phe)), the location of the bacterial consensus Phe. One model for the Tat system implies a strong interaction between the precursor and cpTatC (TatC), because it proposes that cpTatC pulls the precursor through a Tha4-facilitated opening (10Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Bruser T. Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, tOE17 cross-linked to cpTatC through the V – 20Tmd(Phe) site could still be efficiently transported into the lumen (13Gé;rard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have further characterized the precursor-receptor interactions of tOE17 and a phenylalanine-substituted tOE17 (V – 20F), which exhibits a stronger interaction comparable with its Tmd(Phe) derivative. In particular, whereas tOE17 was primarily bound through electrostatic interactions, V – 20F required both salt and urea solutions to be released from the membrane. The V – 20F association with the receptor complex was also more stable to blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analysis. Finally, V – 20F, when bound to thylakoids, was virtually inaccessible to the protease factor Xa at a variety of cleavage sites introduced near the signal peptide, whereas bound tOE17 was highly accessible to factor Xa at the analogous cleavage sites. In order to determine if binding of V – 20F is similar to the interaction of precursors under the energized conditions that occur during transport, tOE17 was bound to thylakoids pretreated with αTha4 IgGs (to prevent translocation) and a proton gradient was applied. In the presence of the proton gradient, bound tOE17 was less susceptible to salt extraction and less accessible to factor Xa cleavage than in the absence of a proton gradient. These results support a model in which, at the moment of transport, the signal peptide of Tat precursors becomes more tightly associated with and deeply buried in the binding site of the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex. These results will be discussed in the context of current models for translocation by the Tat translocase. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—DNA clones for the various precursors used in this study were constructed by PCR mutagenesis with the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and the clones for tOE17 and iOE17 as templates (15Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing on both strands at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA Sequencing Core Facility verified all constructs. Phenylalanine substitutions were obtained by replacing the relevant codons with TTT. Signal peptide clones were obtained by inserting the stop codon TAG at the respective positions 17 and 30 residues into the coding sequence of the OE17 mature domain. The clone for iOE17 IEGR–30 was prepared by substituting the coding sequence of iOE17 MASAEGDAVA with MASIEGRAVA, thereby introducing the factor Xa cleavage site, IEGR. The factor Xa cryptic site in iOE17 and tOE17 was removed by substituting aspartate for arginine in QAARAE, giving QAADAE. The clones for tOE17 IEGR11 and tOE17 IEGR39 were obtained by insertion of codons for a glutamate and an arginine in the coding sequence TIKIGAPPPP, to give TIKIEGRAPPPP (site IEGR11) and codons for an isoleucine and a glycine in the coding sequence PLKERFYL to give PLKIEGRFYL (site IEGR39). Preparation of Radiolabeled Precursors—Capped mRNAs were transcribed in vitro with SP6 polymerase (Promega) and were translated in presence of [3H]leucine with a homemade wheat germ translation system (16Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Chloroplasts, Thylakoids, and Lysate—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 9–10-day-old pea seedlings as described by Cline et al. (17Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chloroplast pellets were lysed at 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 at 0 °C for 10 min and adjusted to import buffer (IB; 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol), 10 mm MgCl2. Thylakoids were obtained from lysates by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 8 min and washing with IB. Stromal extract was obtained from the supernatant by additional centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min to remove envelope membranes. Thylakoids were washed with IB and resuspended in IB to 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml before use. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined according to Arnon (18Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precursor Binding and Chase Assays—Precursor binding assays were conducted as follows. [3H]Leucine-labeled in vitro translation products were incubated with apyrase for 10 min at 0 °C and then with an equivalent volume of washed thylakoid membranes and an equivalent volume of IB for 15 min in darkness at 0 °C. Thylakoid membranes were then recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with IB, and analyzed directly (binding) or further incubated for transport from the bound state (chase) by resuspension with a stoichiometric quantity of stromal extract, 5 mm Mg-ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and incubation for 15 min at 25 °C in ∼70 μmol/m2/s white light. Thylakoid membranes were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Bound Precursor Extraction Assays—Precursor-bound thylakoid membranes (25 μg of chlorophyll) were resuspended in 75 μl of the extraction solution (freshly prepared in 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0) and incubated at 0 °C for 10 or 30 min, as described in the figure legends. Samples were centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 1 or 2 min at 2 °C. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Radiolabeled proteins were quantified by scintillation counting of bands extracted from dried gels as previously described (16Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digitonin Solubilization and Blue Native PAGE—Thylakoid membranes were resuspended with one volume of 0.5× IB, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m aminocaproic acid and one volume of 0.5× IB, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m aminocaproic acid, 2% digitonin and incubated for 40 min at 0 °C, and the soluble fraction was collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Samples were mixed with blue native sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5–13.5% polyacrylamide gradient gel (8Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and analyzed by fluorography. Nondenaturing Coimmunoprecipitation—40 μl of digitoninsolubilized thylakoids from a precursor binding reaction were transferred to a low retention microcentrifuge tube containing αHcf106 IgG beads (equivalent to 40 μl of a 25% slurry solution) and incubated for 60 min with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C. Pellets were recovered by centrifugation; washed twice with 200 μl of IB, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m aminocaproic acid, 0.5% digitonin; and transferred into Wizard minicolumns (Promega). Elution was performed by incubating beads with 40 μl of 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 90 min at 37 °C. The eluate (bound fraction) and unbound supernatant of the initial incubation were diluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Factor Xa Assays—Factor Xa was purchased from Novagen and buffer-exchanged into IB by desalting on 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin columns. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of factor Xa and terminated by either the addition of a 20 μm concentration of the specific factor Xa inhibitor, 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone, dihydrochloride (Calbiochem), in 10 mm HCl, when indicated or the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, both of which were shown to immediately quench the reaction in independent experiments. The location of the tOE17 cryptic site was identified via an NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation of the proteolytic fragment obtained by factor Xa cleavage of Escherichia coli produced tOE17 (University of Florida Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research). Protein Precipitation—Proteins were precipitated by two different methods, as noted in the figure legends. First, samples received 10% trichloroacetic acid and were incubated for 45 min at 0 °C, centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 15 min, and washed with ice-cold acetone. Protein pellets were dried at the bench for 15 min and dissolved in sample buffer. Second, the samples received 90% ice-cold acetone and were incubated for 60 min at 0 °C, centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 15 min, dried at the bench for 15 min, and resuspended in sample buffer. Miscellaneous—αTha4-treated thylakoids were prepared as described in Ref. 19Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43027-43033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and resuspended at 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml in IB. Immunoblots were conducted using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Fc as secondary antibodies and developed by the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Methyl viologen, nigericin, and valinomycin were purchased from Sigma; KCl and urea were from Fisher. A Position-specific Phenylalanine Substitution in the Signal Peptide Results in tOE17 That Forms a Tighter and More Stable Association with the cpTat Receptor Complex—As reported previously (13Gé;rard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and designated in Fig. 1A, (Tmd)Phe substitutions of certain residues in the tOE17 signal peptide resulted in a more stable association of the precursor with the 700-kDa receptor complex, cpTatC-Hcf106. One possibility for this effect was that the phenylalanine moiety of (Tmd)Phe increased the overall hydrophobicity of the signal peptide. In order to examine this possibility, phenylalanine substitutions were made at Val–20 (V – 20F), Ile–19 (I – 19F), Leu–7 (L – 7F), and Val3 (V3F) (Fig. 1A), and the effects on binding to the receptor complex were examined. All of the resulting precursors bound productively to thylakoids, since more than 90% of bound precursors were transported when submitted to a chase reaction (data not shown). Three of four modified precursors were similar to tOE17 with regard to their release from the membranes by salt washes and their behavior on BN-PAGE (Fig. 1, B and C). Thylakoid-bound tOE17 was largely extracted by 0.5 m KCl, as were I – 19F, L – 7F, and V3F (Fig. 1B). By contrast, bound V – 20F, like its V – 20Tmd(Phe) counterpart, was not extracted by 0.5 m KCl but required a combination of KCl and urea to be dissociated from the membranes (Fig. 1B). Similarly, V – 20F associated more stably with the 700-kDa receptor complex during BN-PAGE analysis than did tOE17 or the other substituted precursors (Fig. 1C, compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3–5). The different precursors showed some variability in the efficiencies of digitonin solubilization (see numbers below the gels in the top of Fig. 1C). However, the striking difference seen in Fig. 1C was due to the percentage of solubilized precursor that co-migrated with the 700-kDa receptor complex. For example, only 7.4% of solubilized tOE17 migrated at 700 kDa. This was previously attributed to a dissociation of bound tOE17 during electrophoresis, as evidenced by a smear of tOE17 below the precursor-receptor complex (Fig. 1C, lane 1) (8Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By contrast, 75% of the solubilized V – 20F precursor co-migrated with the 700-kDa receptor complex. From this set of data, we conclude that there are two types of productive interactions between the precursor and the thylakoid membranes. The first, exhibited by bound tOE17, is mediated by electrostatic interactions, which are relatively unstable to native electrophoresis. The second, exhibited by bound V – 20F, also involves conformational changes that render the precursor-receptor complex highly stable to native electrophoresis. The fact that L – 7F and V3F did not exhibit stronger binding comparable with their Tmd(Phe) counterparts (top of Fig. 1A) argues against the idea that stronger binding results from a general increase in hydrophobicity. Rather, it points to a position-specific effect of the phenylalanine, which notably, for V – 20F, is in the same relative location, with respect to the RR, as the consensus phenylalanine of the bacterial twin arginine motif. KCl-extractable and KCl-resistant tOE17 Subpopulations Are Associated with the cpTatC-Hcf106 Receptor Complex—In light of the fact that a small subset of bound tOE17 was not extracted by 0.5 m KCl (Fig. 1B), we asked whether or not both the KCl-extractable and the KCl-resistant subpopulations of tOE17 were specifically associated with the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex. BN-PAGE and co-immunoprecipitation analyses were conducted on precursor-bound membranes that were treated either with buffer or with 0.5 m KCl before digitonin solubilization (Fig. 2). tOE17 from both buffer-washed and KCl-washed membranes migrated at the location of the 700-kDa receptor complex. However, the amount of tOE17 at 700 kDa was substantially reduced by KCl treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3; see relative amounts below the lanes). KCl treatment affected neither the solubilization efficiency (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 8; see relative recovery numbers below the lanes) nor the BN-PAGE assay, as evidenced by the fact that the amount of V – 20F co-migrating with the 700-kDa receptor complex after KCl treatment was comparable with the amount from the buffer-washed membranes (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). This was the first indication that the KCl-extractable and KCl-resistant subpopulations of thylakoid-bound tOE17 are associated with cpTatC-Hcf106. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed these results (Fig. 2B). Specifically, 65% of the digitonin-solubilized tOE17 from buffer-washed membranes was co-immunoprecipitated with αHcf106 IgG beads (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4–6). As expected, the KCl treatment reduced the amount of membrane-associated tOE17 to about 17% of the buffer-washed membranes (Fig. 2B, top, compare lanes 3 and 7), but most of the tOE17 solubilized from the KCl-treated membranes was co-immunoprecipitated with Hcf106 (Fig. 2B, top, lanes 8–10). Immunoblot analysis showed that virtually all of the cpTatC was co-immunoprecipitated by the beads and verified the specificity of immunoprecipitation, because chloroplast SecY was not co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. S1). Because essentially the same amount of bound V – 20F was solubilized and co-immunoprecipitated with or without the KCl wash (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–10), we conclude that the KCl treatment did not affect the co-immunoprecipitation assay. Although these results show that both subpopulations of thylakoid-bound precursors are associated with cpTatC-Hcf106, some of the bound precursor was not accounted for in this analysis, because a significant amount of precursor was not solubilized by digitonin (Fig. 2B, compare numbers below lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8). This could simply reflect inefficiency of the solubilization method. Alternatively, it could mean that some of the precursor is associated with the membrane bilayer, as has recently been reported for another precursor (20Bruser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, thylakoid membranes were pretreated with the protease thermolysin prior to a binding assay. This treatment, which digested all of the stromally exposed domains of cpTatC, Hcf106, and Tha4 (not shown), eliminated virtually all binding of tOE17 and V – 20F to the membranes (Fig. S2). This indicates that the observed precursor binding results from protein-protein interactions, which is consistent with our previous observations (11Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is likely that nearly all of the thylakoid-bound precursors are specifically associated with Tat protein components, because mutation of the twin arginine of tOE17 or V – 20Tmd(Phe) to twin lysine virtually eliminates their ability to bind thylakoids (13Gé;rard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Binding Properties of tOE17 and V – 20F Are Determined by the Signal Peptide—The dramatic effect of a single substitution of phenylalanine for valine in the signal peptide (Figs. 1 and 2) prompted us to assess whether the signal peptide, devoid of the mature domain, determines the nature of interactions between the precursor and the receptor complex. This was addressed by preparing transcription/translation constructs for the signal peptides of tOE17 and V – 20F. However, in order to resolve these peptides on Tris/Tricine gels, we found it necessary to include some amino-terminal residues of mature OE17. Constructs that contained the signal peptide and 17 or 30 mature domain residues were prepared from tOE17 (Sp17 and Sp30, respectively) and from V – 20F (SpF17 and SpF30, respectively). All signal peptides efficiently bound to thylakoids (Fig. 3A, even lanes). When signal peptide bound thylakoids were subjected to BN-PAGE analysis, the signal peptides exhibited the behavior of the precursors from which they were derived. Strong bands of SpF17 and SpF30 signal peptides co-migrated with the 700-kDa receptor complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Although not visible in Fig. 3B (lanes 3 and 4), Sp17 and Sp30 gave faint bands co-migrating with the 700-kDa receptor complex with a longer fluorographic exposure (data not shown). The four signal peptides also exhibited similar extraction behavior as their parent precursors, namely extractable with KCl for Sp17 and Sp30 and resistant to KCl (but extractable by a combination of KCl and urea) for SpF17 and SpF30 (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that the signal peptide alone determines the nature of binding to the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex. Signal Peptide-flanking Regions of tOE17, but Not V – 20F, Are Accessible to Factor Xa Protease from the cis Side of the Membrane—The fact that KCl and urea are necessary to dissociate bound V – 20F from thylakoid membranes (Fig. 1) suggested that the V – 20F signal peptide might be more deeply buried in the cpTatC-Hcf106 binding site. To assess this possibility, factor Xa cleavage sites (IEGR) were engineered into the amino- and carboxyl-proximal regions flanking the signal peptides, and the accessibility of bound precursors to factor Xa was determined. Unmodified tOE17 was cleaved by factor Xa at a cryptic site adjacent to the Tpp (thylakoid-processing peptidase) cleavage site (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4A). This site was used as the most carboxyl-proximal site to the signal peptide. When we compared the cryptic site accessibility of productively bound tOE17 and V – 20F, we observed a dramatic difference (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–7). The tOE17 cryptic site was largely accessible to factor Xa, as evidenced by the linear appearance of the cleavage product (Xcp) during the time of the assay. By contrast, the V – 20F cryptic site was completely protected from proteolysis, since no cleavage product could be detected. As controls, the translation products of both precursors were treated with factor Xa and found to be equally susceptible to cleavage (Fig. 4B, lane 8). Two additional carboxyl-proximal sites were engineered at residues 11 (Fig. S3A) and 39 (Fig. 4C) of the mature OE17 domain. This region is reported by x-ray crystallography to be relatively unstructured, unresolved in one study and showing limited β structure in a second study (21Calderone V. Trabucco M. Vujicic A. Battistutta R. Giacometti G.M. Andreucci F. Barbato R. Zanotti G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Ristvejova J. Kopecky Jr., V. Sovova Z. Balsera M. Arellano J.B. Green M. Ettrich R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, and just like for the cryptic site, the two additional carboxylproximal sites of bound tOE17 were readily cleaved by factor Xa, whereas the same sites of V – 20F were essentially inaccessible (see Fig. 4D for IEGR39 and Fig. S3B for IEGR11). In order to determine the accessibility of the amino-proximal side of the signal peptide, iOE17 and iOE17V – 20F were engineered to contain a factor Xa cleavage site at position –30 (Fig. 5A). iOE17 is the natural intermediate of OE17, which is transiently present in the str"

It is known that leukocyte activation by chemoattractants, the change of osmotic pressure in cell media, or cross-linking of L-selectin all result in rapid shedding of L-selectin. Here we present a novel mechanism for surface cleavage of L-selectin on neutrophils during rolling on a sialyl Lewis x-coated surface that involves mechanical force. Flow cytometry and rolling of neutrophils labeled with Qdot®-L-selectin antibodies in an in vitro flow chamber showed that the mechanical shedding of L-selectin occurs during rolling and depends on the amount of shear applied. In addition, the mechanical L-selectin shedding causes an increase in cell rolling velocity with rolling duration, suggesting a gradual loss of L-selectin and is mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Thus, these data show that mechanical force induces the cleavage of L-selectin from the neutrophil surface during rolling and therefore decreases the adhesion of cells to a ligand-presenting surface in flow.

The initial capture and rolling of leukocytes on the endothelial wall is a key prerequisite step for successful firm adhesion and emigration into sites of inflammation and homing into lymph nodes in the case of lymphocytes (1.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6355) Google Scholar, 2.Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 3.McEver R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In tethering and subsequent rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium, L-selectin is a dominant mediator on the leukocyte surface. For instance, in L-selectin-deficient mice, leukocyte migration into the inflamed endothelial wall is severely attenuated, and lymphocyte migration into peripheral lymph nodes is virtually absent (4.Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Pizcueta P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 5.Steeber D.A. Green N.E. Sato S. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1096-1106PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to E- and P-selectin, which are expressed on activated endothelium, L-selectin is constitutively expressed at the tips of microvilli on leukocytes. L-selectin recognizes sulfated, sialylated, fucosylated, mucinous ligands such as Gly-CAM-1, CD34, and podocalyxin expressed on high endothelial venules in lymph nodes (6.Imai Y. Singer M.S.

L-selectin also binds PSGL-1, a sialomucin expressed broadly on the surface of leukocytes, causing secondary tethering via leukocyte-leukocyte interactions (10.Walcheck B. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Kishimoto T.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).

Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: S97-S103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three selectins recognize sLex, albeit with relatively low affinity (12.Varki A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: S31-S35PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its mechanical role in mediating the transient adhesion of leukocytes on the inflamed endothelium, L-selectin exerts an important role as a signal-transducing receptor, activating different biochemical pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (13.Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Smolen J.E. Petersen T.K. Koch C. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. Seo S. Pearson D. Fossett M.C. Simon S.I. J. Biol.

Unlike E- and P-selectin, L-selectin is rapidly cleaved from the cell surface in response to cellular activation and inflammatory stimuli (Table 1). As an indicator of activation-dependent down-regulation of L-selectin, a rapid increase in the surface expression of the Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) β2-integrin on leukocytes has been widely considered (15.Jutila M.A. Rott L.

For instance, PMA, LPS, FMLP, and other chemoattractants can induce the down-regulation of L-selectin from the cell surface (13.Fan H. Derynck R.

The studies of L-selectin shedding so far have been performed with induction and block of its cleavage using extracellular stimuli and TNF-α protease inhibitors (TAPIs), respectively. However, the experimental evidence for the mechanical force-induced down-regulation of L-selectin from leukocytes during the inflammation cascade under shear flow, and its effect on leukocyte adhesion dynamics has been lacking.TABLE 1Summary of various types of L-selectin sheddingTypeInduced byInhibited byIncrease in β2-integrin levelChemical stimulationPMA, LPS, FMLP, and chemotactic factors (15,17,25)TNF-α protease inhibitor (TAPI) {KD-IX-73-4 (TAPI-0) (29.Feehan C.

Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophils collected after rolling in this in vitro model indicated that a portion of neutrophils lost L-selectin from their surface while rolling. Direct measurement of mechanical shedding of L-selectin during rolling by labeling with Qdot®-conjugated anti-L-selectin antibody (Ab) showed that the Qdot® fluorescence intensity of neutrophils decreased after rolling on the substrate. Notably, we found that the instantaneous rolling velocity of neutrophils increased during rolling, implying the gradual loss of L-selectin. These and other cell dynamic data suggest that the mechanical shedding of L-selectin from neutrophils occurs during rolling and that it is shear- and TACE-dependent and regulated by p38 MAPK activation. We also demonstrate that this phenomenon increases the rolling velocity of leukocytes. Antibodies and Reagents−DREG-200 mouse mAb specific for human L-selectin, which partially blocks L-selectin adhesion function (25.Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Butcher E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2244-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 26.Fu H. Berg E.L. Tsurushita N. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 59: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Leu-8/TQ-1 (clone SK11) mouse mAb specific for human L-selectin from BD Biosciences. A hydroxamic acid-based L-selectin sheddase inhibitor, KD-IX-73-4 (TAPI-0) (Peptides International) and a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem) were purchased. Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS (Invitrogen), human serum albumin and low endotoxin (≤1 ng/mg) and essentially γ-globulin-free BSA (Sigma) were purchased. Neutrophil Isolation−Human blood was obtained via veni-puncture from healthy adult donors and collected into a sterile tube containing sodium heparin (BD Biosciences) after informed consent was obtained. Neutrophils were then isolated by centrifugation (480 × g for 50 min at 23 °C) with 1-Step™ Polymorphs (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Co.). After isolation, neutrophils were kept in a 0.5% solution of BSA in low endotoxin (< 0.03 EU/ml) HBSS containing 2 mm Ca2+, 10 mm HEPES, at pH 7.4. For the inhibition of L-selectin shedding or p38 MAPK signaling cascade, 25 or 30 μm KD-IX-73-4 or 100 nm SB203580 was added to the cell solution. Flow Chamber Assay−Circular and rectangular parallel-plate flow chambers (Glycotech) were used in flow experiments. Lower surfaces of the flow chambers were coated with 50–200 μg/ml of NeutrAvidin™ biotin-binding protein (Pierce) for 30 min. The surfaces were then washed with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. 4 μg/ml of multivalent sLex-PAA-biotin (Glycotech) were applied to the surfaces and allowed to bind the NeutrAvidin™ coated surfaces for 2 h. The surfaces were then blocked for nonspecific adhesion with 2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. For the preparation of the BSA-coated surfaces, the lower surface of the flow chamber was coated with 2% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. The flow chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope, Olympus IX81 (Olympus America Inc.), and neutrophil solutions were perfused into the chamber using a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems Inc.) at different flow rates. For tracking individual rolling cells in Fig. 5, a Proscan™II motorized stage (Prior) was used with the constant translational velocity predetermined. Data Acquisition and Cell Tracking−A microscope-linked Hitachi CCD camera KP-M1AN (Hitachi, Japan) was used for neutrophil rolling events with adhesive sLex substrates. Rolling of neutrophils on sLex was recorded on high quality VCR tapes for cell tracking analyses. Cell rolling videos were digitized to 640 × 480 pixels at 30 fps with Scion image v 1.63 with Frame Grabber (CG-7; Scion Co.). Rolling flux measurements and rolling velocities of neutrophils interacting with sLex were then acquired using a computer-tracking program coded in MAT-LAB 7.0.1 (R14) (Mathworks). To determine the rolling flux, the definition of a rolling cell must first be established. A cell was counted as rolling if it rolled for >2 s while remaining in the field of view (432 × 324 μm2 using a 20× objective (NA, 0.40; Type, Plan Fluorite; Olympus America Inc.)) and if it translated at an average velocity less than 50% of the calculated free stream velocity of a non-interacting cell. The free stream velocity was calculated using the theory of Goldman et al. (27.Goldman A.J. Cox R.G. Brenner H. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1967; 22: 653-660Crossref Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy−DREG-200 and Leu-8/TQ-1 mAb were conjugated with Qdot®605 using a Qdot®Ab conjugation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells and BSA- and sLex-coated surfaces were labeled with Qdot®-conjugated Abs (0.5–1 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C. To observe the fluorescence intensity of L-selectin on neutrophils in static and shear applied conditions, cells in the flow chamber were imaged by fluorescence microscopy using the Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a 40× objective (NA = 0.60; Type, Plan Fluorite; Olympus America Inc.), 1.6× magnification changer engaged, and an excitation filter appropriate for Qdot®605. Images were captured with a Cooke SensiCam QE (Tech Imaging Services) and IPLab v3.9.4 r3 (Scanalytics). All fluorescent images were analyzed using IPLab (for measuring immunofluorescence intensities in Fig. 6C) and processed using ImageJ v 1.34s (NIH) including the surface plots in the middle and lower panels of Fig. 6B. Flow Cytometry−For measuring anti-L-selectin antibody binding capacity (ABC) on the neutrophil surface, cells were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with DREG56-FITC mAb (20 μl/5×105 cells; Beckman Coulter) before fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde. As the ABC standard, 50,000 microbeads of each of the four standard beads (Quantum Flow Cytometry Standards Corp.) were labeled with the DREG56-FITC. Labeled cells and beads were analyzed with an ELITE FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Flow cytometry data (.LMD files) were converted to text files using WinMDI v 2.8 (Joseph Trotter, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) and two-dimensional histograms with the addition of contour plots were based on the algorithm of smoothed densities (28.Eilers P.H. Goeman J.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ELISA of sL-selectin−sL-selectin was measured using an ELISA kit (R&D systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mechanical Shedding of L-selectin Occurs during Rolling in Vitro−We initially analyzed the rolling of neutrophils on a sLex-coated surface under shear flow with and without the addition of 25 or 30 μm KD-IX-73-4, in vitro using a parallel plate flow chamber. KD-IX-73-4 is a hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor that can block L-selectin shedding from the cell surface (29.Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two different wall shear stresses were tested: 1.5 dyn/cm2, which is the wall shear stress at which maximal rolling flux is observed, and 4 dyn/cm2, at which we (and others) observe a sharp drop in the number of rolling cells in a rolling flux analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). The number of rolling cells at 4 dyn/cm2 significantly increased with the addition of the hydroxamic acid-based protease inhibitor (Fig. 1A), whereas the average rolling velocity decreased. These findings imply that L-selectin shedding occurs during rolling and affects the rolling dynamics of neutrophils in vitro. To our knowledge, previous studies of L-selectin shedding on leukocytes have been performed with the activation of leukocytes induced by inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or FMLP to induce L-selectin cleavage, except in L-selectin cross-linking experiments that did not test adhesive function (13.Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Palecanda A. Walcheck B. Bishop D.K. Jutila M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17.Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). We propose here that L-selectin on leukocytes can be shed during the rolling process on a ligand-bearing substrate under physiological shear flow without external biochemical activation. Neutrophils were perfused at different flow rates over BSA or sLex in a parallel-plate flow chamber to investigate the effect of neutrophil rolling on L-selectin shedding from the cell surface in vitro. On the BSA-coated surface, cells flowing over the surface did not tether and roll. However, cells were observed to roll on the sLex-coated surface. After the flow chamber experiments, cells were collected, and labeled with FITC-conjugated DREG-56 Ab to quantify the surface L-selectin left on the cells using flow cytometry. Note that it is estimated from numerical simulations that over 90% of perfused neutrophils do not contact the lower surface of the flow chamber hydrodynamically, implying that the majority of cells pass through the flow chamber without engaging in rolling interactions. It is very difficult to separate the cells that roll on a ligand-coated surface from the rest of the cell population. Despite this technical limitation, we found that a measurable fraction of neutrophils lost most of their surface L-selectin after rolling on the sLex-coated surface (Fig. 2, B and C). In the lower fluorescence region (fluorescence intensity of FITC-DREG-56 on neutrophils <1), a new population of cells was formed in the two-dimensional histogram (28.Eilers P.H. Goeman J.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was no significant change in the amount of surface L-selectin on cells after flowing over the BSA surface (Fig. 2, D and E). We further tested KD-IX-73-4 to determine whether the mechanical L-selectin shedding depends on the metalloprotease (Fig. 2F). We found that the mechanical shedding of L-selectin was blocked by the sheddase inhibitor and thus is metalloprotease-dependent. We further quantified the percentage of neutrophils that lost most of their L-selectin after flow chamber experiments by expressing the lower fluorescence population as a percentage of the total. The percentage of neutrophils without L-selectin increased only in the two sets obtained from cells rolling on the sLex-coated surface in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 2G). To address how much total L-selectin was shed during rolling, we measured ABC on the neutrophils using standard beads. Loss of FITC-DREG-56 ABC (ABClost) on neutrophils was calculated as the difference in mean ABC between cells in static condition and cells after rolling on a sLex-surface at 1.5 and 4 dyn/cm2. We then divided the loss of ABC by the rolling flux, because rolling flux sharply decreases with increasing shear stress. The value is 3.09 ± 2.15 at 1.5 dyn/cm2 and 19.80 ± 9.71 ABClost/rolling flux at 4 dyn/cm2 (mean ± S.E.; n = 4; p = 0.04 from a paired and one-tailed Student’s t test), respectively. Notably, we found that the ABClost after cell rolling depends strongly on the shear stress applied. These results collectively suggest that L-selectin shedding from neutrophils occurs mechanically during rolling and that it is both shear- and sheddase-dependent. L-selectin Shed during Rolling Exists Both in the Solution and on the sLex Surface−To address where L-selectin shed by mechanical contact with surface-immobilized sLex is located, we used an ELISA to detect soluble L-selectin in the supernatant collected from flow chamber experiments. Upon proteolysis of L-selectin, a soluble form of the receptor is released from the cell surface, the levels of which can be quantitated by ELISA analysis (30.Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consistent with the flow cytometry data, neutrophil rolling on a sLex surface induced L-selectin shedding and produced a larger amount of soluble L-selectin in the solution (Fig. 3A). We reconfirmed by ELISA that mechanical shedding of L-selectin induced by rolling is shear- and sheddase-dependent. We later labeled the BSA- and sLex-coated surfaces with Qdot®-conjugated anti-L-selectin mAb (Leu-8/TQ1) to investigate whether a fraction of the L-selectin shed during rolling also remains detectable on the ligand-bearing surface. The fluorescence intensity of the sLex surface increased considerably compared with that of the BSA surface (Fig. 3B). These results collectively suggest that L-selectin cleaved from the neutrophil surface because of mechanical shedding exists both in the solution and bound to its ligand. p38 MAPK Activation Alters Neutrophil Dynamics in Vitro and Mediates Mechanical Shedding of L-selectin−The inflammatory mediator-induced shedding of L-selectin on neutrophils is inhibited by a p38 MAPK inhibitor (18.Rizoli S.B. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22072-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), indicating that the p38 MAPK pathway is a mechanism to induce the shedding of L-selectin on neutrophils. We explored the effect of a p38 MAPK inhibitor on the rolling dynamics of neutrophils at 4 dyn/cm2 in vitro. With the addition of 100 nm SB203580, there was a significant increase in rolling flux and a decrease in rolling velocity (Fig. 4). To gain further insights into L-selectin-mediated neutrophil dynamics involved in mechanical shedding of L-selectin, we next focused on the surface L-selectin left on neutrophils using flow cytometry. The mechanical shedding of L-selectin during rolling at 4 dyn/cm2 was completely blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor (data not shown). These results showed that neutrophil rolling in vitro is altered by the inhibition of p38 MAPK, consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical L-selectin shedding on neutrophils is mediated by p38 MAPK activation. Neutrophil Rolling Velocity Increases during Rolling−We next explored the effect of mechanical L-selectin shedding on the instantaneous rolling dynamics of neutrophils in vitro. First, we anticipated that rolling velocity would increase during rolling as the amount of surface L-selectin decreased because of mechanical shedding. 79 rolling cells were tracked from the initiation of rolling to the end of rolling within a long flow chamber. Unexpectedly, rolling velocity seemed to decrease with rolling duration upon initial analysis (Fig. 5A). However, we also found that most cells rolled for a short time and then detached from the sLex-coated surface as shown in Fig. 5B. Data were thus divided into five smaller subsets depending on the rolling duration and each subset plotted individually to show the mean rolling velocity every 2 s (Fig. 5, C and D). When analyzed in this manner, we found that the rolling velocity of neutrophils on a sLex-coated surface increases with rolling duration for the cells with short rolling duration as originally suspected. As implied by Fig. 5C, the majority of rolling cells (88%) rapidly lose their surface L-selectin while rolling, and as a result, cannot sustain continuous rolling and detach to join the free stream. Note that this experiment was performed at a shear stress of 4 dyn/cm2, at which rolling flux drops sharply. Thus, when binning all of the data together, the mean rolling population continuously shifts toward the most strongly adherent cells, obscuring the trans"
https://openalex.org/W2037385179,"The B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 11B gene (BCL11B) encodes a Krüppel-like zinc-finger protein, which plays a crucial role in thymopoiesis and has been associated with hematopoietic malignancies. It was hypothesized that BCL11B may act as a tumor-suppressor gene, but its precise function has not yet been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the survival of human T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines is critically dependent on Bcl11b. Suppression of Bcl11b by RNA interference selectively induced apoptosis in transformed T cells whereas normal mature T cells remained unaffected. The apoptosis was effected by simultaneous activation of death receptor-mediated and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, most likely as a result of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upregulation and suppression of the Bcl-xL antiapoptotic protein. Our data indicate an antiapoptotic function of Bcl11b. The resistance of normal mature T lymphocytes to Bcl11b suppression-induced apoptosis and restricted expression pattern make it an attractive therapeutic target in T-cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1993844758,"We recently discovered a novel signaling phenomenon involving a rapid and transient rise in intracellular low molecular weight iron complex(es) in activation of IκB kinase (IKK) in hepatic macrophages. We also showed direct treatment with ferrous iron substitutes for this event to activate IKK. The present study used this model to identify upstream kinases responsible for IKK activation. IKK activation induced by iron is abrogated by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant (DN) for transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), NF-κB-inducing kinase, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and by treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase-1 (MEK1) inhibitor. Iron increases AKT phosphorylation that is prevented by DNTAK1 or DNp21ras. Iron causes ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is attenuated by DN-PI3K, prevented by DNp21ras, but unaffected by DNTAK1. Iron-induced TAK1 activity is not affected by the PI3K or MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting TAK1 is upstream of PI3K and MEK1. Iron increases interactions of TAK1 and PI3K with p21ras as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization of these proteins with caveolin-1 as shown by immunofluorescent microscopy. Finally, filipin III, a caveolae inhibitor, abrogates iron-induced TAK1 and IKK activation.

A. 2005; 102: 1906-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and the ability of this protein to bind to ferroportin for its internalization and degradation and consequently to reduce export of cellular iron (8Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Conversely, iron loading causes chronic tissue damage and inflammation. The most prevalent hypothesis for this causal link has been that the iron-catalyzed Fenton pathway generates a hydroxyl radical and causes oxidative tissue injury. However, emerging evidence indicates that the effects of iron may be more complex and intricate than simple oxidant injury and involve molecular mechanisms by which expression of proinflammatory cytokines is induced by enhanced iron-dependent signaling. To this end, we have demonstrated a novel signaling event of a transient rise in intracellular low molecular weightiron complex(es) in 2 min after the treatment of cultured hepatic macrophages (HM) 2The abbreviations used are: HM, hepatic macrophage; TAK1, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MAPK, mitogen-activating protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; DN, dominant negative; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (9Xiong S.

This unique event precedes and is required for activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB (9Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17646-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increase in intracellular non-heme iron store caused by a mutation in natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-1 results in coordinated accentuation of the low molecular weight-iron complex(es) response, IKK and NF-κB activation, and TNFα release in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (9Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17646-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the direct treatment with iron causes within 2 min an immediate and maximal quenching of RAW264.7 cells loaded with an iron-sensitive fluorescent probe, suggesting an immediate uptake of iron by the cells (10Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Immunology. 1999; 96: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Addition of ferrous sulfate (5–50 μm) to cultured HM activates IKK but not JNK (11She H. Xiong S. Lin M. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G719-G726Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the low molecular weight-iron complex(es) response induced by a ligand-receptor interaction is substituted for by exogenous ferrous iron in transducing signals to activate IKK in primary cultures of HM. IKK plays a central role in a classical activation pathway of NF-κB through phosphorylation of IκB for subsequent polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (see Ref. 12Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar for review). Three IKK subunits have been identified, IKKα and IKKβ as catalytic subunits and IKKγ as a regulatory unit. The most common form of IKK is composed of a heterodimer of IKKα and IKKβ bound to a dimer of IKKγ. IKK activation occurs when IKKβ is phosphorylated by mechanisms that appear to involve upstream kinases recruited by IKKγ. This phosphorylation triggers intra- and intermolecular trans-phosphorylation of IKK subunits. Much research has been done to identify these upstream kinases. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 are shown to directly interact with and activate IKK (13Lin X. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Mu Y. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIK mediates IKK activation by double-stranded RNA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase (16Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Other MAP3Ks, such as MEKK2 and MEKK3, are also shown to induce IKK activation (17Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Survival signaling is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) via NF-κB-dependent and -independent mechanisms in many cell types (18Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), including macrophages (19Liu H. Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conflicting results are available for the role of PI3-kinase pathway in regulation of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory gene expression. Inhibitors for PI3-kinase are shown to enhance (LPS)-induced expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages (20Park Y.C. Lee C.H. Kang H.S. Chung H.T. Kim H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and activation of PI3K conversely inhibits iNOS expression in glial cells (21Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This negative regulation may be because of interference of LPS-induced MAPK pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and JNK with PI3-kinase pathway (22Guha M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32124-32132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In contrast, opposing results are also available. PI3-kinase is shown to phosphorylate and increase transactivation activity of p65 (23Thomas K.W. Monick M.M. Staber J.M. Yarovinsky T. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 492-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a constitutively active AKT enhances NF-κB-dependent gene expression via IKK activation in fibroblasts (24Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and a dominant negative mutant of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase blocks TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression (25Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The present study has investigated upstream kinases that are required for iron-induced IKK activation in HM. The use of dominant negative mutants (DN) and pharmacological inhibitors for potential upstream effector molecules demonstrated that multiple kinases, including MEK1, NIK, TAK1, and PI3K, are required for ferrous iron to activate IKK in HM. Further, TAK1 PI3K and p21ras are shown to physically interact in caveolae to initiate iron-induced signaling. Materials—RAW264.7 cells employed in this study were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Fetal bovine serum, ferrous sulfate, LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5), filipin III, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Adenoviral vectors Ad.DNTAK1, Ad.DNNIK, Ad.DNPI3K expressing DN mutants of TAK1 (K63W), NIK, and PI3K (Δp85) were obtained from Dr. David A. Brenner (Columbia University Medical Center, New York), and Ad.DNp21ras was given by Dr. L. F. Parada (University of Taxes Southwestern Medical Center). Antibodies against p-AKT and p-p44/p42 ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against p85α, TAK1, AKT, p21ras, and IKKα/β were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LY294002, U0126, and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem. Pronase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad. ECL kit was obtained from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. Iron chelators 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (L1) and N,N′-bis-2-hydrobenzylethlenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid were generous gifts from Dr. Gary Brittenham (College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University). Cell Preparation—HM were isolated from male Wistar rats by the Non-parenchymal Liver Cell Core of the Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases as previously published (4Tsukamoto H. Lin M. Ohata M. Giulivi C. French S.W. Brittenham G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1240-G1250PubMed Google Scholar, 9Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C.

Physiol. 2002; 283: G719-G726Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was digested in situ by sequential perfusion with pronase and collagenase, and non-parenchymal liver cells were fractionated by discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation using arabinogalactan. An HM-enriched fraction was further purified by the adherence method to achieve a final purity exceeding 95%. After 3 days of culture, the cells were treated with LPS (100 or 500 ng/ml) or ferrous sulfate (50 μm) in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in the presence or absence of various inhibitors as described below and subsequently subjected to collection of cell lysate for IKK and TAK1 assays and immunoblot analysis. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. IKK and TAK1 Assays—To assay the activity of IKK or TAK1, HM cultured in a 100-mm dish were treated with ferrous sulfate (50 μm) or LPS (500 ng/ml) for 30 min in the presence and absence of the iron chelators or inhibitors, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors, 300 mm NaCl, and 1.5% Triton X-100). The lysates were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until assayed. After infection with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative mutant of TAK1, NIK, PI3K, or p21ras, HM were treated with FeSO4 to test their effects on iron-induced IKK and TAK1 activities. IKK activity was determined as previously described (9Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17646-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK was immunoprecipitated with IKKα/β antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. The assay was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IκBα, and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi). The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphate incorporated into GST-IκBα was visualized by analyzing the membrane with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For TAK1 assay, the identical procedure was performed except for the use of anti-TAK1 antibody and GST-MKK6 (Chemico) as a substrate. For the treatment with superoxide dismutase, 5 min before iron treatment superoxide dismutase was added to the HM culture at the concentration of 150 μg/ml. Immunoblot Analysis, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—For immunoblot analysis, cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously reported (9Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17646-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11She H. Xiong S. Lin M. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G719-G726Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with different antibodies, and detected by chemiluminescence. For co-immunoprecipitation analysis for TAK1, p21ras, and p85α, cell lysate was first immunoprecipitated with antibody against p21ras (or p85 α), the immune complex was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and the membrane was incubated with anti-TAK1 and p85α (or p21ras). The release of TNFα by iron-treated HM was examined by using a commercially available mouse TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—The HM were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in cold methanol for 20 min at -20 °C after cultivation and iron/L1 treatment. After three washes the cells were permeabilized by incubation with cold 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After treatment with blocking solution containing 5% nonfat milk for 60 min, the staining was performed by incubation of 1:200 dilution of antibody against p21ras or p85α in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times for 5 min each. The cells were then incubated with the second antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluora488 or rhodamine for 2 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml) for 10 min after three washes. The cells were viewed using a Nikon microscope equipped with a digital camera. For triple immunostaining, mouse anti-p85α antibody (1:200 dilution), goat anti-TAK1 (1:200 dilution), and rabbit anti-caveolin1 (1:100 dilution) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. As the secondary antibodies, AlexaFluora350-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-goat IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were used. The immunofluorescence-stained HM were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 equipped with lasers of argon, HeNel, HeNe2, and titanium and the appropriate filters for detection of fluorescence from AlexaFluora350, fluorescein isothiocyanate, or rhodamine. Iron Chelators Block Iron-induced IKK Activity—We first validated iron-induced IKK activation in cultured rat HM. As shown in Fig. 1, the treatment with iron sulfate (50 μm) clearly increases IKK activity at 30 min (lane 2). This effect is completely abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with L1 or N,N′-bis-2-hydrobenzylethlenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid, a bidentate or hexadentate iron chelator (lanes 3 and 4). Iron-induced IKK Activity and TNFα Expression Are Mediated by TAK1, NIK, PI3K, and MEK1—To test whether TAK1, NIK, or PI3K is involved in mediating iron-induced IKK activation, we used an adenoviral vector expressing a DN mutant of each kinase and a green fluorescent protein-expressing vector as a control. Transduction of each DN at m.o.i. of 50 completely prevents iron-induced IKK activation (Fig. 2, A–C). Furthermore, use of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 results in similar abrogation of IKK activation (Fig. 2D). Addition of U0126, the MEK1 inhibitor, also prevents IKK activation whereas SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, does not suppress but rather promotes IKK activity (Fig. 2D). These results suggest the involvement of TAK1, NIK, PI3K, and MEK1 in iron-induced IKK activation. The observed enhancement of IKK activity with the p38 MAPK inhibitor may be because of an inhibitory effect of this MAPK on MEK1/2 via PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation (26Li S.P. Junttila M.R. Han J. Kahari V.M. Westermarck J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3473-3477PubMed Google Scholar, 27Grethe S. Porn-Ares M.I. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine whether these effects on IKK activation are translated into a downstream biological event, we measured iron-induced release of TNFα by HM with or without vector-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of the upstream kinases. Iron stimulates the release of TNFα by 10-fold and this effect is largely, if not completely, blocked by a DN of TAK1, or PI3K, or by the use of the PI3K and MEK inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 (Fig. 2E). DNNIK only partially prevents TNFα release. Iron Induces Phosphorylation of ERK and PI3K—We next examined the relationship between MEK1 and PI3K in iron-induced signaling. Addition of ferrous sulfate induces AKT phosphorylation as effectively as the treatment with LPS, demonstrating PI3K activation by iron (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). Iron chelator L1 largely blocks this effect (lane 3). AKT phosphorylation is, as expected, prevented with LY294002 (lane 5) but not with U0126 (lane 6). SB203580 has no effect on AKT phosphorylation (lane 7). We also examined ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a downstream target of MEK1. Iron clearly induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and this is blocked by the iron chelator. As expected, U0126 blocks ERK phosphorylation (lane 6). LY294002 mildly suppresses iron-induced ERK phosphorylation (lane 5), whereas SB203580 enhances it (lane 7). These results suggest that MEK1 is not involved in iron-induced PI3K activity in HM. They also suggest that iron-induced ERK phosphorylation is enhanced by PI3K but inhibited by p38 MAPK. The latter corroborates the observed enhancement of IKK activity by SB203580 and again may be caused by MEK1 dephosphorylation by p38 MAPK as discussed above. TAK1 and p21ras Are Involved in Iron-induced PI3K Activity in HM—NIK has been shown to be downstream of TAK1 in interleukin 1-induced signaling (28Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between PI3K and TAK1 in IKK activation is not fully known. Thus, we examined whether PI3K activation is dependent on TAK1 activity in our model of iron-induced IKK activation. To this end, we assessed iron-induced AKT phosphorylation without or with transduction of DNTAK1. AKT phosphorylation is induced by iron in the cells infected with the green fluorescent protein control vector (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Transduction of DNTAK1 prevents this effect as effectively as DNPI3K expression (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–6). This result suggests that TAK1 is involved in iron-induced PI3K activity. We also examined the effect of DNp21ras on AKT phosphorylation and IKK activation because this GTPase was previously shown to be activated by reactive free radicals (28Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 29Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and to physically interact with PI3K (31Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Infection with a viral vector expressing DNp21ras also blocks AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8) and IKK activation in iron-treated HM (Fig. 3C, lane 4). These data collectively suggest that TAK1 and p21ras are involved in iron-induced PI3K activity. Using the same blot, we assessed ERK phosphorylation. As shown in the two lower panels of Fig. 3B, iron-induced ERK phosphorylation is ameliorated by DNPI3K much like the effect of LY294002 (Fig. 3A). DNTAK1 has no effect on iron-induced ERK phosphorylation, but DNp21ras prevents this signaling event. These results suggest that iron-induced MAPK signaling via MEK1/ERK requires p21ras, but not TAK1, and is positively regulated by PI3K. Next, we examined whether iron-induced TAK1 activity is affected by the PI3K or MEK inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3D, iron induces TAK1 activity as determined by phosphorylation of GST-MMK6 but this induction is not influenced by either LY294002 or U0126, suggesting TAK1 activity is upstream of PI3K and MEK1. We also tested whether iron-induced TAK and IKK activation and ERK and AKT phosphorylation are dependent on generation of superoxide anion. For this, we added superoxide dismutase to the HM culture. This treatment indeed attenuates iron-induced TAK1 and IKK activities and ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). TAK1 and p21ras Physically Interact with PI3K in Iron-stimulated HM—In light of the previous report on a physical interaction between p21ras and PI3K (31Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), our observation of the involvement of TAK1 and p21ras in PI3K activation suggests that TAK1 may also interact with PI3K along with p21ras in iron-stimulated HM. This notion was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell lysate from iron-treated HM was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p21ras antibody, and the immune complex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against TAK1 or the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 4A, iron treatment increases TAK1 association with p21ras (upper panel) and p85α behaves similarly (lower panel). Conversely, immunoprecipitation was performed with an antibody against p85α regulatory subunit and the complex was immunoblotted with an anti-TAK1 or anti-p21ras antibody. Iron indeed increases interactions of TAK1 and p21ras to the p85α regulatory subunit (Fig. 4B). Iron treatment does not alter the level of p21ras or p85α (Fig. 4, A and B, lowest panels). These results demonstrate both TAK1 and p21ras physically interact with PI3K in iron-stimulated HM. To demonstrate co-localization of p21ras and p85α in iron-treated HM, the cells were immunostained with the respective antibodies for p21ras and PI3K and examined under fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A, p85α and p21ras begin to co-localize in small punctate structures at 5 min after addition of iron. At 15 min, this process is clearly induced and numerous co-localization sites are observed. At 30 min, co-localization staining becomes larger and globular. Pretreatment with L1 abolishes this co-localization phenomenon (data not shown). We then performed triple immunostaining for TAK1, p21ras, and caveolin-1, a marker for caveolae, and examined it under confocal microscopy. This staining indeed reveals co-localization of three proteins following iron treatment (Fig. 5B). These results support physical interactions between TAK1, PI3K, and p21ras and co-localization of these three effectors in caveolae. Caveolae Inhibitor Blocks Iron-induced IKK and TAK1 Activities—Finally, we examined whether inhibition of caveolae formation, which would theoretically prevent recruitment and interactions of TAK1, PI3K, and p21ras, prevents iron-induced TAK1 and IKK activation. For this experiment, we used filipin III, which selectively binds cholesterol and inhibits caveolae formation (32Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Indeed, this treatment completely abrogates iron-induced IKK and TAK1 activity (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that caveolae facilitate the formation of the functional signaling complex of TAK, p21ras, and PI3K for iron-induced IKK activation. Indeed, iron-induced AKT phosphorylation is also suppressed by filipin III but ERK phosphorylation is only partially inhibited. Redox-mediated signal transduction and the roles of free radicals as intracellular messengers have long been recognized (see Ref. 33Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar for review). One of the most classical examples of the involvement of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species is signaling induced by growth factors. Upon binding of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin to respective receptors, their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity increases and recruits via SH-2 containing docking proteins (e.g. Shc), adaptor molecules such as GRB2 pre-associated with a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS. This results in activation of p21ras and the well known Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway. The tyrosine kinase receptor also binds the SH-2 domain in the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and activates the PI3K via p21ras. Thus, p21ras serves as the convergent point for the Ras-Raf-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways (31Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is this convergent point that reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species were suggested to act to trigger signals. Indeed, our results on iron-induced signaling demonstrate activation of both Ras-MEK1-ERK1/2 and Ras-PI3-AKT pathways with p21ras as a convergent point (Fig. 3A). Further, our study reveals the first evidence for the interactions by TAK1 with p21ras and PI3K (Fig. 4, A and B). This physical association is considered to be important because TAK1 plays a role in iron-induced AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) as previously observed for LPS-induced protein kinase B/AKT activation (34Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, TAK1 association with p21ras appears to have no significance in the Ras-MAPK pathway because TAK1 has no role in iron-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) as also shown in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells (34Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although iron-induced AKT phosphorylation is dependent on TAK1 activity (Fig. 3B), TAK1 activity is not affected by PI3K inhibition (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that TAK1 is upstream of PI3K. Our results also demonstrate the involvement of both TAK1 and NIK in iron-induced activation. TAK1 was previously shown to phosphorylate and activate NIK in interleukin 1-induced IKK activation (28Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Whether the same signaling cascade takes place in iron-induced IKK activation needs to be addressed in our future study. Reactive free radicals activate p21ras (29Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), and Cys-118 that is located within the highly conserved GTP-binding site is believed to be a critical site for this redox regulation (35Lander H.M.

S-nitrosylation of Cys-118 represents a well known post-translational modification that causes guanine nucleotide exchange and consequent activation of p21ras (29Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and recruitment of PI3K (31Deora A.A. Win T. Vanhaesebroeck B. Lander H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29923-29928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). S-nitrosylation involves transfer of nitrosonium (NO+) to a SH group, and iron catalyzes conversion of NO to NO+ (36Stojanovic S. Stanic D. Nikolic M. Spasic M. Niketic V. Nitric Oxide. 2004; 11: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because signaling induced by addition of ferrous sulfate is immediate (5–15 min) as judged by co-localization of the effector proteins (Fig. 5A) and activation of IKK (11She H. Xiong S. Lin M. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G719-G726Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), NO must be constitutively released to participate in this proposed mechanism. Use of the cells transduced with a C118S p21ras mutant should allow testing the role of Cys-118. Our results also demonstrate the role of superoxide anion (O¯·2) as superoxide dismutase attenuates iron-induced TAK1 and IKK activities. It is yet to be known whether O¯·2 is a direct effector reactive oxygen species or works with reactive nitrogen species to initiate iron-induced signaling. Our results also highlight the importance of caveolae as a site of iron-induced signal transduction involving the p21ras/PI3K/TAK1 interactions. Caveolin-1, the marker for caveolae, co-localizes with TAK1 and p85α subunit of PI3K (Fig. 5B), and filipin III, an inhibitor for caveolae formation, completely abrogates iron-induced TAK1 and IKK activation (Fig. 6). Caveolae are plasma membrane microdomains that play pivotal roles in cellular signal transduction besides clathrin-independent endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and regulation of calcium flux to name a few (see Ref. 37Krajewska W.M. Maslowska I. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2004; 9: 195-220PubMed Google Scholar for review). This multifunctional organelle is known to house many signaling components, including tyrosine kinase receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor), non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (Src, Fak, Fyn), GTPases, phospholipases C and D, and protein kinases A and C. Thus, our finding of co-localization of TAK/PI3K/p21ras in caveolae may not be surprising. However, the fact that the different types of nitric-oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase are also localized in caveolae supports a notion that this organelle provides an ideal microenvironment for iron-catalyzed signaling involving reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, p21ras, TAK, and PI3K. In summary, we demonstrate that ionic iron activates IKK in hepatic macrophages through mechanisms involving collective actions of p21ras, PI3K, TAK1, NIK, and MEK1. Iron stimulates interactions of p21ras with PI3K and TAK in caveolae to initiate some of these signals, and p21ras appears to serve as a convergent point for iron-induced activation of both MAPK and PI3K pathways."

We purified several acetylated proteins by the affinity to an anti-acetylated lysine (AcLys) antibody from cells treated with TSA and identified them by mass spectrometry. Here we report on acetylation of CFIm25, a component of mammalian cleavage factor Im (CF Im), and poly(A) polymerase (PAP), a polyadenylating enzyme for the pre-mRNA 3′-end. The residues acetylated in these proteins were mapped onto the regions required for interaction with each other. Whereas CBP acetylated these proteins, HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC10, SIRT1, and SIRT2 were involved in in vivo deacetylation. Acetylation of the CFIm25 occurred depending on the cleavage factor complex formation. Importantly, the interaction between PAP and CF Im complex was decreased by acetylation. We also demonstrated that acetylation of PAP inhibited the nuclear localization of PAP by inhibiting the binding to the importin α/β complex. These results suggest that CBP and HDACs regulate the 3′-end processing machinery and modulate the localization of PAP through the acetylation and deacetylation cycle.

These results suggest that CBP and HDACs regulate the 3′-end processing machinery and modulate the localization of PAP through the acetylation and deacetylation cycle. Eukaryotic mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) are synthesized and processed in the nucleus prior to their export to the cytoplasm. Transcription is thought to be coupled spatially and temporally to the capping of the pre-mRNA at the 5′-end, splicing, and 3′-end formation (1.Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 2.Proudfoot N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mature 3′-ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail to the upstream cleavage product. In mammals, these reactions are catalyzed by a large multicomponent complex that is assembled in a cooperative manner. The cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 2The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; PAP, poly(A) polymerase; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase.2The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; PAP, poly(A) polymerase; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase. recognizes the highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA, whereas the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) binds to GU- or U-rich elements downstream of the poly(A) site. In addition, the cleavage reaction requires mammalian cleavage factor I (CF Im), cleavage factor IIm (CF IIm), and poly(A) polymerase (PAP). After the first step of 3′-end processing, CPSF remains bound to the upstream cleavage fragment and tethers PAP to the 3′-end of the pre-mRNA. In the presence of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1), PAP elongates the poly(A) tail (reviewed in Ref. 3.Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage factor Im (CF Im) is a heterodimer composed of a 25-kDa small subunit and one of the 59-, 68-, and 72-kDa large subunits, which is required for the first step in pre-mRNA 3′-end processing (4.Ruegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The complex containing 25 and 68 kDa subunits has been shown to be sufficient for the in vitro CFIm activity (5.Ruegsegger U. Blank D. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The binding of CF Im to the pre-mRNA is thought to be one of the earliest steps in the assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery and facilitates the recruitment of other processing factors. For example, it has been shown that the N-terminal region of CFIm25 was responsible for the interaction with the C-terminal region of PAP (6.Kim H. Lee Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PAP is a key protein in the pre-mRNA 3′-end processing reaction in mammals because PAP catalytically participates in the polyadenylation reaction of pre-mRNA. PAP adds the poly(A) tails of 200–250 residues at the specific sites of pre-mRNAs introduced by CPSF, CstF, CF Im, and CF IIm. The catalytic function of PAP resides in its N-terminal region, which has a sequence similarity with a nucleotidyl transferase family. The C-terminal region carries an RNA binding region, two nuclear localization signals (NLS1 and NLS2), and a serine/threonine-rich region. The activity of PAP is regulated by phosphorylation during the cell cycle (7.Zhao W. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5010-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine-rich domain of PAP is responsible for the regulation by phosphorylation. The C-terminal region of PAP is also involved in the coupling of splicing and polyadenylation via protein-protein interactions with splicing factors U1A and U2AF65. The C-terminal region of PAP can also serve as a target of other regulatory proteins for protein-protein interactions such as CFIm25 and PABPN1 (6.Kim H. Lee Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8.Dettwiler S. Aringhieri C. Cardinale S. Keller W. Barabino S.M. J. Biol.

Acetylation of not only histones but also these non-histone proteins are controlled by two enzyme families histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and deacetylases (HDAC). Treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors such as TSA have been shown to accumulate the acetylated proteins by blocking the in vivo deacetylation of these proteins. During the course of our screening for novel acetylated protein using TSA, we identified CFIm25 as a 25-kDa acetylated protein. In addition, PAP that interacts with CFIm25 was also found to be acetylated and deacetylated by the same enzyme set as that for CFIm25. Functional analysis suggests that interaction between these proteins and/or localization of PAP is regulated by an acetylation/deacetylation cycle. These results provide a new insight into the role of protein acetylation in not only transcriptional initiation and elongation but also termination.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with each plasmid using the Lipofectamine2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For siRNA knockdown of CFIm68, COS-7 cells were transfected with CFIm68 siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, cat. 012334) using a DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). Mass Spectrometry−Following Coomassie Blue staining, bands corresponding to the CFIm25 or PAP were excised, and the gel pieces were destained with 50% CH3CN in 50 mm NH4HCO3 solution. After removal of the supernatant, cysteine residues were reduced with dithiothreitol, carbamidomethylated with IAA, and the proteins were digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic peptides were recovered by sequentially adding 50% CH3CN/1% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% HCOOH/25% CH3CN/15% i-PrOH, and 80% CH3CN solutions. The supernatants were collected and pooled into one tube, reducing the volume in vacuo. The dried tryptic peptides were suspended in 2% CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to the following LC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was accomplished with the MAGIC 2002 HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, CA). Peptide samples were loaded onto a Cadenza C18 custom-packed column (0.2 × 50 mm, Michrom BioResources, Inc.), and eluted using a linear gradient of 5–60% CH3CN in 0.1% HCOOH for 30 min with a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Samples were ionized with the Nanoflow-LC ESI, and MS/MS spectrum data were obtained with a LCQ-Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). The Mascot data base-searching software (Matrix Science, Inc., London, UK) was used for the identification of acetylated proteins. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting−Cells were harvested and sonicated for 10 s twice in ice-cold Immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with each primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C using gentle agitation and with the protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for another 1 h. The agarose pellets were then washed three times with IP buffer, and the bound proteins were extracted with the SDS-PAGE loading buffer by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. After the membranes had been incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, the immune complexes were detected with an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the luminescence was analyzed with a LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). Nonspecific Polyadenylation Assay−Each 10 μg of the plasmids for HFF-PAP was introduced into COS-7 cells (10-cm dish). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with TSA (3 μm) plus NA (5 mm) and cultured for an additional 12 h. Cells were then harvested and PAP proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and subsequently eluted with the FLAG peptide (Sigma). DIG-labeled RNA was synthesized from RsaI-digested pSP6L3 preΔ1 plasmids (22.Christofori G. Keller W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by in vitro transcription using a DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified PAP and 0.1 μg of DIG-L3 preΔ1 were mixed in the reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.1 mg/ml tRNA, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 5% glycerol, 0.8 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 5 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was performed at 37 °C, and then stopped at 30 min or 2 h by adding 2× TBE-urea sample buffer containing 3.5 m urea (Invitrogen). After the poly(A) addition reaction, the RNA was separated by 10% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 60 min, and subsequently electroblotted to a nylon membrane (Pall Corp.). A DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used for the detection of DIG-labeled L3preΔ1 RNA, and the luminescent was detected with a LAS-3000 image analyzer. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy−Exponentially growing cells were plated on 18-mm coverslips and incubated overnight. After transfection and drug treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then rinsed three times with PBS, and the cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After the coverslips had been incubated in blocking solution (5% calf serum/PBS) for 30 min, the primary antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and the Alexa-fluor anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. After the coverslips had been washed three times with PBS, they were observed under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot2). Identification of CFIm25 as an Acetylated Protein in TSA-treated COS-7 Cells−To identify proteins of which acetylation is enhanced by TSA treatment, we carried out affinity purification of acetylated proteins using an acetylated lysine-specific (AcLys) antibody. COS-7 cells were treated with 300 nm TSA for 6 h; the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-AcLys antibody, and the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. These putative acetylated proteins were excised from the gel, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In this experiment, CFIm25 was identified as the 25-kDa acetylated protein besides known acetylated proteins such as p53, T-Ag, and histones (16.Shimazu T. Komatsu Y. Nakayama K.I. Fukazawa H. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7391-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CFIm25 is a component of the mammalian cleavage factor Im (CF Im), which is thought to be required for the first step in pre-mRNA 3′-end processing, and interacts directly with mRNA or PAP (Fig. 1A). LC-MS/MS suggested that the acetylation occurs at lysine 23 (Fig. 1B). To confirm the acetylation of CFIm25 at lysine 23, CFIm25 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3-cFLAG vector from a human kidney cDNA library. Point mutants at lysine 23 and lysine 29 (as a control) were subsequently generated, and COS-7 cells were transfected with these plasmids (Fig. 1C). Because the point mutation at lysine 23 (K23R) completely abolished the acetylation of CFIm25, we concluded that the acetylation site in CFIm25 is lysine 23 (compare Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 6). Because TSA inhibits all class I and II HDAC enzymes, some members of these families may catalyze the deacetylation at lysine 23. We next examined whether class III HDACs that are NAD-dependent enzymes are also involved in the deacetylation of CFIm25 besides TSA-sensitive class I/II enzymes. Whereas the class III enzymes are resistant to TSA, they can be inhibited by nicotinamide (NA), a by-product of the catalytic reaction. COS-7 cells were treated with or without TSA and/or NA, and in vivo acetylation levels were determined. As shown in Fig. 1D, the combined treatment with TSA and NA remarkably increased the CFIm25 acetylation, suggesting that CFIm25 is deacetylated by both class I/II and class III HDACs. Even in this experiment, the K23R mutant was not acetylated, indicating that the acetylation site in CFIm25 is only lysine 23. Enzymes Responsible for Acetylation and Deacetylation of CFIm25−It has been shown that p300/CBP and PCAF acetylate many non-histone proteins. To determine which enzyme is responsible for the acetylation of CFIm25, COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmids for FLAG-tagged CFIm25 together with CBP, PCAF, or TIP60. As shown in Fig. 2A, CBP could acetylate CFIm25 but not the K23R mutant, whereas catalytic-dead CBP (CBP-mut) failed to acetylate CFIm25. Whereas PCAF could weakly acetylate CFIm25 (2.95-fold), TIP60 could not. If there was any activity at all, it was very weak. These results suggest that CBP is the major HAT for the CFIm25 acetylation. Thus far, 11 HDACs classified into class I and class II HDACs have been reported. To identify the HDACs involved in the deacetylation of CFIm25, we first determined the enzymes that physically interact with CFIm25 by the co-immunoprecipitation assay. COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmids for FLAG-tagged CFIm25, HA-tagged CBP, and HA-tagged HDAC1–8 and -10; the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and the CFim25-binding proteins were detected with the anti-HA antibody. This experiment showed that HDAC1, -3, and -10 were detected as the proteins bound to CFIm25 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, these three enzymes were able to bind CFIm25, and their overexpression caused marked decreases in the in vivo acetylation of CFIm25. We next investigated the physical interaction with CFIm25 and the deacetylating activity of human SIRT1–5 to determine the class III HDAC responsible for the deacetylation of CFIm25. To this end, Myc-tagged SIRT1-SIRT5 were co-expressed with the FLAG-tagged CFIm25 in COS-7 cells and the CFIm25-binding proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, SIRT1 and SIRT2 interacted with and deacetylated CFim25 in vivo. These results imply that SIRT1 and SIRT2 are the CFIm25-deacetylating enzymes among the class III HDACs. Acetylation of CFIm25 Is Dependent on Pre-mRNA Cleavage Factor Complex Formation−We next investigated how the CFIm25 acetylation is regulated in the cleavage factor complex. CFIm25 has been shown to bind to CFIm68 and forms the CF Im heterodimer complex. First, we tested whether expression of complex members affects the acetylation of CFIm25. Surprisingly, CFIm25 could be acetylated even in the absence of TSA or NA treatment when CFIm68 was co-overexpressed (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 7). On the other hand, the acetylation level of CFIm25 was not affected by the PAP overexpression. Because CBP was the acetylase of CFIm25 (Fig. 2A), we next checked whether CBP interacted with CFIm25, CFIm68, or PAP (Fig. 3B). Importantly, whereas CFIm68 and PAP could bind to CBP, CFIm25 could not interact with CBP. This observation suggests that CFIm68 mediates acetylation of CFIm25 by recruiting CBP. To test this possibility, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with CFIm25, CFIm68, and CBP. As shown in Fig. 3C, acetylation of CFIm25 by CBP was enhanced when CFIm68 was simultaneously overexpressed. On the other hand, CFIm68 knock-down by siRNA remarkably reduced CFIm25 acetylation in the presence of TSA plus NA (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, acetylation of the CFIm25 was decreased when cells were treated with an RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D (AMD) (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the acetylation of CFIm25 enhanced during active transcription, which requires the CF Im complex formation for polyadenylation of the transcripts. Acetylation of PAP, Another Pre-mRNA Processing Complex Protein That Interacts with CFIm25−The above results suggest that CBP is one of the components of the pre-mRNA processing complex, and that not only CFIm68 but also PAP are associated with CBP. Therefore, we examined whether CFIm68 or PAP can be acetylated by CBP. COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmids for either FLAG-tagged CFIm25, CFIm68, or PAP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with or without TSA and NA. As shown in Fig. 4A, PAP, but not CFIm68, was acetylated when treated with TSA plus NA. LC-MS/MS analysis suggested the four potentially acetylated sites (Lys635, Lys644, Lys730, and Lys734) in PAP (Fig. 4B). All the acetylation sites were mapped in the C-terminal regulatory domain including lysine 644, one of the four lysine residues in the C-terminal NLS2 sequence (644KRTSSPHKEESPKKTK659; Fig. 4C). To see if these sites are actually acetylated, we introduced point mutations into these sites, and tested whether they are acetylated in COS-7 cells treated with or without TSA plus NA. Among these lysine residues, lysine 644 was shown to be the major acetylation site because the single point mutation at lysine 644 resulted in a remarkable decrease in the acetylation (Fig. 4D, lane 6). Although a weak acetylation still remained in the double mutant of lysine 635 and lysine 644, the acetylation of the 4KR mutant was undetectable even when treated with TSA plus NA. Thus, we conclude that all four lysine residues of PAP identified by LC-MS/MS experiments can be acetylated. The C-terminal region of PAP is known to be required for various protein interactions, and contains multiple Ser phosphorylation sites. Our results indicate the presence of another modification in the C-terminal regulatory region of PAP. Enzymes Responsible for Acetylation and Deacetylation of PAP−To verify whether PAP is also acetylated by CBP like CFIm25, we examined the effect of HAT expression on the PAP acetylation. As shown in Fig. 5A, PAP was actively acetylated by CBP (6.31-fold), but was only weakly acetylated by other HATs, indicating that CBP is the major acetylating enzyme for PAP like CFIm25. Similarly, all the HDACs (HDAC1, -3, -10, and SIRT1, 2) that interacted with CFIm25 could also associate with PAP (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5B, all these enzymes (HDAC1, 3, 10 and SIRT1, 2) could reduce the acetylation when co-expressed with PAP. These results indicate that the same enzymes as those for CFIm25 are responsible for the acetylation and deacetylation of PAP. Acetylation Reduces the Interaction between PAP and CF Im−The N-terminal region of CFIm25 and the C-terminal region of PAP are known to be responsible for the protein interaction with each other (6.Kim H. Lee Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because the acetylation sites in each protein are also located in these regions, it seems likely that acetylation influences the interaction between PAP and the CF Im complex. To test this possibility, we measured the interaction between FLAG-tagged PAP and HA-tagged CFIm25 and CFIm68 by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the interaction between PAP and CFIm25 or CFIm68 was reduced compared with that of wild type or KR mutant (lanes 2 and 4), when deacetylases were inhibited (lane 3; TSA plus NA treatment) or the acetylation mimic forms were used (lane 5; CFIm25-K23Q and PAP-4KQ). These results imply that acetylation regulates the interaction between PAP and the CF Im complex. Acetylation Did Not Affect Polyadenylating Activity of PAP−Because phosphorylation of PAP is known to inhibit polyadenylating activity (7.Zhao W. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5010-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we next checked whether the PAP activity was affected by acetylation. The plasmids for PAP mutants were transfected in COS-7 cells and the cells were treated with or without TSA+NA for 12 h. These PAP mutants were purified by the affinity to the anti-FLAG antibody. The amounts of purified PAP proteins used in this experiment were determined (Fig. 7A). We carried out the in vitro nonspecific polyadenylation assay under conditions identical to those previously reported (22.Christofori G. Keller W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), except that we used DIG-labeled adenovirus L3 pre-Δ1 RNA as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 7B, the nonspecific polyadenylating activity was not affected by the acetylation or the KQ mutations. This observation was consistent with the previous report showing that the C-terminal deletion mutant of PAP (Δ644–739 amino acids) did not lose the catalytic activity (19.Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Acetylation Promotes Cytoplasmic Localization of PAP−Because lysine 644, one of the four acetylation sites in PAP, is located in the NLS2 (644KRTSSPHKEESPKKTK659), it is possible that acetylation affects the interaction with the importin α/β complex and the nuclear import of PAP. To test this possibility, we expressed the FLAG-tagged PAP mutants and V5-tagged importin β in COS-7 cells, and analyzed the effect of acetylation on the interaction between PAP and importin β by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 8A, wild type with the TSA+NA treatment or the 4KQ mutant were more weakly bound to importin β than wild type or 4KR. Indeed, the increased cytoplasmic localization of PAP was observed with TSA+NA treatment or by the 4KQ mutation, whereas wild type and the 4KR mutant localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 8, C and D). These results show that acetylation of NLS2 in the PAP inhibits the binding to the importin α/β complex by neutralizing the basic lysine residue, thereby enhancing the cytoplasmic distribution of PAP. Recent research has revealed that acetylation regulates the functions of many proteins other than histones. We have screened for acetylated proteins using an anti-acetylated lysine specific antibody and LC-MS/MS analysis. In this report, we focused on the acetylation of CFIm25, a subunit of the mammalian cleavage complex, and PAP. CFIm25 forms a complex named CF Im with a 68-kDa subunit and binds to pre-mRNA in the first step in pre-mRNA 3′-end processing. It is also shown to interact with PAP, and this interaction may assist polyadenylation by recruiting PAP to pre-mRNA. Although regulation of PAP by Ser phosphorylation has been described, we demonstrated that acetylation also regulates PAP. The present study shows that the interaction between CFIm25 and PAP decreases when lysine 23 on CFIm25 and lysine 635/644/730/734 on PAP are acetylated. The mechanism by which the acetylation decreases the interaction is still obscure but local conformational changes or loss of positive charges caused by acetylation might affect the interaction, because acetylation occurs in each interaction surface of these proteins. Another effect of acetylation on the PAP function is changes in the localization. PAP re-localized to the cytoplasm when acetylated. This is probably because acetylation at the lysine residue in the NLS2 impairs the NLS function. Basic residues such as Arg and Lys are thought to be important for NLS, and acetylation of lysine residues results in the loss of their positive charges. Indeed, PAP interaction with the importin complex was greatly reduced by acetylation. However, it is still possible that acetylation of lysine residues other than NLS2 are responsible for the decrease in the importin binding. On the other hand, we could not observe any significant change in the CFIm25 localization by TSA plus NA treatment nor KR mutation (data not shown). Although nonspecific polyadenylation activity of PAP was not affected by acetylation (Fig. 7), it is possible that acetylation indirectly affects poly(A) addition and transcriptional termination through regulating the protein interactions. Although it is still unclear whether acetylation of PAP and CFIm25 activate or repress the mRNA processing, our data suggest that acetylation may have a negative role in the first assembly step by enhanced cytoplasmic localization of PAP and the weaker interaction between CF Im and PAP, while it may promote the following cleavage and polyadenylation steps by facilitating the dissociation of the CF Im complex from PAP. The fact that CFIm25 could directly interact with HDACs but not with CBP suggests that acetylation of CFIm25 occurs after the cleavage complex formation and deacetylation occurs when the complex is dissociated. Thus, it seems likely that deacetylation of CFIm and PAP promotes the assembly of the cleavage complex, whereas acetylation is coupled with the following dissociation steps (Fig. 9). As a consequence, reversible acetylation may facilitate the poly(A) addition of pre-mRNA, while permanent acetylation will lead to the dissociation of PAP and CFIm25 and the cytoplasmic localization of PAP, which may repress polyadenylation reactions. However, because general transcription and protein synthesis are not affected by treatment with both TSA and NA (data not shown), the role of reversible acetylation of CFIm25 and PAP may be controlling the rate of polyadenylation in response to the environmental conditions. Because protein acetylation is regulated by the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (23.Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and the deacetylating activity of class III HDACs depends on the cellular NAD levels (24.Bordone L. Guarente L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), it seems possible that acetylation of CFIm25 and PAP is controlled by the metabolic activity. It has been well established that HATs are involved in the initiation and elongation of transcription through acetylation (25.Marmorstein R. Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In this report, we provided evidence for the contribution of HATs and HDACs to the transcriptional termination through the acetylation of processing factors of pre-mRNA. Thus, the reversible acetylation of non-histone proteins appears to play a more profound role than previously thought, which should be carefully investigated.

Of the five mammalian isoforms, the detailed functional characteristics have only been reported for NCKX1 and -2. In the current study, the functional characteristics of recombinant NCKX3 and -4 expressed in HEK293 cells were determined and compared with those of NCKX2. Although the apparent affinities of the three isoforms for Ca2+ and Na+ were similar, NCKX3 and -4 displayed ∼40-fold higher affinities for K+ ions than NCKX2. Functional analysis of various NCKX2 mutants revealed that mutation of Thr-551 to Ala, the corresponding residue in NCKX4, resulted in an apparent K+ affinity shift to one similar to that of NCKX4 without a parallel shift in apparent Ca2+ affinity. In the converse situation, when Gln-476 of NCKX4 was converted to Lys, the corresponding residue in NCKX2, both the K+ and Ca2+ affinities were reduced. These results indicate that the apparently low K+ affinity of NCKX2 requires a Thr residue at position 551 that may reduce the conformational flexibility and/or K+ liganding strength of side-chain moieties on critical neighboring residues. This interaction appears to be specific to the structural context of the NCKX2 K+ binding pocket, because it was not possible to recreate the K+-specific low affinity phenotype with reciprocal mutations in NCKX4.

An important aspect of understanding the unique physiological roles of the various NCX and NCKX isoforms is to determine their functional properties. The three NCX isoforms catalyze the exchange of 3 Na+ ions for 1 Ca2+ ion and have been demonstrated to display very similar functional properties with K0.5 values of ∼100–400 μm for Ca2+ (in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+) and ∼10–60 mm for Na+ (29.Fontana G.

We have previously reported the electrophysiological characterization of recombinant rat brain NCKX2 expressed in HEK293 cells (31.Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol.

NCKX2 was shown to exchange 4 Na+ ions for 1 Ca2+ and 1 K+ with K0.5 values of ∼1 μm or 100 μm for Ca2+ dependence, in the absence or presence of 1 mm Mg2+, respectively, 10 or 35 mm for K+ dependence, in the presence of choline+ or Li+, respectively, and 30 or 60 mm for Na+ dependence or inhibition, respectively. Although NCKX3 and -4 have been demonstrated to function as K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, their detailed functional characteristics are unknown (14.Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H.

NCKX3 and -4 are closely related, with 71% overall amino acid sequence identity but only 40% identity with NCKX1 and -2, which may underlie functional differences between the isoforms that could have important implications for their roles in Ca2+ signaling. In the current study, functional characterization of recombinant human NCKX2, -3, and -4 was undertaken by expression in HEK293 cells loaded with fura-2 AM in a perfusion chamber using a microscope photometer. The results of these studies indicated the apparent K0.5 for K+ ions of NCKX3 and -4 was ∼40-fold lower than that of NCKX2. Site-directed mutagenesis of NCKX2 and -4 based on multiple sequence alignments of the α-repeat regions was employed to identify the molecular determinants responsible for the apparent differences in K+ affinity. These studies suggest that the identified residues may alter the conformational flexibility and/or liganding strength of key acidic residues in the K+ binding pocket. All common chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, VWR, or BDH and were minimally of analytical grade. All molecular procedures were performed according to previously established protocols (32.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Subsequent functional analyses suggested that there were no obvious functional differences between the short and long splice variants, so all subsequent experiments were performed using the long splice variant of NCKX2. Generation of the constructs used for expression of recombinant human NCKX3 and -4 has been described previously (14.Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X.

PCR was used to insert the FLAG epitope (amino acids DYKDDDDK) into the putative N-terminal extracellular loops of NCKX2 (by replacing residues 89–96), NCKX3 (by insertion after residue 66), and NCKX4 (by insertion after residue 41). Mutagenesis−Site-directed mutagenesis to achieve the desired changes in the amino acid sequences was performed using either overlap-extension PCR or megaprimer PCR according to previously established methods (33.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 34.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The correct sequences of all the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amino acid numbering was based on the long splice variants of NCKX2 and NCKX3 and the short splice variant of NCKX4, which corresponds to the versions used in our functional assays. Cell Culture and Transfection−Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of Qiagen-purified expression plasmids into HEK293 cells was performed using a standard Ca2+-phosphate precipitation protocol as previously described (12.Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing cells transfected with the parent expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen), were used as negative controls. Photometry and Data Analysis−Two days after transfection, HEK293 cells on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) and mounted in a perfusion chamber on a microscope stage. The fura-2 ratio was determined by measuring fluorescence emission at 510 nm from excitations at 340 nm and 380 nm with a D-104 microscope photometer using Felix version 1.42 software (Photon Technology International). The perfusion solutions used contained 10 mm d-glucose and 10 mm HEPES-tetramethylammonium, pH 7.4, with either 145 mm NaCl or LiCl and varying concentrations of KCl and/or NaCl to a total of 145 mm, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 or varying concentrations of CaCl2 buffered with 0.5 mm EGTA to the desired final concentration for Ca2+ dependence experiments. The cells were perfused alternatively for 3 min with sodium buffer or 2 min with lithium buffer at a rate of ∼3 ml/min in a volume of ∼0.5 ml, ensuring complete solution change in ∼10 s or less. Ca2+ transport rates for reverse mode NCKX2 activity were determined by linear regression of the initial linear rate of change of the fura-2 ratio. Each coverslip was internally normalized to the average of the rates of the second and last pulses, but if they differed by >20% a correction for the change in maximal rate with time was applied, using a linear interpolation between the second and last pulses to mathematically correct the intervening pulses as illustrated in Fig. 1. All data analysis and curve-fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software. The Ca2+ and K+ dependence curves and Na+ inhibition curves were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis to the equation: Y = Top – Bottom/(1–10^((log(K0.5 or IC50) – X)*Hillslope), where, with the exception of the NCKX2 K+ dependence curve, the Top was constrained to a value of 100% and the Bottom was constrained to a value of 5%. Development of a Functional Assay for Recombinant NCKX2, -3, and -4−HEK293 cells grown on coverslips and transfected with expression constructs for recombinant FLAG-tagged NCKX2, -3, or -4, or pcDNA3.1+ without insert, were loaded with fura-2 AM and mounted in a perfusion chamber on a microscope stage. The ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm from excitations at 340 and 380 nm, respectively, was monitored using a microscope photometer. When the perfusion solution containing 145 mm Na+ was switched to one containing 135 mm Li+ and 10 mm K+, a rapid increase in the fura-2 ratio was observed in cells transfected with NCKX constructs but not in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1+ (Fig. 1A). The rapid rise in the fura-2 fluorescence ratio required the presence of K+ ions in the perfusion solution and therefore, represented reverse mode, NCKX-mediated Ca2+ influx (data not shown). Repeated switches between Na+-containing buffer and Li+ + K+-containing buffer to a total of nine “pulses” generally resulted in initial rates of Ca2+ transport by NCKX3 and -4 that individually differed by no more than 20%, whereas NCKX2 displayed a monotonic run-down phenomenon that was linear after the first pulse and resulted in the rate of pulse nine being 40% lower than the rate of pulse two in the example presented in Fig. 1 (B and C). In all experiments, the rate of the first pulse was inconsistent with that of the following pulses and thus not included in any of the analyses. Run-down was also observed for NCKX3 and -4 in some experiments and was similarly absent in some NCKX2 experiments. Therefore, run-down phenomena were generally considered significant when the second and last pulses differed more than the variability observed in experiments where no run-down was observed (i.e. >20%). In such cases, a time-dependent correction was applied, based on linear interpolation between pulses two and nine, and used to mathematically correct the intervening pulses (Fig. 1C). It is also worth noting that the amplitude of the Ca2+ responses did not always correlate well with the initial rate of rise (this is seen in the example traces of Figs. 2 and 3). Initial rates were always used for data analysis as illustrated in Figs. 2B and 3B.FIGURE 3K+ concentration dependences of recombinant NCKX2, -3, and -4. The effects of varying K+ concentrations on the reverse-mode operation of NCKX2, -3, and -4 in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+ were determined and analyzed using the functional assay described in the legend to Fig. 2.

These experiments were performed using either increasing or decreasing concentrations of Ca2+, yielding identical results. Representative experiments in which decreasing concentrations were used are presented in Fig. 2A, whereas representative experiments in which increasing concentrations were used are presented in some of the subsequent figures. Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1+ did not display any notable changes in the fura-2 ratio when perfused with the various buffers. To illustrate the data analysis methods used, the portions of the representative traces shown in Fig. 2A corresponding to the initial rates of fura-2 ratio change for each pulse are presented in Fig. 2B. When the data from four to six coverslips were internally normalized, averaged, and fitted using nonlinear regression analysis, the resulting apparent K0.5 values for NCKX2, -3, and -4 were similar (1.3–1.7 μm), and the Hill slope values ranged from 0.98 to 1.2, suggesting the presence of a single class of Ca2+-binding sites (Fig. 2C and Table 1). These data were consistent with the previously reported value of 1.4 μm obtained for recombinant rat brain NCKX2 using electrophysiological methods (31.Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J.

Open table in a new tab The K+ concentration dependences of the initial rates of fura-2 ratio change in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant NCKX2, -3, and -4 were determined in buffers containing 0.1 mm Ca2+ and varying concentrations of K+ (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3 (A and B) representative traces and the respective portions of each pulse corresponding to the initial rates of fura-2 ratio change are shown. For all the subsequent figures, only the representative traces are shown. When the average data from four to seven coverslips for the K+ concentration dependences were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis, NCKX2 displayed rates that did not saturate within the range of concentrations tested, whereas NCKX3 and -4 displayed apparent K0.5 values of 1.3 and 1.1 mm, respectively, and Hill slope values of 1.0 and 1.1, respectively, consistent with the presence of a single K+ binding site (Fig. 3C and Table 1). Because the range of K+ concentrations tested did not saturate NCKX2 activity, the data could not be fitted with a high degree of confidence, but an apparent K0.5 of ∼40 mm was obtained when the “Top” parameter (i.e. the maximal rate) was unconstrained in the nonlinear regression analysis. This apparent low affinity for K+ was consistent with our previously reported apparent K0.5 of ∼36 mm for recombinant rat brain NCKX2 obtained using electrophysiology (31.Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data indicated that NCKX3 and -4 have ∼40-fold higher apparent affinities for K+ ions during reverse-mode operation than NCKX2. Na+ Inhibition of the Reversemode Activity of NCKX2, -3, and -4−To assess the affinities of the various NCKX isoforms for Na+ ions, we determined the initial rates of fura-2 ratio change in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant NCKX2, -3, and -4 in perfusion buffers containing 10 mm K+, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and varying concentrations of Na+ (Fig. 4A). HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1+ did not display any notable fura-2 ratio changes in the presence of the various perfusion solutions. The average data from four separate experiments for each isoform was fitted using nonlinear regression analysis and revealed apparent IC50 values of 34, 30, and 18 mm for NCKX2, -3, and -4, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table 1), which were consistent with the value of 60 mm determined for recombinant rat brain NCKX2 in the presence of 40 mm K+ and 1 mm Ca2+ using electrophysiology (31.Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Hill slope values ranged from 1.6 to 1.8, which was consistent with the presence of multiple classes of Na+ binding sites that are either competitive or allosteric (31.Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35.Reeves J.P. Sutko J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3178-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that NCKX2, -3, and -4 exhibit similar apparent affinities for Na+ ions under these conditions of assay. Multiple Sequence Alignments and Mutagenesis Strategy−In studies on NCX proteins aimed at identifying the amino acid residues responsible for the differential Ni2+ and Li+ sensitivities of NCX1, -2, and -3, extensive chimeric constructs were generated and tested, revealing that the only regions with any notable effects contained the α-repeat 1 and 2 sequences (36.Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Nakamura T.Y. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23094-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extensive mutagenesis efforts on NCKX isoforms strongly suggested that the α-repeats contain the structural motifs responsible for cation binding and translocation (22.Winkfein R.J.

Therefore, to identify the molecular determinants responsible for the apparent differences in K+ affinities between NCKX2 and NCKX3 and -4, we performed multiple sequence alignments containing only the α 1 and 2 repeat regions (Fig. 5). Using this alignment, we identified residues that were different between NCKX2 and NCKX3 and -4 and constructed grouped mutations (M1–M6) that covered the entire lengths of the α-repeat regions, in which the selected residues in NCKX2 were converted to the corresponding residues in NCKX4 and vice versa (Table 2). Because NCKX3 and -4 differ by only eight amino acids in the α-repeat regions and the results presented in Table 1 suggested that these two proteins are functionally very similar, NCKX3 was not subjected to any further analyses. Immunoblotting of postnuclear extracts from HEK293 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant NCKX2 and -4 constructs using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies confirmed that all of the generated constructs were expressed at roughly similar levels (data not shown).TABLE 2NCKX2 mutant constructs and their reciprocal NCKX4 counterpartsMutant constructMutations forNCKX2NCKX4M1G184SS132GL193VV141LA199TT147AS201GG149SN202DD150NI205VV153IM2F218CC166FV219II167VM222VV170MA224GG172AS227AA175SM3V524II442VE526YY444EI528LL446IS531PP449SE532DD450EE533VV451EL537II455LI539FF457IM4I546VV464IL549CC467LI550MM468IT551AA469TV553LL471VK558QQ476KM5S567NN485SV569II487VI573VV491IM6T577LL495TP581GG499PL585GG503LY587QQ505Y Open table in a new tab K+ Affinity Assays for the NCKX2 and -4 Mutant Constructs−To determine if the introduced mutations resulte"
https://openalex.org/W2078691421,"The methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) corrinoid-iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP) methyltransferase (MeTr) catalyzes transfer of the methyl group of CH3-H4folate to cob(I)amide. This key step in anaerobic CO and CO2 fixation is similar to the first half-reaction in the mechanisms of other cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases. Methyl transfer requires electrophilic activation of the methyl group of CH3-H4folate, which includes proton transfer to the N5 group of the pterin ring and poises the methyl group for reaction with the Co(I) nucleophile.

Instead, an Asn residue and water molecules are found within H-bonding distance of N5. Structural and kinetic experiments described here are consistent with the involvement of an extended H-bonding network in proton transfer to N5 of the folate that includes an Asn (Asn-199 in MeTr), a conserved Asp (Asp-160), and a water molecule. This situation is reminiscent of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which involves protonation of the purine N7 in the transition state and is accomplished by an extended H-bond network that includes water molecules, a Glu residue, and an Asn residue (Kicska, G.

In MeTr, the Asn residue swings from a distant position to within H-bonding distance of the N5 atom upon CH3-H4folate binding. An N199A variant exhibits only ∼20-fold weakened affinity for CH3-H4folate but a much more marked 20,000-40,000-fold effect on catalysis, suggesting that Asn-199 plays an important role in stabilizing a transition state or high energy intermediate for methyl transfer.

The methylated CFeSP then reacts with carbon monoxide and CoA to generate acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by the bifunctional NiFeS protein, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (2Ragsdale S.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The MeTr reaction is similar to a variety of cobalamin-dependent methylation reactions, including methyl transfer from CH3-H4folate to the bound cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase, which subsequently transfers its methyl group from methylcobalamin to homocysteine (3Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 4Matthews R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CH3−CH4folate+Co(I)−CFeSP→CH3−Co(III)−CFeSP+H4folate REACTION 1 The MeTr reaction mechanism consists of several steps (5Seravalli J. Zhao S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5728-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The first two steps include a pH-dependent conformational change followed by binding of CH3-H4folate. Equilibrium dialysis studies shows that MeTr has a high affinity binding site for CH3-H4folate with a Kd of 10 μm (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CH3-H4folate binds to MeTr in the unprotonated state and then undergoes rapid protonation (5Seravalli J. Zhao S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5728-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This proton transfer step generates a positive charge at the N5 position of the pterin ring, resulting in electrophilic activation of the methyl group of CH3-H4folate (3Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This activation step is important because H4folate is a very poor leaving group, but it is not rate-limiting. Next, the CFeSP binds, and its Co(I) center catalyzes an SN2 displacement of the N5 methyl group of CH3-H4folate to form the methylated CFeSP. There is evidence that proton transfer to the pterin occurs in a tertiary complex with CH3-H4folate and cob(I)alamin for the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH) (7Smith A.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13880-13890Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in the ternary complex with CH3-H4folate and homocysteine for the enzyme cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (8Taurog R.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5092-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crystal structure of MeTr (in the absence of substrate) reveals no obvious proton donor within H-bonding distance of the N5 position of CH3-H4folate, which was modeled into the structure (9Doukov T. Seravalli J. Stezowski J. Ragsdale S.W. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The only amino acid that located near enough to N5 to participate in H-bonding is the side chain of Asn-199; however, this group is not chemically suitable to act as a proton donor. Thus, the mechanism of proton transfer leading to electrophilic activation of the methyl group is unclear. To solve this paradox, one might posit that the proton donor moves into place after CH3-H4folate binds; however, the recent crystal structure of the CH3-H4folate-MetH complex shows that there is no acidic group positioned near the N5 group of the pterin and, like the MeTr structure, Asn-199 (MeTr numbering) is within H-bonding distance to N5 (10Evans J.C.

The lack of discernible proton delivery systems in the crystal structures of enzymes that catalyze proton transfer is surprisingly common. Besides methyltransferases, this situation is encountered in a number of enzymes, including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (11Rod T.H. Brooks III, C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8718-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (12Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The latter catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of purine nucleoside to form the corresponding purine base and ribose 1-phosphate. Fig. 1 compares the H-bonding patterns in MeTr, MetH, and DHFR near the N5 of CH3-H4folate (or folate in DHFR) with PNP in the vicinity of N7 of the transition state analog immucillin-H (ImmH). In addition to the structural homology, there are mechanistic similarities of the methyltransferases with PNP as well. To facilitate their bond cleavage reactions, both sets of enzymes appear to require substrate protonation and subsequent stabilization of a protonated species in the transition state. Evidence that N7 is protonated in the transition state of the PNP reaction comes from a series of elegant studies by Schramm and co-workers using transition state analogs (13Lewandowicz A. Ringia E.A. Ting L.M. Kim K. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Zubkova O.V. Mee S. Painter G.F. Lenz D.H. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. J. Biol.

They find a difference in affinity of 107 (10.1 kcal/mol) between ImmH, an analog that is an H-bond donor at N7 (always protonated) and 4-aza-3-deaza-ImmH, an analog that is an H-bond acceptor at N7 (never protonated), suggesting that analogs that are protonated at N7 mimic the transition state. Available to accept the H-bond from N7 of substrate is Asn-243 (12Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C.

The oxygen of the carboxamide side chain of Asn-243 is 3.3 Ä away from N7 with an unprotonated substrate bound and moves closer (2.8-2.9 Ä) when protonated substrate analogs are bound (12Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C.

NMR studies show that a single H-bond between Asn-243 and N7 of substrate is only partly responsible for the full 10.1 kcal/mol difference between ImmH and 4-aza-3-deaza-ImmH binding affinity (13Lewandowicz A.

The equivalent residue to Asn-243 in MeTr, Asn-199, is conserved in all methyltransferases. Given the provocative location of Asn-199 in MeTr and its potential role in transition state stabilization in the transmethylation reaction, we performed site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, and structural studies to evaluate the contribution of this residue to catalysis. General DNA Manipulations—DNA isolation and manipulation were performed using standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA sequences of all PCR-generated DNA fragments were confirmed by automated sequencing of both strands by the Genomics Core Research Facility (University of Nebraska-Lincoln, NE) with a Beckman Coulter CEQ2000XL 8-capillary DNA sequencer using dye terminator chemistry. Site-directed Mutagenesis of MeTr—Asn-199 was mutated to Ala using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) using the wild-type pET3a-MeTr plasmid (9Doukov T. Seravalli J. Stezowski J. Ragsdale S.W. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was digested with DpnI and transformed into Escherichia coli Top10 (Invitrogen) cells. The N199A mutant plasmid was then isolated and transformed into B834(DE3)pLysS(met-) (Novagen) E. coli cells. Enzyme Purification—E. coli cells transformed with pET3a-MeTr (N199A mutant or wild-type) were grown in 3 or 4 liters of Terrific Broth essentially as described earlier (9Doukov T. Seravalli J. Stezowski J. Ragsdale S.W. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside when the OD at 600 nm reached 0.5-0.8, grown for 3 h at 37 °C or 11 h at 25 °C, and then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 min. The cells (12 or 16 g) were suspended in 50 or 40 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 2 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol (DTT), 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 units/ml DNase I, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by sonication for 10 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C with a Beckman Ti35 rotor, the supernatant fraction was recovered as cell-free extract. The cell-free extract was heated at 70 °C for 40 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. MeTr was then purified from the cell-free extract using a 150-ml phenyl-Sepharose column and buffer-exchanged and concentrated by ultrafiltration into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 2 mm DTT. The concentration of protein was determined with the rose bengal method (16Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A typical yield from one liter of culture was 50 mg of MeTr. Activity Measurements—For steady-state assays, MeTr activity was determined in the reverse direction by following transfer of the methyl group of methylcobalamin to H4folate as described earlier (17Zhao S.Y. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed at pH 8.4 and 55 °C using 66 μm methylcobalamin, 300 μm H4folate, and the decrease in absorbance at 520 nm from methyl-Co(III) was measured. The forward reaction was measured essentially as described earlier (17Zhao S.Y. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 0.1 m potassium succinate, pH 5.0, 60 mm NaCl, 3.6 μm CFeSP, 87 μm CH3-H4folate, MeTr (4.1 nm monomer for the wild-type or 8.3 μm monomer for the N199A variant) and 165 μm Ti(III)-citrate to reduce Co(II) to the Co(I) state. The decrease in absorbance at 390 nm (Co(I) decay) and increase at 450 (methyl-Co(III) formation) were measured. The absorbance changes for the forward and reverse reactions were monitored using an OLIS Cary-14-converted spectrometer (Bogart, GA). Presteady-state kinetic experiments for the wild-type MeTr and N199A variant were performed at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. For both experiments, 300 μm 6S-CH3-H4folate, MeTr (40 μm of monomer), 1 mm Ti(III)citrate, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.1, 0.1 m NaCl was rapidly mixed with 10 μm CFeSP, 1 mm Ti(III)citrate (to reduce the CFeSP to the Co(I) state), 0.1 m MES, pH 5.1, 0.1 m NaCl. The decrease in absorption of Co(I) at 390 and the increase in absorption of the methylated Co(III) at 450 nm were recorded. For the CFeSP, the Δε between cob(I)amide and methylcob(III)amide at 390 and 450 nm is 17 and 6 mm-1 cm-1, respectively (18Zhao S. Roberts D.L. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15075-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The experiment with the wild-type protein was performed with a DX.17MV sequential stopped-flow ASVD spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics (Leatherbarrow, England), whereas for the N199A variant MeTr, the same experiments were performed at room temperature using an S2000 miniature fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Inc., Dunedin, FL) inside a Vacuum Atmospheres (Hawthorne, CA) anaerobic chamber. Binding Studies—Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed as described (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using a lower solution containing 40 μm N199A-MeTr monomer and an upper solution containing varying concentrations of (6R,S)-14CH3-H4folate (4-75 μm). Both solutions contained 0.1 mm MES, pH 6.1, and 1 mm DTT. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed at pH 7.6 by titrating 2.8 μm MeTr monomer with CH3-H4folate as described (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We could not measure the Kd at low pH values because under these conditions, the fluorescence of CH3-H4folate was much more intense than that of MeTr. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments for wild-type and N199A MeTr were performed with a MicroCal VPITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at pH 5.1 and 7.6. Before the experiment, the enzyme solutions were dialyzed against the buffer with appropriate pH, i.e. 0.1 m MES, pH 5.1, or 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 2 mm DTT if needed for anaerobiosis. The reaction cell was filled with a 0.05 mm (as monomer) MeTr solution. The titrated ligand [6S]-5-CH3-H4folate (1.5 mm) was dissolved in the same buffer used for dialysis of the enzyme. The stirring speed was 310 rpm, and the thermal power of 29 injections of 10 μl was recorded every 120 s. Thermogram analysis was performed using the Origin 7.0 software supplied with the instrument. Crystal Growth—Crystals of MeTr with CH3-H4folate (CH3-H4folate/MeTr) and of N199A with CH3-H4folate (CH3-H4folate/N199A) were produced at room temperature using a hanging drop setup and equal amounts of protein and precipitant (typically 2 μl of protein to 2 μl of precipitant). The protein solutions were kept in an anaerobic bottle before crystallization. Small aliquots were taken by syringe for the experiments. Typical protein solution contained 15-25 mg/ml MeTr in 50 mm Tris pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. For the complexes with CH3-H4folate, a 3-fold molar excess of the 6-S-monoglutarate substrate (Schricks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland) was added to the crystallization mixture. A precipitant stock solution contained 8-15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000, 20-50 mm calcium acetate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol. To obtain single crystals, this stock solution was diluted 50-100-fold in 20% glycerol prior to crystallization. Typically, 4 μl of the stock mixture were added to either 196 μl or 396 μl of 20% glycerol to make the working crystallization solution. Crystals formed two-dimensional plates and were very fragile and difficult to manipulate. All crystals were cryofrozen directly from the drops into the cryostream. The 20% glycerol in the crystallization condition acted as cryoprotectant. Data Collection—The CH3-H4folate/MeTr data set was obtained at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory) X12-C line on a B4 Brandeis CCD 4 cell detector. The CH3-H4folate/N199A data set was also collected at NSLS on the X25 beam line with a MAR345 image plate detector. Diffraction data were integrated with MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and scaled and merged using SCALA (20Evans P.R. Protein Crystallogr. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar) and TRUNCATE (21French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The crystal structure of CH3-H4folate/MeTr was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of MeTr in space group P212121 (PDB code 1F6Y) as the search model. In particular, a MeTr dimer model with all protein atoms and no water molecules was used for the initial molecular replacement in the program EPMR (23Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), yielding a correct solution with a correlation coefficient CC = 0.538 and a residual factor r = 0.466. Unaccounted for electron density in the TIM barrel was modeled as CH3-H4folate with restraints generated from the HIC-Up server. Electron density fitting was performed initially in XtalView (24McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and later in COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The structure was refined with TLS restrained refinement parameters without a σ cutoff and with loose NCS restraints as implemented in REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar, 27Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Since the publication of the apo-MeTr structure, a sequence revision was published for the residues 224-225 (Met-224-Ser-225 to Asp-224-Ala-225). These changes have been incorporated into the current structures. The model also contains a cis-peptide bond between residues Asn-96 and Ser-97 in both subunits and another one between Asn-188 and Pro-189 in the ordered loop of subunit A. In addition, a 6.5-σ electron density peak suggests the presence of a metal ion near residue Asp-224. A metal ion modeled into this electron density is in position to interact with Asp-224, five water molecules, and the carboxyl group of Gly-222, with distances ranging from 2.38 to 2.75 Ä. Based on these oxygen-rich interactions, the bond lengths, and the σ of the electron density peak, a divalent cation such as calcium (present in the crystallization conditions) is a reasonable assignment. In subunit A, the putative calcium ion is well ordered, but in subunit B, it has much weaker density and was modeled at 50% occupancy. The final model for CH3-H4folate/MeTr has excellent stereochemistry (Table 1), and no residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (440 of 469 non-glycine and non-proline residues were in the most favored region, 29 were in the additional allowed region, 0 were in the generously allowed region, and 0 were in the disallowed region). The loop after the sixth helix (184-188) in subunit B is disordered, and these residues were omitted from the final model. The final model has 519 protein residues of MeTr, two calcium atoms, two CH3-H4folate molecules, and 426 ordered water molecules. The CH3-H4folate/N199A structure was solved to 2.3 Ä resolution using rigid body refinement and TLS restrained refinement in REFMAC starting from the CH3-H4folate/MeTr model and keeping analogous reflections in the test set for the Rfree reference. The model was modified by changing Asn-199 to alanine. A Ramachandran plot shows that 440 of 469 non-glycine and non-proline residues are in the most favored region, 28 are in additional allowed region, 1 is in generously allowed region (leucine 162, subunit A), and 0 is in the disallowed region. The final model has 519 protein residues of MeTr, two calcium atoms, two CH3-H4folate molecules, and 357 ordered water molecules. As in the CH3-H4folate/MeTr model, the loop after the sixth helix (184-188) in subunit B is disordered, and these residues were omitted from the final model. Composite omit maps calculated in CNS (28Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were used to check both the CH3-H4-folate/MeTr and the CH3-H4-folate/N199A structures. Effect of Asn-199 on CH3-H4 folate Binding—Since Asn-199 is in hydrogen-bonding contact with N5 of CH3-H4folate, we expected that the N199A mutation would decrease affinity of MeTr for this substrate. However, we do not observe a large decrease in affinity. Based on equilibrium dialysis experiments with the N199A variant and 6S-CH3-H4folate (Fig. 2A), the Kd value is 26.5 ± 8.8 μm, and the enzyme reaches a maximum ratio of 0.95 ± 0.13 mol of CH3-H4folate bound per mol of MeTr at pH 6.1. With the wild-type protein, the Kd value was determined by equilibrium dialysis to be pH-independent between pH 4.9 and 8.5 and is about 2.6-fold lower (10 ± 1 μm) (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Tryptophan residue(s) undergo fluorescence quenching when MeTr binds CH3-H4folate (Fig. 2B) (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Zhao S.Y. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Kd value obtained from tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments is 21.3 ± 1.0 μm for the N199A variant at pH 7.6, which compares with a value between 0.64 μm (17Zhao S.Y. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and 2.1 μm (6Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W.

SUV39H1 increased Cabin1-mediated repression of MEF2 transcriptional activity in MEF2-targeting promoters. The SUV39H1 was revealed to bind to the 501–900-amino acid region of Cabin1, which was distinct from its histone deacetylase-recruiting domain. In addition, the Gal4-Cabin1-(501–900) alone repressed a constitutively active Gal4-tk-promoter, indicating that Cabin1 recruits SUV39H1 and represses transcriptional activity. Finally, both SUV39H1 and Cabin1 were shown to bind on the MEF2 target promoter in a calcium-dependent manner. Thus, Cabin1 recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes, both histone deacetylases and a histone methyltransferase, to repress MEF2 transcriptional activity.

In lymphocyte development, expression of the Nur77 gene, an immediate-early gene involved in apoptosis of autoreactive T cells in response to T cell receptor signaling, is critically regulated by MEF2 (7Youn H.D.

In neuronal cells, MEF2 is implicated in neuronal activity-dependent cell survival, and recently MEF2 has been shown to regulate excitatory synapse number and postsynaptic differentiation of dendrites (8Mao Z.

Covalent modifications of N-terminal tails of histones include acetylation/deacetylation and methylation/demethylation (11Featherstone M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In general, chromatin in the neighborhood of transcriptionally active gene is enriched in acetylated histones, and the enzymes responsible for both acetylation and deacetylation are often recruited to sites where gene expression is to be activated or repressed, respectively (11Featherstone M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Felsenfeld G. Groudine M.

Histone lysine methylation has proven to “mark” chromatin for downstream events that result in the “activation” or “repression” of specific genes and large chromosomal regions (11Featherstone M.

Among the histone methyltransferases involved in the repression process, the best characterized is the human homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Su(var)3–9, SUV39H1 (15Aagaard L. Laible G. Selenko P. Schmid M. Dorn R. Schotta G. Kuhfittig S. Wolf A. Lebersorger A. Singh P.B. Reuter G. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). SUV39H1 has been shown to generate a binding site for the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1 through trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (16Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D.

As with many DNA binding transcriptional factors, MEF2 alters target gene expression by recruiting specific chromatin-modifying activities to promoter regions (6Shalizi A.K. Bonni A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 69: 239-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the absence of transactivating stimuli, MEF2 represses target genes by association with histone deacetylases (HDACs). MEF2 recruits HDAC1/HDAC2 via Cabin1-mSin3 complex or via MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor and directly recruits HDAC4/HDAC5 (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Youn H.D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23515-23521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the presence of transactivating stimuli, the association with HDACs is disrupted and MEF2 recruits a calcineurin-activated transcription factor, NF-AT, and a histone acetyltransferase, p300 (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of the regulation of MEF2 is not fully elucidated. Cabin1, which was initially identified as a calcineurin-binding and -inhibitory protein, is widely expressed in a variety of tissues (22Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of human Cabin1 encodes 2,220 amino acids. A yeast two-hybrid system with a C-terminal 502-amino acid fragment of Cabin1 as bait, MEF2B was initially found to bind Cabin1 via the MADS/MEF2 box (7Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MEF2 is normally sequestered by Cabin1 in a transcriptionally inactive state. In this state, Cabin1 recruits mSin3 and its associated HDAC1 and HDAC2 to mediate transcriptional repression. Cabin1 also inhibits the association between MEF2 and a coactivator, p300. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration induces the dissociation of MEF2 from Cabin1 as a result of competitive binding of activated calmodulin to Cabin1. The release of Cabin1 from MEF2 results in release of HDACs, and it also provides the binding sites for p300 (7Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cabin1-mediated transcriptional repression of MEF2D cannot be fully rescued by HDAC inhibitors (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional chromatin modifications may occur. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that histone methylation contributes to the transcriptional repressive potential of Cabin1 in addition to the chromatin modifications already identified. Plasmids and Antibodies—Myc-Cabin1 (FL), Myc-Cabin1-(320–2220), Myc-Cabin1-(1–1800), Myc-Cabin1-(1–900), Myc-Cabin1-(1–315), Gal4-Cabin1 (FL), pGL-Nur77-(–307 to –242)-luc, Myc-MEF2D, and pOF-MEF2-luc were described previously (7Youn H.D.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6135-6139PubMed Google Scholar). Cabin1-(366–500), Cabin1-(321–700), Cabin1-(501–900), Cabin1-(501–700), and Cabin1-(701–900) were generated by subcloning of EcoR1-BamH1 PCR products from full-length Cabin1 into pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) B (Invitrogen). Gal4-Cabin1-(501–900) was generated by subcloning of EcoR1-BamH1 PCR products into pcDNA3.1/Ga14-myc-His(-) B, which was generated by inserting the Gal4 DNA binding domain into the HindIII site of pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) B (Invitrogen). FLAG-Cabin1 (FL), FLAG-Cabin1-(1–2116), and FLAG-Cabin1-(Δ501–900/FL) were generated by subcloning of PCR products from full-length Cabin1 into pcDNA5/FRT/DEST-FLAG (Invitrogen). cDNA of SUV39H1 was generated by PCR amplification from 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and was cloned into pcDNA3.0-FLAG, which was generated by inserting a FLAG tag in the XbaI site of pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). A bacterial expression construct for SUV39H1 was generated by subcloning of BamH1-SalI PCR fragment into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA of histone H3 was generated by PCR from HEK293 cells and was cloned into pRSET B (Invitrogen). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) or His fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and the proteins were isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies for anti-Cabin1 and anti-MEF2D were described previously (7Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 25Youn H.D. Chatila T.A. Liu J.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4323-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Anti-SUV39H1 (MG44) and anti-trimethylhistone H3(K9) antibodies were purchased from Upstate, anti-p300 (N-15) polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-acetylhistone H3(K9) antibody from Cell Signaling, anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-hemagglutinin (16B12) monoclonal antibodies from Covance, and anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody from Sigma. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Reporter Gene Assay—DO11.10 T hybridoma cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. DO11.10 cells were transfected using electroporation (250 V, 975 μF). HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and then transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation methods or Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). For coimmunoprecipitation assays, transfected cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with suitable antibodies along with Protein-A/G beads (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. For the reporter gene assays, cells were transfected with suitable promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids and expression vectors. Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection. Luciferase activities were measured with a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). Histone Methyltransferase Assay—Nuclear extracts from 3 × 108 DO11.10 cells were immunoprecipitated by anti-Cabin1 rabbit polyclonal antibody or normal rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were divided into 1:2, and each immunoprecipitate was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of appropriate buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 2.5 μg of bacterially purified His-tagged histone H3 as the substrate and 1 μCi of 3H-labeled S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of SDS loading buffer, and samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by gel drying and autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (25Youn H.D. Chatila T.A. Liu J.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4323-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, DO11.10 cells (4 × 107/lane) were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (40 nm) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 3 h. Formaldehyde-treated nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with various antibodies. DNA fragments present in the immunoprecipitates were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR® Green fluorescence on the iQ5 Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Results were normalized by total input DNA using the 2–ΔΔCT calculation method (26Livak K.J. Schmitten T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). The position and sequence of primers used to amplify chromatin immunoprecipitation-enriched DNA spanning the MEF2-responsive elements in the Nur77 promoter were –521 to –498 from the translation start site, 5′-AGGACAGACTGGGAAAGGGACAAA-3′, and –254 to –232, 5′-AGGGAGCGCGGATTGTTTGAT-3′. As a control, the DNA fragments present in the immunoprecipitates were amplified with primers that specifically recognize the coding region of the Nur77, +434 to +456, 5′-GGGTAGGGGGTTGTCTGAGCATG-3′, and +641 to +662, 5′-CCTTCAGCAACCCCCAGGTCTT-3′. Confocal Microscopy—DO11.10 cells were transfected with FLAG-SUV39H1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP), or GFP-Cabin1, or both FLAG-SUV39H1 and GFP-Cabin1. After 30 h of transfection, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then stained with anti-FLAG antibody and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were suspended in 50% (v/v) glycerol containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solutions and loaded on the slide glass and covered with cover glass. Immunofluorescence was observed under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.D., and p value was calculated using Student's t test calculator (www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/ttest.html). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data presented are representative of at least three separate experiments. Cabin1 Recruits an Active Histone Methyltransferase, SUV39H1—To investigate the role of histone methylation on the transcriptional repression of MEF2 by Cabin1, we analyzed whether Cabin1 can recruit any active histone methyltransferase. To initially test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Cabin1 complex from DO11.10 cell nuclear extracts and assayed in vitro histone methyltransferase activity with recombinant histone H3 as the substrate. The immunoprecipitated Cabin1 complex specifically had histone H3 methyltransferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). In mammals, one of the best characterized histone H3 methyltransferases that has repressive potential is SUV39H1 (15Aagaard L. Laible G. Selenko P. Schmid M. Dorn R. Schotta G. Kuhfittig S. Wolf A. Lebersorger A. Singh P.B. Reuter G. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Cabin1 associated with SUV39H1. Mammalian HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged SUV39H1 and for Myc-tagged Cabin1. Cabin1 specifically interacted with SUV39H1, as observed by coimmunoprecipitation using either anti-FLAG antibody or anti-Myc antibody, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Bacterially purified GST-SUV39H1 could also pull down transfected Myc-tagged Cabin1, whereas GST alone could not (Fig. 2C). To ascertain the physiological association of SUV39H1 and Cabin1, we performed immunoprecipitation assay using the endogenous proteins in DO11.10 cells. Anti-SUV39H1 antibody, but not preimmune serum (IgG), could specifically immunoprecipitate Cabin1 (Fig. 2D). Next, we examined whether SUV39H1 and Cabin1 could colocalize in cells. When both GFP-tagged Cabin1 and FLAG-tagged SUV39H1 were cotransfected in DO11.10 cells, a significant portion was found to colocalize in nuclei. Whereas GFP was diffusely distributed in both nuclei and cytosol, GFP and SUV39H1 rarely colocalized within nuclei (Fig. 3). SUV39H1 Increases Cabin1-mediated Repression of MEF2 Transcriptional Activity—To determine the functional consequence of the association between Cabin1 and SUV39H1, we analyzed the role of SUV39H1 in MEF2-targeting promoters. Transcriptional activity of MEF2 was measured by luciferase reporter gene under the control of two tandem MEF2 binding sites (pOF-MEF2-luc) or under the control of two MEF2 binding sites within the minimal Nur77 promoter region (pGL-Nur77-Luc) in DO11.10 cells or HEK293 cells. Cotransfection of MEF2D with luciferase reporter gene enhanced the reporter gene significantly, and this enhanced activity was repressed by additional cotransfection of Cabin1 (FL). Moreover, additional cotransfection of SUV39H1 further inhibited MEF2D-driven activation of the reporter gene whereas Cabin1-(1–2116), which lacks the MEF2 binding domain, did not inhibit MEF2D-driven activation of the MEF2 reporter gene. In addition, SUV39H1 did not synergize with Cabin1-(1–2116) in repression of the MEF2 reporter gene (Fig. 4). These results suggest that SUV39H1 represses MEF2 transcriptional activity via Cabin1. The 501–900-Amino Acid Region of Cabin1 Binds to SUV39H1—To further analyze the role of SUV39H1 in Cabin1-mediated repression of MEF2 transcriptional activity, we first determined the SUV39H1 binding domain within Cabin1. Various truncation mutants of Cabin1 were overexpressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection or labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription and translation. Bacterially purified GST-SUV39H1 was mixed with cell lysates containing Myc-Cabin1 deletion mutants or in vitro translational products of [35S]Cabin1 deletion mutants followed by GST affinity precipitation of SUV39H1 using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The interaction between Cabin1 deletion mutant and SUV39H1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody or autoradiography (Fig. 5, A and B). The N-terminal 900 amino acids of Cabin1 were initially revealed to bind to SUV39H1 (Fig. 5, A and D). Cabin1-(501–900), Cabin1-(501–700), and Cabin1-(701–900) were recruited by SUV39H1 (Fig. 5, B and D). However, neither Cabin1-(1–315) nor Cabin1-(366–500) was recruited by GST-SUV39H1, suggesting Cabin1-(501–900) was responsible for the interaction between Cabin1 and SUV39H1 (Fig. 5, B and D). Pull-down experiments using Cabin1 (FL) and Cabin1-(Δ501–900/FL), which lacks the 501–900-amino acid region of Cabin1, showed that GST-SUV39H1 could recruit Cabin1 (FL) but not Cabin1-(Δ501–900/FL) (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, SUV39H1 bound to Cabin1 at a different site from the MEF2 binding domain (MEF2BD) at the C-terminal of Cabin1 (Fig. 5E). This result suggested that Cabin1 can simultaneously bind to both SUV39H1 and MEF2 via its 501–900 amino acids and C-terminal MEF2BD, respectively. The 501–900-Amino Acid Region of Cabin1 Alone Represses a Constitutively Active Promoter—The 501–900-amino acid region of Cabin1, which was identified as a SUV39H1-interacting domain, is distinct from mSin3 and its associated HDAC-interacting domain, mSin3BD (Fig. 5E) (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because we found that Cabin1 represses MEF2 transcriptional activity by recruiting SUV39H1, we tested whether the 501–900-amino acid region could have repressive ability when recruited to the vicinity of a constitutively active promoter. We thus expressed a fusion protein between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the 501–900-amino acid region of Cabin1 and determined the ability of the resultant fusion protein to repress a constitutively active reporter gene placed in close proximity to multimerized Gal4 binding sites. This fusion protein indeed repressed the reporter gene activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). It has been reported that a fusion protein between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and full-length Cabin1 or the N-terminal 315 amino acids of Cabin1 represses a constitutively active reporter gene placed in close proximity to multimerized Gal4 binding sites, presumably via mSin3 and its associated HDACs (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment Cabin1-(2007–2220), which cannot recruit mSin3 and HDACs, had no repressive effect on the reporter gene activity (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, SUV39H1 did not increase the Cabin1-(Δ501–900/FL)-mediated repression of MEF2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6C). Thus, the repressive potential of Cabin1-(501–900) is probably due to the recruitment of SUV39H1 through Cabin1-(501–900). Both SUV39H1 and Cabin1 Bind on the MEF2 Target Promoter in a Calcium-dependent Manner—To address the physiological association of SUV39H1 on MEF2-regulated promoters, we analyzed the Nur77 promoter, which has been known to be regulated by MEF2D in a calcium-dependent manner (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This promoter contains two MEF2 binding sites (19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of DO11.10 cells revealed that Cabin1 and SUV39H1 bound on the Nur77 promoter in the absence of a calcium signal, but in the presence of a calcium signal both Cabin1 and SUV39H1 were released from the promoter (Fig. 7, A and B) whereas MEF2D bound on the Nur77 promoter both in the absence and presence of a calcium signal and p300 bound on the Nur77 promoter only in the presence of a calcium signal (Fig. 7, A and B). Moreover, in the absence of a calcium signal trimethylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3-K9) was detected, and this trimethylation decreased in the presence of a calcium signal. On the contrary, acetylation of H3-K9 increased in the presence of a calcium signal (Fig. 7, A and B). These findings demonstrate that SUV39H1 is recruited to MEF2 target promoters by association with Cabin1-MEF2 complexes. Calcium signals abrogate the interaction between Cabin1 and MEF2. Consequently, SUV39H1 is also released from MEF2. In this study, we have revealed previously unrecognized interaction between Cabin1 and a histone methyltransferase. Histones are methylated on either lysine or arginine residues. Lysine side chains are mono-, di-, or trimethylated, whereas arginine side chains are monomethylated or (symmetrically or asymmetrically) dimethylated (14Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Cell. 2002; 109: 801-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The methylation of arginine residues has only been linked to active transcription because this modification is solely found on chromatin when genes are actively transcribed (14Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 29Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The methylation of lysine residues can signal either activation or repression, depending on the particular lysine residue that is methylated (30Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Even within the same lysine residue, the biological consequence of methylation can differ depending on the methylation state (31Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E.

Among the lysine residues, the lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9) is the best characterized as a methylation site linked with repression. Among methyltransferases that are responsible for the methylation of the H3-K9, SUV39H1 and G9a are the major H3-K9 methyltransferases in higher eukaryotes; SUV39H1 is the major H3-K9 methyltransferase that is responsible for trimethylation of H3-K9, whereas G9a is the major H3-K9 methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of H3-K9 in euchromatin (33Wu R.

Cell. 2004; 14: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, the best candidates for the methyltransferase that associates with Cabin1 and represses MEF2 transcriptional activity are SUV39H1 and G9a. We first tested whether SUV39H1 is associated with Cabin1 and found that indeed SUV39H1 bound Cabin1 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2). We thus focused on the effect of SUV39H1 on the function of Cabin1. Later we found that G9a is also associated with Cabin1 (data not shown). It will be interesting to further investigate the relationship between G9a and Cabin1. The SUV39H1, mSin3, and MEF2 binding domains in Cabin1 are all distinct (Fig. 5E). Thus, it is possible that Cabin1, MEF2, mSin3 and its associated HDACs, and SUV39H1 make up a complex. The previously known mechanism by which calcium regulates MEF2D in this promoter is through dissociation of calcium-sensitive MEF2 co-repressors (Cabin1/HDACs, HDAC4/5) and the association with the calcineurin-activated transcription factor NF-AT and the coactivator p300 (7Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Youn H.D. Liu J.O. Immunity. 2000; 13: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). From the findings in this study and previous results, the Cabin1-mediated repression mechanism of MEF2 can be depicted like this: Cabin1 is recruited to promoters through its interactions with DNA sequence-specific-binding protein MEF2. The association of Cabin1 with mSin3 and its associated HDACs and histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 provides an efficient mechanism for modifying nucleosomal histone tails. HDACs deacetylate the H3-K9, and then SUV39H1 trimethylates this site, maintaining chromatin in repressive states. Increase of the intracellular calcium concentration abrogates the interaction between Cabin1 and MEF2. Consequently, HDACs and SUV39H1 are also released from MEF2 target promoters. The dissociation of Cabin1 from MEF2 also provides a binding site for histone acetyltransferase p300. Acetylation of histone H3 by p300 makes the chromatin suitable for transcription (Fig. 8). Because SUV39H1 trimethylates H3-K9 and histone acetylation can occur only on the unmethylated lysine, this trimethylated lysine should be demethylated before acetylation. Until recently, histone methylation was thought to be an irreversible process. However, now it is revealed that not only histone phosphorylation and acetylation but also histone methylation are reversible processes. Recently, histone demethylases such as lysine-specific demethylase 1 and JmjC domain-containing proteins JHDM1, JHDM2A, and JMJD2A have been reported (37Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P.

Cell. 2006; 125: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Among them, JMJD2A reverses trimethylated H3-K9 to di- but not mono- or unmethylated products (40Whetstine J.R. Nottke A. Lan F. Huarte M. Smolikov S. Chen Z. Spooner E. Li E. Zhang G. Colaiacovo M. Shi Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (818) Google Scholar), and JHDM2A demethylates mono- and dimethyl H3-K9 (39Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (668) Google Scholar). So, it may be possible that JMJD2A and JHDM2A cooperate in demethylation of trimethyl H3-K9 to unmethylated H3-K9. In this regard, JMJD2A and JHDM2A may be also required in calcium-dependent activation of MEF2 transcriptional activity. It appears that different degrees of methylation are associated with distinct chromatin regions or transcriptional states. Trimethylation of H3-K9 is mainly associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin and transcriptional repression, whereas dimethylation of H3-K9 appears to occur on repressed genes in euchromatin (33Wu R. Terry A.V. Singh P.B. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N.

For example, in retinoblastoma-mediated transcriptional repression of E2F, retinoblastoma is recruited to promoters through its interaction with the DNA sequence-specific-binding protein E2F. Retinoblastoma associates with HDACs and SUV39H1 to repress E2F target promoters (41Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Furthermore, class II HDACs are known to bind MEF2 and repress its transcriptional activity by recruiting class I HDACs and SUV39H1 (21Chan J.K.L. Sun L. Yang X.J. Zhu G. Wu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23515-23521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7302-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are quite parallel to the Cabin1-mediated repression mechanism proposed in Fig. 8. In this study, we found the involvement of SUV39H1, a H3-K9 methyltransferase, in Cabin1-mediated repression of MEF2 transcription factor. Histone methylation is critical for maintaining the chromatin as “activated” or “inactivated” state. Thus, the findings that SUV39H1 associates with Cabin1 and determines the H3-K9 states in MEF2-driven promoters disclose that Cabin1 serves as a co-repressor of MEF2 transcription factor. Moreover, because Cabin1 is a huge protein and has a potential for recruiting other types of proteins involved in transcriptional repression, it will be interesting to further investigate the different types of Cabin1-mediated repression of MEF2 transcription factor."

In mice lacking one copy of Men1, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary adenomas are common. In animals lacking one copy of Rb1, intermediate pituitary and thyroid tumors occur at high frequency, with less frequent development of pancreatic islet hyperplasia and parathyroid lesions. In mice heterozygous for both Men1 and Rb1, pancreatic hyperplasia and tumors of the intermediate pituitary and thyroid occurred at high frequency. Serum measurements of calcium and glucose did not vary significantly between genotypic groups. Loss of heterozygosity at the Rb1 locus was common in pituitary and thyroid tumors, whereas loss of menin was observed in pancreatic and parathyroid lesions. The tumor spectrum in the double heterozygotes was a combination of pathologies seen in each of the individual heterozygotes, without decrease in age of onset, indicating independent, non-additive effects of the two mutations. Together with the lack of increased tumor spectrum, this suggests that menin and pRb function in a common pathway of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2060211381,"Adenoviral proteins interact with host-cell proteins to either exploit or inhibit cellular functions for the purpose of viral propagation. E4orf6, the 34-kDa gene product of the E4 gene, interacts with the double-strand break repair (DSBR) protein DNA-dependent protein kinase and cooperates with binding partner E1B-55K to degrade MRE11, preventing viral DNA concatemer formation. We previously demonstrated that E4orf6 radiosensitizes human tumor cells through the inhibition of DSBR, notably in the absence of E1B-55K. Here, we report that E4orf6 prolongs the signaling of DNA damage by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating γH2AX. The inhibition of PP2A occurs without significant disruption of the DNA re-ligation rate. Prolonged signaling of DNA damage in the presence of E4orf6 initiates caspase-dependent and independent cell death. This is accompanied by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) hyperactivation and the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Knockdown of AIF by shRNA rescues the radiosensitization induced by E4orf6. Taken together, these data suggest that E4orf6 disrupts cellular DSBR signaling by inhibiting PP2A, leading to prolonged H2AX phosphorylation, hyperactivation of PARP, and AIF translocation to the nucleus. The function of E4orf6 as an inhibitor of PP2A and activator of PARP in the absence of other adenoviral gene products is of importance in delineating the adenovirus-host cell interplay.

The function of E4orf6 as an inhibitor of PP2A and activator of PARP in the absence of other adenoviral gene products is of importance in delineating the adenovirus-host cell interplay. Adenovirus has evolved ways to commandeer host cell machinery for successful entry, viral DNA replication, and propagation of progeny virions. For example, the adenovirus E1A gene product binds Rb to release E2F and promote entry into S phase resulting in efficient viral DNA replication. The 34-kDa gene product of the E4 gene, E4orf6, cooperates with the 55-kDa gene product of the E1B gene to degrade p53, preventing an early cellular apoptotic response to infection (1Querido E.

E4orf6 and E1B-55K inhibit both adenoviral DNA concatemer formation, which has been viewed as a cellular defense to viral replication imposed by cellular DNA repair mechanisms (3Weitzman, M.

Both concatemer formation and V(D)J recombination depend on the non-homologous end-joining pathway (4Kienker L.J. Shin E.K. Meek K.

These same DSBR proteins are also required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) following exposure to radiation. The primary mechanism of cytotoxicity from ionizing radiation (IR) is the induction of DNA damage and DSBs, which are known to be the most lethal of DNA lesions (9Smith G. Jackson S.P. Gen.

In addition, an increased capacity of DSBR has been identified as contributing significantly to the radioresistance of gliomas (13Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N. Nature. 2006; 444: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar). Due to these observations, the inhibition of DNA DSBR is an attractive method for radiosensitization; therefore, we recognized the ability of E4orf6 to interfere with cellular DSBR as a great opportunity to exploit E4orf6 for the purpose of radiosensitizing radioresistant tumor cells. We have previously demonstrated that E4orf6, independent of E1B-55K and therefore independent of p53 and MRE11 degradation, is capable of significantly radiosensitizing tumor cells by inhibiting cellular DSBR in response to radiation-induced DSBs (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In E4orf6-expressing cells, we found prolonged levels of H2AX phosphorylation at Ser-139 (γH2AX) and DNA-PK autophosphorylation at Thr-2609 at 360 min post-irradiation, a time when DNA repair should be complete and the repair proteins should be dephosphorylated. However, it was unclear as to whether E4orf6 inhibited the physical re-ligation of the dsDNA breaks or inhibited a step downstream of re-ligation and how this DNA damage signal was translated into increased radiosensitivity. Therefore, we sought to determine the reason for prolonged signaling of damage, as well as the cell death pathway responsible for the radiosensitization. Here, we report our findings on the atypical mechanism of cell death induced by E4orf6 in the presence of DNA damage. In irradiated E4orf6-expressing cells, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) becomes hyperactivated and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus, inducing cell death. The ability to radiosensitize tumor cells through expression of a single gene makes E4orf6 a promising genetic tool to be used in conjunction with standard radiation therapy in the treatment of radioresistant tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Cell Lines, Irradiations, Infections, and Reagents—U251 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. All irradiations were carried out with a 137Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 4.0 Gy (gray)/min. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Infections were performed as previously described (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol.

U251 cells, infected with either null or E4orf6 virus, were irradiated at 40 Gy and harvested by trypsinization. Cells (1.5 × 106) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, mixed with an equal volume of 2.0% agarose, and embedded in plugs. Solidified plugs were immersed in lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% w/v N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt) with freshly added 100 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 55 °C overnight. Lysed plugs were rinsed with storage buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored in storage buffer at 4 °C. For electrophoresis, plugs were cut into thirds and loaded into the wells of a 1.0% agarose gel (in 0.5× TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris/boric acid, 1 mm EDTA)). Electrophoresis was carried out at 12 °C in 0.5X TBE with parameters of 66 V (2.0 V/cm), linearly increasing (50–5000 s) pulse times, and a duration of 48 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated for 20 min in ethidium bromide (1.0 μg/ml in 0.5× TBE), destained for 20 min in 0.5× TBE, and imaged and quantified on a Typhoon 9210 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). All values were normalized to their respective samples at 40 Gy without repair time (total induced damage) and shown as fold decrease in damage over time. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Activity Assay—PP2A activity was measured according to manufacturer’s protocol (catalog 17-313, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Approximately 3 × 106 cells were directly lysed by sonication in imidazole buffer containing complete mini mixture (Roche Applied Science), pepstatin, aprotinin, leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Each sample (500 μg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with PP2A antibody (catalog 05-421). As outlined in the protocol, beads containing precipitated PP2A were added to a phosphatase reaction with threonine phosphopeptide in a shaking incubator. Samples were then aliquoted into three wells of a 96-well plate, into which malachite green detection solution was added. Plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then read at 650 nm on an automated plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol.

Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in TBS-Tween with 1% milk at the following dilutions: PP2A at 1:3000, cleaved caspase-3 at 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), PAR at 1:2000 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), AIF at 1:3000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), lamin a/c at 1:3000 (BD Biosciences), and β-actin at 1:50,000. All membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL Plus chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Optical density of reactive bands was measured by image analysis software (Scion Image; Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) as described previously (15Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A.

AIF Knockdown—Non-selectable pKD-NegCon-v1 (negative control shRNA) and pKD-AIF-v3 (AIF shRNA) plasmids were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The plasmids were digested with NotI and EcoRI restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI) for the shRNA to be subcloned into pSilencer 4.1-CMV puro vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) to obtain the puromycin resistance gene while maintaining the original H1 RNAP III promoter from the Upstate vectors. The reengineered plasmids were used in transfections with U251 cells and Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection the U251 cells were treated with 3 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h, a time point when mock transfected cells were dead. The surviving NegCon and AIF cells were then plated at limited dilution for harvesting of individual clones. Selected cells were maintained in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, and the addition of 100 μm non-essential amino acids and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol aided in their growth. Clonogenic Survival Assay—To analyze clonogenicity in infected and irradiated cells, a modified clonogenic assay was used, due to the sensitivity of the infected cells to the combination of irradiation and replating. U251 clones transfected with negative control or AIF-targeting shRNA were plated in 35-mm plates in triplicate at equal density, infected the next day at an MOI predetermined to yield maximal infectivity, and irradiated 48 h later with a 137Cs source (dose rate of 4.0 Gy/min) at a range of IR doses. When unirradiated control plates were near confluence (at or near day 7 post-IR), the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as previously described (15Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M.

Crystal violet was solubilized in 33% acetic acid and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured in triplicate for each well as described by Bernardi et al. (16Bernardi R.J. Trump D.L. Yu W.-D. McGuire T.F. Hershberger P.A. Johnson C.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4164-4173PubMed Google Scholar). E4orf6 Does Not Inhibit the Re-ligation of DSBs—We previously demonstrated that E4orf6 radiosensitizes human tumor cells by inhibiting DSBR as measured by prolonged γH2AX and Thr-2609-phosphorylated DNA-PK levels and by sublethal damage repair assay in U251 and RKO tumor cells, respectively (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because detection of DSBs (H2AX phosphorylation) and DSB repair complex formation (DNA-PK autophosphorylation) were not inhibited by E4orf6, we hypothesized that E4orf6 was interfering with the late stages of repair resulting in the prolonged signaling of damage at times when complete repair would result in dephosphorylation of H2AX and DNA-PK. However, it remained possible that the physical re-ligation of DSBs is inhibited by E4orf6, perhaps through interference with DNA LigaseIV, the enzyme responsible for ligating breaks during NHEJ. To determine whether E4orf6 inhibits re-ligation of the DSBs, we employed the PFGE method to quantify the DNA DSBs over time based on the ability of damaged DNA to migrate through an agarose gel. U251 cells were infected with null (control) or E4orf6-expressing adenoviral vectors (previously optimized (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). The infected cells were irradiated at 48 h post-infection and harvested at varying times post-irradiation. As measured by PFGE, U251 cells expressing E4orf6 repaired DSBs at a rate similar to those infected with control virus (Fig. 1). There was a trend of E4orf6 attenuating repair at early times post-irradiation; however, this trend was not significant and levels of damage for E4orf6 virus- and null virus-infected U251 cells were overlapping at 360 min post-irradiation (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which effectively blocks DSBR by inhibiting DNA-PK prior to ligase activation, resulted in the persistence of significant levels of damaged DNA at 120 min post-irradiation (Fig. 1) and beyond (data not shown). E4orf6 Inhibits PP2A—Based on the similar rates of re-ligation in null virus- and E4orf6 virus-infected U251 cells, we hypothesized that E4orf6 must inhibit a post-ligation step involving γH2AX dephosphorylation. It was recently demonstrated that PP2A is responsible for the dephosphorylation of γH2AX following repair of radiation-induced DSBs (17Chowdhury D. Keogh M.-C. Ishii H. Peterson C.L. Buratowski S. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the activity of PP2A was altered by E4orf6, resulting in the prolonged phosphorylation of H2AX, by performing in vitro phosphatase reactions with lysates from infected U251 cells. Whereas radiation treatment led to an increase in PP2A activity in null virus-infected U251 cells, PP2A activity in response to IR was significantly inhibited in cells expressing E4orf6 (Fig. 2). The well known inhibitor of PP2A okadaic acid completely inhibited PP2A activity, and no PP2A activity was recovered by a negative control IgG antibody. These data are consistent with the prolonged H2AX phosphorylation in the presence of E4orf6 (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and suggest that the inhibition of PP2A activity contributed to the increased sensitivity of E4orf6-expressing cells to IR. Induction of PARP Activation and PARP-induced Cell Death in Irradiated E4orf6-expressing U251 Cells—Despite the almost complete re-ligation of DSBs, E4orf6 significantly sensitizes cells to die in response to IR. Thus, we hypothesized that the prolonged signaling of damage initiates a cell death program in E4orf6-expressing cells. Time-lapse microscopy suggested that a significant portion of infected cells undergo apoptotic death, observed by the formation of membrane blebs and spikes in the days following irradiation (data not shown). Representative phase microscopy images shown in Fig. 3A demonstrate similar amounts of rounded cells between null virus- and E4orf6 virus-infected U251 populations 48 h following IR. We decided to further characterize apoptosis in these U251 cells. Since caspase-3 is a terminal caspase activated by various apoptotic stimuli, we analyzed caspase-3 cleavage in response to infection and irradiation. The level of cleaved caspase-3 beginning at 48 h post-irradiation were similar to that induced by treatment with staurosporine but did not differ significantly between null virus-infected and E4orf6 virus-infected U251 cells (Fig. 3B); therefore, caspase-dependent cell death is unlikely to be responsible for the significant radiosensitization induced by E4orf6. One well characterized caspase-independent mechanism of DNA damage-induced cell death is via PARP hyperactivation. PARP is activated by nicked DNA and responds by covalently modifying signaling and repair proteins with the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) in polymers of varying length. PARP is necessary for cell survival under conditions of mild DNA damage (18Bouchard V.J. Rouleau M. Poirier G.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar); however, in the presence of excessive DNA damage (or unrepaired DNA damage) hyperactivation of PARP leads to induction of a caspase-independent cell death program (20Wang H. Yu S.-W. Koh D.W. Lew J. Coombs C. Bowers W. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10963-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To determine the PARP response in null virus-infected and E4orf6 virus-infected cells, we analyzed the presence of PAR-modified proteins with an antibody recognizing PAR polymers. We observed PAR modified proteins under control conditions and an induction in newly ribosylated proteins within 30 min of radiation treatment. In null virus-infected U251 cells this increase in ribosylation returned to baseline levels within 2 h post-IR (black arrows, Fig. 4A), a time when the majority of dsDNA breaks have been repaired (Fig. 1). However, in irradiated E4orf6-expressing cells, there was a significant and continual increase in PAR-modified proteins (black asterisks, Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. These results mirror the effects of E4orf6 on prolonged H2AX phosphorylation and DNA-PK autophosphorylation following IR and suggest that this difference in the PARP-dependent cellular response to IR between null virus-infected and E4orf6 virus-infected cells could be responsible for the radiosensitization by E4orf6. To determine whether the PARP activation plays a role in cell death induction in the presence of E4orf6, we decided to analyze AIF, a key effector molecule downstream of PARP hyperactivation.FIGURE 4E4orf6 induces PARP hyperactivation and AIF translocation to the nucleus in response to IR. A, PARP activation was analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes PAR polymers ranging in length from 2–50 units; black arrows represent IR-responsive bands, and black asterisks denote E4orf6-dependent, IR-induced PAR-modified proteins. B, AIF translocation to the nucleus as assayed by immunoblotting for AIF levels in cytoplasmic or nuclear cell lysates; STS, a powerful inducer of AIF translocation, was used as a positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AIF is a mitochondrial resident protein and has been identified as a downstream modulator of PARP activity (21Yu S.-W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). PARP hyperactivation in the presence of massive DNA damage leads to disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the release of AIF from the outer mitochondrial membrane (22Yu S.-W. Wang H. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 14: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Once released from the mitochondria, AIF translocates to the nucleus and aids in events characteristic of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, high molecular weight DNA fragmentation requiring endonuclease G, and phosphatidylserine exposure (23Wang X. Yang C. Chai J. Shi Y. Xue D. Science. 2002; 298: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We measured AIF translocation to the nucleus by subcellular fractionation of nuclei and immunoblotting. The nuclear levels of AIF were elevated in E4orf6-expressing U251 cells, compared with null virus-infected cells in response to IR (Fig. 4B). Staurosporine (STS), a chemical inducer of apoptosis by both AIF-dependent and caspase-3 dependent means, also induced substantial AIF nuclear translocation. Therefore, the higher levels of AIF released from the mitochondria in response to IR in the E4orf6-expressing cells could mediate all, or part of, the observed radiosensitization induced by E4orf6. E4orf6-induced Radiosensitization Is AIF-dependent—To determine whether radiosensitization by E4orf6 is dependent upon AIF translocation, we established U251 clones stably expressing shRNA against AIF or a negative control shRNA that does not target any known proteins. Fig. 5A shows the level of AIF knockdown in a mixed population and an individual clone, as well as the normal levels of AIF in control shRNA-expressing cells. AIF shRNA induced a decrease in AIF protein of ∼83% in clone AIF.1 compared with the control clone. When the individual clones were analyzed for clonogenic survival following IR, E4orf6 radiosensitized the control shRNA clone to a similar degree as untransfected U251 cells. However, the cells expressing AIF shRNA were significantly more radioresistant (Fig. 5B). This indicates that AIF-dependent cell death significantly contributes to the increase in radiation-induced cell death in the presence of E4orf6. However, AIF knockdown cells retain some ability to undergo caspase-3 cleavage in response to IR (Fig. 5C). This could be due to the incomplete knockdown of AIF protein and/or the presence of AIF-independent caspase activation in the presence of E4orf6. Interestingly, in the absence of AIF, control infected U251 cells are deficient in IR-induced caspase-3 cleavage but are only modestly more resistant to IR (data not shown) suggesting that caspase-3 cleavage is not a significant contributor to radiation-induced cell death in the absence of E4orf6. Tumor therapy regimens of the most aggressive cancers, such as GBM have become multi-modality by including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Clinically, it is possible to deliver localized and very large doses of IR by stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery; however, a proportion of GBM tumor cells will survive these high doses of IR and continue to proliferate. There is a need for novel therapeutics, and it is ideal to explore radiosensitizers, as the survival time for patients with GBMs and other radioresistant tumors increases significantly from the addition of therapeutics that potentiate the radiation treatments (24Stupp R.

Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (15071) Google Scholar). We have previously identified E4orf6 as a potent radiosensitizer of glioblastoma cells in vitro (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we further define the action of E4orf6 in the presence of IR and report an atypical mechanism of cell death by which E4orf6 induces tumor cell radiosensitization. We demonstrate that E4orf6 has the ability to inhibit DSBR by prolonging signaling from DSBs, despite the physical repair of DNA damage. These data suggest that E4orf6 does not significantly inhibit the recruitment or activity of DNA Ligase IV. Because our previous data showed that E4orf6 inhibits the dephosphorylation of DSBR complex proteins H2AX and DNA-PK, we conclude that E4orf6 interferes with the very late stages of repair, after re-ligation of the break but before complex dissociation and dephosphorylation. These late, postligation events of repair have been established to be as important as physical re-ligation in conferring radioresistance. The repair complex proteins must undergo a conformational change and dissociate to signal complete repair (25Block W.D. Yu Y. Merkle D. Gifford J.L. Ding Q. Meek K. Lees-Miller S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4351-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Ding Q. Reddy Y.V.R. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This finding highlights the sensitive nature with which cells react to prolonged signaling of damage, despite the physical repair of damage. In the case of E4orf6, the DSBs resulting from IR are repaired at a similar rate to control cells, but PP2A activity is compromised by E4orf6 rendering γH2AX unable to be dephosphorylated, and therefore, the cells respond as if significant levels of unrepaired damage remain by inducing cell death. We also report that PARP-induced cell death is a consequence of the prolonged DSB signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an adenoviral protein elicits PARP activation in response to cellular stress, such as DNA damage. As a well defined downstream mediator of PARP activation, AIF translocation contributes a significant amount of cell death in E4orf6-expressing cells exposed to radiation. The rescue of radiosensitization in AIF knockdown cells was incomplete (93%). Although not significant, this trend could be attributed to the incomplete AIF knockdown or the possibility of an AIF-independent pathway contributing to the cell death induced by E4orf6. AIF-independent caspase-3 cleavage is a likely component responsible for this alternate pathway. Caspase-3 cleavage induced by IR is decreased but still present in AIF knockdown cells, suggesting that caspase-3 cleavage is induced in cells expressing E4orf6 but not a major contributor to radiosensitization. Therefore, the caspase-3 cleavage observed in AIF-expressing cells was partially AIF-independent, a possibility that is consistent with published reports of both AIF-dependent and independent caspase activation in response to mitochondrial dysfunction (20Wang H. Yu S.-W. Koh D.W. Lew J. Coombs C. Bowers W. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10963-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Yu S.-W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). In control-infected cells, the contribution of mitotic cell death and cell cycle arrest are likely the major contributors to decreased clonogenicity in response to IR, which is supported by the nearly complete lack of caspase-3 cleavage in the absence of AIF with insignificant effects on radioresistance. In extrapolating from these studies, the possibility exists that PARP-induced AIF-dependent cell death is a more general response to the presence of unrepaired DSBs, a possibility that warrants further investigation. How does prolonged or excessive PARP activation lead to AIF release? Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, data support a model in which the depletion of cellular energy from the large scale addition of PAR polymers to cellular proteins (27Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) leads to a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and AIF release. We attempted to determine whether addition of pyruvate or NAD+, having been shown to restore cellular energy pools (28Zong W.-X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.-Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), could inhibit AIF translocation in E4orf6-expressing and irradiated cells. However, these attempts were not successful. This is likely due to the fact that in the studies in which pyruvate and NAD+ were used, the stress was acute, while in our experimental system, E4orf6 causes a prolonged, modest level of sustained PARP hyperactivation. The rate of repair is important in determining radioresistance or radiosensitivity, as much as the levels of damage remaining at 360 min post-irradiation. With that being said, however, the level of radiosensitization achieved with Wortmannin treatment (10 μm) is about one log at 8 Gy (29Kubota N. Okada S. Inada T. Ohnishi K. Ohnishi T. Cancer Lett. 2000; 161: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), similar to the one log of sensitization at 8 Gy achieved by E4orf6 (14Hart L.S. Yannone S.M. Naczki C. Orlando J.S. Waters S.B. Akman S.A. Chen D.J. Ornelles D. Koumenis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); therefore, a discrepancy exists between the DSB re-ligation rate and radiosensitization when E4orf6 is compared with a chemical inhibitor of DSBR. Thus, the high level of radiosensitization by E4orf6 cannot be explained alone by the slight alteration in the rate of early repair. Rather, as suggested by our data, this can be explained by the signaling effects of γH2AX and PARP at late times post-irradiation when damage levels are similar between E4orf6 and control-infected cell populations. Another noteworthy finding it that there is an apparent delay between the prolonged γH2AX and PARP signaling at 360 min post-IR and the onset of morphological cell death, beginning at 48 h post-IR as observed with time-lapse microscopy (data not shown). It remains possible that the early inhibition of DSBR, as witnessed by prolonged γH2AX levels in E4orf6-expressing cells, is propagated by cellular replication, which was observed prior to cell death in the time-lapse videos. Both null virus-infected and E4orf6 virus-infected cells continued to proliferate following exposure to IR, suggesting defective cell cycle control, likely attributed to the presence of mutated p53 in U251 cells (30Asai A. Miyagi Y. Sugiyama A. Gamanuma M. Hong S. Takamoto S. Nomura K. Matsutani M. Takakura K. Kuchino Y. J. Neurooncol. 1994; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, it is the cells expressing E4orf6 and prolonged γH2AX signaling that propagate the DNA damage response resulting in a significant increase in death, in contrast to control, repair-proficient cells that proliferate without amplifying DNA damage. Another explanation for a delay in the onset of death is the possibility that the E4orf6-expressing cells require more than 360 min for the PARP activation to translate into a death signal, such as from the depletion of cellular energy. This is supported by published data confirming the role of PARP in DNA repair and survival at low doses of IR but inducing cell death at higher levels of damage (18Bouchard V.J. Rouleau M. Poirier G.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol.

This is consistent with reports suggesting the almost immediate onset of death following AIF translocation. We therefore propose a model by which aberrant γH2AX signaling is sufficient to induce PARP hyperactivation and eventual AIF translocation to the nucleus, resulting in cell death in the presence of E4orf6 (Fig. 6). Collectively, our results point to an atypical apoptotic response as a significant contributor to E4orf6-induced radiosensitization.

Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with BMS-387032 led to a stabilization of the E2F1 protein that was accompanied by significant increases in the p57 mRNA and protein. This increase did not occur in an E2F1-deficient cell line. An E2F1-estrogen receptor fusion protein activated the endogenous p57 promoter in response to hydroxytamoxifen treatment in the presence of cycloheximide. Luciferase constructs driven by the p57 promoter verified that upregulation of p57 mRNA by BMS-387032 is transcriptional and dependent on E2F-binding sites in the promoter. Expression of exogenous p57 significantly decreased the fraction of cells in S phase. Furthermore, p57-deficient MDA-MB-231 cell lines were significantly more sensitive to BMS-387032-induced apoptosis than controls. The results presented in this manuscript demonstrate that small molecule cdk inhibitors transcriptionally activate p57 dependent upon E2F1 and that this activation in turn serves to limit E2F1's death-inducing activity."

Here we show that the binding site for integrins on Mss4 is overlapping with those for Rab GTPases. Functional analysis of the Mss4/integrin interaction revealed its importance for activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and remodeling of secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The exocytosis of all the proteins analyzed, however, was unaffected. Furthermore, our data suggest that Mss4 drives the coordinated action of the MT1-MMP/integrin protein complex, thus regulating the presence and activation of MT1-MMP at newly formed filopodia and lamellipodia. This in turn facilitates the conversion of pro-MMPs to MMPs, resulting in cleavage and remodeling of ECM proteins.
