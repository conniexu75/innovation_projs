https://openalex.org/W2034994370,"A major problem worldwide is the potential loss of fisheries, forests, and water resources. Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES."

In the past decade, an avalanche of research has shown that many real networks, independent of their age, function, and scope, converge to similar architectures, a universality that allowed researchers from different disciplines to embrace network theory as a common paradigm. The decade-old discovery of scale-free networks was one of those events that had helped catalyze the emergence of network science, a new research field with its distinct set of challenges and accomplishments."
https://openalex.org/W2038976543,"T Follicular Helper Cell Differentiation When B cells respond to an infection, they often require help from CD4 + T cells to mount a proper response. It is thought that a subset of CD4 + effector T cells, called T follicular helper cells (T FH ), performs this function. Several subsets of effector CD4 + T cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. Whether this is also the case for T FH cells has not been clear (see the Perspective by Awasthi and Kuchroo ). Nurieva et al. (p. 1001 , published online 23 July) and Johnston et al. (p. 1006 ; published online 16 July) now demonstrate that the transcription factor Bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for T FH differentiation and subsequent B cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. Johnston et al. also show that expression of Bcl6 and the transcription factor, Blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in T FH cells and that, when ectopically expressed, Blimp-1 inhibits T FH development."
https://openalex.org/W2116803339,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are important for antiviral and autoimmune responses. Retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) proteins mediate IFN production in response to cytosolic double-stranded RNA or single-stranded RNA containing 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp). Cytosolic B form double-stranded DNA, such as poly(dA-dT)•poly(dA-dT) [poly(dA-dT)], can also induce IFN-β, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the cytosolic poly(dA-dT) DNA is converted into 5′-ppp RNA to induce IFN-β through the RIG-I pathway. Biochemical purification led to the identification of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) as the enzyme responsible for synthesizing 5′-ppp RNA from the poly(dA-dT) template. Inhibition of RNA Pol-III prevents IFN-β induction by transfection of DNA or infection with DNA viruses. Furthermore, Pol-III inhibition abrogates IFN-β induction by the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila and promotes the bacterial growth. These results suggest that RNA Pol-III is a cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune responses. Type I interferons (IFNs) are important for antiviral and autoimmune responses.

Furthermore, Pol-III inhibition abrogates IFN-β induction by the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila and promotes the bacterial growth. These results suggest that RNA Pol-III is a cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune responses. Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Host cells utilize their pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The Toll-like receptor family (TLRs) is one class of PRRs that recognize PAMPs including lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and unmethylated CpG DNA (reviewed by Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7876) Google Scholar). Ligand-engaged TLRs recruit the adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF to activate downstream kinases including IκB kinase complex (IKK) and IKK-related kinases (TBK1 and IKKɛ), which activate the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), respectively. NF-κB and IRFs function together in the nucleus to induce type I interferons (IFNs; e.g., IFN-α and IFN-β) and other cytokines. In another PRR pathway, cytosolic RNAs are recognized by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 (Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. The RNA helicase RIG-I has an essential function in double-stranded RNA-induced innate antiviral responses.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2888) Google Scholar). RLRs contain RNA helicase domains that recognize viral double-stranded RNA. In addition, RIG-I and LGP2 contain a C-terminal regulatory domain that recognizes single-stranded RNA containing 5′-triphosphate, which distinguishes foreign (e.g., viral) RNAs from self-RNAs that normally contain 5′ modification (e.g., capped mRNA). RIG-I and MDA5 also contain N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), which interact with the CARD domain of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, VISA, and CARDIF) (Kawai et al., 2005Kawai T.

MAVS localizes on the mitochondrial outer membrane through its C-terminal transmembrane domain, and this localization is important for MAVS to activate the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1 to induce IFNs (Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B.

Like RNA, accumulation of foreign or self-DNA in the cytosol also triggers potent innate immune responses. DNA can be introduced into the cytosol of mammalian cells after infection with DNA viruses or bacteria, and the detection of cytosolic DNA is important for mounting an immune response against these pathogens. Under certain conditions, self-DNA is inappropriately delivered to the cytosol, resulting in autoimmune responses. For example, DNase II-deficient macrophages lack the ability to digest self-DNA from engulfed apoptotic cells, leading to IFN-β production (Okabe et al., 2005Okabe Y. Kawane K. Akira S. Taniguchi T. Nagata S. Toll-like receptor-independent gene induction program activated by mammalian DNA escaped from apoptotic DNA degradation.J. Exp.

Lethal anemia caused by interferon-beta produced in mouse embryos carrying undigested DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cytosolic DNA induces IFNs is not well understood. In particular, the sensor that detects cytosolic DNA and triggers IFN production has remained largely unknown. Although DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) has been proposed to be a potential cytosolic DNA sensor (Takaoka et al., 2007Takaoka A. Wang Z. Choi M.K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Ban T. Lu Y. Miyagishi M. Kodama T. Honda K. et al.DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) is a cytosolic DNA sensor and an activator of innate immune response.Nature. 2007; 448: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), DAI-deficient mice still produce interferons in response to B form DNA and have similar innate and adaptive immune responses to those of wild-type mice (Ishii et al., 2008Ishii K.J. Kawagoe T. Koyama S. Matsui K. Kumar H. Kawai T. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Takeshita F. Coban C. et al.TANK-binding kinase-1 delineates innate and adaptive immune responses to DNA vaccines.Nature. 2008; 451: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recent studies identify AIM2 as a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the inflammasome and caspase-1 (reviewed by Schroder et al., 2009Schroder K. Muruve D.A. Tschopp J. Innate immunity: cytoplasmic DNA sensing by the AIM2 inflammasome.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R262-R265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, AIM2 is not involved in type I interferon induction by cytosolic DNA. Genetic studies have shown that cytosolic DNA can induce IFN production in mouse cells lacking RIG-I or MAVS, suggesting that the DNA signaling pathway is distinct from the RIG-I pathway (Ishii et al., 2006Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. et al.A Toll-like receptor-independent antiviral response induced by double-stranded B-form DNA.Nat.

The specific and essential role of MAVS in antiviral innate immune responses.Immunity. 2006; 24: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is evidence that in certain human cell lines the induction of IFN-β by transfected double-stranded DNA depends on RIG-I and MAVS (Cheng et al., 2007Cheng G. Zhong J. Chung J. Chisari F.V. Double-stranded DNA and double-stranded RNA induce a common antiviral signaling pathway in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 9035-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Ishii et al., 2006Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. et al.A Toll-like receptor-independent antiviral response induced by double-stranded B-form DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). However, RIG-I binds to RNA but not DNA, raising the question of how DNA might activate the RIG-I pathway. In this report, we show that the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) poly(dA-dT)•poly(dA-dT), herein referred to as poly(dA-dT), is converted to an RNA species in the cytosol to trigger the RIG-I pathway in human and mouse cells. This RNA species contains 5′-triphosphate and forms a double-stranded RNA. The conversion of DNA to RNA can be recapitulated in vitro with cytosolic extracts. Biochemical purification led to the identification of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase III (Pol-III) as the enzyme responsible for transcribing the DNA template into an RNA ligand that activates RIG-I. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Pol-III expression or inhibition of its enzymatic activity impedes interferon induction by transfection of DNA or infection with several DNA viruses, including adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Moreover, Pol-III inhibition blocks interferon induction by the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila. These results strongly suggest that Pol-III is a cytosolic DNA sensor that triggers type I interferon production through the RIG-I pathway. In the course of attempting to identify a cytosolic DNA sensor involved in IFN-β production, HEK293 cells were transfected with various DNA together with a luciferase reporter driven by the IFN-β promoter. The cell lysates were analyzed by luciferase activity assays as well as native gel electrophoresis to detect IRF3 dimerization (Figure 1A). As controls, the cells were also transfected with the synthetic RNA poly(I:C) or infected with Sendai virus (SeV), an RNA virus known to induce IFN-β. Among the DNA tested, including poly(dA-dT), poly(dI-dC)•dpoly(dI-dC) [poly(dI-dC)], calf thymus DNA, PCR fragments of different lengths, and a linearized plasmid (pcDNA3), only poly(dA-dT) could activate IRF3 and induce IFN-β. Silencing the expression of RIG-I or MAVS with two different pairs of small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos strongly inhibited IRF3 and IFN-β induction by poly(dA-dT) (Figure 1B). Pretreatment of poly(dA-dT) with DNase-I completely abrogated its ability to induce IFN-β, whereas RNase A treatment had no effect (Figure 1C), indicating that RIG-I-dependent induction of IFN-β was not due to some RNA contaminants in poly(dA-dT). Synthetic DNA oligos containing 50 or 100 nucleotides of AT sequence were potent inducers of IFN-β, whereas GCAT or GC sequences of comparable lengths had little activity (Figure S1 available online). Interestingly, insertion of 10 GC nucleotides in the middle of AT50 abolished its IFN-β-inducing activity. Poly-T, poly-A, or the duplex DNA formed between poly-T and poly-A did not induce IFN-β. A duplex DNA containing 80% AT sequence was capable of inducing IFN-β, whereas a DNA containing 50% AT sequence was inactive (Figure S1). Taken together, these results suggest that IFN induction by DNA in HEK293 cells requires AT-rich sequence and certain length (30–50 nucleotides, see below). Poly(dA-dT), but not other DNA tested, also activated IRF3 and induced IFN-β in HeLa cells; the IRF3 activation was inhibited by RNAi of RIG-I or MAVS (Figure S2), indicating that RIG-I-dependent induction of IFN-β by poly(dA-dT) is not restricted to HEK293 cells. To identify the ligands responsible for RIG-I activation in cells transfected with poly(dA-dT), we extracted nucleic acids from the cell lysates with phenol and chloroform and tested the ability of these nucleic acids to induce IFN-β. The nucleic acids extracted from cells transfected with poly(dA-dT) potently induced IFN-β. Surprisingly, the activity of nucleic acids extracted from poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells was sensitive to RNase A, but not DNase I, suggesting that some intermediary RNAs capable of inducing IFN-β were activated or produced after poly(dA-dT) transfection (Figure 1D). To test whether the production of IFN-inducing RNA depends on the length and/or composition of cytosolic DNA, we transfected synthetic DNA oligos, as well as longer poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC) (purchased from GE Healthcare), into HEK293-IFNβ-Luc reporter cells to measure IFN-β induction by the DNA. RNA from the transfected cells was extracted, then transfected into the same IFN-β reporter cells to measure IFN-β induction by the RNA (Figure 1E). Interestingly, poly(dA-dT) containing as few as 30 base pairs was capable of directing the production of IFN-inducing RNA in the transfected cells. By contrast, even long poly(dG-dC) and GCAT DNA sequences were unable to produce any IFN-inducing RNA. Previous studies showed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking RIG-I or MAVS were still capable of producing IFN-β after transfection of DNA, including poly(dA-dT) (Ishii et al., 2006Ishii K.J. Coban C. Kato H. Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. et al.A Toll-like receptor-independent antiviral response induced by double-stranded B-form DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, Sun et al., 2006Sun Q. Sun L. Liu H.H. Chen X. Seth R.B. Forman J. Chen Z.J. The specific and essential role of MAVS in antiviral innate immune responses.Immunity. 2006; 24: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To determine whether the transfection of DNA in MEF cells also leads to the generation of IFN-inducing RNA, we transfected MAVS-deficient primary MEF cells with various DNA and then measured IFN-β production by ELISA. Indeed, poly(dA-dT), poly(dI-dC), and calf thymus DNA, but not Sendai virus infection, induced IFN-β production in MAVS-deficient MEF cells (Figure 1F). When RNA extracted from these cells was transfected into HEK293-IFNβ-Luc reporter cells, only the RNA extracted from poly(dA-dT)-transfected and Sendai virus-infected cells was capable of inducing IFN-β (Figure 1G). These results suggest that MEF cells possess two cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways, one detecting DNA irrespective of sequence composition and inducing IFN-β through a MAVS-independent mechanism, and the other recognizing the poly(dA-dT) sequence and producing RNA ligands that trigger the RIG-I-MAVS pathway. Both poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC) DNA induced IFN-β in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), but only RNAs extracted from poly(dA-dT)-transfected BMDMs were capable of inducing IFN-β when they were transfected into the HEK293-IFNβ-Luc reporter cells (Figures 1H and 1I). Therefore, poly(dA-dT) leads to the generation of IFN-inducing RNA not only in transformed cells (HEK293 and HeLa), but also in primary fibroblasts (MEFs) and macrophages. RIG-I recognizes dsRNA and ssRNA bearing 5′-triphosphate (Hornung et al., 2006Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzozka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.K. Schlee M. et al.5′-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.Science. 2006; 314: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, Pichlmair et al., 2006Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Naslund T.I.

To determine the features of the IFN-inducing RNA generated in cells transfected with poly(dA-dT), we treated the RNA isolated from HEK293 cells with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) or polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and then tested its ability to induce IFN-β (Figure 2A). The activity of the RNA was destroyed by SAP, but not PNK treatment. Using PNK to add one phosphate to the SAP-treated RNA did not restore the activity, indicating that RNA containing 5′-monophosphate fails to induce IFN-β. Treatment of the RNA extracted from poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells with terminator exonuclease (Ter Ex), an enzyme that specifically digests RNA containing 5′-monophosphate, did not impair the IFN-inducing activity of the RNA (Figure 2B, lower panel), whereas treatment with RNase If (an RNase sensitive to heat inactivation) destroyed IFN-β induction. Control experiments showed that Ter Ex efficiently degraded 5′-monophosphate (5′-p) RNA generated by the treatment of RNA with SAP followed by PNK (Figure 2B; upper panel). These results show that the IFN-inducing RNA contained more than one phosphate at the 5′ end, most likely 5′-triphosphate (see the Discussion). Next, to determine the structure of the intermediary RNA, we treated the RNA with RNases known to be specific for ssRNA or dsRNA. The specificity of the RNases was tested with in vitro-synthesized ssRNA or dsRNA (Figure 2C, upper panel). RNase III specifically digests dsRNA, but not ssRNA, whereas RNase T1 has the opposite specificity. ssRNA was more sensitive to digestion by low concentration of RNase A than was dsRNA. When the RNA from poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells was treated with RNase III and a high concentration of RNase A that degrades dsRNA, it lost its ability to induce IFN-β. By contrast, RNase T1 or a low concentration of RNase A, which degrades ssRNA, had no effect on the ability of the RNA to induce IFN-β (Figure 2C, lower panel). These results suggest that the IFN-inducing RNA from poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells is double-stranded RNA containing 5′-triphosphate. To determine whether the RNA is a RIG-I ligand, we immunoprecipitated RIG-I from HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged RIG-I using a FLAG-specific antibody (M2). The RNA in the immunoprecipitates was extracted and tested for IFN-β induction (Figure 2D). The RNA extracted from the RIG-I complex immunoprecipitated from poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells induced IFN-β, whereas the RIG-I complex from mock-transfected cells did not contain IFN-inducing RNA. Taken together, these results indicate that poly(dA-dT) instructs or stimulates the production of dsRNA containing 5′-triphosphate, which binds to and activates RIG-I. There are at least two potential mechanisms by which poly(dA-dT) leads to the generation of IFN-inducing RNA. Poly(dA-dT) might activate certain enzymes such as RNA kinases, which modify endogenous RNAs and convert them into RIG-I ligands. Alternatively, poly(dA-dT) might serve as a template to direct the de novo synthesis of RNA by some enzymes, such as a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. To determine whether RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol-II) is involved in the synthesis of the IFN-inducing RNA, we transfected poly(dA-dT) into HEK293 cells that were pretreated with the RNA Pol-II inhibitor α-amanitin, and then total RNA was extracted from the cells and transfected into the IFN-β reporter cell line. α-amanitin blocked the transcription of IFN-β induced by poly(dA-dT) (Figure S3A), but did not inhibit the generation of the RNA, which, when extracted from the drug-treated cells and retransfected into HEK293-IFN-β reporter cells, was still capable of inducing IFN-β (Figure S3B). These results indicate that RNA polymerase II is not involved in transcribing the intermediary RNA from poly(dA-dT). Actinomycin D, which intercalates GC-rich double-stranded DNA and blocks transcriptional elongation, also did not prevent the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells (Figure S3B), suggesting that either actinomycin D did not inhibit transcription from poly(dA-dT) or the RNA was not generated through de novo synthesis. To dissect the mechanism by which poly(dA-dT) leads to the production of IFN-inducing RNA, we tested whether the DNA can trigger the RNA generation in a cell-free system. HeLa cytosolic extracts (S100) were incubated with poly(dA-dT), ATP, MgCl2, and RNase inhibitors at 30°C for 1 hr, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and DNase I treatment. The RNA was then tested for IFN-β induction. Remarkably, the RNA generated in this cell-free system potently activated the IFN-β promoter (Figure 3A). This activity was abolished by RNase but not DNase treatment, indicating that the IFN-inducing activity was not due to contaminating poly(dA-dT) (Figure 3A). Similar to the cell-based assays, poly(dG-dC), poly(dI-dC), or calf thymus DNA was incapable of triggering the production of IFN-inducing RNA in the in vitro system (Figure S4A). The cell lysates from human (HEK293 and THP1) and mouse (MEF and Raw264.7) cell lines were also capable of generating IFN-inducing RNA in the presence of poly(dA-dT) (Figure S4B). Furthermore, the RNA generated in vitro lost its ability to induce IFN-β after treatment with SAP or the enzymes that digest dsRNA (RNase III and high concentration of RNase A), but not those that digest ssRNA (RNase T1 and RNase A at low concentration) (Figures S4C and S4D). The in vitro-generated IFN-inducing RNA was also resistant to terminator exonuclease, indicating that it does not contain 5′-monophosphate (Figure S4E). These results indicate that the cell-free system that we established faithfully recapitulates the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in poly(dA-dT)-transfected cells. To identify the factors required for the generation of IFN-inducing RNA, we first divided HeLa cytosolic extracts (S100) into two parts by 40% and 40%–80% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitates were dialyzed (5 kDa cutoff) and then assayed for their ability to generate IFN-inducing RNA in the presence of poly(dA-dT) and ATP. Surprisingly, the 40% and 40%–80% fractions did not have the activity either alone or in combination (Figure 3B), suggesting that some factors were lost during dialysis or were not precipitated by 80% ammonium sulfate. To test whether HeLa S100 contains some small molecules or other heat-resistant factors required for the production of IFN-inducing RNA, we treated HeLa S100 at 75°C for 15 min to precipitate most proteins, and the supernatant (“heat sup”) was tested for its ability to support the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in the presence of the dialyzed fractions from ammonium sulfate precipitation. Addition of the “heat sup” to the reaction containing 40% ammonium sulfate-precipitated proteins led to a robust production of IFN-inducing RNA (Figure 3B). The activity in the “heat sup” was resistant to proteinase K, DNase I, and RNase If (Figure S5A) and could penetrate through a filter with 5 kDa molecular weight cutoff (data not shown), suggesting that some small molecules were required for generating IFN-inducing RNA. We purified the small molecules through the purification scheme indicated in Figure 3C and found two distinct peaks of activity in the last step of purification using a gel filtration column (Superdex peptide; Figure 3D). The fractions from both peaks had maximum absorption at 254 nanometer (data not shown), suggesting that they might be nucleotides or derivatives of nucleotides. Two active fractions (18 and 21) from the Superdex peptide column were further analyzed by LC-MS (Figure S6) and NMR (Figure 3E). LC-MS analysis (see the Supplemental Data for details) of fraction 21 (F21) indicated the presence of UDP with an m/z of 403.0 [M–H]+, although the signal was partially masked by the presence of HEPES buffer (Figure S6). The 1H NMR spectrum of F21 measured in D2O at 600 MHz showed the characteristic signals of a uridine nucleotide: two aromatic doublets at δ 7.89 and 5.91 ppm, an anomeric doublet at 5.87 ppm, and overlapping multiplets of the ribose (Figure 3E). Comparison to an authentic standard of UDP in D2O with 10 μM HEPES and 40 μM KCl showed an excellent overlap in the 1H NMR spectrum, unequivocally establishing the active component of F21 as UDP. The second active fraction, F18, was determined to be a 2:1 ratio of UTP to UDP. LC-MS clearly showed the presence of UDP, but under the initial conditions we were unable to detect UTP. 1H NMR analysis showed two doublets at δ 7.85 and 7.89 ppm in a 2:1 ratio and a complex mixture of signals from δ 5.85 to 5.90 ppm (Figure 3E). The close similarity of the two sets of signals between F18 and F21 indicated the presence of a metabolite related to UDP, most likely UTP. 1H NMR of an authentic standard of 1:2.5 UDP:UTP with 10 μM HEPES and 40 μM KCl was nearly identical to F18. The small difference in chemical shift can be attributed to a difference in pH and ionic strength between F21 and the authentic standard. We originally missed the presence of UTP in F18 by LC-MS using our original LC conditions (condition 1 in experimental procedures), but changing the buffer to 0.1 M NH4OAc as a buffer (condition 2) allowed us to clearly verify the presence of UTP with an m/z of 483.0 [M–H]+ (Figure S6). To verify the requirement of UTP and UDP in the production of IFN-inducing RNA, we replaced the “heat sup” with UTP, CTP, GTP, or a mixture of these three nucleotides in the in vitro assay containing the dialyzed protein (40% ammonium sulfate precipitate), poly(dA-dT), and ATP. Only UTP could support the generation of IFN-inducing RNA (Figure 3F). UDP, UMP, and uridine, but not dNTP, also supported IFN induction in the in vitro assays (Figures S5B and S5C), suggesting that the protein fraction might have nucleotide kinase activity to convert UDP, UMP, or uridine to UTP. As the reaction mixtures always contained ATP, we removed ATP from the reaction and found that this removal abolished the production of IFN-inducing RNA (Figure 3G). Therefore, both ATP and UTP are required for the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in the in vitro system. Treatment of HeLa S100 with proteinase K completely destroyed the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in the in vitro system, indicating that one or more proteins in S100 are required for the RNA generation (Figure 4A). We purified the active proteins from HeLa S100 through eight steps of conventional chromatography (Figure 4B, left). Fractions from the last Superdex-200 step were analyzed for their ability to stimulate the generation of IFN-inducing RNA in the presence of poly(dA-dT), ATP, and UTP (Figure 4B, upper right). Aliquots of the fractions were also analyzed by silver staining (Figure 4B, lower right). At least eight visible bands copurified with the activity. Three of these bands, p45, p40, and p23, were identified by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The p45 bands contained subunit D of DNA-directed RNA polymerase III (POLR3D), p40 contained POLR3F, POLR3C, POLR3D, and POLR3H, and p23 contained POLR3H, POLR3G, and POLR3D. Immunoblotting showed that POLR3F and POLR3G copurified with the activity that generates IFN-inducing RNA (Figure S7). As these proteins are subunits of RNA polymerase III, we attempted to identify all the subunits of the Pol-III complex. We established a HEK293 cell line stably expressing FLAG-POLR3F and immunoprecipitated the Pol-III complex with the FLAG antibody. The Pol-III complex was eluted with a FLAG peptide and then immunoprecipitated again with an antibody against POLR3G or a control IgG (Figure 4C). Silver staining of the immunoprecipitated proteins revealed at least 12 distinct bands that were present in the POLR3G complex, but not in the control IgG sample. Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry of these unique bands identified 11 known Pol-III subunits (POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR3C, POLR3D, POLR3E, POLR3F, POLR3G, POLR3GL, POLR3H, POLR1C, and CGRP-RCP) (Hu et al., 2002Hu P. Wu S. Sun Y. Yuan C.C. Kobayashi R. Myers M.P. Hernandez N. Characterization of human RNA polymerase III identifies orthologues for Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III subunits.Mol. Cell.

Importantly, the purified Pol-III complex immunoprecipitated with anti-POLR3G, but not the control IgG immunoprecipitate, was sufficient to catalyze the synthesis of IFN-inducing RNA in the presence of poly(dA-dT), ATP and UTP (Figure 4D). To determine whether endogenous Pol-III could catalyze the synthesis of IFN-inducing RNA from poly(dA-dT), we purified the Pol-III complex from HeLa S100 by immunoprecipitation. Proteins immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against POLR3F or POLR3G, but not control IgG, had the ability to generate IFN-inducing RNA (Figure 4E). We also tested the involvement of TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is known to recognize the"

Whether differentiated cells themselves can contribute to cell replacement and tissue regeneration is a controversial question. Here, we show that differentiated heart muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, can be induced to proliferate and regenerate. We identify an underlying molecular mechanism for controlling this process that involves the growth factor neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, ErbB4. NRG1 induces mononucleated, but not binucleated, cardiomyocytes to divide. In vivo, genetic inactivation of ErbB4 reduces cardiomyocyte proliferation, whereas increasing ErbB4 expression enhances it. Injecting NRG1 in adult mice induces cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity and promotes myocardial regeneration, leading to improved function after myocardial infarction. Undifferentiated progenitor cells did not contribute to NRG1-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Thus, increasing the activity of the NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway may provide a molecular strategy to promote myocardial regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2089518544,"The evolution of prostate cancer from an androgen-dependent state to one that is androgen-independent marks its lethal progression. The androgen receptor (AR) is essential in both, though its function in androgen-independent cancers is poorly understood. We have defined the direct AR-dependent target genes in both androgen-dependent and -independent cancer cells by generating AR-dependent gene expression profiles and AR cistromes. In contrast to what is found in androgen-dependent cells, AR selectively upregulates M-phase cell-cycle genes in androgen-independent cells, including UBE2C, a gene that inactivates the M-phase checkpoint. We find that epigenetic marks at the UBE2C enhancer, notably histone H3K4 methylation and FoxA1 transcription factor binding, are present in androgen-independent cells and direct AR-enhancer binding and UBE2C activation. Thus, the role of AR in androgen-independent cancer cells is not to direct the androgen-dependent gene expression program without androgen, but rather to execute a distinct program resulting in androgen-independent growth.

Thus, the role of AR in androgen-independent cancer cells is not to direct the androgen-dependent gene expression program without androgen, but rather to execute a distinct program resulting in androgen-independent growth. Androgens, functioning through the androgen receptor (AR), are essential for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (Heinlein and Chang, 2004Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Androgen receptor in prostate cancer.Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Thus, androgen-ablation therapies, which involve surgical castration or the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (or antagonists), have been the mainstay of treatment for advanced androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) for over 40 years. While such therapies initially lead to disease regression, in general, advanced prostate cancer ultimately progresses to an androgen-independent (AIPC) late stage that is refractory to current therapies (also termed “castration-resistant prostate cancer”) (Debes and Tindall, 2004Debes J.D.

The development of androgen-independent prostate cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). As AR is expressed in the vast majority of both ADPC and AIPC (Heinlein and Chang, 2004Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Androgen receptor in prostate cancer.Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, Scher and Sawyers, 2005Scher H.I. Sawyers C.L.

Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Molecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy.Nat.

Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), it appears AR signaling pathways play a critical role in both ADPC and AIPC. AR is a member of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that regulates target gene expression in a ligand-inducible manner (Mangelsdorf et al., 1995Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.The nuclear receptor superfamily: the second decade.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5841) Google Scholar). Two well-characterized AR target genes in ADPC are prostate specific antigen (PSA) and the TMPRSS2-ETS fusion genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that control of these target genes involves long-range, combinatorial regulation by AR, DNA-binding collaborating transcription factors and non-DNA binding co-regulatory factors (Shang et al., 2002Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Formation of the androgen receptor transcription complex.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2005Wang Q.

Cell. 2007; 27: 380-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). While the role of AR target genes in regulating cell-cycle progression in ADPC have yet to be fully defined, it is well understood that decreased ADPC growth after AR silencing and/or androgen deprivation primarily involves a block of the G1/S cell-cycle transition through AR-dependent regulation of cyclin D1, p21 and p27 (Comstock and Knudsen, 2007Comstock C.E. Knudsen K.E. The complex role of AR signaling after cytotoxic insult: implications for cell-cycle-based chemotherapeutics.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, how AR regulates cell growth in AIPC is not known. Addressing this question is of clinical importance as it may lead to the identification of specific therapeutic targets for this lethal stage of the disease. By comparing the program of gene expression directly regulated by AR in a model of the progression of ADPC to AIPC and gene and protein expression from actual AIPC cases we find that AR selectively and directly upregulates a set of M-phase cell-cycle genes to promote AIPC growth. To mimic the properties of clinical prostate cancer progression, we utilized LNCaP-abl (abl), an androgen-independent derivative of the androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line that was generated after long-term androgen deprivation (Culig et al., 1999Culig Z. Hoffmann J. Erdel M. Eder I.E. Hobisch A. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Utermann G. Schneider M.R. Parczyk K. et al.Switch from antagonist to agonist of the androgen receptor bicalutamide is associated with prostate tumour progression in a new model system.Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consistent with its AIPC phenotype abl cells grow substantially more rapidly than LNCaP cells in hormone-depleted medium (see Figure S1A available with this article online). While the physiological androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly increases LNCaP cell proliferation, it has little effect on abl cell growth (Figure S1A). To identify genes that might account for the androgen-independent growth of abl compared with LNCaP, we examined gene expression profiles of abl cells in the absence of DHT and LNCaP cells in the absence and presence of DHT treatment for 4 hr (Figure S1B) using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 expression arrays. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of upregulated transcripts in abl compared with LNCaP in the absence of DHT showed that the top two enriched GO biological processes are “cell cycle” (p = 2.8 × 10−19, modified Fisher exact p value, hereinafter) and “mitotic cell cycle” (p = 2.2 × 10−17), suggesting that higher expression of cell-cycle genes, particularly M-phase genes, may contribute to AIPC growth. Interestingly, GO analysis of upregulated transcripts in abl compared with LNCaP cells treated with DHT for 4 hr also revealed that “M phase” (p = 8.8 × 10−22) and “Cell cycle” (p = 1.4 × 10−21) as top two enriched GO biological processes, suggesting that androgen does not directly increase cell-cycle gene transcription in LNCaP cells to promote their growth. This result is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that androgen induces LNCaP growth through mTOR activation and a post-transcriptional increase in Cyclin D protein level (Xu et al., 2006Xu Y. Chen S.Y. Ross K.N. Balk S.P. Androgens induce prostate cancer cell proliferation through mammalian target of rapamycin activation and post-transcriptional increases in cyclin D proteins.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7783-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether cell-cycles genes are also enriched in upregulated genes from clinical cases of AIPC compared with ADPC cases. This was accomplished by re-analyzing gene expression profiles of AIPC and ADPC from two clinical studies (Figure S1B) (Stanbrough et al., 2006Stanbrough M. Bubley G.J. Ross K. Golub T.R. Rubin M.A. Penning T.M. Febbo P.G. Balk S.P. Increased expression of genes converting adrenal androgens to testosterone in androgen-independent prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2815-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Varambally et al., 2005Varambally S. Yu J. Laxman B. Rhodes D.R. Mehra R. Tomlins S.A. Shah R.B. Chandran U. Monzon F.A. Becich M.J. et al.Integrative genomic and proteomic analysis of prostate cancer reveals signatures of metastatic progression.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In agreement with the cell line results, the most significantly enriched GO biological processes categories in clinical AIPC upregulated transcripts are also “cell cycle” (Varambally dataset, p = 4.7 × 10−15, and Stanbrough dataset, p = 2.7 × 10−23) and “mitotic cell cycle” (Varambally dataset, p = 6.3 × 10−16, and Stanbrough dataset, p = 1.9 × 10−22). These data demonstrate that expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes, primarily M-phase genes are enriched in AIPC and may promote AIPC growth. Given our finding that expression of specific cell-cycle genes are upregulated in abl compared with LNCaP and the requirement of AR for growth of both cell lines (Figure 1A), we hypothesized that AR promotes AIPC proliferation by upregulating specific cell-cycle genes. We next performed gene expression profiling to define AR-dependent genes in abl by transfection of a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against AR (siAR) or a control siRNA (siControl). As referents, we also performed gene expression analysis in LNCaP cells following AR silencing and in both cell lines over a time course of DHT stimulation (0, 4 hr, and 16 hr) (Figure 1B)(Wang et al., 2007Wang Q. Li W. Liu X.S. Carroll J.S. Janne O.A. Keeton E.K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Pienta K.J. Brown M. A hierarchical network of transcription factors governs androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer growth.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 380-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the expression data clearly distinguished androgen-regulated genes and AR-regulated genes that reflect ligand-activated and basal AR activity, respectively (Figure 1B). Therefore, AR-regulated genes in AIPC are not the same as those regulated by androgen in ADPC (Figures 1C and S2). As AR silencing decreases abl cell proliferation (Figure 1A), we next focused on the AR upregulated genes in abl cells (i.e., siControl/siAR upregulated genes). Interestingly, GO analysis of 345 abl-specific AR upregulated transcripts (q < 0.05) (Figure 1C) revealed that “cell cycle” (52 transcripts, p = 1.4 × 10−9) and “mitotic cell cycle” (24 transcripts, p = 8.0 × 10−9) are the top two over-represented GO biological processes. Moreover, comparing these AR upregulated cell-cycle transcripts in abl cells with upregulated transcripts in clinical AIPC showed very significant overlaps (hypergeometric distribution, for cell-cycle transcripts: 36% (p = 8.85 × 10−3) overlap with Varambally dataset and 50.9% (p = 1.05 × 10−3) overlap with Stanbrough dataset; for M phase transcripts: 62.5% (p = 1.20 × 10−5) overlap with Varambally dataset and 91.7% (p = 4.02 × 10−10) overlap with Stanbrough dataset) (Figure 1D). In contrast to enriched “cell cycle” and “mitotic cell cycle” GO biological processes for abl-specific AR upregulated transcripts, the most significantly enriched GO biological processes for 23 LNCaP-specific basal AR upregulated transcripts and 435 LNCaP-specific transcripts upregulated by 4 hr DHT treatment (Figure 1C) are “cellular lipid metabolism” (p = 7.7 × 10−2) and “positive regulation of cellular process (p = 9.7 × 10−5),” respectively. In addition, 291 of 345 transcripts abl-specific AR upregulated transcripts (q < 0.05) have a higher AR induced gene expression fold change in abl than in LNCaP cells. GO analysis of these 291 genes also revealed that “cell cycle” (p = 2.6 × 10−9) and “mitotic cell cycle” (p = 5.2 × 10−9) as the top two enriched GO biological processes. Taken together these data suggest that AR selectively upregulates M-phase cell-cycle genes to promote AIPC growth. To investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism for the differential pattern of AR-regulated genes in AIPC and ADPC, we defined the AR cistrome by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with tiled oligonucleotide microarrays across the entire human genome (ChIP-on-chip) in abl and LNCaP cells. Briefly, AR ChIP was first performed in abl and LNCaP cells. The ChIP-enriched DNA was then amplified and hybridized to Afftymetrix whole human genome tiling array sets. In order to increase the sensitivity of our approach (Johnson et al., 2008Johnson D.S. Li W. Gordon D.B. Bhattacharjee A. Curry B. Ghosh J. Brizuela L. Carroll J.S. Brown M. Flicek P. et al.Systematic evaluation of variability in ChIP-chip experiments using predefined DNA targets.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we performed the AR ChIP-on-chip in the presence of DHT in both cell lines. Our strategy is to identify AR binding sites by ChIP-on-chip in the presence of androgen followed by the validation of sites of interest by directed ChIP in both the presence and absence of androgen. Using the MAT algorithm (Johnson et al., 2006Johnson W.E. Li W. Meyer C.A. Gottardo R. Carroll J.S. Brown M. Liu X.S. Model-based analysis of tiling-arrays for ChIP-chip.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we identified 8,708 AR binding sites in LNCaP cells and 6,353 AR binding regions in abl cells based on a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (Figure S3). As positive controls, we found that these included previously reported AR binding regions at the PSA, KLK2 and TMPRSS2 genes (Figure S4) (Schuur et al., 1996Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A. Kmetec L.A.

We next compared AR binding in two cell lines using a less stringent statistical cutoff (p < 1 × 10−4 or FDR 15%) to avoid missing true differential binding sites with low binding affinity (MAT score). LNCaP cells have a greater number of higher affinity AR binding sites than do abl cells (Figures 2A and S5), which is consistent with a previous report showing that androgen signaling activity is significantly decreased in AIPC compared with ADPC (Tomlins et al., 2007Tomlins S.A. Mehra R. Rhodes D.R. Cao X. Wang L. Dhanasekaran S.M. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Wei J.T. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. et al.Integrative molecular concept modeling of prostate cancer progression.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Correlation of AR binding sites with activated and basal AR-regulated genes showed a significant enrichment of AR binding within 20–50 kb of the transcription start sites (TSS) of upregulated genes but not of downregulated genes in both ADPC and AIPC (Figures 2B and S6), suggesting that these upregulated genes are primarily direct targets of AR action. Although in general the level AR occupancy at target sites is greater in LNCaP cells than in abl cells (Figure 3A), we find greater occupancy of AR binding near abl-specific AR upregulated cell-cycle genes and M-phase genes in abl cells than in LNCaP cells (Figure 3A and Table S2). Greater levels of AR binding are correlated with higher expression of target cell-cycle and M-phase genes in abl (Figure 3B and Table S2). Directed ChIP for the AR binding sites near the M-phase cell-cycle regulatory genes CDC20, UBE2C, CDK1, and ANAPC10 confirmed that these sites are preferentially occupied in abl as compared with LNCaP in the presence of DHT and have significant AR occupancy in the absence of hormone only in abl and not in LNCaP (Figure 3C). We examined the mRNA (Figure 3D) and protein (Figure 3E) expression of CDC20, UBE2C, and CDK1 in abl and LNCaP cells in the absence of hormone and following AR silencing. These results confirmed that these genes are differentially upregulated and AR-dependent in abl as compared with LNCaP. Among the specific AR regulated M-phase cell-cycle genes in abl cells, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C), an anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is of particular interest as the expression of this gene was recently found to be critical for inactivating the cell-cycle M-phase checkpoint (Reddy et al., 2007Reddy S.K. Rape M. Margansky W.A. Kirschner M.W. Ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation.Nature. 2007; 446: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further characterized the two specific UBE2C AR binding sites that are located −32.8 kb and +41.6 kb away from the TSS of UBE2C gene in abl cells (Figure S7). While these two putative enhancers are within or downstream of other annotated genes, UBE2C is the only AR dependent gene in the region. In order to test whether these two putative enhancers communicate with the UBE2C promoter, we performed quantitative chromosome conformation capture assays (3C-qPCR) (Hagege et al., 2007Hagege H. Klous P. Braem C. Splinter E. Dekker J. Cathala G. de Laat W. Forne T. Quantitative analysis of chromosome conformation capture assays (3C-qPCR).Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Fixed chromatin from LNCaP and abl cells treated with DHT or vehicle was digested with BglII followed by ligation under low DNA concentrations and reverse crosslinking. The ligation products were quantified using Taqman real-time PCR. This revealed significantly greater interaction between these two putative enhancers and the UBE2C promoter in abl cells than in LNCaP cells in the absence of hormone (Figure 4A). In order to determine the mechanism of the preferential occupancy of the UBE2C enhancer sequences in abl we examined whether there were abl-specific sequence alterations in these regions. Sequencing of the two UBE2C enhancer regions identified by AR ChIP-on-chip in LNCaP and abl cells revealed that these two regions are 100% identical in the two cell lines (data not shown). Given our previous findings that collaborating transcription factors and coactivators may assist nuclear receptor binding in certain regions (Carroll et al., 2005Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S.

Directed ChIP analysis showed significantly higher occupancy of FoxA1 and MED1 to both enhancers and GATA2 to enhancer 2 in abl cells as compared with LNCaP cells (Figures 4B and 4C). We also examined serine 5 phosphorylated polymerase II (P-pol II ser 5) occupancy at the UBE2C promoter in both cell lines (Figure 4D). We find significantly greater P-pol II ser 5 occupancy at the UBE2C promoter in abl compared with LNCaP cells that is unchanged by the addition of DHT. In contrast, at the PSA promoter P-pol II ser 5 occupancy is significantly greater in LNCaP cells and is stimulated by DHT. The greater level of AR transcription complex loading on the UBE2C enhancers leads to a greater level of P-pol II ser 5 at the promoter through chromosomal looping (Figure 4A), resulting in higher UBE2C expression levels in abl cells (Figures 3D and 4E). Importantly, silencing of FoxA1, GATA2 or MED1 decreases UBE2C mRNA level in abl cells but not in LNCaP cells (Figure 4E), suggesting that each of these factors plays an indispensable role in mediating UBE2C expression. Interestingly, while minimally greater levels MED1 protein expression in abl (Figure 4F) might account for greater MED1 recruitment to the UBE2C enhancers, differences in expression do not account for the differential recruitment of FoxA1 and GATA2 to the UBE2C enhancers. We have recently defined a role for the active enhancer histone marks H3 lysine 4 mono- and di-methyl (H3K4me1 and H3K4me2) (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S.

FoxA1 translates epigenetic signatures into enhancer-driven lineage-specific transcription.Cell. 2008; 132: 958-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we therefore examined the levels of these marks (and as control the promoter-specific H3K4me3 mark) at the UBE2C enhancers. We find that H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 are significantly enriched at the UBE2C enhancers only in abl and not in LNCaP (Figures 4G and 4H) suggesting that these epigenetic marks may define these sites as abl-specific enhancers leading to AR-dependent expression of UBE2C only in this cell type. In order to determine whether H3K4 methylation is required for the increased AR occupancy at the UBE2C enhancers in abl cells we overexpressed a H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 specific demethylase KDM1 (Shi et al., 2004Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1.Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar) in both LNCaP and abl cells. Consistent with our recent finding that KDM1 overexpression reduces FoxA1 recruitment in MCF7 cells (Lupien et al., 2008Lupien M. Eeckhoute J. Meyer C.A. Wang Q. Zhang Y. Li W. Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brown M. FoxA1 translates epigenetic signatures into enhancer-driven lineage-specific transcription.Cell. 2008; 132: 958-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we found that KDM1 overexpression decreases FoxA1 binding and H3K4me2 level at the UBE2C enhancers (Figure S8). More significantly, overexpression of KDM1 almost completely abolishes AR binding in both cell lines (Figure 5A), suggesting that H3K4 marks are required for differential AR binding at the UBE2C enhancers in LNCaP and abl cells. Interestingly, FoxA1 silencing also almost fully abolishes AR binding at the UBE2C enhancers in LNCaP and abl cells (Figure 5B), suggesting FoxA1 binding is also essential for differential AR recruitment. By contrast, silencing of AR has no effect on differential H3K4me2 level and FoxA1 binding on the UBE2C enhancers (Figure 5C). In addition, FoxA1 silencing has no effect on differential H3K4me2 levels on the UBE2C enhancers (Figure S9). Thus the differential H3K4 marks and FoxA1 act upstream of AR and are required for differential AR binding at the UBE2C enhancers (Figure 5D). To confirm that the requirement for H3K4 methylation and FoxA1 binding for AR binding was not restricted to the UBE2C enhancers, we performed H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and FoxA1 ChIP on the CDK1, CDC20 and ANAPC10 enhancers. We find that the levels of H3K4 methyl marks and FoxA1 are also higher on these enhancers in abl cells than LNCaP cells (Figure S10). As controls, the H3K4 marks and FoxA1 are not present at randomly selected androgen responsive elements (ARE) that have no AR binding (Figure S10). As expected, overexpression of KDM1 or silencing of FoxA1 also significantly decreases AR binding on the CDK1 and CDC20 enhancers (Figure S11). Moreover, overexpression of UBE2C does not increase AR binding at the CDK1, CDC20 and ANAPC10 enhancers in LNCaP cells (Figure S12). These findings suggest that increased AR binding at the enhancers of other M-phase genes in abl cells is also determined by H3K4 methylation and FoxA1 binding rather than being the result of increased UBE2C expression. In order to confirm that AR-dependent overexpression of UBE2C is not unique to abl cells, we determined UBE2C protein expression levels in another model of AIPC and in clinical AIPC cases. We confirmed that UBE2C protein level is greater and AR-dependent in the androgen-independent cell line C4-2B (Thalmann et al., 2000Thalmann G.N. Sikes R.A. Wu T.T. Degeorges A. Chang S.M. Ozen M.

Given the well-established role of mitochondrial defects in human disease, functional characterization of these proteins may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Starting with yeast as a model system, we investigated an uncharacterized but highly conserved mitochondrial protein (named here Sdh5). Both yeast and human Sdh5 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the human SDH5 gene, located on chromosome 11q13.1, segregate with disease in a family with hereditary paraganglioma, a neuroendocrine tumor previously linked to mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits. Thus, a mitochondrial proteomics analysis in yeast has led to the discovery of a human tumor susceptibility gene."

In contrast to primary cilia, motile cilia serve a mechanical function. For example, the cilia on airway epithelia remove inhaled material from the lung. Shah et al. (p. 1131 , published online 23 July; see the cover; see the Perspective by Kinnamon and Reynolds ) now show that these classic motile cilia are also chemosensory. The motile cilia on airway epithelia contain bitter-taste receptors and their associated signaling machinery. Moreover, application of bitter substances triggers an elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ levels and increases cilia beat frequency. Thus, in airway epithelia, bitter-taste receptors may be able to detect noxious substances entering the airways and initiate an autonomous defensive mechanism designed to accelerate elimination of the offending compound."

The fraction of hexagons decreases with an increase in curvature. In bright field microscopy, each cell contains a bright yellow core, placed in a greenish cell with yellowish border, but the core disappears in dark field. With use of confocal microscopy, we observe that these cells consist of nearly concentric nested arcs that lie on the surface of a shallow cone. We infer that the patterns are structurally and optically analogous to the focal conic domains formed spontaneously on the free surface of a cholesteric liquid crystal. These textures provide the basis for the morphogenesis as well as key insights for emulating the intricate optical response of the exoskeleton of scarab beetles."

However, unlike ESCs or even somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-produced NT-ESCs, no iPSC lines have so far fulfilled the most stringent pluripotency criterion of being able to generate full-term mice via tetraploid blastocyst complementation (Hayashi and Surani, 2009Hayashi K.

To understand the reprogramming mechanisms that occur during iPSC generation, it is important to address whether iPSCs are fully pluripotent. As in previous reports (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

After viral transduction, the MEFs were cultured in ES culture medium containing Dox for 12 days until ES-like colonies appeared, and then the Dox was removed from the culture medium (Figure 1B). Four days later, ES-like colonies were individually digested and replated in 24-well plates. After propagation, we selected five iPSC lines that exhibited typical ESC morphology (Figure 1C) for long-term culture and characterization. The ES-like colonies generated were positive for AP activity (see Figure S1 available online). RT-PCR and qPCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of pluripotency marker genes, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, was comparable across all five iPSC lines and normal ESC lines but showed dramatic differences relative to MEFs (Figures 1D and 1E). Silencing of the exogenous lentiviral vectors was also observed (Figure S2). Immunofluorescent staining further confirmed the protein expression of three transcription factors and the surface marker SSEA-1 in the iPSCs (Figure 1F). In addition, other pluripotency-related genes were all expressed at similar levels in the iPSCs and normal ESCs (Figure S3). The karyotypes of all five iPSC lines were normal, with 40 chromosomes (Figure S4). Southern blot analysis was used to examine viral integration into the genome of iPSCs and indicated that there were one or two integrations for each of the four lentiviral constructs into the iPS genome (Figure 1G). To investigate the pluripotency of the generated iPSCs, we performed in vitro differentiation and teratoma and chimera experiments. The iPSCs formed EBs efficiently in vitro, and upregulation of marker genes for all three germ layers was detected in the plated EBs (Figure S5). We then transplanted the iPSCs subcutaneously into immune-deficient SCID mice and found that all the iPSC lines tested generated teratomas 3–4 weeks after transplantation. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining indicated that the iPSCs could differentiate into a variety of cell types from all three germ layers (Figure 1H). The LiPS-6 line generated postnatal chimeras with normal appearance that gave rise to germline offspring after mating with ICR female mice (Figure 1I). However, we could not produce full-term mice from this line via tetraploid complementation. Meanwhile, we noticed a very high degree of chimerism in the chimeras generated from one iPSC line, LiPS-8, as indicated by its chimera coat color, which was almost completely contributed by iPSC (Figure 1J). We therefore decided to test whether these iPSCs were capable of generating full-term mice through tetraploid complementation. We first generated tetraploid embryos by fusing late two-cell-stage embryos to one-cell-stage embryos using an Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX 2001). The embryos were collected from B6D2F1 female mice mated with male mice of the same strain. Ten to fifteen iPSCs were microinjected into the cavity of tetraploid blastocysts, and the complemented blastocysts (n = 200) were transferred into seven pseudopregnant ICR female mice after 2–3 hr of recovery. On the due date, a C-section was performed to ascertain whether any of the tetraploid-complemented embryos had developed into live animals. As shown in Figure 2A, we produced two full-term mice from the iPSC-complemented tetraploid blastocysts. One pup (Figure 2Ab) was overweight (2.72 g) and died within 1 hr following the C-section. The other pup (Figure 2Aa) was of normal weight (1.36 g) and survived for 3 days but died because the surrogate mother refused to feed it. To test whether the fully iPSC-derived mouse can survive to adulthood, we repeated this experiment with tetraploid blastocysts from ICR mice. After transplantation of 187 tetraploid-complemented blastocysts into the oviducts of seven pseudopregnant mice, we successfully produced two more full-term pups from these embryos (Figure 2A), and one pup survived into adulthood and appears to be healthy (Figure 2B). The efficiency of generating full-term mice from iPSC-complemented ICR tetraploid embryos was similar to the B6D2F2 background embryos (1.07% versus 1.00%, Figure 2F). We then performed SSLP and rtTA analysis of the organs collected from the three dead pups and the tail tip of the live mouse. The results clearly indicated that all the pups were derived from the iPSCs (mostly C57BL/6 background) and not from the tetraploid embryos (B6D2F2 or ICR background) (Figures 2C–2E). Moreover, we successfully cultured skin fibroblast cells from the pups that died shortly after the C-section. After adding Dox to the medium, many ES-like colonies appeared (Figure S6), and the efficiency was substantially higher than for the first round of iPS induction. As the inducible iPSC line LiPS-8 is, to our knowledge, the first iPSC line that has been used successfully to generate mice by tetraploid complementation, we investigated the gene expression profile of this particular cell line as compared with the normal ESC lines, R1, and the parental MEF cells. The data clearly showed that the gene expression profile of this specific iPS line is very similar to the normal ESCs (Figure 2G). Meanwhile, bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis of the Oct4 promoter showed that it is highly unmethylated in the inducible iPSC line LiPS-8, whereas it is highly methylated in the parental MEF cells (Figure S7). In conclusion, we have successfully produced full-term mice from iPSC-complemented tetraploid blastocysts. Although these findings are an important proof of principle, it would be premature to make claims based on them about whether iPSCs in general are functionally equivalent to normal ESCs, as we have here only identified one iPSC line that possesses this capacity, and the process is also very inefficient. It is possible that this line has specific characteristics that allow tetraploid-complementation activity but are not shared by other iPSC lines. It will be interesting to evaluate whether iPSCs generated using fewer factors or different approaches are capable of producing tetraploid-complemented mice (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.B. Zaehres H. Wu G.

Previous studies show that the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas, widely regarded as an ideal system in which to study flagellar biology, swims forward by the synchronous action of its two flagella. Using high-speed imaging over long intervals, we found a richer behavior: A cell swimming in the dark stochastically switches between synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. Three-dimensional tracking shows that these regimes lead, respectively, to nearly straight swimming and to abrupt large reorientations, which yield a eukaryotic version of the ""run-and-tumble"" motion of peritrichously flagellated bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2004751440,"Most tissue cells grown in sparse cultures on linearly elastic substrates typically display a small, round phenotype on soft substrates and become increasingly spread as the modulus of the substrate increases until their spread area reaches a maximum value. As cell density increases, individual cells retain the same stiffness-dependent differences unless they are very close or in molecular contact. On nonlinear strain-stiffening fibrin gels, the same cell types become maximally spread even when the low strain elastic modulus would predict a round morphology, and cells are influenced by the presence of neighbors hundreds of microns away. Time lapse microscopy reveals that fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells on fibrin deform the substrate by several microns up to five cell lengths away from their plasma membrane through a force limited mechanism. Atomic force microscopy and rheology confirm that these strains locally and globally stiffen the gel, depending on cell density, and this effect leads to long distance cell-cell communication and alignment. Thus cells are acutely responsive to the nonlinear elasticity of their substrates and can manipulate this rheological property to induce patterning."

The observed relationships between cloud cover and regional meteorological conditions provide a more complete way of testing the realism of the cloud simulation in current-generation climate models.

https://openalex.org/W2140463048,"In the formation of chiral crystals, the tendency for twist in the orientation of neighboring molecules is incompatible with ordering into a lattice: Twist is expelled from planar layers at the expense of local strain. We report the ordered state of a neat material in which a local chiral structure is expressed as twisted layers, a state made possible by spatial limitation of layering to a periodic array of nanoscale filaments. Although made of achiral molecules, the layers in these filaments are twisted and rigorously homochiral--a broken symmetry. The precise structural definition achieved in filament self-assembly enables collective organization into arrays in which an additional broken symmetry--the appearance of macroscopic coherence of the filament twist--produces a liquid crystal phase of helically precessing layers."
https://openalex.org/W2019663610,"A variety of simple bent-core molecules exhibit smectic liquid crystal phases of planar fluid layers that are spontaneously both polar and chiral in the absence of crystalline order. We found that because of intralayer structural mismatch, such layers are also only marginally stable against spontaneous saddle splay deformation, which is incompatible with long-range order. This results in macroscopically isotropic fluids that possess only short-range orientational and positional order, in which the only macroscopically broken symmetry is chirality--even though the phases are formed from achiral molecules. Their conglomerate domains exhibit optical rotatory powers comparable to the highest ever found for isotropic fluids of chiral molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2043562679,"Drosophila embryogenesis is characterized by rapid transitions in gene activity, whereby crudely distributed gradients of regulatory proteins give way to precise on/off patterns of gene expression. To explore the underlying mechanisms, a partially automated, quantitative in situ hybridization method was used to visualize expression profiles of 14 developmental control genes in hundreds of embryos. These studies revealed two distinct patterns of gene activation: synchronous and stochastic. Synchronous genes display essentially uniform expression of nascent transcripts in all cells of an embryonic tissue, whereas stochastic genes display erratic patterns of de novo activation. RNA polymerase II is ""pre-loaded"" (stalled) in the promoter regions of synchronous genes, but not stochastic genes. Transcriptional synchrony might ensure the orderly deployment of the complex gene regulatory networks that control embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009144787,"The toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), the largest member of the toucan family, possesses the largest beak relative to body size of all birds. This exaggerated feature has received various interpretations, from serving as a sexual ornament to being a refined adaptation for feeding. However, it is also a significant surface area for heat exchange. Here we show the remarkable capacity of the toco toucan to regulate heat distribution by modifying blood flow, using the bill as a transient thermal radiator. Our results indicate that the toucan's bill is, relative to its size, one of the largest thermal windows in the animal kingdom, rivaling elephants' ears in its ability to radiate body heat."
https://openalex.org/W2127851265,"Reef-building corals live in symbiosis with a diverse range of dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that differentially influence the fitness of the coral holobiont. The comparative role of symbiont type in holobiont fitness in relation to host genotype or the environment, however, is largely unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap by manipulating host-symbiont combinations and comparing growth, survival and thermal tolerance among the resultant holobionts in different environments.Offspring of the coral, Acropora millepora, from two thermally contrasting locations, were experimentally infected with one of six Symbiodinium types, which spanned three phylogenetic clades (A, C and D), and then outplanted to the two parental field locations (central and southern inshore Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Growth and survival of juvenile corals were monitored for 31-35 weeks, after which their thermo-tolerance was experimentally assessed. Our results showed that: (1) Symbiodinium type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance; (2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions; and (3) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness. Furthermore, coral-algal associations were established with symbiont types belonging to clades A, C and D, but three out of four symbiont types belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis. Associations with clade A had the lowest fitness and were unstable in the field. Lastly, Symbiodinium types C1 and D were found to be relatively thermo-tolerant, with type D conferring the highest tolerance in A. millepora.These results highlight the complex interactions that occur between the coral host, the algal symbiont, and the environment to shape the fitness of the coral holobiont. An improved understanding of the factors affecting coral holobiont fitness will assist in predicting the responses of corals to global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2053272135,"Related organisms typically respond to a given cue by altering the level or activity of orthologous transcription factors, which, paradoxically, often regulate expression of distinct gene sets. Although promoter rewiring of shared genes is primarily responsible for regulatory differences among related eukaryotic species, in bacteria, species-specific genes are often controlled by ancestral transcription factors, and regulatory circuit evolution has been further shaped by horizontal gene transfer. Modifications in transcription factors and in promoter structure also contribute to divergence in bacterial regulatory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2093583036,"Glucocorticoids are important regulators of lipid homeostasis, and chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels induce hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and visceral obesity. The occupied glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a transcription factor. However, those genes regulating lipid metabolism under GR control are not fully known. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4, fasting-induced adipose factor), a protein inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, is synthesized and secreted during fasting, when circulating glucocorticoid levels are physiologically increased. We therefore tested whether the ANGPTL4 gene (Angptl4) is transcriptionally controlled by GR. We show that treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone increased Angptl4 mRNA levels in primary hepatocytes and adipocytes (2–3-fold) and in the livers and white adipose tissue of mice (∼4-fold). We tested the mechanism of this increase in H4IIE hepatoma cells and found that dexamethasone treatment increased the transcriptional rate of Angptl4. Using bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a GR binding site within the rat Angptl4 sequence. A reporter plasmid containing this site was markedly activated by dexamethasone, indicative of a functional glucocorticoid response element. Dexamethasone treatment also increased histone H4 acetylation and DNase I accessibility in genomic regions near this site, further supporting that it is a glucocorticoid response element. Glucocorticoids promote the flux of triglycerides from white adipose tissue to liver.

Fasting also increases circulating levels of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4, a fasting-induced adipose factor). ANGPTL4 is a protein secreted by the liver and WAT that can inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and stimulate WAT lipolysis (3Hato T. Tabata M. Oike Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2008; 18: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 4Kersten S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Li C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). LPL hydrolyzes lipoprotein TG, promoting fatty acid storage in the WAT. This activity is counterbalanced by that of lipases, which hydrolyze stored TG, promoting fatty acid release by adipocytes. Therefore, one could predict that reducing ANGPTL4 activity would promote WAT TG storage, whereas increasing it would favor lipolysis. This prediction is consistent with the results of genetic and physiological studies. First, mice lacking ANGPTL4 (Angptl4−/−) have decreased plasma TG levels and an increased capacity for weight gain (6Bäckhed F. Ding H. Wang T. Hooper L.V. Koh G.Y. Nagy A. Semenkovich C.F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15718-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). By contrast, mice overexpressing Angptl4 in the WAT have a dramatically limited capacity for TG storage and increased levels of plasma TG, fatty acids, and glycerol (7Mandard S.

Plasma TG and fatty acid levels are similarly increased in mice by adenoviral overexpression of Angptl4 in the liver (8Xu A. Lam M.C. Chan K.W. Wang Y. Zhang J. Hoo R.L. Xu J.Y. Chen B. Chow W.S.

Finally, a recent large population-based study uncovered sequence variations in Angptl4 that are associated with loss of function and reduced plasma TG levels in humans (11Romeo S. Pennacchio L.A. Fu Y. Boerwinkle E. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In summary, these data suggest that transcriptional modulation of Angptl4 expression could serve as an important regulatory mechanism in TG homeostasis. We previously showed that Angptl4 mRNA levels are increased by glucocorticoids in A549 lung epithelial cells, suggesting that glucocorticoids may exert transcriptional control over Angptl4 expression (12Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15603-15608Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis in metabolic tissues. First, excess glucocorticoids promote hypertriglyceridemia, as also seen in models where ANGPTL4 levels are increased (1Macfarlane D.P. Forbes S. Walker B.R. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 197: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Walker B.R. Diabet. Med. 2006; 23: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Walker B.R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 157: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Second, reducing the ratio of active to inactive glucocorticoids by pharmacologically inhibiting 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I increased plasma TG clearance and decreased liver TG synthesis, two components of the phenotype seen in Angptl4−/− mice (6Bäckhed F. Ding H. Wang T. Hooper L.V. Koh G.Y. Nagy A. Semenkovich C.F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15718-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar, 15Desai U. Lee E.C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11766-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that both physiologic and pathophysiologic responses to glucocorticoids may involve the regulation of Angptl4 expression in metabolic tissues. However, whether Angptl4 expression is indeed directly regulated by glucocorticoids in the liver and WAT remains unexplored. Given the prominent role of ANGPTL4 in systemic TG metabolism, we explored the regulation of Angptl4 by glucocorticoids. We first examined whether glucocorticoids regulate Angptl4 expression in primary hepatocytes and adipocytes, mouse livers and WAT, and established cell lines. We then dissected the mechanism of glucocorticoid-regulated Angptl4 expression using a rat hepatoma cell line, H4IIE. Finally, we used Angptl4−/− mice to investigate the potential role of ANGPTL4 in glucocorticoid-regulated TG homeostasis. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (a gift from Dr. Daryl Granner, Vanderbilt University) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). When cells were treated with dexamethasone (DEX), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (J R Scientific) was used. Rat primary hepatocytes were purchased from Cambrix. Human primary adipocytes were purchased from ZenBio. H4IIE cells (1 × 108 to 2 × 108 cells) were cross-linked by using formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% at room temperature for 5 or 10 min. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocols were otherwise as previously described (16Bolton E.C. So A.Y. Chaivorapol C. Haqq C.M. Li H. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2005-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.C. Shah N. Pantoja C. Meijsing S.H. Ho J.D. Scanlan T.S. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were grown to confluence and treated with DMSO or DEX for different times. Cells were then harvested and incubated in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 5 min. Nuclei were then isolated by microcentrifuge at 170 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The total nuclei from each of the DMSO- or DEX-treated samples were counted, and equal numbers of nuclei were used for in vitro transcription. We split the samples into two aliquots. One was incubated in 100 μl of 2× in vitro transcription buffer (200 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 200 mm sucrose, and 20% glycerol) plus 8 μl of biotin-UTP (Roche), and the other in 100 μl of 2× in vitro transcription buffer plus 8 μl of UTP (negative control) for 30 min at 29 °C. 6 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 and 6 μl of RNase-free DNase (Roche) (10 units/μl) were then added to stop the reactions. Total RNA was then isolated using Nucleospin RNA II (E&K). Dyna beads M-280 (Invitrogen) were washed twice in solution A (0.1 mm NaOH, 0.5 m NaCl) for 5 min, once in solution B (0.1 m NaCl) for 5 min, and then resuspended in binding/wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m NaCl) plus 1 μl (40 units) of RNasin (Promega) per 100 μl of beads. 50 μl of beads (in binding/wash buffer) were then added to RNA, incubated at 42 °C for 20 min, and then shaken for 2 h at room temperature. Afterward, the beads were centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The beads were then washed once (5 min) with 500 μl of 15% formamide plus 2× saline/sodium citrate buffer and twice with 1 ml of 2× saline/sodium citrate buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 30 μl of RNase- and DNase-free water. 10 μl of beads were used for each reverse transcription reaction prior to quantitative PCR (qPCR). Total RNA was isolated from cells by using QIAshredder and RNeasy kits (Qiagen). Total RNA from liver and epididymal WAT was isolated by using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.). To synthesize random-primed cDNA, 0.5 μg of total RNA (10 μl), 4 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, and 2 μl of random primers (New England Biolabs) were mixed and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. A 4-μl mixture containing 25 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs), 10 units of RNasin, and 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) was then added and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The resultant cDNA was diluted to 200 μl, and 2.5 μl was used to perform qPCR in a 25-μl reaction containing Taq DNA polymerase (1.25 units; Promega), 1× reaction buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP (Invitrogen), 0.2× SYBR Green I dye (Molecular Probes), and 250 nm of each primer. Alternatively, EVA QPCR SuperMix Kit (Biochain) was used per the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed in either an Opticon-2 DNA Engine (MJ Research) or a 7900HT PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by using the δ-δ Ct method as supplied by the manufacturer. Rpl19 expression was used for internal normalization. All primer sequences are presented in supplemental Table S1. Livers and Epididymal WAT were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Samples were thawed, suspended, and homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Tissue lysates were cleared by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using semidry transfer (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 8 h at 22 °C with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS (50 mm Tris base, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS with 5% milk containing primary antibody, followed by washes with TBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 at pH 7.5 (TBST). Membranes were then incubated for 2 h at 22 °C in TBS with 5% milk containing secondary antibody followed by washes with TBST. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lighting Plus-ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were stripped for 0.5 h at 22 °C in PBS with 7 μl/ml of β-mercaptoethanol, washed with PBS for 0.5 h, and blocked for 4 h in TBS with 10% milk before re-probing with other primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: ANGPTL4 (Rb polyclonal antibodies to ARP4, ab2920; Abcam Inc.), β-actin (C4) mouse monoclonal IgG1 (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit IgG1-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling), and anti-mouse IgG1-horseradish peroxidase (sc-2060; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were scanned as TIFF files to Adobe Photoshop CS4 (version 11.0) and quantified using Image J software. The optical density of the ANGPTL4 band divided by that of the respective β-actin band are presented. The rat Angptl4 genomic region containing the predicted GR binding site was amplified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR fragment was restriction-digested and subcloned into the pGL4-TATA reporter. A mutagenesis kit (QuikChange) was used to make site-directed mutations per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Nuclei from H4IIE cells treated with vehicle or DEX for 1 h were digested with 6.25–200 units/ml of DNase I (Qiagen) for 5 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by treatment with Proteinase K for 1 h at 65 °C. DNA samples were purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen). The samples underwent qPCR analysis to determine the relative amounts of cleaved products (see supplemental Table 1 for primer sequences), which were used to express the percent of DNA cleavage by DNase I. Transfection in H4IIE cells was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the technical manual. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with either DMSO or 0.5 mm DEX overnight. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was measured by a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the technical manual. Serial dilutions of purified GR DNA binding domain (DBD) protein (provided by Dr. Miles Pufall, University of California, San Francisco) were mixed with complementary oligonucleotides (2 × 10−8m) containing either wild-type or mutant Angptl4 GREs end-labeled with Cy5 in a solution comprised of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/μl dI-dC. The mixtures reacted for 30 min to reach equilibrium and were then run out on 8% native gels and scanned by a Typhoon phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). C57BL/6J (B6) wild-type mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Angptl4−/− mice were provided by the laboratories of Andras Nagy (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital) and Jeff Gordon (Washington University). Heterozygous mice (Angptl4+/−) on a mixed B6:129/Sv background were generated as described (6Bäckhed F. Ding H. Wang T. Hooper L.V. Koh G.Y. Nagy A. Semenkovich C.F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15718-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar), and Angptl4+/+, Angptl4+/−, and Angptl4−/− littermates, obtained by crossing Angptl4+/− mice were compared. The PCR protocols for genotyping animals were previously described (6Bäckhed F. Ding H. Wang T. Hooper L.V. Koh G.Y. Nagy A. Semenkovich C.F. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15718-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). Mice (3–4 months old) were injected intraperitoneally daily with 40 mg/kg body weight of water-soluble DEX (Sigma) in PBS for 4 consecutive days. 20 h after the final injection, mice were fasted for 4 h (17Wang J.C. Shah N. Pantoja C. Meijsing S.H. Ho J.D. Scanlan T.S. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and then used for blood collection and tissue harvest. Liver samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors. Lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and separated by TLC on Silica Gel G-60 plates with the solvent hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (v/v/v, 80:20:1). The TG bands were visualized by exposure to iodine, and then scraped and analyzed as described (18Snyder F. Stephens N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), with triolein (Sigma) as a standard, and expressed per tissue weight. Serum was isolated from whole blood immediately after collection, and a colorimetric kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure serum TG levels. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for each group and comparisons were analyzed by Student's t test. To determine whether Angptl4 expression is regulated by glucocorticoids in primary rat hepatocytes and human adipocytes, we treated these cells with the synthetic glucocorticoid DEX for 5 h. After harvesting the cells to prepare total RNA, cDNA was synthesized and qPCR was performed using specific primers. We first confirmed that DEX treatment increased the expression of Pepck and Per1 in hepatocytes and adipocytes, respectively (positive controls), and did not affect mRNA levels of Angptl3 and Abcd4, two genes not known to be regulated by glucocorticoids (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, DEX treatment significantly increased Angptl4 mRNA levels in both hepatocytes and adipocytes, indicating that Angptl4 expression is regulated by glucocorticoids in vitro. (Fig. 1A). We then tested whether glucocorticoids regulate Angptl4 expression in the model rat hepatoma cell line, H4IIE, by treating these cells with DEX for 5 h. As for primary hepatocytes, DEX treatment increased Angptl4 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). We chose to conduct subsequent in vitro studies using H4IIE cells because the effect of DEX on Pepck, Angptl3, and Angptl4 mRNA expression in these cells replicated what was seen in primary hepatocytes. To investigate whether glucocorticoids increase Angptl4 expression in vivo, we dissected the livers and epididymal WAT from C57BL6/J mice injected daily for 4 days with either DEX or PBS. We then used these tissues to prepare total RNA, synthesize cDNA, and perform qPCR to measure mRNA levels. DEX treatment increased the levels of CD36 mRNA (positive control) but had no effect on Soat1 (ACAT1) mRNA levels (negative control) in both liver and WAT (Fig. 1B). However, as it did in primary hepatocytes and adipocytes, DEX treatment of mice increased Angptl4 mRNA levels in both the liver and WAT (Fig. 1B), indicating that Angptl4 is regulated by glucocorticoids in vivo. We next sought to determine whether the increase in Angptl4 mRNA expression induced by DEX treatment is associated with an increase in ANGPTL4 protein levels. We performed Western blots on tissue lysates from control and DEX-treated mice, and found that DEX treatment for 4 days markedly elevated the levels of ANGPTL4 protein in both the WAT and liver (Fig. 1, C and D). Previous studies (19Mandard S. Zandbergen F. Tan N.S. Escher P. Patsouris D. Koenig W. Kleemann R. Bakker A. Veenman F. Wahli W. Müller M. Kersten S. J. Biol.

Our results from the WAT and livers of DEX-treated mice agree with these observations (Fig. 1C). We next investigated whether the elevation of Angptl4 mRNA by glucocorticoid treatment is due to an increase in the rate of Angptl4 transcription in H4IIE cells by using nuclear run-on assays. Cells were treated with DEX in DMSO for 10, 30, or 120 min. Control cells were either untreated or treated with DMSO alone for 120 min. Afterward, nuclear extracts were prepared from these cells, and in vitro transcription was performed by adding biotin-UTP. Newly synthesized RNA was then isolated on streptavidin beads. After random-primed cDNA was synthesized, qPCR was performed to detect changes in transcription rates using Angptl4 specific primers. No effect was seen after 10 min of DEX treatment (Fig. 2). However, treatments of 30 and 120 min both markedly increased the rate of Angptl4 transcription (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids can regulate Angptl4 at the transcriptional level. To investigate whether transcription of Angptl4 is directly regulated by the GR, we sought to identify GR binding sites within the Angptl4 genomic sequence. We applied a bioinformatic approach (BioProspector motif), with which we identified specific sequences within 64 kb of rat Angptl4 (which extended 32 kb upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site) that were highly similar (width of the first motif block was set at 14) to 79 previously identified GR binding sites (21So A.Y. Cooper S.B. Feldman B.J. Manuchehri M. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5745-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because many important transcriptional regulatory regions within genes are conserved between multiple species, we next employed a BLAST search of the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser to filter and isolate sequences conserved across the rat, mouse, and human genomes. This comparison yielded a single species-conserved palindromic sequence (AGAACATTTTGTTCT) located at the 3′-untranslated region of Angptl4 between 6267 and 6281 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A). We used a ChIP assay to investigate GR recruitment to this putative GR binding site in H4IIE cells. Cells were treated for 1 h with DEX and then harvested for ChIP (“Experimental Procedures”). Using a control IgG antibody for ChIP, the number of genomic DNA fragments that were amplified in the predicted GR binding site was similar between control (DMSO) and DEX-treated samples (data not shown). By contrast, using a GR-specific antibody for ChIP, we found that DEX treatment resulted in a ∼2.3-fold enrichment of genomic DNA fragments that amplified the predicted GR binding site (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that GR occupancy of this palindromic sequence occurs in a DEX-dependent manner, suggesting that this sequence may be a functional GRE. To test whether this identified genomic GR binding site is sufficient to mediate cellular responsiveness to glucocorticoids, we inserted the rat Angptl4 genomic DNA containing this sequence into a reporter plasmid that drove expression of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL4-ANGPTL4-GRBS, Fig. 4A). This plasmid was transfected into H4IIE cells, and 24 h later, cells were treated with either DMSO (control) or DEX overnight. Treatment with DEX strongly induced luciferase activity in transfected H4IIE cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that this predicted GRE confers glucocorticoid responsiveness. To test the specificity of this sequence in mediating the glucocorticoid response, we made a single nucleotide mutation within it (Fig. 4A, the mutated nucleotide is underlined). This nucleotide was chosen for mutation as previous studies demonstrated that it directly contacts GR and is an important mediator of glucocorticoid responses (22Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 23So A.Y. Chaivorapol C. Bolton E.C. Li H. Yamamoto K.R. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e94Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mutation of this nucleotide reduced the glucocorticoid response by more than 50% (Fig. 4B), consistent with this sequence being a functional GRE. Finally, we performed EMSA to confirm the direct binding of GR to the Angptl4 GRE. We found that 0.03125 μm purified GR DBD was able to bind efficiently to Cy5-labeled Angptl4 GRE and that this binding increased with the concentration of GR DBD protein in the reaction mixture, until, by 2 μm, it bound all of the labeled GRE (Fig. 4C). Notably, most GR DBD bound to the Angptl4 GRE as a dimer (Fig. 4C), a requirement for transactivation. Mutant Angptl4 GRE, which contains a single nucleotide change in one of the two GRE half-sites (Fig. 4A), had a compromised interaction with GR DBD (Fig. 4C). Although GR monomers could bind to mutant GRE, presumably at the wild-type half-site, GR dimers could not, consistent with decreased transactivation of mutant Angptl4 GRE by GR (Fig. 4B). Even 2 μm GR DBD only bound to mutant GRE as a monomer (Fig. 4C). Together these findings confirm that GR binds directly and specifically to the identified Angptl4 GRE. Chromatin architecture can control eukaryotic gene expression in vivo by modulating the accessibility of genomic sequences to transcriptional activation machinery (24Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L.

The most consistent brain structural abnormality in patients with schizophrenia is enlarged lateral ventricles. However, it is unknown whether the aetiology of ventriculomegaly in schizophrenia involves prenatal infectious processes. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that there is a causal relationship between prenatal immune challenge and emergence of ventricular abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia in adulthood.We used an established mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) by the viral mimic PolyI:C administered in early (day 9) or late (day 17) gestation. Automated voxel-based morphometry mapped cerebrospinal fluid across the whole brain of adult offspring and the results were validated by manual region-of-interest tracing of the lateral ventricles. Parallel behavioral testing determined the existence of schizophrenia-related sensorimotor gating abnormalities.PolyI:C-induced immune activation, in early but not late gestation, caused marked enlargement of lateral ventricles in adulthood, without affecting total white and grey matter volumes. This early exposure disrupted sensorimotor gating, in the form of prepulse inhibition. Identical immune challenge in late gestation resulted in significant expansion of 4(th) ventricle volume but did not disrupt sensorimotor gating.Our results provide the first experimental evidence that prenatal immune activation is an environmental risk factor for adult ventricular enlargement relevant to schizophrenia. The data indicate immune-associated environmental insults targeting early foetal development may have more extensive neurodevelopmental impact than identical insults in late prenatal life."
https://openalex.org/W2128989272,"Background Local public health agencies play a central role in response to an influenza pandemic, and understanding the willingness of their employees to report to work is therefore a critically relevant concern for pandemic influenza planning efforts. Witte's Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) has been found useful for understanding adaptive behavior in the face of unknown risk, and thus offers a framework for examining scenario-specific willingness to respond among local public health workers. We thus aim to use the EPPM as a lens for examining the influences of perceived threat and efficacy on local public health workers' response willingness to pandemic influenza. Methodology/Principal Findings We administered an online, EPPM-based survey about attitudes/beliefs toward emergency response (Johns Hopkins∼Public Health Infrastructure Response Survey Tool), to local public health employees in three states between November 2006 – December 2007. A total of 1835 responses were collected for an overall response rate of 83%. With some regional variation, overall 16% of the workers in 2006-7 were not willing to “respond to a pandemic flu emergency regardless of its severity”. Local health department employees with a perception of high threat and high efficacy – i.e., those fitting a ‘concerned and confident’ profile in the EPPM analysis – had the highest declared rates of willingness to respond to an influenza pandemic if required by their agency, which was 31.7 times higher than those fitting a ‘low threat/low efficacy’ EPPM profile. Conclusions/Significance In the context of pandemic influenza planning, the EPPM provides a useful framework to inform nuanced understanding of baseline levels of – and gaps in – local public health workers' response willingness. Within local health departments, ‘concerned and confident’ employees are most likely to be willing to respond. This finding may allow public health agencies to design, implement, and evaluate training programs focused on emergency response attitudes in health departments."
https://openalex.org/W2113525376,"Background The lactase enzyme allows lactose digestion in fresh milk. Its activity strongly decreases after the weaning phase in most humans, but persists at a high frequency in Europe and some nomadic populations. Two hypotheses are usually proposed to explain the particular distribution of the lactase persistence phenotype. The gene-culture coevolution hypothesis supposes a nutritional advantage of lactose digestion in pastoral populations. The calcium assimilation hypothesis suggests that carriers of the lactase persistence allele(s) (LCT*P) are favoured in high-latitude regions, where sunshine is insufficient to allow accurate vitamin-D synthesis. In this work, we test the validity of these two hypotheses on a large worldwide dataset of lactase persistence frequencies by using several complementary approaches. Methodology We first analyse the distribution of lactase persistence in various continents in relation to geographic variation, pastoralism levels, and the genetic patterns observed for other independent polymorphisms. Then we use computer simulations and a large database of archaeological dates for the introduction of domestication to explore the evolution of these frequencies in Europe according to different demographic scenarios and selection intensities. Conclusions Our results show that gene-culture coevolution is a likely hypothesis in Africa as high LCT*P frequencies are preferentially found in pastoral populations. In Europe, we show that population history played an important role in the diffusion of lactase persistence over the continent. Moreover, selection pressure on lactase persistence has been very high in the North-western part of the continent, by contrast to the South-eastern part where genetic drift alone can explain the observed frequencies. This selection pressure increasing with latitude is highly compatible with the calcium assimilation hypothesis while the gene-culture coevolution hypothesis cannot be ruled out if a positively selected lactase gene was carried at the front of the expansion wave during the Neolithic transition in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2022906555,"Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis requires numerous biosynthetic enzymes and activated sulfate and sugar donors. Although the sequence of biosynthetic events is resolved using reconstituted systems, little is known about the emergence of cell-specific GAG chains (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate) with distinct sulfation patterns. We have utilized a library of click-xylosides that have various aglycones to decipher the mechanism of GAG biosynthesis in a cellular system. Earlier studies have shown that both the concentration of the primers and the structure of the aglycone moieties can affect the composition of the newly synthesized GAG chains. However, it is largely unknown whether structural features of aglycone affect the extent of sulfation, sulfation pattern, disaccharide composition, and chain length of GAG chains. In this study, we show that aglycones can switch not only the type of GAG chains, but also their fine structures. Our findings provide suggestive evidence for the presence of GAGOSOMES that have different combinations of enzymes and their isoforms regulating the synthesis of cell-specific combinatorial structures. We surmise that click-xylosides are differentially recognized by the GAGOSOMES to generate distinct GAG structures as observed in this study. These novel click-xylosides offer new avenues to profile the cell-specific GAG chains, elucidate the mechanism of GAG biosynthesis, and to decipher the biological actions of GAG chains in model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2101711834,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive ataxia, is due to reduced levels of frataxin, a highly conserved mitochondrial iron-chaperone involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis. Most patients are homozygous for a (GAA)(n) expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. A few patients, either with typical or atypical clinical presentation, are compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a micromutation.We have developed a new strategy to generate murine cellular models for FRDA: cell lines carrying a frataxin conditional allele were used in combination with an EGFP-Cre recombinase to create murine cellular models depleted for endogenous frataxin and expressing missense-mutated human frataxin. We showed that complete absence of murine frataxin in fibroblasts inhibits cell division and leads to cell death. This lethal phenotype was rescued through transgenic expression of human wild type as well as mutant (hFXN(G130V) and hFXN(I154F)) frataxin. Interestingly, cells expressing the mutated frataxin presented a FRDA-like biochemical phenotype. Though both mutations affected mitochondrial ISC enzymes activities and mitochondria ultrastructure, the hFXN(I154F) mutant presented a more severe phenotype with affected cytosolic and nuclear ISC enzyme activities, mitochondrial iron accumulation and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The differential phenotype correlates with disease severity observed in FRDA patients.These new cellular models, which are the first to spontaneously reproduce all the biochemical phenotypes associated with FRDA, are important tools to gain new insights into the in vivo consequences of pathological missense mutations as well as for large-scale pharmacological screening aimed at compensating frataxin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2087223450,"T cell antigen recognition requires binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to a complex between peptide antigen and major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHC), and this recognition occurs at the interface between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell. The TCR and pMHC molecules are small compared with other abundant cell surface molecules, and it has been suggested that small size is functionally important. We show here that elongation of both mouse and human MHC class I molecules abrogates T cell antigen recognition as measured by cytokine production and target cell killing. This elongation disrupted tyrosine phosphorylation and Zap70 recruitment at the contact region without affecting TCR or coreceptor binding. Contact areas with elongated forms of pMHC showed an increase in intermembrane distance and less efficient segregation of CD3 from the large tyrosine phosphatase CD45. These findings demonstrate that T cell antigen recognition is strongly dependent on pMHC size and are consistent with models of TCR triggering requiring segregation or mechanical pulling of the TCR."
https://openalex.org/W2131536382,"Background Chromosome structure, DNA metabolic processes and cell type identity can all be affected by changing the positions of nucleosomes along chromosomal DNA, a reaction that is catalysed by SNF2-type ATP-driven chromatin remodelers. Recently it was suggested that in vivo, more than 50% of the nucleosome positions can be predicted simply by DNA sequence, especially within promoter regions. This seemingly contrasts with remodeler induced nucleosome mobility. The ability of remodeling enzymes to mobilise nucleosomes over short DNA distances is well documented. However, the nucleosome translocation processivity along DNA remains elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown what determines the initial direction of movement and how new nucleosome positions are adopted. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used AFM imaging and high resolution PAGE of mononucleosomes on 600 and 2500 bp DNA molecules to analyze ATP-dependent nucleosome repositioning by native and recombinant SNF2-type enzymes. We report that the underlying DNA sequence can control the initial direction of translocation, translocation distance, as well as the new positions adopted by nucleosomes upon enzymatic mobilization. Within a strong nucleosomal positioning sequence both recombinant Drosophila Mi-2 (CHD-type) and native RSC from yeast (SWI/SNF-type) repositioned the nucleosome at 10 bp intervals, which are intrinsic to the positioning sequence. Furthermore, RSC-catalyzed nucleosome translocation was noticeably more efficient when beyond the influence of this sequence. Interestingly, under limiting ATP conditions RSC preferred to position the nucleosome with 20 bp intervals within the positioning sequence, suggesting that native RSC preferentially translocates nucleosomes with 15 to 25 bp DNA steps. Conclusions/Significance Nucleosome repositioning thus appears to be influenced by both remodeler intrinsic and DNA sequence specific properties that interplay to define ATPase-catalyzed repositioning. Here we propose a successive three-step framework consisting of initiation, translocation and release steps to describe SNF2-type enzyme mediated nucleosome translocation along DNA. This conceptual framework helps resolve the apparent paradox between the high abundance of ATP-dependent remodelers per nucleus and the relative success of sequence-based predictions of nucleosome positioning in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1986899307,"Mechanisms contributing to disease-associated trinucleotide repeat instability are poorly understood. DNA ligation is an essential step common to replication and repair, both potential sources of repeat instability. Using derivatives of DNA ligase I (hLigI)-deficient human cells (46BR.1G1), we assessed the effect of hLigI activity, overexpression, and its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) upon the ability to replicate and repair trinucleotide repeats. Compared with LigI+/+, replication progression through repeats was poor, and repair tracts were broadened beyond the slipped-repeat for all mutant extracts. Increased repeat instability was linked only to hLigI overexpression and expression of a mutant hLigI incapable of interacting with PCNA. The endogenous mutant version of hLigI with reduced ligation activity did not alter instability. We distinguished the DNA processes through which hLigI contributes to trinucleotide instability. The highest levels of repeat instability were observed under the hLigI overexpression and were linked to reduced slipped-DNAs repair efficiencies. Therefore, the replication-mediated instability can partly be attributed to errors during replication but also to the poor repair of slipped-DNAs formed during this process. However, repair efficiencies were unaffected by expression of a PCNA interaction mutant of hLigI, limiting this instability to the replication process. The addition of purified proteins suggests that disruption of LigI and PCNA interactions influences trinucleotide repeat instability.

Thus, the recruitment of hLigI to specific replication and repair processes plays an important role in DNA metabolism and might accommodate particular requirements to DNA stability.In a yeast model for CTG/CAG repeat instability that is prone to contractions, disruption of the hLigI homologue (cdc9 gene) further increased this effect (5Schweitzer J.K.

Although these yeast studies did not reveal whether the effect of LigI was via DNA replication or repair, it highlighted a potentially active role of the enzyme in TNR instability.

The mutant allele expressed in SV40-immortalized fibroblasts established from this patient (46BR.1G1) encodes a version of hLigI (hemizygous or homozygous for the Arg-771 to Trp) which maintains only 3–5% of ligase activity compared with the non-mutant hLigI (16Barnes D.E.

In this study we have used derivatives of the deficient 46BR.1G1 cells expressing wild type and mutant versions of hLigI to gain insight into the role of this factor in regulating stability of TNRs.DISCUSSIONhLigI is not only the major ligase active at DNA replication forks but also participates in various forms of DNA repair. The involvement of DNA nicks in replication, repair, and recombination and the potential for repeat strand slippage at nicks present this step as one through which DNA mutations at repeat sequences may occur. Cell lines harboring distinct hLigI backgrounds (18Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr.

In agreement with published studies, DNA replication efficiency was dependent upon having enough ligation activity and the ability of hLigI to interact with PCNA (16Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E.

These results are also consistent with PCNA coordinating the action of hLigI during Okazaki fragment processing and ligation and the essential role of PCNA in efficient fork progression (17Prigent C.

At the same time, replication was slightly hindered by the presence of CTG/CAG repeats in the template, an effect further exacerbated by hLigI-altered backgrounds. Reduced replication across repeats may reflect frequent replication pauses and increased duration of mutant hLigI upon the DNA due to the presence of highly stable secondary structures formed by CTG/CAG repeats (60Veeraraghavan J.

Likewise, hLigI altered backgrounds resulted in larger, polar repair tracts that, unlike those generated by HeLa (LigI+/+), extended beyond the slip-out lesion. Similar increases in repair tracts resulting from hLigI deficiency have been described for base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and double-strand-break repair (17Prigent C. Satoh M.S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2628-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The widened and polar repair tracts are likely the result of strand displacement DNA synthesis under hLigI-deficient backgrounds (17Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). hLigI inhibits the strand displacement activity of DNA polymerase δ in long-patch base excision repair through an interaction with PCNA (21Pascucci B.

Similarly, polymerase δ strand displacement can be modulated in Okazaki fragment processing by PCNA, FEN-1, and RPA (64Maga G. Villani G. Tillement V. Stucki M. Locatelli G.A. Frouin I. Spadari S. Hübscher U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14298-14303Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Coordination of the ligation step with DNA repair excision and synthesis and replication fork progression clearly involve proper ligation activity and PCNA binding. A contribution of the mutant 46BR hLigI to the altered metabolism cannot be discarded, as this mutation was present in all 46BRLigI cell lines. This hypothesis is supported by the incompletely recovered replication-mediated instabilities by the hLigI-diluted extracts, which only approached the levels attained by the 46BRLigIm/m extract. It is also supported by the disconnect between the aberrant tract sizes and the altered repair efficiencies by all 46BR.1G1 cell variants. This might suggest the possibility that the endogenous mutant hLigI (Arg-771 to Trp mutation) (32Webster A.D. Barnes D.E. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Lindahl T. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1508-1509Abstract PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) may have a dominant negative effect on these processes (53Vijayakumar S. Dziegielewska B. Levin D.S. Song W. Yin J. Yang A.

We did not observe any significant change in CTG/CAG repeat instability because of reduced hLigI activity even after further reduction of this activity by drug inhibition. In accordance with our results, high levels of DNA instability have not been linked to deficiencies in ligase I activity (patient cells, transgenic mice, or yeast) (16Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E.

O'Sullivan M.J. Melton D.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4065-4074PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CTG/CAG instability was markedly increased in a replication direction-independent manner by extracts containing either high levels of wild type hLigI or a mutant version that is unable to bind PCNA.On several points our results agree with previous yeast studies (30Refsland E.W. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 2005; 171: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Subramanian J. Vijayakumar S. Tomkinson A.E. Arnheim N. Genetics. 2005; 171: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and extend them by revealing specific contributions of replication- or post-replication repair to repeat instability; (i) mutant low activity ligase did not affect instability, (ii) overexpression of wt-LigI increased instability, and (iii) a dependence upon PCNA interaction was observed in both studies. Although the yeast study observed a replication direction dependence on these effects, we observed effects for both directions. These differences may be because of the different types or levels of instability occurring in our primate system compared with the yeast model used. Although we did not test an effect of overexpression of a PCNA-interacting mutant ligase, as done in the yeast studies, we were able to distinguish the processes through which the PCNA-interacting mutant and the overexpressed functional ligase contribute to instability; the PCNA-interacting mutant contributes primarily through replication, whereas ligase overexpression was through repair and possibly replication. Although the yeast study did not distinguish these processes, the effects they observed may be similar to those we observe. Replication-induced repeat instability through loss of PCNA binding may be the result of a failure of hLigI to localize properly at replication foci (18Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2022151581,"Several studies have demonstrated that the passive transfer of protective antigen (PA)-neutralizing antibodies can protect animals against Bacillus anthracis infection. The standard protocol for the isolation of PA-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is based upon a primary selection of the highest PA-binders by ELISA, and usually yields only few candidates antibodies. We demonstrated that by applying a PA-neutralization functionality-based screen as the primary criterion for positive clones, it was possible to isolate more than 100 PA-neutralizing antibodies, some of which exhibited no measurable anti-PA titers in ELISA. Among the large panel of neutralizing antibodies identified, mAb 29 demonstrated the most potent activity, and was therefore chimerized. The variable region genes of the mAb 29 were fused to human constant region genes, to form the chimeric 29 antibody (cAb 29). Guinea pigs were fully protected against infection by 40LD(50)B. anthracis spores following two separate administrations with 10 mg/kg of cAb 29: the first administration was given before the challenge, and a second dose was administered on day 4 following exposure. Moreover, animals that survived the challenge and developed endogenous PA-neutralizing antibodies with neutralizing titers above 100 were fully protected against repeat challenges with 40LD(50) of B. anthracis spores. The data presented here emphasize the importance of toxin neutralization-based screens for the efficient isolation of protective antibodies that were probably overlooked in the standard screening protocol. The protective activity of the chimeric cAb 29 demonstrated in this study suggest that it may serve as an effective immunotherapeutic agent against anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W1991111651,"Signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) is a myeloid membrane receptor that interacts with the membrane protein CD47, a marker of self. We have solved the structure of the complete extracellular portion of SIRPalpha, comprising three immunoglobulin superfamily domains, by x-ray crystallography to 2.5 A resolution. These data, together with previous data on the N-terminal domain and its ligand CD47 (possessing a single immunoglobulin superfamily domain), show that the CD47-SIRPalpha interaction will span a distance of around 14 nm between interacting cells, comparable with that of an immunological synapse. The N-terminal (V-set) domain mediates binding to CD47, and the two others are found to be constant (C1-set) domains. C1-set domains are restricted to proteins involved in vertebrate antigen recognition: T cell antigen receptors, immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex antigens, tapasin, and beta2-microglobulin. The domains of SIRPalpha (domains 2 and 3) are structurally more similar to C1-set domains than any cell surface protein not involved in antigen recognition. This strengthens the suggestion from sequence analysis that SIRP is evolutionarily closely related to antigen recognition proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1999553798,"The anaerobic bacterium Finegoldia magna is part of the human commensal microbiota, but is also an important opportunistic pathogen. This bacterium expresses a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, SufA, which partially degrade the antibacterial chemokine MIG/CXCL9. Here, we show that MIG/CXCL9 is produced by human keratinocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. In contrast to the virulent human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, the presence of F. magna had no enhancing effect on the MIG/CXCL9 expression by keratinocytes, suggesting poor detection of the latter by pathogen-recognition receptors. When MIG/CXCL9 was exposed to SufA-expressing F. magna, the molecule was processed into several smaller fragments. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that SufA cleaves MIG/CXCL9 at several sites in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule. At equimolar concentrations, SufA-generated MIG/CXCL9 fragments were not bactericidal against F. magna, but retained their ability to kill S. pyogenes. Moreover, the SufA-generated MIG/CXCL9 fragments were capable of activating the angiostasis-mediating CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells, in an order of magnitude similar to that of intact MIG/CXCL9. F. magna expresses a surface protein called FAF that is released from the bacterial surface by SufA. Soluble FAF was found to bind and inactivate the antibacterial activity of MIG/CXCL9, thereby further potentially promoting the survival of F. magna. The findings suggest that SufA modulation of the inflammatory response could be a mechanism playing an important role in creating an ecologic niche for F. magna, decreasing antibacterial activity and suppressing angiogenesis, thus providing advantage in survival for this anaerobic opportunist compared with competing pathogens during inflammation."

We identified inherent physiological abnormalities in the circulating and splenic immune composition between PARP-1−/− and wild type (WT) mice. Upon EAE induction, PARP-1−/− mice had an earlier onset and developed a more severe EAE compared with WT cohorts.

However, we did not detect significant differences in cytokine profiles between PARP-1−/− and WT spinal cords at the peak of EAE. Expression analysis of different PARP isozymes in EAE spinal cords showed that PARP-1 was down-regulated in WT mice and that PARP-3 but not PARP-2 was dramatically up-regulated in both PARP-1−/− and WT mice, suggesting that these PARP isozymes could have distinct roles in different CNS pathologies.

Together, our results indicate that PARP-1 plays an important role in regulating the physiological immune composition and in immune modulation during EAE; our finding identifies a new aspect of immune regulation by PARPs in autoimmune CNS pathology.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, 18 PARP family members have been identified in the human genome (3Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Of these, PARP-1 is the most abundantly expressed PARP in most cell types (2Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), accounting for up to 85% of maximally activated cellular PARP activity (4Moroni F. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2008; 8: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Initially, PARP-1 function was associated only with DNA single-stranded break repair and maintenance of genomic integrity (5Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S.

Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mutagenesis. 2003; 18: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence has shown that PARP-1 plays important roles in multiple cellular and disease processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In several cell types, PARP-1 has been shown to have a direct role in gene expression by modulating specific transcription factors including those regulating inflammation (9Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Kraus W.L. Lis J.T.

Recent studies have also reported their involvement in DNA replication (12Sugimura K. Takebayashi S. Taguchi H. Takeda S. Okumura K. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and epigenetics (13Krishnakumar R. Gamble M.J. Frizzell K.M. Berrocal J.G. Kininis M. Kraus W.L.

Fisher R.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, excessive activation of PARP-1 has been shown to induce a form of caspase-independent cell death, which involves the nuclear translocation of the flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondria (16Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar, 17Koh D.W. Dawson T.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 264-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This type of cell death by PARP-1 activation, termed “parthanatos,” (19Andrabi S.A. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) has been implicated as an important mediator of various central nervous system (CNS) disorders (20Kauppinen T.M. Chan W.Y. Suh S.W. Wiggins A.K. Huang E.J. Swanson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7136-7141Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, several studies have examined PARP-1 as a target for therapeutic intervention (21Decker P. Muller S. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Kauppinen T.M. Suh S.W. Berman A.E. Hamby A.M. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb.

Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), and PARP-1 inhibitors are currently the focus of several clinical trials (25Helleday T. Petermann E. Lundin C. Hodgson B. Sharma R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase central nervous system experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein major histocompatibility complex interferon γ interleukin myelin basic protein complete Freund's adjuvant Hanks' balanced salt solution phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence-activated cell sorter quantitative PCR tumor necrosis factor-α transforming growth factor-β inducible nitric-oxide synthase intercellular adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule DNA methyltransferase 1 CCCTC binding factor T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 wild type. Mice lacking PARP-1 (PARP-1−/−) have also shown significant protection against various forms of CNS injury (26Kauppinen T.M. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 50: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These mice are resistant to neuronal cell death after ischemia-reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration (27Goto S. Xue R. Sugo N. Sawada M. Blizzard K.K. Poitras M.F. Johns D.C. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Crain B.J. Traystman R.J. Mori S. Hurn P.D.

Furthermore, PARP-1 deficiency is suggested to alter immune responses, as PARP-1−/− mice showed resistance to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock (29Oliver F.J. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). This immunomodulation has been suggested to be a result of PARP-1 regulation of transcriptional networks involved in immune cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production (30Saenz L. Lozano J.J. Valdor R. Baroja-Mazo A. Ramirez P. Parrilla P. Aparicio P. Sumoy L. Yélamos J. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 171Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Modulation of the activity of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) by PARP-1 has been reported in T lymphocytes (29Oliver F.J. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 31Kameoka M.

Moreover, T cell-dependent antibody responses are also found to be markedly reduced in PARP-1−/− mice (33Ambrose H.E. Willimott S. Beswick R.W. Dantzer F. de Murcia J.M. Yelamos J. Wagner S.D. Immunology. 2009; 127: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to immune activation, there is also evidence indicating that PARP-1 could be required in earlier stages of immune system maturation. For example, in vitro experiments have suggested that PARP-1 is critical for the functional maturation of dendritic cells (34Aldinucci A. Gerlini G. Fossati S. Cipriani G. Ballerini C. Biagioli T. Pimpinelli N. Borgognoni L. Massacesi L. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation and proinflammatory gene expression in resident immune cells in the brain (microglia and astrocytes) have also been found altered in vitro by the deficiency of PARP-1 (11Ha H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Kauppinen T.M. Swanson R.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2288-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or in the presence of PARP inhibitors (35Kauppinen T.M. Swanson R.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2288-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 36Phulwani N.K. Kielian T. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In animal models, administration of putative PARP-1 inhibitors, such as 6(5H)-phenanthridinone, benzamide, PJ-34, and 5-aminoisoquinolinone, has been shown to ameliorate clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (37Chiarugi A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Scott G.S. Kean R.B. Mikheeva T. Fabis M.J. Mabley J.G. Szabó C. Hooper D.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), experimental autoimmune arthritis (39Gonzalez-Rey E. Martínez-Romero R. O'Valle F. Aguilar-Quesada R. Conde C. Delgado M. Oliver F.J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and experimental autoimmune diabetes (40Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Mabley J.G. Power R. Szabó C. Rabinovitch A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These effects have been suggested to be caused mainly by attenuation of inflammatory responses involving multiple immune cell types (41Masutani M. Nakagama H. Sugimura T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although PARP-1 is believed to be the primary target in these studies, the specificity of these inhibitors on the different PARP isozymes has not been completely examined (42Nottbohm A.C. Hergenrother P.J. Huang Z. Drug Discovery Research: New Frontiers in the Post-Genomic Era. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ2007: 163-185Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that there may be distinct but cooperative roles for PARP-1 and other PARP family members in their immunomodulatory effects (36Phulwani N.K. Kielian T. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite all of these previous studies, the specific role of PARP-1 in CNS immune injury seen in multiple sclerosis remains largely unclear. In this study, we examined the autoimmune response and progression of EAE in PARP-1−/− mice. Our results unexpectedly demonstrated that the deficiency of PARP-1 markedly alters the immune phenotype, leading to an exacerbated EAE in PARP-1−/− mice. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. New England Peptide (Gardner, MA) synthesized the peptide containing amino acids 35–55 of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) used in this study. Antibodies against CD4, CD8, B220, CD25, CD11c, CD11b, CD45, MHC Class II, IFNγ, and IL-17 were purchased from BD Biosciences, CD14 and F4/80 were from eBioscience (San Diego), CD68 was from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC), myelin basic protein (MBP) was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), Iba1 was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), and AlexaFluor 488- and 555-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. Liberase RI and DNase I were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Percoll was from GE Healthcare. MACS® reagents for CD11c+ cell purification were from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Quantitative PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Breeding pairs with a homozygous deletion of the PARP-1 gene (129S-Parp1tm1Zqw/J) (43Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) and wild type (WT) controls in the same 129S genetic background (129S1/SvImJ) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and were bred and genotyped for the experiments. Animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Davis. In 10-week-old mice, EAE was induced by injecting an emulsion of 300 μg of MOG peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously on either hind flank as two injections. In addition, 250 ng of pertussis toxin was injected intraperitoneally on the same day as MOG-CFA, and another dose was administered after 48 h. Body weights of mice were recorded before MOG-CFA injection and then continuously at 2-day intervals. Disease development was monitored daily, and the severity of clinical signs was scored based on a standard neurological scoring system for EAE as follows: 1, limp tail or waddling gait; 2, limp tail and ataxia; 2.5, single limb paresis and ataxia; 3, double limb paresis; 3.5, single limb paralysis and paresis of second limb; 4, full paralysis of two limbs; 4.5, moribund; 5, dead. Scoring was performed in a blind fashion, and all animals were genotyped again for confirmation at the end of each experiment. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture under anesthesia (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and placed in EDTA-coated vacutainers (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and stored at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed within 2 to 3 h after collection using the Hemavet multispecies hematological analyzer 850FS (Drew Scientific, Waterbury, CT) calibrated for use in the mouse. Measurements for erythrocyte, total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were carried out. A manual differential count on Giemsa-stained blood smears was also performed simultaneously to validate automated results. Sample names were coded, and manual counts were performed in a blind fashion. Spleens were removed from either anesthetized mice before perfusion or immediately after euthanasia in a CO2 chamber and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) on ice. They were then sliced into small pieces (∼1 mm3) in a Petri dish using surgical blades, and a single cell suspension was prepared by gently forcing the pieces through a 100-μm cell strainer. The resulting cell suspension was then centrifuged and resuspended in red blood corpuscle lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science), allowed to shake at room temperature for 10 min, and washed with RPMI lymphocyte culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) by centrifugation and resuspension at 4 °C. Isolated splenocytes were subsequently counted to estimate total cell numbers and prepared for either flow cytometry or cell culture as described below. To examine CD4+ T cell subsets expressing IFNγ (Th1 cells) and IL-17 (Th17 cells), we performed an in vitro treatment of lymphocyte preparations with MOG. For this specific assay, mice were sampled at days 7 and 10 of EAE when there was a high peripheral lymphocyte response. Spleens were processed as described above; but in addition to spleens, lymph nodes (superficial cervicals, axillary, brachial, mesenteric, and inguinal) were also included in the cell isolation. For culture, 3 × 105 cells were plated on Costar® ultra-low-binding 96-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA). MOG was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and cells were incubated in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 20 h. During the last 5 h of incubation, cells were exposed to brefeldin A (Golgi Stop®, BD Biosciences) to facilitate/enhance intracellular staining by retaining cytokines within the cells. Controls without MOG treatment, to visualize background, and positive controls using phorbol myristyl acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (750 ng/ml) during the last 2 h of incubation, to evaluate the viability and positive response of the CD4+ T lymphocytes in culture, were performed. At the end of incubation, cells were collected and processed for flow cytometry. Mouse spleens (three pooled for each sample) were collected in RPMI medium containing 0.5 Wünsch units/ml Liberase RI (Roche Applied Science) and 14 μg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science). Spleens were then sliced into small pieces using surgical blades and incubated with continuous shaking for 30 min at room temperature. During incubation, spleen pieces were triturated every 10 min by using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. At the end of incubation, EDTA (10 mm final concentration) was added to stop the enzymatic reaction. Red blood corpuscle lysis was performed as described above, and cells were subsequently separated in a step Percoll gradient. In brief, cells were resuspended in 40% Percoll in RPMI medium with 2 mm EDTA, overlaid on 70% Percoll in the same medium, and centrifuged at 2,800 rpm at 4 °C for 25 min. Cells at the interface were collected with a Pasteur pipette into a separate tube, washed twice, and resuspended in RPMI medium with 2 mm EDTA. Cells were then counted and incubated with rat anti-mouse CD3 and CD19 antibodies for 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EDTA, added to a tube of equilibrated sheep anti-rat Biomag beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with continuous rotary mixing. After incubation, the Biomag bead-bound cells were removed by magnetic separation, and the non-bound cells were processed for magnetic sorting (MACS®, Miltenyi Biotec) using CD11c+ selection. In brief, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EDTA and incubated with FcR block (eBioscience) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with CD11c-specific MACS® beads for 15 min in a rotary mixer at 4 °C. The incubation suspension was then loaded on an equilibrated MACS LS column; bound cells were washed three times and eluted. Cells were then counted, and the purity of each preparation was tested using flow cytometry for CD11c+ cells as described below; only samples of >90% purity were used for further experiments. To examine the antigen uptake potential of PARP-1−/− dendritic cells, we performed specific assays for phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. In this experiment, purified dendritic cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells on Costar® ultra-low-binding 96-well plates. For the phagocytosis assay, FITC-conjugated albumin was added at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. For the macropinocytosis assay, FITC-conjugated dextran was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cells under both conditions were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. Negative controls without albumin or dextran and a more stringent temperature-based control in which cells exposed to either FITC-albumin or FITC-dextran were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h were also set up concurrently. At the end of incubation, the cells were processed for flow cytometry to estimate uptake by quantifying FITC fluorescence along with the detection of CD11c+ cells as described below. Transcardial perfusion was carried out under anesthesia with 20 ml of sterile PBS to clear all vascular blood cells in the CNS. Immediately after perfusion, brain and spinal cord were removed by dissection in a laminar flow unit and placed in HBSS (with 2 mm EDTA) on ice. Collected tissues were chopped into small pieces (∼1 mm3) in a Petri dish with digestion buffer (HBSS with 0.5 Wünsch Units/ml Liberase RI and 14 μg/ml DNase I) using a sterile scalpel blade. The tissue pieces were then incubated in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and shaking at 100 rpm/min for 25 min. After incubation, the resulting isolated cells were passed through a 100-μm cell strainer and rinsed twice with HBSS. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and subsequently separated in a step Percoll gradient as described for dendritic cells. Cells at the interface were collected with a Pasteur pipette into a separate tube and washed twice by centrifugation and resuspension in HBSS. These cells were counted and prepared for either flow cytometry or cell culture. Before antibody labeling, cells were spun down and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin with 0.1% azide). To reduce nonspecific antibody binding, surface Fc receptors were blocked using FcR block for 30 min. Surface labeling using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (CD4, CD8, B220, CD14, F4/80, MHC Class II, CD11c, CD25, CD11b, CD45, and isotype controls) was carried out directly in FACS buffer with a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed by centrifugation and resuspension in FACS buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were subsequently either fixed with 1% formaldehyde solution for analysis or permeabilized for intracellular labeling (IFNγ, IL-17, CD68, and isotype controls). For intracellular labeling for IFNγ and IL-17, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD Cytofix and Cytoperm buffers (BD Biosciences). Fluorophore-conjugated IFNγ and IL-17 were then added into BD Cytoperm buffer and allowed to label overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were washed with BD Cytoperm buffer, fixed using 1% formaldehyde solution, and analyzed. For intracellular labeling of CD68, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Leucoperm (AbD Serotec) and processed as described above for IFNγ and IL-17. Data acquisition from labeled cells was performed in a CyAN flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Isotype and autofluorescence controls were examined for each assay. Acquired data were subsequently analyzed by calculating proportions/percentages and average intensities using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Absolute numbers of cellular subtypes were derived from percentages using the total cell numbers counted after isolation. Spinal cords were dissected from transcardial perfusion-fixed animals and placed in 4% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. Samples were then embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Sections (10 μm thick) were prepared in a cryotome and stored at −20 °C until use. For routine histological examination, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For localization of MBP and Iba1, slides were post-fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked using 10% normal goat serum, and then samples were incubated with primary antibodies against either MBP or Iba1 overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed in PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500). Fluorescent nuclear counterstaining was carried out using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μm final concentration; Invitrogen) for 10 min. Slides were then washed in PBS and mounted using ProLong Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen). Images were acquired on an Olympus BX61-DSU microscope (Olympus Corp., Melville, NY) using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). To examine the relative expression of immune cytokines, adhesion molecules, PARP isozymes and epigenetic regulators during EAE in PARP-1−/− and WT mice, we used a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. Total RNA was extracted from lumbar spinal cords isolated (after clearing vascular blood cells as described earlier) from non-immunized mice (Day 0) and from mice at their peak of clinical EAE scores (Day 14) using a Qiagen RNeasy lipid mini kit following the standard protocol. For quality control, RNA purity was verified using the OD260/280 ratio to be between 1.8 and 2.0. Total RNA (1.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using MultiscribeTM reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Subsequent qPCR reactions for TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, iNOS, and TGFβ were performed in triplicate on a Roche Lightcycler 480 using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) with specific primers (supplemental Table 1) either designed or selected from published literature (44Overbergh L. Valckx D. Waer M. Mathieu C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 45Cho I.H. Hong J. Suh E.C. Kim J.H. Lee H. Lee J.E. Lee S. Kim C.H. Kim D.W. Jo E.K. Lee K.E. Karin M. Lee S.J. Brain. 2008; 131: 3019-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The specificity of products from each primer set was validated by analyzing melting curves (Tm). To examine the induction of PARP-1 and relative changes in PARP-2, PARP-3, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) expression during EAE in WT and PARP-1−/− mice, qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate using validated TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems), PARP-1 (Mm00500171_g1), PARP-2 (Mm01319555_m1), PARP-3 (Mm00467486_m1), ICAM-1 (Mm 01175876_g1), VCAM-1 (Mm01320970_m1), DNMT1 (Mm01151065_g1), CTCF (Mm004840 27_m1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Mm99999915_g1).

https://openalex.org/W2084722362,"Tropomyosin is a prototypical coiled coil along its length with subtle variations in structure that allow interactions with actin and other proteins. Actin binding globally stabilizes tropomyosin. Tropomyosin-actin interaction occurs periodically along the length of tropomyosin. However, it is not well understood how tropomyosin binds actin.Tropomyosin's periodic binding sites make differential contributions to two components of actin binding, cooperativity and affinity, and can be classified as primary or secondary sites. We show through mutagenesis and analysis of recombinant striated muscle alpha-tropomyosins that primary actin binding sites have a destabilizing coiled-coil interface, typically alanine-rich, embedded within a non-interface recognition sequence. Introduction of an Ala cluster in place of the native, more stable interface in period 2 and/or period 3 sites (of seven) increased the affinity or cooperativity of actin binding, analysed by cosedimentation and differential scanning calorimetry. Replacement of period 3 with period 5 sequence, an unstable region of known importance for cooperative actin binding, increased the cooperativity of binding. Introduction of the fluorescent probe, pyrene, near the mutation sites in periods 2 and 3 reported local instability, stabilization by actin binding, and local unfolding before or coincident with dissociation from actin (measured using light scattering), and chain dissociation (analyzed using circular dichroism).This, and previous work, suggests that regions of tropomyosin involved in binding actin have non-interface residues specific for interaction with actin and an unstable interface that is locally stabilized upon binding. The destabilized interface allows residues on the coiled-coil surface to obtain an optimal conformation for interaction with actin by increasing the number of local substates that the side chains can sample. We suggest that local disorder is a property typical of coiled coil binding sites and proteins that have multiple binding partners, of which tropomyosin is one type."
https://openalex.org/W2082320704,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses multiple mechanisms to avoid elimination by the immune system. We have previously shown that M. tuberculosis can inhibit selected macrophage responses to IFN-γ through TLR2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To specifically address the role of TLR2 signaling in mediating this inhibition, we stimulated macrophages with the specific TLR2/1 ligand Pam3CSK4 and assayed responses to IFN-γ. Pam3CSK4 stimulation prior to IFN-γ inhibited transcription of the unrelated IFN-γ-inducible genes, CIITA and CXCL11. Surface expression of MHC class II and secretion of CXCL11 were greatly reduced as well, indicating that the reduction in transcripts had downstream effects. Inhibition of both genes required new protein synthesis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that TLR2 stimulation inhibited IFN-γ-induced RNA polymerase II binding to the CIITA and CXCL11 promoters. Furthermore, TATA binding protein was unable to bind the TATA box of the CXCL11 promoter, suggesting that assembly of transcriptional machinery was disrupted. However, TLR2 stimulation affected chromatin modifications differently at each of the inhibited promoters. Histone H3 and H4 acetylation was reduced at the CIITA promoter but unaffected at the CXCL11 promoter. In addition, NF-κB signaling was required for inhibition of CXCL11 transcription, but not for inhibition of CIITA. Taken together, these results indicate that TLR2-dependent inhibition of IFN-γ-induced gene expression is mediated by distinct, gene-specific mechanisms that disrupt binding of the transcriptional machinery to the promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2038670986,"Background Although lacking visual experience with numerosities, recent evidence shows that the blind perform similarly to sighted persons on numerical comparison or parity judgement tasks. In particular, on tasks presented in the auditory modality, the blind surprisingly show the same effect that appears in sighted persons, demonstrating that numbers are represented through a spatial code, i.e. the Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect. But, if this is the case, how is this numerical spatial representation processed in the brain of the blind? Principal Findings Here we report that, although blind and sighted people have similarly organized numerical representations, the attentional shifts generated by numbers have different electrophysiological correlates (sensorial N100 in the sighted and cognitive P300 in the blind). Conclusions These results highlight possible differences in the use of spatial representations acquired through modalities other than vision in the blind population."
https://openalex.org/W2041004261,"Background Although dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure (HF), the mechanism underlying DCM is not well understood. Previously, it has been demonstrated that an integrative analysis of gene expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of various diseases. In this study we develop a systems approach by linking public available gene expression data on ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ICM), a main pathological form of DCM, with data from a layered PPI network. We propose that the use of a layered PPI network, as opposed to a traditional PPI network, provides unique insights into the mechanism of DCM. Methods Four Cytoscape plugins including BionetBuilder, NetworkAnalyzer, Cerebral and GenePro were used to establish the layered PPI network, which was based upon validated subcellular protein localization data retrieved from the HRPD and Entrez Gene databases. The DAVID function annotation clustering tool was used for gene ontology (GO) analysis. Results The assembled layered PPI network was divided into four layers: extracellular, plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. The characteristics of the gene expression pattern of the four layers were compared. In the extracellular and plasma membrane layers, there were more proteins encoded by down-regulated genes than by up-regulated genes, but in the other two layers, the opposite trend was found. GO analysis established that proteins encoded by up-regulated genes, reflecting significantly over-represented biological processes, were mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm layers, while proteins encoded by down-regulated genes were mainly located in the extracellular and plasma membrane layers. The PPI network analysis revealed that the Janus family tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling pathway might play an important role in the development of ICM and could be exploited as a therapeutic target of ICM. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) may also be a potential candidate target, but more evidence is required. Conclusion This study illustrated that by incorporating subcellular localization information into a PPI network based analysis, one can derive greater insights into the mechanisms underlying ICM."
https://openalex.org/W2058649586,"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is the most abundant heterocyclic amine in cooked foods, and is both mutagenic and carcinogenic. It has been suspected that the carcinogenicity of PhIP is derived from its ability to form DNA adducts, principally dG-C8-PhIP. To shed further light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of mutations by PhIP, in vitro DNA synthesis analyses were carried out using a dG-C8-PhIP-modified oligonucleotide template. In this template, the dG-C8-PhIP adduct was introduced into the second G of the TCC GGG AAC sequence located in the 5' region. This represents one of the mutation hot spots in the rat Apc gene that is targeted by PhIP. Guanine deletions at this site in the Apc gene have been found to be preferentially induced by PhIP in rat colon tumors. DNA synthesis with A- or B-family DNA polymerases, such as Escherichia coli polymerase (pol) I and human pol delta, was completely blocked at the adducted guanine base. Translesional synthesis polymerases of the Y-family, pol eta, pol iota, pol kappa, and REV1, were also used for in vitro DNA synthesis analyses with the same templates. REV1, pol eta, and pol kappa were able to insert dCTP opposite dG-C8-PhIP, although the efficiencies for pol eta and pol kappa were low. pol kappa was also able to catalyze the extension reaction from the dC opposite dG-C8-PhIP, during which it often skipped over one dG of the triple dG sequence on the template. This slippage probably leads to the single dG base deletion in colon tumors."

All the mutants except the swap mutant S186E/E439S showed markedly reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity, and S186E/E439S restored completely the wild-type activity. In all the mutants except S186E/E439S, the isomerization of ADP-sensitive phosphorylated intermediate (<i>E</i>1P) to <i>E</i>2P was markedly retarded, and the <i>E</i>2P hydrolysis was largely accelerated, whereas S186E/E439S restored almost the wild-type rates. Results showed that the Ser<sup>186</sup>-Glu<sup>439</sup> hydrogen bond stabilizes the <i>E</i>2P ground state structure. The modulatory ATP binding at sub-mm∼mm range largely accelerated the <i>E</i>P isomerization in all the alanine mutants and E439S. In S186E, this acceleration as well as the acceleration of the ATPase activity was almost completely abolished, whereas the swap mutation S186E/E439S restored the modulatory ATP acceleration with a much higher ATP affinity than the wild type. Results indicated that Ser<sup>186</sup> and Glu<sup>439</sup> are closely located to the modulatory ATP binding site for the <i>E</i>P isomerization, and that their hydrogen bond fixes their side chain configurations thereby adjusts properly the modulatory ATP affinity to respond to the cellular ATP level."
https://openalex.org/W2047215427,"Recently, researchers who support “network neutrality” have become worried that the Internet may lose its innovative edge. They are concerned that control could be shifting from the edges of the Internet toward the service providers at the center, which would allow the providers to have “gatekeeper” capacity and would contradict the Internet's “end-to-end” principle ( 1 – 3 ). This core tenet states that control over information flows should take place, to the extent possible, at the end points of the network ( 4 ). President Obama supported net neutrality during his campaign ( 4 ) and in recent statements ( 5 ), and the European Parliament has added net neutrality to its recent telecom bill ( 6 ). Taking the end-to-end principle from protocols to users, Jonathan Zittrain has called for maintaining the Internet's “generativity,” the ability of users at the network's end points to create, distribute, and run whatever software code they choose ( 7 ). There are good reasons to preserve network neutrality and generativity, but it is unclear whether these are sufficient to ensure continued innovation. The larger issue is what policies are optimal to foster innovation on the Internet?"
https://openalex.org/W2001763155,"It is well accepted that the brain's computation relies on spatiotemporal activity of neural networks. In particular, there is growing evidence of the importance of continuously and precisely timed spiking activity. Therefore, it is important to characterize memory states in terms of spike-timing patterns that give both reliable memory of firing activities and precise memory of firing timings. The relationship between memory states and spike-timing patterns has been studied empirically with large-scale recording of neuron population in recent years. Here, by using a recurrent neural network model with dynamics at two time scales, we construct a dynamical memory network model which embeds both fast neural and synaptic variation and slow learning dynamics. A state vector is proposed to describe memory states in terms of spike-timing patterns of neural population, and a distance measure of state vector is defined to study several important phenomena of memory dynamics: partial memory recall, learning efficiency, learning with correlated stimuli. We show that the distance measure can capture the timing difference of memory states. In addition, we examine the influence of network topology on learning ability, and show that local connections can increase the network's ability to embed more memory states. Together theses results suggest that the proposed system based on spike-timing patterns gives a productive model for the study of detailed learning and memory dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2070999642,"Tumors deficient in expression of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) usually fail to induce T-cell-mediated immunity and are resistant to T-cell lysis. However, we have found that introduction of the B7.1 gene into TAP-negative (TAP(-)) or TAP1-transfected (TAP1(+)) murine lung carcinoma CMT.64 cells can augment the capacity of the cells to induce a protective immune response against wild-type tumor cells. Differences in the strength of the protective immune responses were observed between TAP(-) and TAP1(+) B7.1 expressing CMT.64 cells depending on the doses of gamma-irradiated cell immunization. While mice immunized with either high or low dose of B7.1-expressing TAP1(+) cells rejected TAP(-) tumors, only high dose immunization with B7.1-expressing TAP(-) cells resulted in tumor rejection. The induced protective immunity was T-cell dependent as demonstrated by dramatically reduced antitumor immunity in mice depleted of CD8 or CD4 cells. Augmentation of T-cell mediated immune response against TAP(-) tumor cells was also observed in a virally infected tumor cell system. When mice were immunized with a high dose of gamma-irradiated CMT.64 cells infected with vaccinia viruses carrying B7.1 and/or TAP1 genes, we found that the cells co-expressing B7.1 and TAP1, but not those expressing B7.1 alone, induced protective immunity against CMT.64 cells. In addition, inoculation with live tumor cells transfected with several different gene(s) revealed that only B7.1- and TAP1-coexpressing tumor cells significantly decreased tumorigenicity. These results indicate that B7.1-provoked antitumor immunity against TAP(-) cancer is facilitated by TAP1-expression, and thus both genes should be considered for cancer therapy in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2011980144,"Video sensors with embedded compression offer significant energy savings in transmission but incur energy losses in the complexity of the encoder. Energy efficient video compression architectures for CMOS image sensors with focal-plane change detection are presented and analyzed. The compression architectures use pixel-level computational circuits to minimize energy usage by selectively processing only pixels which generate significant temporal intensity changes. Using the temporal intensity change detection to gate the operation of a differential DCT based encoder achieves nearly identical image quality to traditional systems (4dB decrease in PSNR) while reducing the amount of data that is processed by 67% and reducing overall power consumption reduction of 51%. These typical energy savings, resulting from the sparsity of motion activity in the visual scene, demonstrate the utility of focal-plane change triggered compression to surveillance vision systems."
