https://openalex.org/W1969800514,"Four persons developed marked parkinsonism after using an illicit drug intravenously. Analysis of the substance injected by two of these patients revealed primarily 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) with trace amounts of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxy-piperidine (MPPP). On the basis of the striking parkinsonian features observed in our patients, and additional pathological data from one previously reported case, it is proposed that this chemical selectively damages cells in the substantia nigra."
https://openalex.org/W2062594120,"Tumor ascites fluids from guinea pigs, hamsters, and mice contain activity that rapidly increases microvascular permeability. Similar activity is also secreted by these tumor cells and a variety of other tumor cell lines in vitro. The permeability-increasing activity purified from either the culture medium or ascites fluid of one tumor, the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma, is a 34,000- to 42,000-dalton protein distinct from other known permeability factors."

https://openalex.org/W1981147697,"It has been proposed that cell-cell recognition occurs by means of local cell surface modulation of a small number of proteins rather than by expression of large numbers of different cell surface markers. Several different cell adhesion molecules (CAM's) have now been found in a number of vertebrate species in different tissues such as liver and striated muscle and even in a single complex structure such as the brain, where different molecules specific for neurons and glia have been identified. The neuron-specific molecule is involved in early embryonic events but also mediates neurite fasciculation, neuromuscular interaction, and orderly layering of neural tissue. It undergoes local surface modulation with loss of sialic acid during development. A failure of this process is closely correlated with connectional disorders in the staggerer mutant of the mouse. The accumulated data on this and other CAM's favor modulation theories rather than strict chemoaffinity theories of cell-cell recognition."

These results assign the gene for the hereditary form of retinoblastoma to band q14 on chromosome 13, the same region which is affected in the chromosome deletion form of this eye tumor, and therefore suggest a common underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of these two forms of retinoblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W2039690588,"Evoked potential indices of an early and late stage of attentional processing were recorded from schizophrenic and normal subjects during dichotic listening tasks. Despite slow and inaccurate detections, the schizophrenic subjects were able to focus selectively to different ears but only at a fast stimulation rate, showing integrity of the early selective stage. They showed an abnormal late stage, indicating inefficiency in processing information from detected targets. Marked deficits at a slow stimulation rate and during divided attention suggest that the schizophrenic attention disorder is one of control and maintenance of a selective processing strategy rather than of general slowness or absence of selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2000925896,"A genetic recombinant within the major histocompatibility (B) complex of the chicken has revealed the chromosomal subregion effecting resistance to Marek's disease--a malignant lymphoma induced by a herpesvirus. The recombinant, BF21-G19, occurred spontaneously among the progeny of a male heterozygous for resistant BF21-G21 and susceptible BF19-G19 haplotypes. Exposure to Marek's disease of families segregating for the recombinant showed that this new F-G arrangement conferred a level of resistance equivalent to that of the resistant parental haplotype. Thus, a gene, or genes, within or closely linked to the B-F region of the B complex appears to be responsible for the observed resistance to Marek's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2024016245,"Cholesterol-loaded macrophages secrete cholesterol and apolipoprotein E. The current studies show that this secretion occurs by two independent pathways. In the absence of serum, the cells secrete apolipoprotein E, but not cholesterol. In the presence of monensin (an inhibitor of protein secretion), the cells secrete cholesterol, but little apolipoprotein E. After secretion, apolipoprotein E and cholesterol associate with high-density lipoprotein to form a particle that can deliver cholesterol to the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis. We conclude that apolipoprotein E does not function to remove cholesterol from macrophages but rather to participate in ""reverse cholesterol transport."""
https://openalex.org/W2078828436,"A modified flow cytometer has been used to detect attogram quantities of aqueous rhodamine 6G by laser-induced fluorescence analysis. A detection limit of 28 attograms (35,000 molecules) was obtained, nearly two orders of magnitude better than earlier measurements. The detection limit in concentration units was 1.4 x 10(-13) mole per liter. During the 1-second measurement period, the total volume sampled was 0.42 microliter. On average, only half a rhodamine 6G molecule was present in the 6-picoliter probed volume."
https://openalex.org/W1999014676,"Developmental changes in the site of receptor damage following pure-tone acoustic overstimulation were examined in the basilar papillae of embryonic and hatchling chickens. During development, a systematic shift in the position of damage toward the apex of the cochlea was produced by each of three frequencies, suggesting that the transduction properties of the sensory epithelium systematically shift with age. These results imply that neurons in the central nervous system may be maximally stimulated by different sounds during development."

https://openalex.org/W2057939038,"The proposition that a set of unlinked
genes could be coordinately induced by
means of cis interactions with a common
regulatory molecule retains an attractive
simplicity. The idea requires that some
form of homologous sequence exists in the
vicinity of genes that are functionally
related and are induced in concert. As
primary sequence data for sets of such
genes have become available, several
interesting homologies have indeed turned
up. Though the shared sequence elements
are quite short, the statistical probability of
their chance occurrence in similar positions
with respect to each of the several
coordinately induced genes is extremely
low. Furthermore, in two such cases, direct
evidence has been obtained by DNA
transformation that the short repeated
sequence elements shared among the
5'-flanking regions of the inducible genes
are required for regulation."

In embryos, neurons at any given position in these nuclei were maximally sensitive to lower frequency sounds than the best frequency after hatching. This finding indicates that neurons are maximally stimulated by sounds of different frequencies as development proceeds and supports the hypothesis that during development there is a change in the spatial encoding of frequency along the cochlea."

https://openalex.org/W2070744240,Weekly transfusions of whole blood from a nondiabetic subline of BB/W rats reduced the incidence of diabetes in susceptible BB/W rats from 39 to 0 percent and the incidence of pancreatic insulitis from 64 to 6 percent. Responsiveness of lymphocytes to concanavalin A was found to be low in rats with diabetes or insulitis. Transfusion restored concanavalin A responsiveness to levels observed in control rats free of diabetes or insulitis. These data suggest that whole blood alters the course of autoimmune BB/W rat diabetes.

A two-dimensional spatial configuration was found to be suitable to represent the dissimilarity data, and the two dimensions could be interpreted as corresponding to the position of the apical and basal electrode of the two-electrode combination.

https://openalex.org/W2070533172,"The anatomy of the posterior basicranium has been repeatedly invoked in systematic definitions of Primates. One widely cited definition of the order claims that 'all undoubted primates' are distinguished from other mammals by two basicranial specializations: (1) absence of a major vascular foramen on the medial side of the auditory region, and (2) development of the auditory bulla from the petrosal bone. As we show here, specialization (1) does not apply to the paromomyid Ignacius, and is of uncertain incidence in other unquestioned members of suborder Plesiadapiformes (archaic primates from the early Cenozoic of Europe and North America). Specialization (2) cannot be demonstrated without ontogenetic evidence, and all relevant plesiadapiform fossils are adult. In fact, the only plesiadapiform with an arterial pattern remotely resembling that of early primates of modern aspect (or 'euprimates') is the microsyopid Cynodontomys, but it is often regarded as non-primate because it lacks a petrosal bulla. Although plesiadapiforms resemble euprimates in traits of the cheek teeth and postcranium, some other (presumably non-primate) groups possess these traits as well. Since the order Primates is not clearly definable by unique specializations, the best grounds for regarding plesiadapiforms as euprimate antecedents are stratigraphic and phenetic. This fact may be best expressed by systematic arrangements that emphasize adaptive grades rather than unsubstantiated clades."
https://openalex.org/W2022941248,"The electrical activity of macrophages derived from human blood monocytes was recorded in vitro with intracellular microelectrodes and was analyzed with computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis techniques. In cells impaled 6 to 8 days after the cultures were prepared, the resting potentials reached a maximum value of -72 millivolts. The cells were electrically excitable; spikes exhibited a slow upstroke, a fast downstroke, a discrete threshold, a large overshoot, and a brief undershoot. Repetitive firing was induced by a maintained depolarizing current. A positive relation was observed between transmembrane currents and resting potential. Voltage-current relations were nonrectifying for subthreshold current injections. Since these cells had not been treated with any specific activation factors, the electrical activity recorded is evidence for the presence of voltage-dependent inward and outward currents in the membranes of mature macrophages. The electrical signals generated by these cells may be useful for the assay of sensor and effector functions of macrophages, such as chemotaxis, receptor-ligand interactions, and phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069987171,"Cerebral glucose metabolism in rats was examined 1 week after the production by ibotenic acid of unilateral striatal lesions. The incorporation of carbon-14-labeled deoxyglucose decreased within the lesion but much less than that of carbon-14-labeled glucose. Barbiturate anesthesia caused a reversal of the asymmetric striatal deoxyglucose labeling, such that the lesioned striatum retained more tracer than the contralateral side. The combined use of barbiturates and radiolabeled deoxyglucose may enhance the identification of recent brain infarction in experimental animals and in man."

https://openalex.org/W1552188133,"Monoclonal antibodies exhibiting various specificities for B6 vitamer forms have been prepared. The antigen preparation employed was a partially purified mixture of human placental proteins that had been derivatized by reaction with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and sodium borohydride. Spleen cells obtained from mice immunized with the phosphopyridoxyl protein preparation were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line designated X63-Ag8.653. The resulting hybridomas were screened for production of antibodies to the haptenic phosphopyridoxyl group using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clones producing such antibodies were isolated by limiting dilution methods. The monoclonal antibodies obtained in this fashion have been characterized with respect to their ability to interact with various forms of vitamin B6. In addition, these antibodies have been shown to be useful in the detection of cellular pyridoxal phosphate binding components using immunoblot techniques. Monoclonal antibodies to vitamin B6 derivatives are potentially powerful tools in the assessment of vitamin B6 nutritional status and in the study of the roles of pyridoxal phosphate binding components in relation to growth, differentiation, carcinogenesis, and steroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1545582911,"The biosynthesis and initial processing of the methionine-enkephalin precursor preproenkephalin A were examined by cell-free translation of mRNA from brain and adrenal medulla. A novel antiserum raised against Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 was shown to react with bovine adrenal medulla fractions (apparent Mr 34,000) containing proenkephalin A. Affinity-purified antibodies from this antiserum were used to immunoprecipitate cell-free translated [35S]Met-enkephalin-containing protein. A protein of apparent Mr 30,000 +/- 500 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was the only Met-enkephalin precursor consistently synthesized by translation of mRNA from bovine or guinea pig striatum, rat brain, or bovine adrenal medulla. The presence of [35S]Met-enkephalin sequences in this protein was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography of trypsin/carboxypeptidase B digests. Dog pancreas endoplasmic reticulum membranes converted the Mr 30,000 protein to an immunoreactive protein of apparent Mr 28,500 that lacked significant core glycosylation. These results suggest that 1) a protein similar or identical to bovine adrenal medullary preproenkephalin A is the major Met-enkephalin precursor synthesized in brain as well as adrenal medulla, and 2) preproenkephalin A is converted to a protein resembling proenkephalin A, presumably by removal of a signal peptide."

The PG fractions obtained were analyzed to determine the amino acid composition, the content of sulfate and carbohydrate constituents, the molecular weight, and sedimentation properties under associative and dissociative conditions and the types of glycosaminoglycan components. The results show that the major type of low density PG in adult bovine metacarpophalangeal cartilage is a proteochondroitin sulfate with a Mr approximately 44,000. A single glycosaminoglycan component was detected following alkaline borohydride cleavage that was completely digested by chondroitinase ABC treatment. The disaccharide composition of this glycosaminoglycan was 4% O-sulfate, 22% 6-sulfate, and 74% 4-sulfate. Variations were observed in the content of chondroitin sulfate and the other carbohydrate constituents, indicating that the low density PG in this tissue probably occurs as a family of molecules with a variable composition. Sedimentation velocity analysis showed that under associative conditions PG-III formed high molecular weight complexes by self-association."

https://openalex.org/W1978139107,"Studies on the interaction of magnetic fields and biological organisms have centred on the influence of applied magnetic fields on the physiology and behaviour of organisms, including humans, and a search for magnetic sources within the organisms themselves. Evidence continues to accumulate that a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates, can detect and orient to ambient magnetic fields (for examples see refs 2-4). Since the discovery that magnetic orientation by bacteria was due to the presence within the organism of magnetic particles of the ferric/ferrous oxide, magnetite, the search has begun for other biogenic deposits of inorganic magnetic material and ways in which the possession of such material might confer on the organism the ability to orient to ambient magnetic fields. Such magnetic material, often identified as magnetite, has been discovered in bees, homing pigeons, dolphins and various other organisms, including man. A variety of hypotheses for the use of magnetite in magnetic field detection have been proposed. We report here that bones from the region of the sphenoid/ethmoid sinus complex of humans are magnetic and contain deposits of ferric iron. The possible derivations and functions of these deposits are discussed."
