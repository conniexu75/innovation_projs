Here, we demonstrate that activation of dendritic cells by TLR2 or TLR4 agonists, although it led to comparable activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, resulted in striking differences in cytokine and chemokine gene transcription, suggesting that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling is not equivalent. A TLR4 agonist specifically promoted the production of the Th1-inducing cytokine interleukin (IL) 12 p70 and the chemokine interferon-γ inducible protein (IP)-10, which is also associated to Th1 responses. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation failed to induce IL-12 p70 and interferon-γ inducible protein (IP)-10 but resulted in the release of the IL-12 inhibitory p40 homodimer, producing conditions that are predicted to favor Th2 development. TLR2 stimulation also resulted in preferential induction of IL-8 and p19/IL-23. Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 MAPK in the TLR-mediated induction of several cytokine and chemokine messages was demonstrated using specific inhibitors. Thus, TLRs can translate the information regarding the nature of pathogens into differences in the cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and therefore may contribute to the polarization of the acquired immune response.

First, it alerts the immune system to the presence of pathogens so that an immediate response can be mounted to contain the infection. Later, during the establishment of acquired immunity, this recognition event is thought to provide information regarding the nature of the invading microorganism that will contribute to determine the differentiation of T helper (Th)1 cells into either Th1 cells, which promote cell-mediated immunity, or Th2 cells, which encourage humoral responses. Cytokines play a pivotal role in this process, with IL-12 committing cells to Th1 lineage differentiation and IL-4, in the absence of IL-12 and IFN-γ, promoting Th2 development (3Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 635-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the nature of the pathogens is translated into differences in the cytokines produced remains poorly understood. Recognition of several microbial products is mediated by members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (4Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 5Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These receptors are characterized by an extracellular leucine-rich domain that shows considerable divergence and is probably involved in recognition of different agonists, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic Toll-IL-1 receptor domain that connects the receptor to the signaling machinery shared by IL-1 and IL-18 (6Muzio M.

Although all TLRs for which an agonist has been identified appear to activate similar signaling pathways, including NF-κB, p38 MAPK, stress-activated protein/JNK, and MAPK (Erk1/2) kinases (8Takeuchi O.

Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5395) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether different TLRs differ in their ultimate function, the activation of innate immune responses. Evidence that TLRs are not functionally equivalent is accumulating. Homodimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 is sufficient to initiate signaling that leads to TNF-α production by a macrophage cell line. In contrast, heterodimerization of TLR2 cytoplasmic domain with either TLR1 or TLR6 cytoplasmic tails is required for induction of this cytokine (13Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that despite their high sequence homology, the cytoplasmic tails of different TLRs are not functionally equivalent and suggest that different signals may emanate from distinct receptors. The concept that distinct TLR may differ in their signaling ability is also supported by studies of Drosophila TLRs. Despite sharing homologous cytoplasmic domains, toll and 18 wheeler, which mediate the immunity of the fly to fungi and bacteria, respectively, are known to activate very different and nonoverlapping gene expression (14Lemaitre B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the possibility that TLR2 and TLR4 may differentially activate human DCs. LPS (Escherichia coli K12 LCD25) was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). It was purified from contaminant lipoproteins normally found in commercially available LPS preparations by double phenol extraction, exactly as described in (16Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar).Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PGN) was from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). Zymosan was from Sigma. Synthetic lipopeptide Pam3-Cys-Ala-Gly is derived from an E. colilipoprotein and was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). OspB-L is a synthetic lipopeptide (Cys-Ala-Gln-Lys-Gly-Ala) derived fromBorrelia burgdorferi, and OspB is the non-acylated hexapeptide that served as a control as it possesses no biological activity. They were both kindly provided by Dr. Juan C. Salazar, University of Connecticut Medical School. LY-294,002 and SB203580 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). U0126 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). TLR2 and TLR4 sequences were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human monocyte total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) andPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: TLR4–5′, GCGCGCGGCCGCGGAAAGCTGGGAGCCCTGCGTGGAGG; TLR4–3′, GCGCGGATCCTCAGATAGATGTTGCTTCCTGCC; TLR2–5′, GCGCGCGGCCGCGAAGGAAGAATCCTCCAATCAGGC; and TLR2–3′, GCGCGGATCCCTAGGACTTTATCGCAGCTCTCAG. The TLR2 sequence was cloned in the NotI-BamHI sites of pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma). TLR4 sequence was cloned as a NotI-BamHI fragment into a modified pFLAG-CMV-1 that contained the c-Myc epitope tag in place of the FLAG tag. C-terminal FLAG-tagged MD-2-containing vector was kindly provided by Dr. Miyake (Saga Medical School). The MD-2 sequence was excised as a XhoI-NotI fragment and inserted in the SalI-NotI sites of vector pBOS-H2Bgfp, which also contains the blastidicin resistance gene. A subclone of the HeLa cell line was transfected using Superfect reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with pFLAG-CMV-TLR2 and pPuro or with pMyc-CMV-TLR4 and pBOS-MD-2, and stable transformants were selected in puromycin or blastidicin containing medium, respectively. Several colonies were isolated, and TLR2 or TLR4 expression was tested by Western blot and FACScan analysis using M2-FLAG or Myc monoclonal antibodies. Two clones with comparable TLR2 and TLR4 expression were expanded and further characterized. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from Leukopacks (courtesy of the Kraft Blood Donors Center) by routine Ficoll-Hystopaque density gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using MACS CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Purity was checked by staining with a FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody (Sigma) and FACScan analysis and was routinely found to be greater than 94%. Immature DCs were obtained by incubating monocytes at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and recombinant human (rh) granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml) and rhIL-4 (10 ng/ml) (both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 8 days. Fresh complete medium was replaced every 4 days. rhIFN-γ was from R&D Systems. Recombinant murine TNF-α was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. rhIL-1β was kindly provided by Marta Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy). DC surface markers were stained using the following PE- or FITC-conjugated mAbs from PharMingen (San Diego, CA): phycoerythrin-CD1a (clone HI149), phycoerythrin-CD40 (clone 5C3), phycoerythrin-CD83 (clone HB15e), FITC-CD86 (clone 2331), and FITC-human leucocyte antigen-DR (clone G46–6). FITC-CD14 (clone UCHM1) was from Sigma. HeLa-TLR2 or HeLa-TLR4/MD2 cells were transiently transfected in six-well plates using Superfect reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.5 μg of endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-luciferase and 1 μg of pcDNA-CD14 (kindly provided by Dr. Golenbock, Boston University) and 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase. Luciferase assay was performed using Promega (Madison, WI) reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Efficiency of transfection was normalized by measuring β-galactosidase in cell lysates. 1 × 106 DCs were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by vigorous vortexing. Lysates were spun at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 6 μg of nuclear protein extract were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 32P-labeled probe (CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAG) and 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The DNA-protein complex was resolved by PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed for autoradiography. Cells were lysed in 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3 VO4, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates containing 100 μg of proteins were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads coated with glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun recombinant protein. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm PNPP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm DTT). The kinase reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample. Proteins were resolved by PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed for autoradiography. Phospho-MAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNase protection assay was performed using 4–6 μg of total RNA using the BD Biosciences-PharMingen Riboquant kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The hCK-2b, hCK-5, and hCK3 multiprobe template sets were used. The templates for IL-23 p19 and for GAPDH were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: IL-23a, GCAGAGCTGTAATGCTGCTG; IL-23b, CCGATCCTAGCAGCTTCTC. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, and the p19 sequence was excised byEcoRI-BamHI restriction and cloned into theEcoRI-BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For GAPDH, the following primers were used: GAPDHa, CGCGCTCGAGCCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG; GAPDHb, CGCGGAATTCGGCAGGTTTTTCTAGACGG. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XhoI-EcoRI and cloned into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3. The templates were linearized by EcoRI or XhoI restriction, phenol-extracted, and precipitated, and 100 ng were used in a standard RNase protection assay. DCs were plated in RPMI 1640 medium/10% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 48-well plates and stimulated as described in the figure legends. IP-10, IL-8, IL-12 p70, and IL-12 p40 were measured by ELISA using matched pairs of antibodies from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The IL-12 p40 ELISA is specific for the p40 subunit with less than 5% cross-reactivity with the IL-12 p70. To determine whether TLR2 and TLR4 differ in their ability to activate DCs, several microbial products that have been previously demonstrated to activate different TLRs were tested. Highly purifiedE. coli LPS was used as TLR4 agonist (17Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M-Y Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P.

Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) were used as agonists of the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer (13Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). In addition, two synthetic lipopeptides derived from bacterial lipoproteins, OspB-L and Pam-Cys, were used. Similar peptides have been shown to activate cells through TLR2 paired to a yet unidentified TLR (22Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1999; 285: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were conducted in order to confirm specificities and characterize dose responses using HeLa clones stably transfected with TLR2 or TLR4/MD-2. Increasing concentrations of zymosan, PGN, and OspB-L and Pam-Cys lipopeptides were able to activate NF-κB-dependent luciferase production in HeLa-TLR2 but not in HeLa-TLR4/MD-2 (Fig.1A). As expected, the activation of NF-κB by LPS was detected only in HeLa-TLR4/MD-2. This response was MD-2-dependent (data not shown) and was not detected in HeLa-TLR2 even at concentrations several logs higher than those that elicited a maximal response in HeLa-TLR4/MD-2. Similar doses of LPS or PGN were able to activate NF-κB to the same degree in human immature DCs, as assessed by EMSA (Fig. 1B). Supershift experiments demonstrated that for both agonists, the main NF-κB species induced was a p65/p50 dimer (data not shown). In addition to NF-κB activation, LPS and PGN are known to activate p38 MAPK, stress-activated protein/JNK, and MAPK (Erk1/2) kinases in a TLR-dependent fashion. The activation state of these kinases was tested in DCs treated with LPS and PGN. In these cells, both LPS and PGN activated stress-activated protein/JNK (Fig.1C), MAPK (Erk1/2) (Fig. 1D), and p38 MAPK (Fig.1E) to the same extent. MAPK (Erk1/2) activation was also similarly affected by both agonists in HeLa-TLR2 and HeLa-TLR4/MD-2 (data not shown). Finally, we compared the effects of these microbial products on the induction of maturation of DCs (Fig.2). Treatment with either LPS or PGN markedly induced equivalent expression of mature DC surface markers CD40, CD83, CD86, and human leucocyte antigen-DR. Thus, optimal and comparable cell activation in HeLa and DCs occurred at doses of 1–10 ng/ml LPS, 10 μg/ml PGN, 50 μg/ml zymosan, 2 μg/ml lipopeptide Pam-Cys, and 10 μg/ml lipopeptide OspB-L.Figure 2TLR2 and TLR4 agonists induce similar phenotypic maturation of human DCs. DCs were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) or PGN (10 μg/ml) for 36 h. Staining of surface markers was analyzed by FACScan flow cytometry.

Shaded areas represent staining of the untreated cells, and outlined areas represent isotype control Abs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of cells by microbial products through TLR2 and TLR4 is known to induce the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, we investigated whether TLR2 or TLR4 agonists differentially regulate the expression of these factors in human immature DCs. The pattern of expression of several chemokines, including Ltn, RANTES, IP-10, MIP1α, MIP1β, MCP-1, IL-8, and I-309, was analyzed using RNase protection assays (Fig.3A). Housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH provided internal controls. Whereas the majority of the chemokines were induced to the same extent by both TLR2 and TLR4 agonists after 4 h of stimulation, one transcript, the message for IP-10, was specifically induced by LPS but not by the TLR2 agonists PGN, zymosan, or lipopeptides. This effect was consistently observed using DCs derived from several donors and was seen at different time points and for all the effective doses of agonists tested. The lowest effective dose of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) was still able to induce IP-10 transcript, whereas maximally potent doses of PGN and zymosan never induced IP-10. The IP-10 message was not observed even after 18 h of stimulation with PGN (see Fig. 4) or zymosan and with prolonged overexposure of the autoradiograph. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated DCs secreted large quantities of IP-10 protein in the media (Fig. 3B). This chemokine was completely absent in PGN-stimulated, DC-conditioned media. IP-10 message induction by TLR4 agonist was confirmed in HeLa TLR4/MD-2 (Fig.3C), thus ruling out the possibility that the induction of this transcript, rather than being TLR4-mediated, was indirectly stimulated by IFN-γ released by few contaminating cells.Figure 4TLR2 agonist is a more powerful IL-8 inducer than TLR4 agonist. A, RNase protection assay analysis of transcripts for chemokines. DCs were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) or PGN (10 μg/ml) for 14 h. B, DCs were stimulated with LPS (1 or 10 ng/ml) or PGN (1 or 10 μg/ml) for 24 h. IL-8 was measured in supernatants by ELISA after dilution to 1:40 for LPS stimulation and to 1:100 for PGN stimulation. Measurements were done in triplicate. Data are mean ± S.D. One representative experiment of three is shown. The detection limit of the assay was 31 pg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In some experiments, TLR2 stimulation appeared to preferentially induce the transcripts of specific chemokines, such as IL-8 and MIP-1α. Initially, we interpreted this effect as a result of the supramaximal concentration of TLR2 agonists used to rule out the possibility that insufficient cell stimulation was the cause of the lack of IP-10 transcript. Surprisingly, when RNAs of cells stimulated for 14 h (instead of 4 h, as in previous experiments) with optimal agonist concentrations were analyzed, the IL-8 transcript was detected exclusively in cells stimulated with TLR2 agonist (Fig. 4A). Thus, 4-h stimulation resulted in comparable IL-8 message induction, whereas during prolonged stimulation, IL-8 message was detected exclusively in cells stimulated with TLR2 agonists. Note that in the HeLa cell lines, 4-h stimulation also resulted in comparable level of IL-8 transcript (Fig. 3C). Measurement of IL-8 in DC culture media revealed that cells stimulated for 24 h with TLR2 agonist released 100 times more IL-8 than cells stimulated with TLR4 agonist (400 ± 32 ng/ml versus 4.4 ± 0.26 ng/ml) regardless of the concentration of agonist used (Fig.4B). To test whether stimulation through TLR2 or TLR4 also resulted in differences in the expression pattern of proinflammatory cytokines, transcript levels for IL-12 p35 and p40 subunits, IL-10, IL-1α and IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-18, and IFN-γ were analyzed (Fig.5A). As was observed for chemokine expression, most cytokine transcripts were induced to the same extent by both TLR2 and TLR4 agonists, but one transcript, IL-12 p35, was specifically induced only by the TLR4 agonist LPS. Similarly to IP-10, IL-12 p35 message was not observed even at supramaximal doses of PGN or zymosan or for prolonged incubation times (18 h). Interestingly, the transcript of IL-12 p40 subunit was equally induced by both TLR agonists. This protein can form homodimers that have been shown to act as an IL-12 receptor antagonist (24Ling P. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Stern A.S. Lin P. Hollfelder K. Su C. Pan Y.C. Hakimi J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 116-127PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of IL-12 p70 and IL-12 p40 protein in the cell culture supernatants of stimulated DCs confirmed the RNase protection data (Fig.5B). Interleukin-12 p70 was produced at low but detectable levels only in the media from cells stimulated with LPS. In contrast, IL-12 p40 was produced at comparable levels in the media of cells stimulated with either LPS or PGN. Note that in these experiments, IL-12 p40 was not produced in such excess of IL-12 p70 to be able to block its activities. In fact, for this to happen, a 500–1000-fold excess of p40 should be produced (24Ling P. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Stern A.S. Lin P. Hollfelder K. Su C. Pan Y.C. Hakimi J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 116-127PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal IL-12 p70 production is known to require IFN-γ priming. Cotreatment of DCs with IFN-γ restored the ability of PGN and lipopeptides to induce IL-12 p70, as previously reported by others (23Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1999; 285: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). However, even under these extreme conditions, LPS appeared to be a more potent stimulus for IL-12 p70 secretion. It should be noted that the primary encounter between a DC and a microbe is likely to occur in an IFN-γ-poor environment. Under these conditions, the low amounts of IL-12 p70 induced by TLR4 agonist might be enough to initiate the positive feedback loop between IL-12 and IFN-γ, thus producing conditions that would favor Th1 lineage commitment. It has recently been shown that IL-12 p40 can pair to a protein called p19 to form IL-23, a novel cytokine with biological activities similar but not identical to those of IL-12 (25Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F., Yu, N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E. Churakova T. Liu M. Gorman D. Wagner J. Zurawski S. Liu Y. Abrams J.S. Moore K.W.

We therefore analyzed the expression of p19 using RNase protection assay (Fig.6). Surprisingly, we found that the message for p19 was preferentially induced by TLR2 agonist. The reagents to test whether the p19 message is translated into protein and whether bioactive IL-23 is formed are at present not available. Using the same experimental approach, we next analyzed the pattern of expression of more proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-β, Ltβ, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IFN-β, transforming growth factor β3, transforming growth factor β2, and transforming growth factor β1. Again, we found that the message of one of these cytokines, IFN-β, was preferentially induced by TLR4 agonist (Fig.7). In order to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the differences in cytokines and chemokines gene induction observed we used pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK/Erk1/2, of p38MAPK, and of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 8 induction of chemokine and cytokine transcripts were most potently blocked by LY-294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, and by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38MAPK, whereas MAPK(Erk1/2) pathway inhibitor U0126 (or PD98059, data not shown) was less effective. Once activated by microbial products, DCs start producing a variety of soluble factors that direct T helper cell differentiation toward the type of immune response, humoral versuscell-mediated, that is better suited to fight the invading pathogen. The mechanism by which the nature of the pathogen determines the panoply of factors produced by DCs, and therefore the type of adaptive immune response, is poorly understood. Here, we report that activation of DCs by microbial agonists of TLR2 or TLR4, although leading to comparable activation of NF-κB and MAPK family members, resulted in striking differences in cytokine and chemokine gene transcription, suggesting that signals emanating from different TLRs are not equivalent and that these pattern recognition receptors may differentially contribute to the polarization of adaptive immunity. A TLR4 agonist specifically promoted the production of the cytokine IL-12 p70, the chemokine IP-10, and the transcript for IFN-β. Conversely, TLR2 stimulation resulted in preferential expression of IL-8 and of IL-23 p19. Among these factors, IL-12 and IP-10 appear to be particularly interesting for their ability to contribute to T helper cell polarization. Due to its ability to stimulate IFN-γ production in T cells, IL-12 is the key cytokine in directing the development of Th1 cells (26Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). It is believed that in its absence, T cells development proceeds by default toward the Th2 lineage. Bioactive IL-12 is produced by activated APC as a heterodimer composed of the p40 and p35 subunits. The p40 subunit is expressed in large excess of the p35 subunit, which is the limiting factor in controlling IL-12 p70 production (27Hayes M.P. Wang J. Norcross M.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 646-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Snijders A. Hilkens C.M. van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Engel M. Aarden L.A. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1207-1212PubMed Google Scholar). IL-12 p40 can also form homodimers that have been shown to act as IL-12 receptor antagonist (24Ling P. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Stern A.S. Lin P. Hollfelder K. Su C. Pan Y.C. Hakimi J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 116-127PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore particularly interesting that TLR2 stimulation, although it fails to induce IL-12 p70 release due to defective p35 gene induction, is nevertheless still able to stimulate release of the inhibitory p40 homodimer, thus producing conditions that are predicted to favor Th2 lineage commitment. On the other hand, TLR2 stimulation preferentially induces p19 gene transcription. p19 is a recently identified protein that can form heterodimers with p40, creating a novel cytokine, IL-23, with activities similar to as well as different from IL-12. For example, compared with IL-12, IL-23 has a diminished ability to induce IFN-γ secretion from activated T cells (25Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F., Yu, N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E. Churakova T. Liu M. Gorman D. Wagner J. Zurawski S. Liu Y. Abrams J.S. Moore K.W. Rennick D. de Waal-Malefyt R. Hannum C. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). It is also unclear which role IL-23 plays in T cells polarization. Due to the uncertainties regarding IL-23 biological activities, it is impossible at present to argue whether the lack of IL-12 production by TLR2-stimulated DCs can be compensated for by the higher p19 gene transcription in these cells. Differential induction of IL-12 by TLR2 and TLR4 agonists has recently been reported in mouse macrophages (29Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in that study, the lack of IL-12 production by TLR2 stimulation was due to absence of p40 transcripts rather than to a failure to transcribe p35, as in our study. Whether this reflects differences between human and mouse in the regulation of IL-12 biosynthesis is not clear. Our finding that TLR4, but not TLR2, agonists stimulate production of IP-10 is also remarkable. IP-10 is a CXC chemokine produced by different cell types in response to IFN-γ and microbial products. IP-10 is a chemoattractant for monocytes, NK cells (30Taub D.D. Lloyd A.R. Conlon K. Wang J.M. Ortaldo J.R. Harada A. Matsushima K. Kelvin D.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1809-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 31Taub D.D. Sayers T.J. Carter C.R. Ortaldo J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3877-3888PubMed Google Scholar), and, importantly, Th1 cells, which have been shown to preferentially express the IP-10 receptor CXCR3 (32Sallusto F. Lenig D. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 33Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). The inability of TLR2-stimulated DCs to produce detectable amounts of IP-10, in contrast to the high level obtained by TLR4 stimulation, may result in a defective recruitment of Th1 cells and is a further indication that signaling emanating from these receptors can differentially contribute to the polarization of the adaptive immune response. Other factors were found to be differentially induced in our study. For example, the chemokine IL-8, a chemoattractant for neutrophils, was produced in much greater amounts by cells stimulated with TLR2 agonists than by cells stimulated with TLR4 agonists; conversely, the IFN-β gene was preferentially induced by TLR4 stimulation. The use of pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK and PI3K allowed us to establish the involvement of these kinases in the induction of several cytokine and chemokine genes in response to both TLR2 and TLR4 agonists. Interestingly, the transcripts of certain cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-12 p40, IL-10, and IP-10, appeared to be more affected by these inhibitors than others. Although our data cannot indicate whether either of these kinases is the TLR4-specific signaling molecule responsible for the differences between TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation, the involvement of PI3K in the induction of IP-10 appears particularly interesting because recruitment of PI3K and activation of AKT, a kinase that depends on PI3K activity, have been demonstrated for TLR2 but not for TLR4 (34Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Here we show that this kinase plays an important role in the induction of chemokine and cytokine genes by both TLR2 and TLR4. IP-10 is an IFN-γ inducible gene. At present, it is not known whether members of TLR family are able to activate IFN-γ-specific signaling pathways, such as the interferon-responsive factors. This area is being investigated. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that TLRs can translate the information regarding the nature of pathogens into differences in the cytokines and chemokines produced by DCs. The observed patterns of gene induction would be predicted to differentially polarize adaptive immune responses. We are grateful to L. Santambrogio, C. Stipp, and B.

Here we show by a pharmacological approach thato-phenanthroline, a general zinc-metalloprotease inhibitors, as well as BB3103 and TAPI, the inhibitors of metalloenzymes ADAM10 (Adisintegrinand metalloprotease); and TACE,tumor necrosis factorα-converting enzyme; ADAM17), respectively, drastically reduce N1 formation. We set up stable human embryonic kidney 293 transfectants overexpressing human ADAM10 and TACE, and we demonstrate that ADAM10 contributes to constitutive N1 production whereas TACE mainly participates in regulated N1 formation. Furthermore, constitutive N1 secretion is drastically reduced in fibroblasts deficient for ADAM10 whereas phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-regulated N1 production is fully abolished in TACE-deficient cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate for the first time that disintegrins could participate in the catabolism of glycosyl phosphoinositide-anchored proteins such as PrPc. Second, our study identifies ADAM10 and ADAM17 as the protease candidates responsible for normal cleavage of PrPc. Therefore, these disintegrins could be seen as putative cellular targets of a therapeutic strategy aimed at increasing normal PrPcbreakdown and thereby depleting cells of the putative 106–126 “toxic” domain of PrPc. We showed previously that PrPc undergoes constitutive and phorbol ester-regulated cleavage inside the 106–126 toxic domain of the protein, leading to the production of a fragment referred to as N1.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). It is thought that the prion-associated pathology occurs when normal prion, referred to as cellular prion or PrPc, is converted into an insoluble and highly protease-resistant protein particle called PrPres or scrapie (PrPsc) (2Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Prion diseases, which can be of sporadic or genetic origins, all led to fatal issues (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). Although normal and pathogenic PrP have the same primary structures, it appears that they could undergo distinct post-transductional events (2Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Giaccone G. Young K. Prelli F. Farlow M.R. Dlouhy S.R. Tagliavini F. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Among them, several lines of evidence indicate that PrP is targeted by distinct proteolytic activities as was shown in normal and Creutzfeldt-Jakob-affected brains (3Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, the normal cleavage appears to occur at the 110/111–112 peptide bond (leading to a fragment referred to as N1; see Fig. 1A) whereas the pathological breakdown is located more N-terminally at the 90–91 site (3Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This leftward shift leads to the preservation of the 106–126 sequence domain of PrP, which behaves as the toxic “core” of the protein (4Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.R. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Normal cleavage could be seen as a means to deplete the protein of its potential pathogenicity. Thus, the nature of the proteases involved in the “normal” cleavage of PrPc and the putative up-regulators of such a process are of considerable interest. We demonstrated recently that in human HEK2931 cells, as well as in murine TSM1 neurons, normal PrPc was cleaved constitutively (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As reported previously, the secreted fragment has a molecular mass of about 11.5 kDa and is labeled by SAF32 and 8G8 but not by PRI308 (see Fig. 1B), which recognizes an epitope overlapping the 111–112 bond (see “Materials and Methods”). Therefore, both molecular mass and immunological characterization indicate that the secreted fragment corresponds to the N1 product generated upon proteolytic attack of PrPc at the 111–112 peptide bond. This hydrolysis could be up-regulated by several effectors of the protein kinase C pathway but not by protein kinase A agonists (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we identified the proteases involved in both constitutive and regulated hydrolytic pathways by combined pharmacological, transfection, and knockout analyses. SAF32 raised against the 79–92 residues of PrP and all other monoclonal antibodies appearing in Fig. 1 have been characterized previously (7Demart S. Fournier J.G. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Lamoury F. Marce D. Lasmezas C. Dormont D. Grassi J. Deslys J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal AL45 directed against TACE was described previously (8Zhang Y. Jiang J. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4342-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ADAM10 was detected with a polyclonal antibody from Euromedex. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu),o-phenanthroline, pepstatin, E64, and 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl-fluoride were from Sigma. BB3103 (hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloprotease inhibitor) was kindly provided by British Biotech, and TAPI (a tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme inhibitor) was kindly supplied by Immunex. HEK293 cells were cultured as described previously (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells overexpressing ADAM10 or TACE were obtained after transfection of 2 μg of ADAM10 and TACE cDNA with DAC30 reagent (Eurogentec). Positive clones were identified by Western blot analysis by means of the above anti-TACE- and -ADAM10-specific polyclonal antibodies. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing penicillin (100 units/ml−1), streptomycin (50 mg/ml−1), and geneticin (0.5 mg/ml−1). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (wild-type, ADAM10−/−, and TACE−/−) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/50% Ham's F-12 containing 5% fetal calf serum containing penicillin (100 units/ml−1) and streptomycin (50 mg/ml−1). HEK293 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and then 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% Tris/glycine gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (2 h, 100 V) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with AL45 or anti-ADAM10 antibodies (dilution 1/1000 in phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween/5% milk). Bound antibodies were detected using a goat anti-rabbit peroxydase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1/5000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunological complexes were revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence as described (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Identification and immunological characterization of N1 was reported previously (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in the absence (control) or in the presence of various pharmacological agents in 1 ml of serum-depleted Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Media were collected, immunoprecipitated, and identified by Western blot analysis with SAF32 (see Ref. 6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar for details). Corresponding cells were lysed, and PrPc was detected by Western blot analysis as reported (6Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using the unpaired t test for pairwise comparisons. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. values, and statistical significance corresponds to a p value <0.05. We established that among a series of classical inhibitors that target distinct classes of proteases, only o-phenanthroline, a zinc-metalloprotease-blocking agent, was able to drastically (and to a similar extent) reduce N1 production by TSM1 and HEK293 cells whereas serine, thiol, and acidic protease inhibitors were ineffective (Fig.2A). To identify putative metalloenzymes involved in N1 production, we examined the effect of TAPI and BB3103. These inhibitors have been shown to block ADAM10 (adisintegrin andmetalloprotease) and TACE (9Middelhoven P.J. Ager A. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S.

These metalloenzymes are responsible for the “shedding” of various transmembrane proteins (11Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and have been shown to contribute to the constitutive and protein kinase C-regulated α-secretase cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein in various cell lines including HEK293 cells (13Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 14Buxbaum J.D.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both TAPI and BB3103 significantly reduce the production of N1 in TSM1 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). It is noteworthy that a 10 μm concentration of TAPI and BB3103 diminishes constitutive N1 production to a same extent but does not totally abolish its formation (Fig. 2C, from four independent experiments). Furthermore, we established that TAPI and BB3103 did not produce an additive effect on constitutive N1 production, indicating that the two inhibitors likely block an identical protease involved in basal N1 production (not shown). Interestingly, TAPI-and BB3103-mediated reduction of N1 is very similar to that achieved by means of o-phenanthroline (Fig. 2, A–C). To delineate the respective contribution of ADAM10 and TACE in N1 formation, we set up stably transfected HEK293 cells overexpressing these enzymes (Fig. 3A). The PDBu-sensitive N1 formation was drastically enhanced in TACE-expressing cells but not in ADAM10 transfectants (Fig. 3, B andC). By contrast, ADAM 10 slightly increases constitutive production of N1 (not shown). The contribution of ADAM10 and TACE in the constitutive and PDBu-regulated N1 formation, respectively, was further examined by the selective depletion of their genes. First, we verified that wild-type mice embryonic fibroblasts also exhibit both constitutive and protein kinase C-regulated N1 formation (Fig.4A). As expected, TACE−/− and ADAM10−/− fibroblasts did not display TACE and ADAM10 immunoreactivities (Fig. 4B). The deficiency of ADAM10 gene led to a mean 51% reduction of constitutive N1 formation without altering the extent of the responsiveness to phorbol esters (Fig. 4,C and E). This reduction was consistently observed with three distinct clones (clone 3, 44 ± 7% of inhibition, n = 4; clone 7, 70 ± 4,n = 4; clone 40, 48 ± 11, n = 6). Conversely, TACE gene disruption fully abolishes the phorbol ester-stimulated N1 production without significantly affecting N1 constitutive production (Fig. 4, D and F). Transfection analysis and gene disruption clearly demonstrated that the PDBu-regulated pathway of normal PrPc is fully ascribable to TACE. By contrast, it appears that ADAM10 only partially contributes to the constitutive N1 formation as underlined by the 50% inhibition of N1 recovery observed in ADAM10−/− fibroblasts. This extent of inhibition (about 50%) matches that observed with the disintegrin inhibitors TAPI and BB3103 (Fig. 2). That TAPI- and BB3103-sensitive constitutive N1 formation is because of ADAM10 appears likely, but one cannot exclude the possibility that another disintegrin(s) also contribute to residual N1 production. In this context, it should be noted that Schlöndorff et al. (16Schlöndorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) described recently two shedding proteases that, based on pharmacological and biochemical properties, appear distinct from TACE and ADAM10 and that could be detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It is noticeable that shedding enzymes have been characterized as proteolytic activities involved in the release of extracellular domains of various transmembrane proteins (11Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Our study is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of the involvement of disintegrins in the cleavage of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. The parallel between the physiological cleavage occurring on the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and PrPc is extremely interesting. Thus, βAPP undergoes a normal cleavage by an activity referred to as α-secretase (for review see Ref. 17Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This processing leads to the secretion of sAPPα, an N-terminal fragment exhibiting neuroprotective and cytotrophic properties (18Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Several studies indicated that sAPPα production could also be constitutive or regulated in a protein kinase C-dependent manner (for review see Ref. 17Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies reported on a major involvement of disintegrins in the α-secretase cleavage of βAPP. Thus, ADAM10 appears to contribute to the constitutive sAPPα production in various cell lines (13Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc.

In both βAPP and PrPc catabolisms, it appears that an additional and yet unidentified activity also participates to the constitutive production of either sAPPα (15Lopez-Perez E. Zhang Y. Frank S.J. Creemers J. Seidah N. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or N1 (present work). Overall, the above observations indicate that both βAPP and PrPc undergo constitutive and protein kinase C-dependent normal cleavage because of two disintegrins, ADAM10 and TACE, mainly responsible for the basal and regulated breakdowns, respectively. ADAM10 and TACE cleavages occur at the 110–111/112 bond,i.e. inside the 106–126 domain that has been suggested to bear the toxic potential of the protein. Here again, it is striking to note that α-secretase, when targeting βAPP, cleaves inside a sequence domain corresponding to the β-amyloid peptide, the “pathogenic” component of senile plaques invading the cortical areas of Alzheimer's disease-affected brains (19Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that the enhancement of α-secretase cleavage by protein kinase C activation in mice engineered to overproduce the Aβ peptide led to a 50% inhibition of Aβ load in mouse brain (20Savage M. Trusko S.P. Howland D.S. Pinsker L.R. Mistretta S. Reaume A.G. Greenberg B.D. Siman R. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ADAM10 and TACE could theoretically be seen as potential therapeutic targets, and increasing their activity could be seen as a means to deplete cells from the 106–126 toxic core borne by PrPc. Endogenous PrPc is thought to be necessary for infectivity of pathogenic inoculates in mice (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 21Blättler T. Brandner S. Raeber A.J. Klein M.A. Volgtländer T. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Nature. 1997; 389: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Infectious inoculates are innocuous in mice in which the PrP gene has been knocked out. Whether infectivity is also reduced in mice overexpressing ADAM10 or TACE because of reduced endogenous content of PrPc is currently being examined. TAPI, TACE cDNA, and TACE−/− fibroblasts were generously provided by Dr. R. Black (Immunex), and BB3103 was a kind gift from British Biotech. ADAM10 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. C. Lunn (Sherring Plough). We are indebted to Drs. Y. Zhang and S. Franck for providing anti-TACE antibodies."

Mammalian cells repair DSBs by homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, the latter requiring DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Werner syndrome is a disorder characterized by genomic instability, aging pathologies and defective WRN, a RecQ-like helicase with exonuclease activity. We show that WRN interacts directly with the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKCS), which inhibits both the helicase and exonuclease activities of WRN. In addition we show that WRN forms a stable complex on DNA with DNA-PKCS and the DNA binding subunit Ku. This assembly reverses WRN enzymatic inhibition. Finally, we show that WRN is phosphorylated in vitro by DNA-PK and requires DNA-PK for phosphorylation in vivo, and that cells deficient in WRN are mildly sensitive to ionizing radiation. These data suggest that DNA-PK and WRN may function together in DNA metabolism and implicate WRN function in non-homologous end joining.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1are particularly mutagenic when misrepaired and lethal if unrepaired. DSBs are introduced into the genome by several means, including errors in DNA metabolism, ionizing radiation, oxidative damage, and radiomimetic drugs. Many cancer therapies exploit the lethality of DNA DSBs by chemically or physically inflicting this type of damage on cancer cells. Eukaryotic cells have evolved two major pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Both pathways contribute significantly to the repair of DSBs and the viability of cells encountering this type of damage (1van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a key component of the mammalian NHEJ repair pathway. DNA-PK is an abundant nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of a 460-kDa catalytic subunit, DNA-PKCS, and a DNA binding component, Ku. Ku is a heterodimer comprising 69-kDa (Ku70) and 86-kDa (Ku80) subunits (2Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The Ku heterodimer binds tightly to DNA DSBs in a sequence-independent manner (3Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase function of DNA-PKCS is activated when DNA-PKCS associates with Ku bound to DNA termini. In vitro, the heterotrimeric DNA-PK bound to DNA is capable of phosphorylating a wide variety of substrates, but in vivo substrates for DNA-PK have yet to be clearly identified (4Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Disruption of any of the three genes encoding DNA-PK components, or mutations rendering the kinase inactive, result in severely compromised NHEJ and V(D)J recombination and, in the case of the Ku deficiencies, premature cellular and organismal senescence (5Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L. Sekiguchi J.M. Frank K. Stanhope-Baker P. Schlissel M.S. Roth D.B. Alt F.W.

Although DNA-PK and its kinase activity are clearly required for mammalian NHEJ, the specific biochemical function(s) of DNA-PKin vivo have yet to be defined. Werner syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized at the cellular level by genomic instability in the form of variegated translocation mosaicism and extensive deletions (9Salk D. Au K. Hoehn H. Martin G.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1981; 30: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Individuals with WS prematurely develop multiple age-related pathologies including bilateral cataracts, graying of the hair, wrinkled skin, osteoporosis, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and increased incidence of cancer (11Goto M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2000; 18: 760-766PubMed Google Scholar, 12Martin G.M. Oshima J. Gray M.D. Poot M. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1999; 47: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). WRN, the gene defective in WS, encodes a 160-kDa protein (WRN), which has 3′-5′ exonuclease, DNA helicase, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities (13Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 14Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). WRN has been reported to interact with p53, replication protein A (RPA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and DNA polymerase δ, and to associate with the DNA replication complex (15Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). WRN was also shown to interact with Ku, suggesting a function in DNA repair (16Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of WRN clearly indicate a function in DNA metabolism, but its specific physiological functions are not yet understood. Repair of DSBs via NHEJ minimally requires DNA-PK and ligase activity, and frequently a search for microhomology, which may require helicase activity, and exonuclease activity (18Lieber M.R. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ligase IV has been identified by genetic and biochemical studies to be the relevant ligase in NHEJ (19Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), but the enzymes responsible for the exonuclease and helicase activities have not been identified. The Mre11·Rad50·NBS1 complex has been implicated in providing the exonuclease activity involved in the NHEJ, but recent reports suggest that this complex may function primarily in homologous recombination repair, with secondary roles in NHEJ and damage signaling (20Petrini J.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Yamashita Y.M. Yagi T. Takata M. Price C. Kakazu N. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6619-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because WRN has both helicase and exonuclease activities, it could facilitate both the microhomology search and the removal of bases prior to the ligation step of NHEJ. In this study, we utilize biochemical and cellular approaches to evaluate interactions between DNA-PK and the WRN protein. We show functional and physiological interactions between DNA-PK and WRN. These results provide a mechanistic model for the regulation of WRN activity by DNA-PK. Our results further suggest that WRN and DNA-PK may function together in DNA metabolism. WS (73-26) and fibroblasts from a normal sibling (82-6) were infected with a pBABE retrovirus carrying the catalytic component of human telomerase (hTERT) and a puromycin resistance gene, selected, and expanded as described (22Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cultures infected with insertless virus senesced 10 (73-26) and 40 (82-6) doublings after infection, whereas cultures infected with pBABE-hTERT continued to proliferate for >150 doublings. Telomerase-expressing cells (73-26 hTERT and 82-6 hTERT) were then superinfected with an LXSN retrovirus carrying the full-length WRN cDNA, untagged or FLAG-tagged at the N terminus, and a neomycin-resistant gene. Infected cells were selected and expanded as described (22Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells (82-6 hTERT, 73-26 hTERT, and WRN-complemented 73-26 hTERT) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For survival assays, varying numbers of cells (5 × 102 to 2 × 103) were plated in triplicate 100-mm culture dishes and irradiated 4 h later (0–5 Gy) using a Pantak® x-ray generator operating at 320 kV/12 mA. After incubation for 9–15 days, the cells were stained with crystal violet, colonies were counted, and the surviving fraction calculated. For viability assays, cells were plated in triplicate 96-well plates at 1000 cells/well, irradiated as described above, and 9 days later the relative number of viable cells was determined using the CellTiter 96® AQueous assay kit (Promega). This assay is based on cellular conversion of the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (inner salt) (MTS) to a formazan product that is soluble in culture medium and quantified by absorbance at 490 nm. Absorbance is proportional to the number of living cells. WRN and Ku proteins were purified to near homogeneity from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the respective human genes (14Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,23Zhao J. Wang J. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DNA-PKCS was purified from either human placenta or cultured HeLa cells, as described previously (24Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by hypotonic swelling and freeze/thaw lysis of cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min, and extracted in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT for 30 min on ice. All buffers contained aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 1 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1 mm. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 10 min and diluted (1:3) with 20 mmTris-HCl pH 8.0. Mouse IgG (1 μg) or 1 μl of rabbit serum was added to 750 μl of nuclear extract, or 0.5 μg of each purified protein, in 750 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 1 μg of a 35-bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with 5-nucleotide single-strand extensions on both 5′ termini, (5′-GGC GCA AAT CAA CAC GTT GAC TAC CGT CTT GAG GCA GAG T) (5′-CCG GGA CTC TGC CTC AAG ACG GTA GTC AAC GTG TTG ATT T) as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. 10 μl of Ultralink Protein A/G beads (Pierce) was added to the reactions and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed with 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and the proteins resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies recognizing WRN (26Moser M.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibodies recognizing DNA-PKCS (25-4) from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Binding reactions were carried out in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol using 200 fmol of the 35-bp DNA described above. The oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled on a single strand with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Approximately 50 fmol of each purified protein was incubated with the probe for 10 min at 25 °C and resolved by 4.5% non-denaturing Tris/glycine PAGE at 4 °C, and visualized by autoradiography (27Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by adding glutaraldehyde to reactions (0.0625% final concentration) after incubation for 10 min at 25 °C, and continuing the incubation for 5 min prior to electrophoresis (28Ting N.S. Kao P.N. Chan D.W. Lintott L.G. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2136-2145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Where noted, polyclonal antibodies recognizing WRN were added after cross-linking and incubated for 1–2 min prior to electrophoresis. In vitrokinase assays were carried out as described (29Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), using ∼0.5 pmol (0.2 pmol for wortmannin experiments) of DNA-PK, 1 pmol of WRN, and 0.75 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 1 μm wortmannin where noted. Reactions were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, visualized, and quantified using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). In vivo labeling experiments used exponentially growing cells (Jurkat, M059J, M059K, SV40 transformed AT (AT5BIVA) or wild-type (1BR3.3GN2) human skin fibroblasts). The cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same media. [32P]Orthophosphate was added directly to the medium (0.6 mCi/ml), with wortmannin at 20 μm where indicated. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and lysed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 75 nm microcystin) as described previously (30Allalunis-Turner M.J. Lintott L.G. Barron G.M. Day III, R.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5200-5202PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were diluted to a final concentration of 100 mm NaCl, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.5%, final concentration), and WRN was immunoprecipitated using 0.5 μl of rabbit anti-serum recognizing WRN. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting. Helicase reactions were carried out in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm ATP with ∼100 fmol of a 21-nucleotide/43-nucleotide duplex DNA substrate in which the 21-nucleotide strand was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (14Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with ∼100 fmol of WRN in each reaction, and the indicated amounts of Ku and DNA-PKCS. Exonuclease assays were carried out under conditions reported previously (14Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), with the same probe used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs; described above). Briefly, 200 fmol of probe was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT with ∼20 fmol of WRN. Reaction products were resolved on 16% PAGE-TBE gels containing 8.3 m urea. To investigate the possibility that WRN functions in NHEJ, we initially carried out immunoprecipitations to determine whether WRN associates with DNA-PK. A rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing WRN was used to immunoprecipitate Jurkat cell nuclear extracts. We found that DNA-PKCS co-precipitated with WRN (Fig.1A, lane 3). The reciprocal experiment, using a monoclonal antibody that binds DNA-PKCS, co-precipitated WRN with DNA-PKCS (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The association of WRN with DNA-PKCS was confirmed using extracts from HeLa and M059K cells and, therefore, was not limited to Jurkat cells (data not shown). The interaction between WRN and DNA-PKCS in cellular extracts could be mediated by other proteins and/or DNA. We therefore reconstituted this interaction using purified proteins and DNA (Fig.1B). WRN associated directly with DNA-PKCS, independent of Ku, and this association was not influenced by the addition of DNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). Additionally, the interaction between DNA-PKCS and WRN was not disrupted by ethidium bromide (concentrations up to 100 μg/ml), further indicating that the interaction is direct (data not shown) (31Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a significant and reproducible increase in the amount of WRN associated with DNA-PKCS was observed when all four components (WRN, Ku, DNA-PKCS, and DNA) were present (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3–5with lane 6). WRN has been reported to interact with Ku, and this interaction was shown to stimulate the WRN exonuclease activity in vitro (16Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here, the addition of Ku did not appear to influence the association of WRN and DNA-PKCS in the absence of DNA, indicating that the WRN-Ku interaction did not markedly influence the WRN-DNA-PKCSinteraction (Fig. 1B, compare lane 5with lanes 3 and 4). These data show that WRN interacts directly with DNA-PKCS, independently of Ku or DNA, and suggest the formation of a stable WRN·DNA-PK·DNA complex. To further characterize the nature of the interaction between DNA-PK and WRN, EMSAs were carried out using purified proteins. The binding of Ku to DNA is well characterized and gave the expected mobility shift (Fig. 1C,lane 2) (32Bliss T.M. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5765-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The addition of equimolar amounts of purified DNA-PKCS further retarded the mobility of the probe, indicating the assembly of DNA-PK on the DNA (Fig.1C, lane 3). The addition of WRN to the DNA-PK binding reaction retarded the probe even further, indicating association of WRN with the DNA-PK·DNA complex (Fig. 1C,lane 4). The addition of WRN appeared to stabilize the DNA·DNA-PK complex, as evidenced by the distinct increase in the amount of DNA shifted and decrease in the amounts of Ku·DNA and DNA-PK·DNA complexes (Fig. 1C, comparelanes 3 and 4). Neither DNA-PKCS nor WRN alone retarded the probe under these conditions, indicating that neither protein independently bound DNA efficiently (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and6). Ku plus WRN in the absence of DNA-PKCS gave only the shifted band corresponding to Ku (data not shown). To detect complexes such as Ku·WRN, which may dissociate under these assay conditions, EMSAs were run after cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 1D). Cross-linking of WRN in the presence of DNA gave only a faint mobility shift, detectable only after long exposures, indicating that its association with DNA is relatively weak (Fig. 1D, lane 1). As expected, reactions containing Ku and DNA-PKCS gave two bands corresponding to Ku and assembled DNA-PK (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Cross-linked reactions containing both Ku and WRN are shown in Fig. 1D (lane 3). The majority of the shifted DNA had a mobility consistent with the Ku·DNA complex, with only minor bands consistent with WRN·DNA and WRN·Ku·DNA complexes. Finally, the cross-linking of DNA-PK·WRN resolved Ku·DNA, the DNA-PK·DNA complex, and a band with mobility consistent with the DNA-PK·WRN·DNA complex (Fig. 1D,lane 4). To confirm the presence of WRN in this complex, we carried out a mobility shift experiment using antibodies that recognize WRN. To visualize all three complexes simultaneously, we cross-linked the reactions before adding increasing amounts of WRN antibody (Fig. 1D, lanes 2′–5′). In the presence of WRN antibody, we observe a mobility shift of only the uppermost band, confirming that WRN is present and exclusive to the uppermost complex. Taken together, these data show that WRN assembles with DNA-PK on DNA and the DNA-PK·WRN·DNA ternary complex is more stable than subcomplexes. We next asked whether WRN is a substrate for DNA-PK kinase activity. DNA-PK phosphorylated WRN in vitro in a DNA-dependent manner (Fig.2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). To confirm that the phosphorylation of WRN was due to DNA-PK, we tested whether wortmannin, a compound known to inhibit DNA-PK, could block phosphorylation of WRN. Phosphorylation of WRN was reduced by more than 90% in the presence of 1 μm wortmannin (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), confirming that WRN is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and that this phosphorylation is inhibited by wortmannin. DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate a variety of substrates in vitro, many of which have no apparent physiological relevance to DNA repair (4Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To gain insights into whether WRN is a physiological substrate of DNA-PK, we carried out labeling experiments to determine whether phosphorylation of WRN occurs in vivo. Jurkat cells were starved for phosphate, followed by addition of [32P]orthophosphate alone or with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Cellular extracts were prepared, followed by immunoprecipitation of WRN. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Sequential autoradiography and Western blotting showed that immunoprecipitated WRN was radiolabeled, clearly demonstrating that WRN was phosphorylated in vivo (Fig.2B). Moreover, wortmannin was a potent inhibitor of WRN phosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 2B,lanes 1 and 2). Wortmannin has been reported to act primarily by inhibiting DNA-PKin vivo (33Chernikova S.B.

To determine whether DNA-PK is required for phosphorylation of WRN in vivo, the human glioma cell lines M059J (which lack DNA-PKCS) and M059K (which express DNA-PKCS) were labeled and analyzed as above (36Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). WRN immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled M059K cells was clearly radiolabeled, whereas WRN immunoprecipitated from32P-labeled M059J was not (Fig. 2B,upper panel, lanes 3 and4). Western blotting showed that equal amounts of WRN protein were precipitated from M059J and M059K cells (Fig.2B, bottom panel, lanes 3 and 4). The intensity of minor contaminating proteins in the immunoprecipitates was independent of the presence of wortmannin, or DNA-PKCS, indicating that approximately equal amounts of isotope were internalized by the cells, and that other kinase activities were not altered (data not shown). The level of another phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase member, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein, is low in M059J compared with M059K cells (37Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein levels affected WRN phosphorylation in vivo, we immunoprecipitated WRN from32P-labeled normal (1BR3.3GN2) and ataxia-telangiectasia (AT5BIVA) human fibroblasts. WRN phosphorylation was similar in normal and ataxia-telangiectasia cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the difference in the WRN phosphorylation in M059K and M059J cells was due to the difference in DNA-PKCS levels. These experiments indicate that DNA-PK is required for WRN phosphorylation, and there is a physiological interaction between WRN and DNA-PK in vivo. WRN has both 3′-5′ exonuclease and ATP-dependent helicase activities (13Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To determine the functional significance of the interaction between WRN and DNA-PK, we first examined the effect of DNA-PK on helicase activity. Preparations of Ku and DNA-PKCS showed no detectable helicase or exonuclease activity under our assay conditions (data not shown). As reported (16Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of Ku did not markedly alter helicase activity (Fig.3A, lanes 2–5). However, increasing amounts of DNA-PKCSdistinctly inhibited WRN helicase activity (Fig. 3A,lanes 6–8). This inhibition was relieved by increasing amounts of Ku (Fig. 3A, lanes 9–11). Because WRN helicase and DNA-PK kinase activities both require ATP, we used wortmannin to specifically inhibit phosphorylation during the helicase reaction. The reversal of helicase inhibition was not altered by wortmannin. Thus, the ability of Ku to reverse the inhibition of WRN helicase by DNA-PKCS was not phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 3A,lanes 12–14). We next investigated the effect of DNA-PKCS on WRN exonuclease activity. Increasing amounts of DNA-PKCSmarkedly inhibited the exonuclease activity (Fig. 3B,lanes 3–6). The addition of Ku to a parallel set of reactions alleviated this inhibition (Fig. 3B,lanes 8–11). WRN exonuclease activity was also stimulated by Ku alone (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 7), as reported previously (16Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). This stimulation is also seen in the helicase assays at high Ku concentrations (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and5; note degradation of the lower band). To determine whether kinase activity alters WRN exonuclease activity, Ku and ATP were added to reactions containing WRN and increasing amounts of DNA-PKCS. ATP stimulated exonuclease activity only slightly above that caused by Ku alone, suggesting that reversal of inhibition by Ku is not entirely phosphorylation-dependent (Fig.3B, compare lanes 8–11 withlanes 13–16). Taken together, these data show that WRN helicase and exonuclease activities are inhibited when WRN is bound to DNA-PKCS, and that this inhibition is reversed when Ku is added. Together, our data suggest that WRN is regulated by DNA-PK, raising the possibility that WRN functions in NHEJ. If WRN functions in NHEJ, its absence should diminish the cell's capacity for NHEJ, a hallmark of which is sensitivity to IR. WS cells, whether normal or SV-40 transformed have not been reported to be IR-sensitive. However, given the relatively mild symptoms of WS, compared with those in mice deficient in DNA-PK components, WRN may not play an essential role in NHEJ and WRN deficiency may therefore confer only mild sensitivity to IR. To test this idea, we immortalized fibroblasts from a WS patient (73-26) and normal sibling (82-6) by expressing the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT), as described (22Dimri G.P. Itahana K.

Thus, the hypothesis that delivery of the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) via recombinant adenovirus would reduce alcohol-induced liver injury was tested. Rats were given recombinant adenovirus containing Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) and then fed alcohol enterally for 4 weeks. Mn-SOD expression and activity of Ad.SOD2 in liver mitochondria of infected animals was increased nearly 3-fold compared with Ad.lacZ-infected controls. Mitochondrial glutathione levels in Ad.lacZ-infected animals were decreased after 4 weeks of chronic ethanol, as expected, but were unchanged in Ad.SOD2-infected animals. Alanine aminotransferase was elevated significantly by ethanol, an effect that was prevented by Ad.SOD2. Moreover, pathology (e.g. the sum of steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis) was elevated dramatically by ethanol in Ad.lacZ-treated rats. This effect was also blunted in animals infected with Ad.SOD2. Neutrophil infiltration was increased about 3-fold in livers from both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected rats by ethanol treatment. Moreover, ESR-detectable free radical adducts in bile were increased about 8-fold by ethanol. Using13C-labeled ethanol, it was determined that nearly 60% of total adducts were due to the α-hydroxyethyl radical adduct. This increase in radical formation was blocked completely by Ad.SOD2 infection. Furthermore, apoptosis of hepatocytes was increased about 5-fold by ethanol, an effect also blocked by Ad.SOD2. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA was elevated to the same extent in both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected animals follows ethanol exposure. These data suggest that hepatocyte mitochondrial oxidative stress is involved in alcohol-induced liver damage and likely follows Kupffer cell activation, cytokine production, and neutrophil infiltration.

Acta Hepatosplenol. 1966; 13: 321-349PubMed Google Scholar), but precise mechanisms of pathology are still largely unknown. Endotoxin and Kupffer cells have been implicated in the mechanism of early alcohol-induced liver injury using the enteral feeding model of Tsukamoto-French (2Tsukamoto H. Reiderberger R.D. French S.W. Largman C. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: R595-R599PubMed Google Scholar). For example, endotoxin derived from the gut activates Kupffer cells in the liver (3Nolan J.P. Camara D.S. Trans. Am. Clin. Climatol. Assoc. 1988; 100: 115-125Google Scholar). In support of this idea, gut sterilization with nonabsorbable antibiotics or inactivation of Kupffer cells by gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) prevents alcohol-induced liver injury in this model (4Adachi Y. Moore L.E. Bradford B.U. Gao W. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 218-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 5Adachi Y. Bradford B.U. Gao W. Bojes H.K. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Kupffer cells, which release effectors and cytokines, are a major source of TNFα1 in the liver (6Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Indeed, TNFα messenger RNA in liver increased after 4 weeks of treatment with ethanol (7Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Bone R.C. Crit. Care Med. 1993; 21: S447-S463Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Moreover, early alcohol-induced liver injury was attenuated by anti-TNFα antibodies and largely prevented in TNF receptor 1 knockout mice (8Iimuro Y. Gallucci R.M. Luster M.I. Kono H. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 9Yin M. Wheeler M.D. Kono H. Bradford B.U. Gallucci R.M. Luster M.I. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 942-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TNFα plays a critical role in early alcohol-induced liver injury. Reactive oxygen species generated during chronic alcohol exposure may also be a major factor in liver damage (10Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Ross W.A. Gordon E.R. Lieber S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 98: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garcia-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). α-Hydroxyethyl free radicals were increased as a result of alcohol treatment (12Knecht K.T. Bradford B.U. Mason R.P. Thurman R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 26-30PubMed Google Scholar) and were diminished by destruction of Kupffer cells with GdCl3 (13Knecht K.T. Adachi Y. Bradford B.U. Iimuro Y. Kadiiska M. Qun-hui X. Thurman R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1028-1034PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, both production of TNFα and α-hydroxyethyl free radicals were decreased in the livers of NADPH oxidase knockout mice, effects that correlated with a reduction in pathology (14Kono H. Rusyn I. Yin M. Gabele E. Yamashina S. Dikalova A. Kadiiska M.B. Connor H.D. Mason R.P. Segal B.H. Bradford B.U. Holland S.M. Thurman R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Moreover, delivery of cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) by adenovirus reduced early alcohol-induced liver injury as well as blunted NFκB activation and TNFα production (15Wheeler M.D. Kono H. Yin M. Rusyn I. Froh M Connor H.D. Mason R.P. Samulski R.J. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether oxidants act as direct toxicants to hepatocytes or as signals to produce TNFα or other cytokines by Kupffer cells. Under normal conditions, the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase balances the production of excess superoxide from electron transport. Hydrogen peroxide, a product of the superoxide dismutase reaction, is further reduced to water by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase using mitochondrial GSH (16Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial glutathione is diminished in the livers of animals exposed to chronic ethanol, supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial oxidant production plays a role in early alcohol-induced liver injury (17Colell A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Ardite E. Mari M. Morales A. Corrales F. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18Fernandez-Checa J.C. Hirano T. Tsukamoto H. Kaplowitz N. Alcohol. 1993; 10: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with the glutathione precursor OTC (l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid) blunted alcohol-induced liver injury in the enteral model (19Iimuro Y. Bradford B.U. Yamashina S. Rusyn I. Nakagami M. Enomoto N. Kono H. Frey W. Forman D. Brenner D. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it is hypothesized that mitochondria may be a critical source of oxidants because of chronic ethanol consumption. The role of Mn-SOD and mitochondrial oxidative stress in alcohol-induced liver injury is controversial. A recent report showed that homozygous mutations in the SOD2 gene that may lead to an increase in mitochondrial localization of SOD is a risk for severe alcoholic liver disease in humans (20Degoul F. Sutton A. Mansouri A. Cepanec C. Degott C. Fromenty B. Beaugrand M. Valla D. Pessayre D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1468-1474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, other reports have demonstrated decreases in Mn-SOD expression and activity in liver because of ethanol in rats (21Koch O. Farre S. De Leo M.E. Palozza P. Palazzotti B. Borrelo S. Palombini G. Cravero A. Galeotti T. Alcohol Alcohol. 2000; 35: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Nanji A.A. Griniuviene B. Sadrzadeh S.M. Levitsky S. McCully J.D. J.

Biophys. 1995; 323: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the hypothesis that overexpression of mitochondrial Mn-SOD would prevent alcohol-induced liver injury was tested here by delivering human mitochondrial Mn-SOD via recombinant adenovirus (Ad.SOD2). Indeed, overexpression of Mn-SOD reduces liver injury induced by alcohol in the enteral feeding model, suggesting that mitochondrial redox state is important in ethanol-induced liver injury. Male Wistar rats weighing 280–310 g were housed in an Association for the Accreditation and Assessment for Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility on a 12-hour light/dark cycle under institutional guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals. Intragastric cannulas were inserted as described by Tsukamoto et al. (2Tsukamoto H. Reiderberger R.D. French S.W. Largman C. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: R595-R599PubMed Google Scholar). Cannulas were tunneled subcutaneously to the dorsal aspect of the neck and connected to infusion pumps by means of a spring-tether device and swivel, allowing rats to move freely in metabolic cages. Rats received a liquid diet described by Thompson and Reitz (24Thompson J.A. Reitz R.C. Lipids. 1978; 13: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is composed of corn oil as fat (34% of total calories), protein (23%), and carbohydrate (43%), plus minerals and vitamins, and supplemented with lipotropes as described by Morimotoet al. (25Morimoto M. Zern M.A. Hagbjork A.L. Ingelman-Sundberg M. French S.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 207: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For the ethanol diet, maltose-dextrin was replaced isocalorically with ethanol. In each group, rats received either high-fat control diet or ethanol-containing diet by continuous infusion through an intragastric tube. The daily amount of ethanol given was gradually increased to 12.0 g/kg/day in the first week. Values were then increased progressively up to 14.5 g/kg/day. Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing the transgene for either β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) or Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) were prepared as described elsewhere (26Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27Zwacka R.M. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Darby C.J. Dudus L. Halldorson J. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid shuttle vector pAd5-CMV-lacZ was constructed using standard cloning protocols. The adenoviral shuttle plasmids were transfected into the permissive HEK 293 host cell line to generate recombinant Ad.lacZ adenovirus. The Ad.SOD2 viral seed stock was a kind gift from Dr. John Engelhardt (University of Iowa). Virus isolates were plaque-purified and propagated in HEK 293 cells, isolated, concentrated, and titered by plaque assay to stock titers of greater than 1×1011 plaque-forming units. Rats were divided randomly into two groups and injected with Ad.lacZ or Ad.SOD2 at a concentration of 1×109 plaque-forming units in 1 ml of lactated Ringer's solution via the penile vein 3 days before liquid diet feeding was initiated. Ethanol concentrations in urine were measured daily. Rats were housed in metabolic cages, and urine was collected over 24 h in bottles with mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Samples were stored at −20 °C for later analysis of ethanol. Ethanol concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 366 nm resulting from the reduction of NAD+to NADH by alcohol dehydrogenase (28Horder M. Rej R. Alanine Transminase..in: Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1983: 444-456Google Scholar). Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta at sacrifice. Serum was stored at −20 °C in microtubes until alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was assayed using standard enzymatic procedures (28Horder M. Rej R. Alanine Transminase..in: Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1983: 444-456Google Scholar). For measurement of plasma endotoxin, blood was taken from the portal vein and the abdominal aorta in pyrogen-free heparinized syringes during laparotomy after 4 weeks of treatment with ethanol. Blood kept in pyrogen-free glass tubes was centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 10 min, and plasma was stored at −80 °C also in pyrogen-free glass tubes until measurement of endotoxin with aLimulus amebocyte lysate test kit (Kinetic QCL, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The levels of total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in whole liver and in mitochondria were measured as described elsewhere (29Moron M.S. DePierre J.W. Mannervik B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (75 mg/kg) and a 24-gauge catheter was inserted into the left femoral vein for injection of the spin trapping agent α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (1 g/kg; Sigma). A laparotomy was performed, PE-20 tubing was inserted into the common bile duct, and the spin trap dissolved in normal saline was injected through the intravenous catheter. Bile was collected for 3 h in an Eppendorf tube containing 35 μl of 5 mmdeferoxamine mesylate (Sigma) to prevent ex vivo radical formation. During this procedure, 1 ml of normal saline was injected through the catheter every 30 min to compensate for loss of fluids. Samples were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until ESR analysis. The ESR spectra of radical adducts was detected using a Varian E-109 spectrometer in an E-238 TM110 microwave cavity with instrument setting of 20 milliwatt microwave power, 0.5 G modulation amplitude, 0.66 s of conversion time, 0.33 time constant, 80 G scan width, and 9.785 gigahertz microwave frequency. Spectra were recorded on an IBM-compatible computer interfaced to the spectrometer, and hyperfine coupling constants were determined with a spectral simulation program (30Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Autopsies were performed after 4 weeks of treatment with ethanol. Livers were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for the assessment of pathology. Liver pathology was scored as described by Nanji et al. (31Nanji A.A. Mendenhall C.L. French S.W. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1989; 13: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) as follows: steatosis (the percentage of hepatocytes containing fat), <25%, 1+; <50%, 2+; <75%, 3+; >75%, 4+; inflammation and necrosis, 1 focus per low-power field, 1+; 2 or more foci, 2+. Pathology was scored in a blinded manner by one of authors. Apoptosis was expressed as % of apoptotic hepatocytes showing condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentation/2,000 hepatocytes in high power fields (×400) selected randomly (32Grasl-Kraupp B. Ruttkay-Nedecky B. Koudelka H. Bukowska K. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was also evaluated using the chromogenic substrate DEVD-pNA (BioSource, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The degree of infiltrating neutrophils was expressed per 100 hepatocytes, because fat accumulation causes ballooning of hepatocytes, making sinusoidal spaces narrow, which affects the numbers of hepatocytes and sinusoidal space in each field. Values were determined by counting polymorphonuclear cells in 5 high power fields (×400)/slide followed by counting the number of hepatocytes in each field. Mean values were used for statistical analysis. Whole liver tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of buffer (40 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture including aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol). Supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 900 × g for 7 min and was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed and resuspended in buffer, and protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Rat hepatocytes from normal, untreated rats were isolated by collagenase perfusion and Percoll centrifugation previously as described (11Garcia-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and cultured at 1 × 106 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. After 4 h of culture, hepatocytes were infected with either Ad.lacZ (100 viral infectious units/cell) or Ad.SOD2 and were cultured for 18 h to allow transgene expression to occur. Cells were then incubated in ethanol (2–200 mm) or saline for 12 h. SOD activity in freshly isolated mitochondria was measured by the reduction of ferricytochromec with modification of a method described elsewhere (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1374-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described above and added to a solution containing 50 mmK2HPO4, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml cytochrome c, and 165 mm xanthine, and superoxide was generated by the addition of 0.004 units of xanthine oxidase. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 10 min. The absorption of cytochrome c was measured at 550 nm, and SOD activity was calculated based on the millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described above. Mitochondrial protein (50 μg) was suspended in Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by electrophoresis using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with sheep anti-human Mn-SOD antibody (Oxis, Portland, OR) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody. β-galactosidase was immunoblotted using a mouse anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Protein was visualized by autoradiography using ECL Western Detection Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK, Little Chalfont, UK). Catalase activity was measured in liver homogenate as described by Aebi (34Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18681) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, homogenate (10 μg) was adjusted to a final volume of 50 μl with phosphate buffer. The reaction was initiated by adding 3.0 ml of 12.5 mm H2O2 in phosphate buffer, and the change in absorbance at 240 nm was measured at 25 °C for 1 min. Based on a millimolar extinction coefficient for H2O2 of 34.9, catalase activity was defined as μmol of H2O2 consumed/min/mg of protein. Glutathione peroxidase activity was determined by adding 10 μl of liver homogenate to 850 μl of buffer containing 0.1 mm NaPO4, 4 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 2 units of glutathione reductase (35Günzler W.A. Flohe L. Glutathione Peroxidase..in: Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 285-290Google Scholar). After 30 s, 10 μl of 1.2 mm t-butyl-hydroperoxide was added to initiate the reaction. The rate of decrease in absorption of NADPH at 340 nm, was measured and the amount of NADPH consumed was calculated using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 6.22. Total RNA was isolated from whole liver using RNA STAT 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). TNFα and the housekeeping gene GAPDH were detected by RNase protection assay using a mouse cytokine RNA probe template set (rCK-1, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Riboprobes were synthesized in the presence of [32P]UTP to yield labeled antisense RNA probes, and RNase protection assays were performed on 20 μg of RNA using a RiboQuantTM multi-probe RNase Protection Assay Kit (PharMingen). Protected samples were separated on 5% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (19:1) urea gels, dried, and exposed to X-ray film. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Results were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test as appropriate. For comparison of pathology scores, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used. Ap value of < 0.05 was selected prior to the study as the level of significance. A tendency for weight loss during the 1-week recovery time after surgery was observed in all groups (data was not shown). Body weight increased steadily after feeding diets for 4 weeks, and there were no significant differences among the groups at sacrifice (Table I). However, liver to body weight ratios were increased 50–60% by ethanol in both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected animals as expected (Table I).Table IEffect of ethanol on body and liver weight and urine alcohol concentrationVirus treatmentDietInitial body weightBody weight at 4 weeksLiver to body weight ratioUACgg%mg/dlAd.lacZHigh fat282 ± 8385 ± 153.3 ± 0.7Ad.lacZEthanol294 ± 7366 ± 214.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 compared with appropriate group of rats fed high-fat diet without ethanol, using ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test.278 ± 14Ad.SOD2High fat295 ± 15375 ± 53.0 ± 0.2Ad.SOD2Ethanol293 ± 7380 ± 154.7 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 compared with appropriate group of rats fed high-fat diet without ethanol, using ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test.263 ± 23Rats were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding the transgene β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) or Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) and fed high-fat control diet with or without ethanol for 4 weeks.

Open table in a new tab Rats were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding the transgene β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) or Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) and fed high-fat control diet with or without ethanol for 4 weeks. Urine alcohol concentrations (UAC) were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = 6). In animals infected with Ad.lacZ and Ad.SOD2, alcohol levels fluctuated in a cyclic pattern with a periodicity of 5 to 6 days even though ethanol was infused continuously as reported previously (2Tsukamoto H. Reiderberger R.D. French S.W. Largman C. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: R595-R599PubMed Google Scholar) The cyclical pattern was described recently to be the result of fluctuations in body temperature and thyroid hormone levels which alter ethanol metabolism (36Li J. Nguyen V. French B.A. Parlow A.F. Su G.L. Fu P. Yuan Q.X. French S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G118-G125PubMed Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in mean urine alcohol concentrations between Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD2-infected rats (TableI). To test the hypothesis that adenoviral gene delivery of Mn-SOD resulted in localized expression, animals were infected with adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units) containing the transgenes for human mitochondrial Mn-SOD (Ad.SOD2) or the bacterial reporter gene β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) as control. Livers were harvested at the end of ethanol treatment, subcellular compartments (i.e. mitochondria and cytosol) were isolated by differential centrifugation, and transgene expression was determined by Western analysis using antibodies against human Mn-SOD or β-galactosidase (Fig.1A). β-Galactosidase was detected in the cytosol of Ad.lacZ-infected animals as expected. Moreover, recombinant Mn-SOD was primarily expressed in the mitochondrial compartment of the liver and was nearly 4-fold higher than the expression of endogenous Mn-SOD. A small amount of Mn-SOD was detected in the cytosol, but this is most likely because of either mitochondrial destruction during the isolation procedure or unprocessed protein that had not been transported into the mitochondria. Enzymatic activity was also evaluated to ensure that recombinant Mn-SOD had functional activity. The activity of SOD in whole liver extracts of Ad.SOD2-infected rats was increased about 2-fold compared with Ad.lacZ-infected rats (Fig. 1B). Serum ALT levels in rats fed high-fat control diet were around 20 units/liter after 4 weeks (Fig.2). Ethanol treatment increased values in Ad.lacZ-transfected rats about 5-fold but caused only a 2-fold increase in Ad.SOD2-infected animals. Figs. 3 and 4 show representative photomicrographs and pathology scores of livers after 4 weeks of high-fat control diet with or without ethanol. There were no pathological changes in Ad.lacZ- or Ad.SOD2-infected rats fed high-fat control diet except for very mild steatosis (Fig. 3A). In contrast, severe steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis were observed in Ad.lacZ-infected rats after ethanol treatment, yielding a total pathology score of 7.8 ± 0.2 (Fig.4). High magnification photomicrographs of Ad.lacZ-infected animals fed ethanol are also shown to illustrate focal infiltrate consisting largely of neutrophils and lymphocytes, necrosis, and apoptosis (Fig. 3B). In Ad.SOD2-infected animals, steatosis, inflammation, and necrosis were blunted by nearly 50%.Figure 4Effect of Ad.lacZ or Ad.SOD2 on pathology score.

https://openalex.org/W1664004980,"Histone acetylation, a reversible modification of the core histones, is widely accepted to be involved in remodeling chromatin organization for genetic reprogramming. Histone acetylation is a dynamic process that is regulated by two classes of enzymes, the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Although promoter-specific acetylation and deacetylation has received most of the recent attention, it is superimposed upon a broader acting and dynamic acetylation that profoundly affects many nuclear processes. In this study, we monitored this broader histone acetylation as cells enter and exit mitosis. In contrast to the hypothesis that HATs and HDACs remain bound to mitotic chromosomes to provide an epigenetic imprint for postmitotic reactivation of the genome, we observed that HATs and HDACs are spatially reorganized and displaced from condensing chromosomes as cells progress through mitosis. During mitosis, HATs and HDACs are unable to acetylate or deacetylate chromatin in situ despite remaining fully catalytically active when isolated from mitotic cells and assayed in vitro. Our results demonstrate that HATs and HDACs do not stably bind to the genome to function as an epigenetic mechanism of selective postmitotic gene activation. Our results, however, do support a role for spatial organization of these enzymes within the cell nucleus and their relationship to euchromatin and heterochromatin postmitotically in the reactivation of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1967660067,"The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr) on hepatocytes plays a role in the clearance of desialylated proteins from the serum. Although its sugar preference (N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ≫ galactose) and the effects of ligand valency (tetraantennary > triantennary ≫ diantennary ≫ monoantennary) and sugar spacing (20 Å ≫ 10 Å ≫ 4 Å) are well documented, the effect of particle size on recognition and uptake of ligands by the receptor is poorly defined. In the present study, we assessed the maximum ligand size that still allows effective processing by the ASGPr of mouse hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro. Hereto, we synthesized a novel glycolipid, which possesses a highly hydrophobic steroid moiety for stable incorporation into liposomes, and a triantennary GalNAc3-terminated cluster glycoside with a high nanomolar affinity (2 nm) for the ASGPr. Incorporation of the glycolipid into small (30 nm) [3H]cholesteryl oleate-labeled long circulating liposomes (1–50%, w/w) caused a concentration-dependent increase in particle clearance that was liver-specific (reaching 85 ± 7% of the injected dose at 30 min after injection) and mediated by the ASGPr on hepatocytes, as shown by competition studies with asialoorosomucoid in vivo. By using glycolipid-laden liposomes of various sizes between 30 and 90 nm, it was demonstrated that particles with a diameter of >70 nm could no longer be recognized and processed by the ASGPr in vivo. This threshold size for effective uptake was not related to the physical barrier raised by the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium, which shields hepatocytes from the circulation, because similar results were obtained by studying the uptake of liposomes on isolated mouse hepatocytes in vitro. From these data we conclude that in addition to the species, valency, and orientation of sugar residues, size is also an important determinant for effective recognition and processing of substrates by the ASGPr. Therefore, these data have important implications for the design of ASGPr-specific carriers that are aimed at hepatocyte-directed delivery of drugs and genes.

Although the effects of sugar type and valency on the affinity of ligands for the ASGPr are now well established, the effects of ligand size on the binding characteristics to the receptor have still not been fully mapped.

For this purpose, we synthesized a novel triantennary glycolipid that shows stable association with lipidic particles because of a highly lipophilic lithocholic oleate (LCO) structure (32Sliedregt L.A.J.M. Rensen P.C.N. Rump E.T. Van Santbrink P.J. Bijsterbosch M.K. Valentijn A.R.P.M. Van der Marel G.A. Van Boom J.H. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. J. Med.

Subsequently, we determined the effect of this glycolipid (LCO-Tyr-GalNAc3) on the ASGPr-mediated uptake of differently sized stable unilamellar liposomes (32Sliedregt L.A.J.M. Rensen P.C.N.

Moreover, we show that the glycolipid can induce effective recognition and uptake of liposomes with a diameter as large as 70 nm by the ASGPr on hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo, whereas larger particles do not bind to the ASGPr. These findings not only add to the further characterization of the structural requirements of ligands for proper recognition by the ASGPr but also have important implications for the design of particulate systems that are widely exploited for ASGPr-mediated targeting of drugs and genes to hepatocytes (40Wadhwa M.S.

Rensen P.C.N. Rump E.T. Van Santbrink P.J. Bijsterbosch M.K. Valentijn A.R.P.M. Van der Marel G.A. Van Boom J.H. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. J. Med.

A novel triantennaryN-acetylgalactosamine-terminated cluster (Z-Tris(GalNAc)3; Mw 1532) has been synthesized and conjugated with a nearly identical steroid structure via a tyrosine residue to allow for trace labeling with 125I, yielding (3β(oleoylamido)-5β-cholanoyl)-Tyr-Gly-Tris(GalNAc)3(LCO-Tyr-GalNAc3; Mw 2182) (see Fig.1B). The synthesis of this glycolipid will be described in full detail elsewhere. The homogeneity and identity of both glycolipids has been fully established by high pressure liquid chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy. The freeze-dried glycolipids were dissolved in PBS at a final concentration of 25–50 μg/μl and stored at −80 °C under argon before use. Their stability (which exceeded 12 months) was routinely checked by thin layer chromatography (n-butanol, n-propanol, 25% NH4OH, and H2O 15:40:30:15 v/v/v/v, or isopropanol and 25% NH4OH 1:1 v/v) and subsequent visualization of carbohydrate and cholesterol moieties by charring with H2SO4and ethanol (1:4 v/v) and MnCl2 (44Goswami S.K. Frey C.F. J. Chromatogr. 1970; 53: 389-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), respectively. LCO-Tyr-GalNAc3 was radioiodinated with carrier-free 125I at pH 7.4 using a Iodogen-coated (10 μg) reaction tube, and ASOR at pH 10.0 according to the ICl method (45McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), respectively. Free 125I was removed by Sephadex G-50 medium gel filtration. The radioiodinated glycolipid migrated as a single band on TLC (n-butanol, n-propanol, 25% NH4OH, and H2O 15:40:30:15 v/v/v/v) as determined by imaging, and more than 98% of the radiolabel in ASOR was 10% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. The specific activities of LCO-Tyr-GalNAc3 and ASOR were 1300–4300 dpm/ng of glycolipid and 260 dpm/ng of protein, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 93: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Hepatocytes were isolated from anesthetized rats or mice by perfusion of the liver with collagenase (type IV, 0.05%, w/v) for 10 min at 37 °C according to the method of Seglen (47Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar) as detailed earlier (27Biessen E.A.L. Bakkeren H.F. Beuting D.M. Kuiper J. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were ≥99% pure as judged by light microscopy, and their viabilities were ≥95% (rat) and ≥80% (mouse) as determined by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocytes were incubated (2 h at 4 °C) in DMEM containing 2% BSA (1 × 106 cells/ml) with 5 nm 125I-ASOR in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled galactose (0.2–200 mm), Z-Gly-Tris(Gal)3 (1–1000 nm), or Z-Tyr-Gly-Tris(GalNAc)3 (0.2–200 nm) under gentle shaking in a circulating lab shaker (Adolf Kühner AG, Basel, Switzerland) at 150 rpm. After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1 min at 50 g), and unbound125I-ASOR was removed by washing twice with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2 (Tris-buffered saline), pH 7.4, containing 0.2% BSA and once with Tris-buffered saline without BSA. The cell pellet was lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, the radioactivity and protein content was measured, and 125I-ASOR binding was calculated (dpm/mg of cell protein). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 mm GalNAc. Displacement binding data were analyzed according to a single-site binding model. Inhibition curves were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad, ISI Software, Philadelphia, PA). Liposomes (mean diameters, 30, 50, and 70 nm) were prepared by sonication as described (39Rensen P.C.N. Schiffelers R.M. Versluis A.J. Bijsterbosch M.K. Van Kuijk-Meuwissen M.E.M.J. Van Berkel T.J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In short, egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (25 mg), CO (1 mg), and [3H]CO (50–100 μCi) were hydrated in 10 ml of 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and subsequently sonicated at 54 °C using a Soniprep 150 (MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, UK) at 18 μm output. Alternatively, liposomes (mean diameters, 50 and 90 nm) were prepared after hydration of the lipids in 2.0 ml of buffer and multiple extrusion (11 times) at 54 °C through 50- and 100-nm Whatman Nuclepore®(Pleasanton, CA) polycarbonate filters, respectively, using a Liposofast-Pneumatic (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada) (48MacDonald R.C.

All liposomes were purified and concentrated (1.014 g/ml) by density gradient ultracentrifugation according to Redgrave et al. (49Redgave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) using NaCl/KBr/EDTA density solutions in a Beckman SW 40 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 18–22 h at 4 °C. Particle sizes were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (Malvern 4700 C System, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) at 27 °C and a 90° angle between laser and detector. Sonication for 60, 15, and 10 min resulted in liposomes with mean particle diameters of 29.4 ± 2.2, 55.7 ± 0.9, and 72.3 ± 3.6 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 3, 2, and 3) that were homogeneous with respect to size (polydispersities of 0.14–0.17, 0.28–0.29, and 0.26–0.27). Extrusion led to liposomes of 48.3 nm (50 nm filter; n = 1) and 90.3 ± 6.1 nm (100 nm filter; mean ± S.D.; n = 4) with polydispersities of 0.15 and 0.11–0.15, respectively. When indicated, liposomes were labeled with 1% (w/w) DiO or DiI by adding 0.25 mg from 10 mg/ml stock solutions in CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1 v/v) before hydration of lipids. The phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol ester contents were determined with the Roche Molecular Biochemicals enzymatic kits for phospholipid and cholesterol, respectively. Precipath® L was used as an internal standard. The particles were stored at 4 °C under argon and used for characterization and metabolic studies within 7 days following preparation, in which period no physicochemical changes occurred. Liposomes (100 μg of phospholipid) were incubated (30 min at 37 °C) with (radioiodinated) glycolipid in PBS, pH 7.4. The mixtures were subjected to 0.75% (w/w) agarose gel electrophoresis at pH 8.8, and the resulting gels were stained for lipid using Sudan Black. Radioactivity was visualized by imaging using a Packard Instant Imager (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA). The electrophoretic mobility (Rf) of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained liposomes (0.18 ± 0.01) was determined relative to the front marker bromphenol blue. Alternatively, incubation mixtures (50 μl) were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography (SMART System; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Superose® 6 (PC 3.2/30) column at a flow rate of 50 μl/min and with PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, as eluent. The galactose content of the collected fractions was determined using a galactose oxidase assay (recovery, 85–100%). In short, samples were incubated in the dark (30 min at room temperature) with 0.9 mm 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6Bider M.D. Wahlberg J.M. Kammerer R.A. Spiess M. J. Biol.

LCO-Tyr-GalNAc3 was used as a standard. The number of associated glycolipid molecules/30-nm particle was calculated assuming 7.62 × 1013liposomes/mg of phospholipid (39Rensen P.C.N. Schiffelers R.M.

Mice were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of a mixture of ketamine (120 mg/kg body weight), thalamonal (0.03 mg/kg fentanyl and 1.7 mg/kg droperidol), and hypnorm (1.2 mg/kg fluanisone and 0.04 mg/kg fentanyl citrate), and the abdomens were opened. [3H]CO-labeled liposomes (100 μg of phospholipid) were injected via the inferior vena cava, after previous incubation (30 min at 37 °C) with PBS"
https://openalex.org/W2048782984,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a novel proinflammatory cytokine found in serum and joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We studied a novel role for IL-18 in mediating cell adhesion, a vital component of the inflammation found in RA and other inflammatory diseases. We examined the expression of cellular cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells and RA synovial fibroblasts using flow cytometry. Adhesion of the monocyte-like cell line HL-60 to endothelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence. IL-18 significantly enhanced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and RA synovial fibroblasts. In addition, IL-18 induced E-selectin expression on endothelial cells and promoted the adhesion of HL-60 cells to IL-18-stimulated endothelial cells. Neutralizing anti-VCAM-1 and anti-E-selectin could completely inhibit HL-60 adherence to endothelial cells. IL-18-induced adhesion molecule expression appears to be mediated through nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI 3-kinase) since addition of inhibitors to either NFκB (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and N-acetyl-l-cysteine) or PI 3-kinase (LY294002) inhibited RA synovial fibroblast VCAM-1 expression by 50 to 60%. Addition of both inhibitors resulted in inhibition of VCAM-1 expression by 85%. In conclusion, the ability of IL-18 to induce adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells and RA synovial fibroblasts indicates that IL-18 may contribute to RA joint inflammation by enhancing the recruitment of leukocytes into the joint. IL-18 requires NFκB as well as PI 3-kinase to induce VCAM-1 on RA synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that there may be two distinct pathways in IL-18-induced adhesion molecule expression.

The Ig supergene family contains diverse proteins that share the same immunoglobulin amino acid domains including adhesion proteins, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), as well as proteins not involved in adhesion, such as the T cell receptor or major histocompatibility complex proteins HLA-DR (1Mojcik C.F. Shevach E.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive rheumatic disease characterized by the proliferation of the synovial membrane, which leads to the degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Another characteristic of RA synovial tissue is the exuberant leukocyte infiltration often present around the newly formed blood vessels (2Szekanecz Z. Koch A.E. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2001; 3: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These inflammatory cells in the RA synovium are derived from the peripheral blood, and there is clear evidence that adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cells mediate the migration of the leukocytes into the synovial membrane (3Szekanecz Z. Szegedi G. Koch A.E. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44: 124-135PubMed Google Scholar). An important example of this process is the localized endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and the selective recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes through its integrin counterreceptor, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) (4van Dinther-Janssen A.C. Horst E. Koopman G. Newmann W. Scheper R.J. Meijer C.J. Pals S.T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4207-4210PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion molecules are also involved in interactions between leukocytes and RA synovial fibroblasts (4van Dinther-Janssen A.C. Horst E. Koopman G. Newmann W. Scheper R.J. Meijer C.J. Pals S.T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4207-4210PubMed Google Scholar). During this cell/cell contact, adhesion molecules act as costimulators resulting in the activation of transcription factors and the production of cytokines, metalloproteinases, or other effector molecules (5Pitzalis C. Kingsley G. Panayi G. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a novel cytokine that has been classified in the IL-1 family in virtue of structural similarity to IL-1β. IL-18 acts as a strong inducer and coinducer of interferon γ (IFNγ) production in T cells and natural killer cells (6Takeda K. Tsutsui H. Yoshimoto T. Adachi O. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Okamura H. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 8: 383-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that IL-18 also has some proinflammatory activities independent of IFNγ; IL-18 induces the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, nitric oxide, and chemokines by T cells and natural killer cells (7Dinarello C.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 103: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Others and we showed that IL-18 operates through nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in natural killer cells, T lymphocytes, and RA synovial fibroblasts (8Matsumoto S. Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Kojima H. Aizawa Y. Yanai Y. Nagaoka K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Ikegami H.

The signaling cascade leading to NFκB activation involves several intermediary molecules that finally lead to the activation of inhibitory κB (IκB). Activated IκB releases NFκB, which migrates into the nucleus and induces gene transcription (8Matsumoto S. Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Shapiro L. Puren A.J. Barton H.A. Novick D. Peskind R.L. Shenkar R. Gu Y. Su M.S. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12550-12555Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). IL-18 has been found in synovial tissue, and enhanced levels of IL-18 were measured in the joint and in the serum of RA patients (12Gracie J.A. Forsey R.J. Chan W.L. Gilmour A. Leung B.P. Greer M.R. Kennedy K. Carter R. Wei X.Q. Xu D. Field M. Foulis A. Liew F.Y. McInnes I.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The role of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of RA remains poorly understood. However, recent evidence suggests that IL-18 enhances the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial tissue (13Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Esfandiari E. Wei X.Q. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6495-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Wei X. Leung B.P. Arthur H.M. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of IL-18 to induce endothelial and RA synovial fibroblast adhesion molecule expression and the mechanism of this expression. Here we demonstrate that IL-18 up-regulates ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 either on RA synovial fibroblasts or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), and we identify IL-18 as a novel inducer of E-selectin on HMVECs. Furthermore, IL-18 promotes endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion and appears to act in this system via VCAM-1 and E-selectin. We provide evidence that IL-18 induces RA synovial fibroblast VCAM-1 expression through NFκB. Finally, we report an alternative pathway involving PI 3-kinase, which influences the level of IL-18-induced VCAM-1 in RA synovial fibroblasts.

Endothelial cell basal medium, and the bullet kit containing media supplements were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) andN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were acquired from Sigma. Specific inhibitors LY294002, PD98059, PP2, and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fibroblasts were isolated from synovium obtained from patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA who had undergone total joint replacement surgery (17Arnett F.C. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fries J.F. Cooper N.S. Healey L.A. Kaplan S.R. Liang M.H. Luthra H.S. Medsger T.A.J. Mitchell D.M. Neustadt D.H. Pinals R.S. Schaller J.G. Sharp J.T. Wilder R.L. Hunder G.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18635) Google Scholar). Fresh synovial tissues were minced and digested in solution of dispase, collagenase, and DNase. Synovial fibroblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. The cells were used at passage 5 or older, at which time they were a homogeneous population of fibroblasts. HMVECs were purchased from BioWhittaker. HMVECs were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium-2 for microvascular cells (BioWhittaker). HMVECs were used between passage 3 and 12. Immortalized human dermal endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were a generous gift of Dr. Edmund W. Ades of the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Thomas Lawley of Emory University (Atlanta, GA). HMEC-1 were grown in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml, Becton Dickinson), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml, Sigma), and 5% FBS. The promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells (HL-60) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. Synovial fibroblasts, HMVECs, and HMEC-1 were grown in 175-mm tissue culture flasks (Falcon) in their respective media at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were passaged by brief trypsinization as previously described (18Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Leibovich S.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RA synovial fibroblasts or HMVECs were plated onto 6-cm Petri dishes (Falcon) at 1 × 105cells/ml and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C in an incubator gassed with 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated with IL-18 (5 nm) for 8 h, 16 h for VCAM-1, 4 h for E-selectin, and 24 h for ICAM-1 and HLA-DR. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper and transferred to fluorescence-activated cell sorting tubes (Becton Dickinson). Cells were then treated with mouse anti-VCAM-1, mouse anti-ICAM-1, mouse anti-E-selectin, mouse anti-HLA-DR, or isotype-matched control (5 μg/ml) as primary antibody. Cells were then incubated for 30 min with a phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1.5 μg/ml). Samples were washed twice with PBS, 1% FBS, and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Samples were assayed using an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Prior to data acquisition, the phycoerythrin channel was standardized using fluorescent beads (Rainbow Beads, Spherotech). For each condition (no stimulation or stimulation with IL-18 or IFNγ), an isotype-matched control was used, and the value was subtracted from the test result. 96-well plates (Dynex Technologies) were placed under UV for 30 min and coated with 0.02% gelatin (Sigma). HMEC-1 were plated into the 96-well plate at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 0 or 5 nm IL-18 or 1.15 nm TNF-α for 6 h at 37 °C/5% CO2. HL-60 were washed twice with PBS and adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, 1% P/S. HL-60 were incubated with 5 μm calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (calcAM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 30 min at 37 °C. CalcAM is a fluorescent dye that is incorporated into the living cells and thereby fixed in the cells. HL-60 were then washed twice with prewarmed RPMI 1640, 1% P/S to remove unincorporated dye and then adjusted to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Labeled HL-60 (25 × 104/100 μl) were added to each well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then were washed very carefully four or five times with prewarmed PBS. Fluorescence was determined by measurement with a fluorescent plate reader (SpectraMAX Gemini, Molecular Devices) set to 494 nm for excitation and 517 nm for emission. Adhesion was automatically expressed in relative fluorescence units. For better comparisons of the differentially treated groups and to avoid the use of relative fluorescence units, the adhesion of HL-60 to unstimulated HMEC-1 was chosen as a reference. The adhesion index was therefore defined as a ratio of adhesion of HL-60 to stimulated HMEC-1 (in relative fluorescence units) to adhesion of HL-60 to unstimulated HMEC-1 (in relative fluorescence units). For experiments in which the adhesion to HMEC-1 was blocked, cells were treated with monoclonal antibodies to VCAM-1, E-selectin, or isotype mouse-matched control (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HL-60 were labeled with calcAM and added to the HMEC-1 as outlined above. After various experimental treatments, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from synovial fibroblasts were prepared as previously described (20Katagiri K. Kinashi T. Irie S. Katagiri T. Blood. 1996; 87: 4276-4285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of protein in each extract was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell extracts were separated on standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transblotting apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween buffer (TBST; 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, with 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were incubated with anti-RelA at 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 14 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were scanned and analyzed for the measurement of the band intensities with the UN-SCAN-IT version 5.1 software (Silk Scientific, Orem, Utah). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Group means were compared with a Student's t test.p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RA synovial fibroblasts obtained from five different donors were cultured in the presence of IL-18 (5 nm) for 8, 16, or 24 h. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Fig.1 shows ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 induction on RA synovial fibroblasts by IL-18. ICAM-1 was constitutively expressed on 48.1% ± 4.9 (mean ± S.E.) of RA synovial fibroblasts. Likewise 19.9% ± 5.4 of RA synovial fibroblasts constitutively expressed VCAM-1. IL-18 stimulation significantly up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1 to 67% ± 5.7 at 24 h. IL-18 also significantly increased VCAM-1 expression to 60% ± 15 at 8 h, and 41% ± 12 at 16 h (p < 0.05). HMVECs were stimulated with IL-18 (5 nm) for 4, 6, or 24 h before fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for VCAM-1, E-selectin, and HLA-DR (Fig. 2). IFNγ (2.5 nm) stimulation was used as positive control for HLA-DR expression. A small percentage of HMVECs expressed VCAM-1 (4.8% ± 1.24) and E-selectin (5.2% ± 1) constitutively. IL-18 significantly induced between a 5- to 6-fold increase in VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression (p < 0.05), whereas it failed to induce HLA-DR expression. The functional significance of the adhesion molecules induced by IL-18 was evaluated with an adhesion assay in which HMEC-1 cultured in 96-well plates were prestimulated with IL-18 or positive control TNF-α and coincubated with the monocyte precursor cell line HL-60. These cells are known to express high amounts of very late antigen (VLA)-4, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, and Lewis X (20Katagiri K. Kinashi T. Irie S. Katagiri T. Blood. 1996; 87: 4276-4285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mizoguchi A. Takasaki S. Maeda S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11949-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three known ligands for VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, respectively. HMEC-1, which are SV 40-transformed normal HMVECs, were employed in place of HMVECs because they grow rapidly and provide a ready source of endothelial cells. Furthermore, HMEC-1 retain the morphologic, phenotypic and functional characteristics of HMVECs (22Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To allow comparison of the different experimental conditions at each incubation time point we used an adhesion index. Following stimulation with IL-18 (5 or 10 nm) for 4 and 6 h, the adhesion index was increased between 1.6- to 2-fold as compared with nonstimulated HMEC-1 (Fig.3). This effect completely declined after 24 h stimulation with IL-18. Interestingly, we observed similar kinetics when HMEC-1 were stimulated with TNF-α (1.15 nm). Indeed, the adhesion index peaked at 4 and 6 h and returned to the baseline at 24 h. To investigate the role of VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression in IL-18-stimulated HMEC-1 adhesion, HMEC-1 stimulated with IL-18 were incubated with monoclonal anti-VCAM-1 (monoclonal antibodies 4B9 and GH12), anti-E-selectin (monoclonal antibodies BB11) or isotype-matched control (2.5 μg/ml) antibodies (Fig.4). Although clones 4B9 and GH12 detect two different epitopes of VCAM-1, they both block VLA-4/VCAM-1 binding. Pretreatment of IL-18-stimulated HMEC-1 with anti-VCAM-1 or anti-E-selectin antibodies completely blocked the adhesion of HL-60 to HMEC-1 as assessed by the adhesion index, which is equal to 1. Interestingly, there was also a significant decrease of the adhesion index when TNF-α-stimulated HMEC-1 were preincubated with the same antibodies (data not shown). We previously showed that IL-18 increases the translocation of NFκB p65 to the nucleus in RA synovial fibroblasts by Western blotting (10Morel, J. C. M., Park, C. C., Kumar, P., and Koch, A. E. (2001) Lab. Invest., in pressGoogle Scholar). This translocation occurred at 1 h and was sustained for at least 4 h. Treatment of RA synovial fibroblasts with PDTC (300 μm) for 1, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h prior to the addition of 5 nm IL-18 inhibited the translocation of NFκB into the nucleus after 2 h of incubation with PDTC (Fig.5). The effect of NFκB inhibition on VCAM-1 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. RA synovial fibroblasts were incubated for 12 h with PDTC (300 μm) prior to the addition of IL-18 (5 nm) for 8 h. As shown in Fig.6A, PDTC inhibited IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression by 50%. To confirm this result, we tested NAC, an additional antioxidant which is structurally distinct from PDTC. The pH of NAC was adjusted to 7.3 prior to the incubation with RA synovial fibroblasts because the acidity of NAC was toxic to the cells. Prior to IL-18 stimulation, NAC was added at a final concentration of 25 μm for 2 h. As shown in Fig.6B, NAC effectively inhibited IL-18 activation of VCAM-1 by 60%. The concentration of PDTC and NAC used in all experiments had no cytotoxic effect during 24 h of observation, since the viability of the cell using propidium iodide uptake as an indicator was greater than 95% (data not shown). Antioxidant PDTC and NAC partially inhibit VCAM-1 expression, suggesting that there are probably other intracellular pathways that mediate VCAM-1 induction. To determine possible alternative pathways involved in IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression, we therefore tested different specific signaling inhibitors including a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), a src kinase inhibitor (PP2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 inhibitor (SB203580), and a Erk1/Erk2 inhibitor (PD98059). RA synovial fibroblasts were pretreated with the specific signaling inhibitors at 10 μm or Me2SO vehicle control for 1 h and then stimulated with IL-18 (5 nm) for 12 h. Flow cytometry was performed to measure cell surface VCAM-1 expression on RA synovial fibroblasts. Data presented in Fig.7 indicate that PI 3-kinase is involved in IL-18 signaling since LY294002 significantly down-regulates VCAM-1 expression on IL-18-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts. This effect was not a toxic effect of LY294002 since the viability of the cells evaluated by trypan blue exclusion was greater than 90%. To determine whether PI 3-kinase and NFκB act sequentially in the same pathway or through separate pathways, we studied the effect of simultaneous addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) with the NFκB inhibitor (PDTC). RA synovial fibroblasts were pretreated with PDTC (300 μm) for 14 h and LY294002 (10 μm) for 1 h and then stimulated for 8 h with IL-18 (5 nm). VCAM-1 expression on RA synovial fibroblasts was detected by flow cytometry. The viability of the cells evaluated by trypan blue was greater than 80%. When applied together, PDTC and LY294002 decreased VCAM-1 expression on IL-18-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts to the level of that found on nonstimulated cells (Fig.8). Adhesion molecules have been extensively studied in RA. Immunostaining of RA synovial tissue revealed that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are expressed on synovial fibroblasts and endothelial cells, whereas E-selectin is expressed only on endothelial cells. Further up-regulation of these adhesion molecules occurs in vitrofollowing exposure to inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (23McMurray R.W. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 25: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The novel proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 has been demonstrated in synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and serum of patients with RA, but its role in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Here, we report that IL-18 up-regulates ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells and RA synovial fibroblasts, and we extend the known effects of IL-18 to include its capacity to induce endothelial cell E-selectin expression. Indeed, the ability of IL-18 to induce E-selectin had never been described to date in any cell type. In fact, very few studies exist on the role of IL-18 in relation to cellular adhesion molecules. In myeloid KG-1 cells, IL-18 increases expression of ICAM-1 and mediates heterotypic aggregation between the KG-1 myeloid cell line and the Peer T cell line (24Kohka H. Yoshino T. Iwagaki H. Sakuma I. Tanimoto T. Matsuo Y. Kurimoto M. Orita K. Akagi T. Tanaka N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This interaction was blocked by anti-ICAM-1. In melanoma cells (B16M), IL-18 up-regulates VCAM-1 expression as well as the adhesion of B16M to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (25Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Fantuzzi G. Mendoza L. Fuentes A.M. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J. Carrascal T. Walsh P. Reznikov L.L. Kim S.H. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). B16M adherence to hepatic sinusoidal endothelium was blocked by anti-VCAM-1 antibody. In this report, we show that IL-18 stimulates endothelial cells to increase binding to promyelocytic leukemia HL-60. The adhesion of HL-60 to HMEC-1 was maximal after 4 and 6 h of stimulation with IL-18. These kinetics suggested that VCAM-1 and/or E-selectin might be involved in this process. Hence, we tested the effect of monoclonal antibodies to VCAM-1 and E-selectin on HL-60 adherence to IL-18 stimulated HMEC-1. Blocking VCAM-1 or E-selectin completely reduced the adhesion of HL-60 to IL-18-stimulated endothelial cells. The ability of IL-18 to promote cell adhesion is particularly interesting since binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells is the first step in the emigration of leukocytes into perivascular space, an important early development of chronic inflammation. This, in combination with the coordinated generation of chemokines by IL-1-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts, as we previously described (10Morel, J. C. M., Park, C. C., Kumar, P., and Koch, A. E. (2001) Lab. Invest., in pressGoogle Scholar), provides an important mechanism promoting the migration of leukocytes into and within the synovium. Data obtained from animal models tend to support this hypothesis. Indeed, mice immunized with type II collagen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and treated with IL-18 exhibit an extensive inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells (13Leung B.P. McInnes I.B. Esfandiari E. Wei X.Q. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6495-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-18-defective mice develop a less severe collagen-induced arthritis than wild-type mice with a lower histological cellular infiltration in the joints (14Wei X. Leung B.P. Arthur H.M. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As compared with wild-type mice, cells isolated from arthritic IL-18-deficient mice also produce significantly lower amounts of TNF-α and IFNγ. Since IL-18 has the ability to induce TNF-α and IFNγ in vitro, it is possible that IL-18 exerts its proinflammatory effects, including adhesion molecule expression, via these cytokines. However, in vitro, the neutralization of TNF-α and IFNγ did not block the IL-18 induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 in KG1 cells and VCAM-1 in B16M cells. In our system, RA synovial fibroblasts and endothelial cells are not known to produce either TNF-α or IFNγ (26Bucala R. Ritchlin C. Winchester R. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 27Bombara M.P. Webb D.L. Conrad P. Marlor C.W. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. Aune T.M. Greve J.M. Blue M.L. J. Leuk. Biol. 1993; 54: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Schwachula A. Riemann D. Kehlen A. Langner J. Immunobiology. 1994; 190: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of IL-18 to activate NFκB, as we reported previously (11Shapiro L. Puren A.J. Barton H.A. Novick D. Peskind R.L. Shenkar R. Gu Y. Su M.S. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12550-12555Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that IL-18 induces RA synovial fibroblast and endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression by itself. Indeed, NFκB is known to regulate the transcription of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin (29Li P. Sanz I. O'Keefe R.J. Schwarz E.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5990-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Kawai M. Nishikomori R. Jung E.Y. Tai G. Yamanaka C. Mayumi M. Heike T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2333-2341PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ferran C. Millan M.T. Csizmadia V. Cooper J.T. Brostjan C. Bach F.H. Winkler H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To examine the participation of NFκB in IL-18-induced adhesion molecule expression, we tested the impact of inhibitors of NFκB on RA synovial fibroblast VCAM-1 expression. These inhibitors, PDTC and NAC, are structurally different but prevent NFκB activation through their antioxidant property. PDTC and NAC are believed to reversibly suppress the release of an inhibitor subunit, IκB, from the latent cytoplasmic form of NFκB in cells treated with inflammatory mediators (32Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Therefore, there should be no migration of NFκB into the nucleus. This is exactly what we observed in RA synovial fibroblasts, since the level of NFκB present in the nucleus of IL-18 stimulated fibroblasts following 2 h of preincubation with PDTC is similar to the level of NFκB present in nonstimulated cells. On the basis of this finding, we assessed the inhibitory effect of PDTC on IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression. PDTC reduced the level of VCAM-1 detected on RA synovial fibroblasts by 50% following IL-18 or IL-1β stimulation. This result was confirmed using NAC. Inhibition of VCAM-1 expression is partial, whereas the concentrations of PDTC and NAC are optimal to block NFκB activation during exposure to IL-18. Interestingly, in a previous study we showed that treatment of cells with antisense NFκB p65 reduced IL-18-induced IL-8 production by about 50% (10Morel, J. C. M., Park, C. C., Kumar, P., and Koch, A. E. (2001) Lab. Invest., in pressGoogle Scholar). These results are consistent with Thomas et al. (33Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C. Cao Z. Wasserman S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated that splenocytes extracted from mice deficient in IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), a serine-threonine kinase involved in NFκB activation following stimulation with IL-18 (8Matsumoto S. Tsuji-Takayama K. Aizawa Y. Koide K. Takeuchi M. Ohta T. Kurimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), secrete one-half the amount of IFNγ protein produced by wild-type cells. Hence, blocking NFκB seems to partially inhibit the effect of IL-18. These observations strongly suggest that there are alternative pathways, which can compensate for the inactivation of NFκB. This hypothesis is supported by Kalina et al. who demonstrated that IL-18 activates the transcription factor STAT3. The same authors reported that IL-18 may operate through the MAPK p38 since an inhibitor of this MAPK partially blocks the production of IFNγ in the natural killer 92 cell line (34Kalina U. Kauschat D. Koyama N. Nuernberger H. Ballas K. Koschmieder S. Bug G. Hofmann W.K. Hoelzer D. Ottmann O.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To explore alternative pathways, we tested different inhibitors of intracellular signaling intermediates on VCAM-1 expression. In RA synovial fibroblasts, surprisingly, MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and PD98059) and the src kinase inhibitor (PP2) did not have any effect on VCAM-1 expression, whereas the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) reduced VCAM-1 expression by 50%. PI 3-kinase is a serine threonine kinase, which can become activated by several pathways (35Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di F.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of PI 3-kinase by IL-18 could be either direct or indirect. The indirect mechanism could involve a cytokine produced by IL-18-stimulated RA synovial fibroblasts, which may act in an autocrine fashion to induce VCAM-1 expression through PI 3-kinase activation. For example, growth factors are known to act through PI 3-kinase (35Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di F.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can modulate adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells (36Kim I. Moon S.O. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IL-18 could directly activate PI 3-kinase following binding to its receptor. PI 3-kinase relays the signaling of G protein-coupled receptors (37Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible, although not described to date, that a G protein-coupled IL-18 receptor could exist. A similar hypothesis has been discussed for IL-1 to explain the modulating activity of G protein inhibitors and activators on IL-1β-induced ICAM-1 expression (38Sadeghi M.M. Collinge M. Pardi R. Bender J.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2712-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another possibility might be that IL-18 could activate PI 3-kinase through a receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. Mechanistically, this pathway could involve the small GTPase Ras, or it might rely on a direct binding of PI 3-kinase to receptor tyrosine kinases (35Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di F.P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To activate transcription factors, PI 3-kinase has been demonstrated to operate through Akt (39Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) or small GTPases proteins such as Cdc42, Rac, and Raf-1 (37Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Min and Pober demonstrated that these small GTPases initiate E-selectin transcription in human endothelial cells through a parallel pathway to NFκB involving JNK-c-jun/ATF2 (40Min W. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3508-3518PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, we hypothesized that IL-18 might induce adhesion molecule expression through two parallel pathways. Experiments using PI 3-kinase and NFκB inhibitors together strongly support this hypothesis since LY294002 in combination with PDTC virtually inhibited IL-18-induced VCAM-1 expression. These data suggest that IL-18 mediates VCAM-1 synthesis through two distinct pathways, one involving NFκB and the other involving PI 3-kinase. To induce VCAM-1 expression, PI 3-kinase may use transcription factors other than NFκB such as AP1 and STAT3 that are already known to be activated by PI 3-kinase (41Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 42Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, we can not exclude that PI 3-kinase may use NFκB, at least in part, to induce VCAM-1 transcription. Indeed, it is possible that PI 3-kinase may initiate an activation of NFκB that is not inhibited by PDTC. This theory is supported by Sizemore et al. who showed that PI 3-kinase could regulate NFκB-dependent promoter expression independently of the IκB degradation-NFκB liberation pathway (43Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, IL-18 induces the expression of functional adhesion molecules in two different cell types, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-18-induced RA synovial fibroblast VCAM-1 expression is regulated by a NFκB and PI 3-kinase suggesting that there might be two signaling pathways involved in IL-18-induced adhesion molecule expression. Blocking IL-18 or its signaling pathways may point to a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of inflammatory diseases like RA.

https://openalex.org/W2099239388,"Exogenous long-chain fatty acids are activated to coenzyme A derivatives prior to metabolic utilization. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the activation of these compounds prior to metabolic utilization proceeds through the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases Faa1p and Faa4p. Faa1p or Faa4p are essential for long-chain fatty acid import, suggesting that one or both of these enzymes are components of the fatty acid transport system, which also includes Fat1p. By monitoring the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid, long-chain fatty acid transport was shown to be severely restricted in a faa1Δ faa4Δ strain. These data established for the first time a mechanistic linkage between the import and activation of exogenous fatty acids in yeast. To investigate this linkage further, oleoyl CoA levels were defined following incubation of wild type and mutant cells with limiting concentrations of exogenous oleate. These studies demonstrated oleoyl CoA levels were reduced to less than 10% wild-type levels in faa1Δ andfaa1Δ faa4Δ strains. Defects in metabolic utilization and intracellular trafficking were also found in the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase-deficient strains. The faa1Δfaa4Δ strain had a marked reduction in endogenous acyl-CoA pools, suggesting these enzymes play a role in maintenance of endogenous acyl-CoA pools, metabolism and trafficking. In addition, this strain had levels of in vivo β-oxidation of exogenous oleate reduced 3-fold when compared with the isogenic parent. Northern analyses demonstrated an additional defect in fatty acid trafficking as FAA1 or FAA4 were required for the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding the peroxisomal enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase (POX1) and medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (FAA2). These data support the hypothesis that fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p or Faa4p) functions as a component of the fatty acid import system by linking import and activation of exogenous fatty acids to intracellular utilization and signaling.

Many cells, although capable of de novo fatty acid synthesis, scavenge fatty acids from the extracellular milieu thereby bypassing the energy-expensive synthetic reactions. Cells such as adipocytes export fatty acids for use by other cells and tissues. The mechanisms governing fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane in these cases are poorly understood. Two fundamental mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to this process. (i) Fatty acid transport is independent of membrane-bound fatty acid transporters and occurs by simple diffusion. In this case, transport is viewed as driven by a concentration gradient generated by intracellular utilization. (ii) Membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins mediate fatty acid import and/or export. The challenges we are faced with are to define the individual contributions of diffusion and membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins to promote specificity and selectivity of the fatty acid transport process. Our laboratory investigates the process of fatty acid transport using two genetically tractable model systems, the prokaryote Escherichia coli and the eukaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed in Ref. 1DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each organism can synthesize endogenous fatty acids or acquire fatty acids from the extracellular environment for use as a carbon and energy source for macromolecular synthesis and growth. Yeast in particular is of interest as a model eukaryote since it shares many features in common with mammalian systems. Fatty acid synthesis is catalyzed by a type I (associated) fatty acid synthase (2Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Imported fatty acids can be used for β-oxidation to supply energy as in muscle cells or for storage in a lipid body as in adipocytes (3Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Fatty acids supplied in the growth medium repress the transcription of genes encoding proteins required for fatty acid synthesis (4Kamiryo T. Parthasarathy S. Numa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12068-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additionally, as in some mammalian tissues, fatty acids induce the proliferation of yeast peroxisomes and, therefore, are critical signaling molecules in organelle biogenesis and development (8Elgersma Y. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Kos W. Kal A.J. van Wilpe S. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Import of fatty acids into yeast is an essential function when cells are auxotrophic for fatty acids. This occurs in the natural environment when oxygen is limiting due to inhibition of the O2-requiring Δ9-acyl-CoA desaturase (encoded by OLE1) (11Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1954; 43: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a conditional auxotrophy is imposed when cells are cultured in medium containing the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin. In yeast, fatty acid import is saturable and dependent upon Fat1p, a homologue of the murine fatty acid transport protein, FATP (12Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has hypothesized that Fat1p is one member of a multi-component fatty acid import apparatus (12Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the well characterized E. coli model system, fatty acid import is not only dependent upon the outer membrane-bound transporter, FadL, but also requires the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, FadD (14Black P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this regard, long-chain fatty acid transport is described as vectorial acylation. Since in eukaryotic systems, imported fatty acids must, likewise, be activated by esterification to coenzyme A prior to metabolic utilization, we hypothesize a similar coupling of fatty acid import and activation is one mechanism that drives this process. In the present study we have evaluated the role of the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases Faa1p and Faa4p of S. cerevisiae in fatty acid import, activation, and intracellular trafficking. In S. cerevisiae, four fatty acyl-CoA synthetases encoded by separate genes have been identified: Faa1p, Faa2p, Faa3p, and Faa4p (15Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells carrying deletions in each of the four FAAgenes are viable, suggesting de novo fatty acid synthesis provides sufficient acyl-CoA for essential cellular functions (15Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Faa1p and Faa4p are the primary enzymes involved in activation of imported long-chain fatty acids (C12–C18), whereas Faa2p appears to be involved in activation of medium-chain fatty acids directed toward peroxisomal β-oxidation (15Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The physiological role of Faa3p, which is most active toward fatty acids >C18, has not yet been defined. More recently, very-long-chain (C22-C26) acyl-CoA synthetase activity has also been attributed to Fat1p (17Choi J.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4671-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Watkins P.A. Lu J.F. Steinberg S.J. Gould S.J. Smith K.D. Braiterman L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18210-18219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which plays a pivotal role in long chain fatty acid import (12Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In previous work, our laboratory has devised methods to assess fatty acid transport in yeast. We define the process of fatty acid transport as the net movement of fatty acids from the external milieu across the cell wall and membrane into the internal milieu. Our data support the hypothesis that transport is complex and includes both diffusional and protein mediated components. In previous work, we demonstrated one of the protein components is Fat1p. In the present work, we provide evidence that a long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, either Faa1p or Faa4p, is also required. In addition, we demonstrate deletion ofFAA1 and/or FAA4 alters the endogenous acyl-CoA pools in the absence of exogenous fatty acid, suggesting these enzymes also play a role in intracellular acyl-CoA metabolism. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains YB332 (a; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; his3Δ-200; ade2–101; lys2–801), YB513 (a; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; his3Δ-200; ade2–101; lys2–01; faa1Δ::HIS3), YB524 (a; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; his3Δ-200; ade2–101; lys2–801, faa4Δ::LYS2), YB525 (a; ura3–52; leu2–3, 112; his3Δ-200; ade2–101; lys2–801; faa1Δ::HIS3; faa4Δ::LYS2), and YB526 (a; ura3–52; his3Δ200; ade2–10; lys2–80; leu2–3, 112; faa1Δ::HIS3; faa2Δ::LEU2; faa3Δ::LEU;2 faa4Δ::LYS2) were obtained from Jeffrey I. Gordon (Washington University of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and used in all experiments described. YPDA consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, and 20 mg/liter adenine-hemisulfate. Yeast supplemented minimal medium contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 2% dextrose, adenine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), and amino acids as required (arginine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, and tyrosine (20 mg/liter); lysine (30 mg/liter); and leucine (100 mg/liter)). To assess growth when fatty acid synthase was inhibited, cells were grown on YNBD plates supplemented with 45 μmcerulenin and 100 μm oleic acid (YNB-CER-OLE). To assess growth under hypoxic conditions cells were grown on YNBD plates supplemented with 20 μg/ml ergosterol, 100 μm oleic acid, and amino acids and uracil as required (YNB-EG-OLE). Growth in liquid culture and on plates was at 30 °C. The plasmids pGALFAA1 and pGALFAA4(FAA1 and FAA4 under the control of theGAL7 promoter, respectively) were obtained from InvitroGen. Transformation of the faa1Δ faa4Δ strain was accomplished using the high efficiency lithium acetate protocol essentially as described (19Chen D. Yang B. Kuo T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Fatty acid transport was assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)1 and the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid (C1-BODIPY-C12) as described previously (12Faergeman N.J.

Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YNBD to A600 of 0.8–1.0, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and finally resuspended in 0.1 volume of PBS. Cells (faa1Δ faa4Δ) harboring either pGALFAA1 or pGALFAA4 were grown from an overnight culture in YNB containing 4% sucrose to an A600of 0.4, at which time cultures were split, 2% glucose added to one, 2% galactose added to the other. Growth was continued until the cell density reached an A600 of 0.8. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of PBS as detailed above. All steps were performed at room temperature. Washed cells were incubated with 10 μmC1-BODIPY-C12 for 60 s, washed in PBS containing 50 μm fatty acid-free BSA (two times), PBS, resuspended in PBS, and visualized on an NORAN-OZ CLSM, interfaced with a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope equipped with a PlanApo 60×, 1.4 numeric aperture oil immersion objective lens. No efflux of fatty acid was found during the time course used during these experimental conditions. The use of C1-BODIPY-C12 at a final concentration of 10 μm was chosen, as this allowed for the fluorescent signal to be readily visualized using CLSM. The instrument settings for brightness, contrast, laser power, and slit size were optimized for the brightest sample to assure that the CLSM was set for its full dynamic range. The same settings were used for all subsequent image collections. Rates of fatty acid transport were also determined using the filtration assay described previously (13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YNBD containing the appropriate supplements at 30 °C to mid-log phase, collected by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 0.1 original volume in PBS. 500 μl of cells (1 × 108 cells) were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in PBS, and the assay was initiated by the addition of [9, 10-3H]oleate at the fatty acid:BSA ratios indicated in the table legend. At the defined time points (0, 2, 4, and 6 min), 100-μl duplicate samples were diluted into 5 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Brij 58 (PBS-Brij) and then were immediately filtered through a Whatman Gf/B filter. The filters were washed three times with PBS-Brij. Transport rates were defined within the linear range. No fatty acid efflux was observed over the 6-min period using this experimental approach. All wash steps were carried out at room temperature. Filters were air-dried and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. The final data were expressed in picomoles of oleate transported/min/1 × 108 cells and subjected to analysis of variance using PRIZM software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All data presented represent the mean (± stand error of the mean) from two independent experiments performed in duplicate. Total fatty acid profiles were determined in cells grown in YNBD to anA600 of 0.8. Cell growth and metabolism were stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 6.6 m perchloric acid. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 ×g (4 °C). The cell pellets were resuspended in water and 100 μg of heptadecanoic acid (in hexane) added as an internal standard. The lipids were extracted using a modification of the technique described by Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) using glass beads (2 g/50 ml cultures, 425–600 μm) to break the cells. Following extraction, the lipids were dried under a stream of N2, resuspended in 0.4 ml of NaOH in methanol (20 g/liter), and incubated overnight at 100 °C. boron trifluoride (0.5 ml; 20%) was added and incubation continued for 1 h at 100 °C. The methyl esters were extracted with hexane, dried, resuspended in 1 ml of methyl acetate, and analyzed by gas chromatography using an HP 225 column. The data are presented in mol % fatty acid and are the mean of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. For fatty acyl-CoA determinations, cells were grown overnight in YPDA and diluted to an A600 of 0.1 in 100 ml YNBD. When the cell density reached an A600 of 0.8, oleic acid was added to a final concentration of 100 μmand grown for the times indicated in the figure legend. Cell growth and metabolism were stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 6.6 mperchloric acid. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g (4 °C). Acyl-CoA extraction, quantification, and identification were performed as described by Schjerling et al. (21Schjerling C.K. Hummel R. Hansen J.K. Borsting C. Mikkelsen J.M. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were grown from overnight cultures in YPDA and grown to an A600of 1.0. Following growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended to a density of 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm pepstatin A, and 8 μm leupeptin. The cells were lysed by vigorously vortexing the cell suspension containing glass beads for 1 min, 5 times at 0 °C. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 5 min), and supernatants were used to assess acyl-CoA activities. Acyl-CoA synthetase activities were determined in cell extracts as described (22Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 200 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.01% Triton X-100, fatty acid dissolved in 10 mg/ml α-dextrin (final concentrations of fatty acids were 50 μm), 0.5 mm coenzyme A, and cell extract in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reactions were initiated by the addition of coenzyme A, incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of isopropanol:n-heptane:1 mH2SO4 (40:10:1). The radioactive fatty acid was removed by organic extraction using n-heptane. Acyl-CoA formed during the reaction remained in the aqueous fraction and was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations in the enzyme extracts and purified enzyme samples were determined using the Bradford assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments. All experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance using PRIZM software. Cells were grown and peroxisomes induced in YP medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 3% glycerol) containing 0.2% oleate and 1% Brij58 (YPO) as described by Rottensteiner et al. (24Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Following induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in PBS-Brij58, twice in PBS, and finally resuspended to anA600 of 2.5 in PBS. For assay, aliquots of 200 μl of cell suspension were added to a 25-ml reaction vessel fitted with a center well (Kontes) in a total volume of 2 ml of PBS. To initiate the reaction, [1-14C]oleic acid was added from an ethanolic stock to a final concentration of 10 μm. Reactions were continued for 30 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of H2SO4 to 1 n added directly to the cell sample. Radiolabeled CO2 was trapped for 60 min in 50% ethanolamine in ethanol in the center well. Radioactivity trapped in the well was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The final data were expressed in picomoles/min/mg of protein and analyzed using PRIZM. Data presented represent the mean (± stand error of the mean) from at least three independent experiments. Cells were grown from an overnight culture into YPDA to an A600of 0.1 and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Cells were harvested, washed twice in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) and diluted to an A600 of 0.05 in YP medium containing 2% glucose, 3% glycerol, or 3% glycerol 0.2% oleate, and 1% Brij58 58 and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 0 °C, washed, RNA extracted, and analyzed by Northern blotting (25Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6129-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hybridization probes (OLE1, POX1, FAA2, andACT1) used were PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA, gel-purified, and 32P-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and the Prime-a-Gene kit from Promega. Yeast extract, yeast peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were obtained from Difco. Oleic acid was obtained from Sigma.3H- or 14C-labeled fatty acids were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, American Radiochemicals, or Sigma. C1-BODIPY-C12 was purchased from Molecular Probes. Enzymes required for all DNA manipulations were from Promega, New England Biolabs, United States Biochemical Corp., or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid-activating enzyme Faa1p was first identified as a gene required for growth when the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin was included in the growth media containing the long-chain saturated fatty acids myristate or palmitate (26Duronio R.J. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequently, three additional genes encoding the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases Faa2p, Faa3p, and Faa4p were identified by sequence comparisons and reverse genetics (27Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the cloned genes and enzymes indicated Faa4p had overlapping functions with Faa1p, and either one was sufficient to support growth under these synthetic lethal conditions (15Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the natural environment, yeast are auxotrophic for long-chain unsaturated fatty acids when growing under hypoxic conditions since the O2-requiring Δ9-acyl-CoA desaturase necessary for de novounsaturated fatty acid synthesis is inactive (11Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1954; 43: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of bothFAA1 and FAA4 was required to completely eliminate growth under these culture conditions (Fig.1A). This result was comparable to that observed when fatty acid synthase was inhibited with cerulenin (Fig. 1B). Growth of the faa1Δfaa4Δ strain was restored under both conditionally lethal conditions by the introduction of expression plasmids containing either the FAA1 or FAA4 genes under the control of a galactose inducible promoter; as expected, growth was dependent upon inclusion of galactose in the culture media (Fig. 1). Thus, Faa1p and Faa4p can each activate saturated and unsaturated fatty acids imported from the environment to provide essential fatty acids required for growth. These data did not distinguish whether these fatty acyl-CoA synthetases were required only for metabolic utilization of imported fatty acids or whether they were are also required for the transport process in a manner analogous to that which occurs in Gram-negative bacteria. In an effort to address whether there is a link between fatty acid import and activation in S. cerevisiae, studies were conducted to monitor the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent fatty acid analogue C1-BODIPY-C12 using CLSM. Wild-type cells accumulate exogenous C1-BODIPY-C12quickly (within 30 s) by an essentially irreversible process, suggesting this compound becomes metabolically trapped (12Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C.

Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). No efflux of C1-BODIPY-C12 was noted using this experimental approach to monitor fatty acid import (13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The accumulation of exogenous C1-BODIPY-C12 was basically unchanged in the faa4Δ strain but considerably reduced in the faa1Δ strain (Fig.2A). Deletion of bothFAA1 and FAA4 reduced the accumulation of C1-BODIPY-C12 further (Fig. 2A). These data are consistent with the notion that Faa1p plays a more prominent role in fatty acid import. Centromeric clones (pGALFAA1 and pGALFAA4) encoding these enzymes transformed into the faa1Δ faa4Δ strain led to a large increase in C1-BODIPY-C12accumulation when cells were grown in the presence of galactose to induce the expression of Faa1p or Faa4p (Fig. 2B). These findings attest to the importance of these two enzymes in the fatty acid import process. We hypothesize the irreversible nature of import is due to the metabolic trapping of C1-BODIPY-C12, presumably as a CoA thioester as a consequence of either Faa1p or Faa4p. The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrated the accumulation of the fluorescent fatty acid C1-BODIPY-C12 was compromised in the faa1Δ faa4Δ strain and that expression of either FAA1 or FAA4 from a galactose inducible promoter on a plasmid following transformation in essence restored the wild type activity. These data lend support to the hypothesis that fatty acid import is indeed linked to activation in yeast. In an effort to quantify these results at the level of fatty acid import, we used the filtration method (13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Black P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to monitor the import of [3H]oleate in wild type and fatty acyl-CoA deficient strains as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (Table I). As with the experimental approach detailed above using C1-BODIPY-C12, there was no measurable efflux of the labeled fatty acid following transport (13DiRusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J.K. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Black P.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results revealed that a deletion ofFAA1 decreased oleate import nearly 2-fold, whereas a deletion of FAA4 basically had no effect. Although the reduction in import in the faa1Δ strain was the trend at oleate:BSA ratios of 0.5 and 1.0 (p ≥ 0.1), the reduction in import noted at the higher concentration of oleate was significant (oleate:BSA = 2.0; p < 0.1). The results acquired for the wild-type, faa1Δ, andfaa4Δ strains using the filtration method essentially mirr"

Apoptosis of these cells is emerging as a key process in the resolution of liver fibrosis. Here, we examined the effects of cyclopentenone prostaglandins on apoptosis of human hMFs. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins of the J series markedly reduced hMF viability, with 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2) being the most potent. This effect was independent of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), because PPARgamma and PPARalpha agonists did not affect hMF cell viability, and PPARgamma, the nuclear receptor for 15-d-PGJ2, was not expressed in hMFs. Moreover, 15-d-PGJ2 did not act via a cell surface G protein-coupled receptor, as shown in guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding assays. Cell death resulted from an apoptotic process, because 15-d-PGJ2-treated hMFs exhibited condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA, and elevated caspase-3 activity. Moreover, the caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone blocked the cytotoxic effect of 15-d-PGJ2. The apoptotic effects of 15-d-PGJ2 were reproduced by H2O2 and blocked by the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-(2-mercapto-propionyl)-glycine (NMPG) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Accordingly, 15-d-PGJ2 generated rapid production of reactive oxygen species in hMFs, via a NAC/NMPG/PDTC-sensitive pathway. In conclusion, 15-d-PGJ2 induces apoptosis of human hMFs via a novel mechanism involving oxidative stress and unrelated to activation of its nuclear receptor PPARgamma. These data underline the antifibrogenic potential of 15-d-PGJ2."
https://openalex.org/W1966350789,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors and processed to generate transcriptionally active forms. The active SREBPs translocate to the nucleus, induce the expression of responsive genes, and are degraded very rapidly. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors elevates the amount of the endogenous nuclear SREBPs, but not the precursors, in HeLa cells. Nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–487) and SREBP-2 (amino acids 1–481), which are transiently expressed in stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (CHO-487 and -481), are also stabilized by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that the nuclear SREBPs are likely to be substrates for the proteasome-dependent proteolysis. The stabilized nuclear SREBPs actively induce the expression of responsive genes including hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, and the low density lipoprotein receptor. The rapid turnover of nuclear SREBP-1a is not affected by the intracellular sterol levels, and the half-life is estimated to be ∼3 h. The nuclear SREBPs are found conjugated with a polyubiquitin chain. When this conjugation is inhibited by overexpression of mutant ubiquitin that is defective in polyubiquitination, the nuclear SREBPs are partly stabilized and induce the expression of the responsive gene, suggesting that the ubiquitin-conjugated SREBPs are substrates for the proteasome. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades SREBPs and that this system controls the expression of SREBP-responsive genes.

These transcription factors belong to a large class of transcription factors containing a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) motif. The SREBP family comprises three subtypes: SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which are generated by alternative splicing, and SREBP-2. Human SREBP-1a contains 1147 amino acids and is 47% identical to human SREBP-2, which contains 1141 amino acids (2Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

SREBP-1c, which in most tissues is the form predominantly expressed, now appears to be a strong candidate as a general mediator of the action of insulin on the regulation of metabolism via effects on gene expression (4Foretz M.

In contrast, SREBP-2, the expression of which is controlled by sterols, is thought to be deeply involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism (6Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the bHLH-Zip transcription factors, the SREBPs are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activated by a two-step proteolytic process (7Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 8Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These proteins contain an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain with a bHLH-Zip motif and a C-terminal regulatory domain separated by two transmembrane helices. The C-terminal regulatory domain associates with SREBP cleavage-activating protein, an ER membrane protein with eight membrane-spanning segments (10Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein contains five copies of the WD repeat, a protein/protein interaction motif, forming a complex with SREBPs that is required for SREBP cleavage by Site-1 protease (S1P), the active form of which is located in a post-ER compartment (11Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The complex is localized in the ER as long as intracellular cholesterol levels are high, thereby stabilizing the SREBP precursors. In cells depleted of cholesterol, ER-derived membrane vesicles containing this complex move to the Golgi where a sequential cleavage of the SREBPs by S1P and Site-2 protease (S2P) occurs, releasing the active forms (12DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Once the active SREBPs are released into the cytoplasm, they are actively transported into the nucleus in an importin β-dependent manner (13Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 7: 2221-2233Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the HLH-Zip domain contains a novel type of nuclear localization signal, which binds directly to importin β. When the active form of SREBP-1 or -2 is transiently expressed in certain cultured cells, the synthesized SREBP is not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction but rather in the nucleus, suggesting that the transport is very rapid and efficient. It has been further demonstrated that dimerization of the SREBPs through the leucine zipper motif is a prerequisite process for nuclear import mediated by importin β (14Nagoshi E. Yoneda Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In general, most transcription factors are extremely unstable. For example, c-Jun, c-Fos, STAT1, p53, c-Myc, and E2F-1, are all unstable proteins, with in vivo half-lives ranging from a few minutes to a few hours (15Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D.

Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediates degradation of various transcription factors, being a major route for intracellular degradation of both short-lived regulatory proteins and abnormal proteins (21Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 22Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a process that covalently tags with polyubiquitin chains and signals for substrate destruction by the 26 S proteasome (23Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). This is accomplished in three sequential steps and is catalyzed by the successive actions of E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). Ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein, is initially activated by E1, and then activated ubiquitin is transferred to E2, whose principal function is to shuttle ubiquitin to E3. E3 binds to the substrate and catalyzes the covalent tagging of ubiquitin to the substrate. Once the first ubiquitin molecule is transferred to a lysine residue within the substrate, a polyubiquitin chain is generated via a series of isopeptide bonds between a lysine residue of the tagging ubiquitin and the C-terminal glycine of the next added ubiquitin molecule. Repeated rounds of ubiquitination result in a polyubiquitinated substrate, which is degraded rapidly by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent reaction. A number of studies have shown that nuclear export is required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of certain nuclear proteins including p27kip1, cyclin D1, p53, and IκBα as well as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (25Tomoda K. Yukiko K. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 26Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These results make it clear that ubiquitin-proteasome degradation occurs in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, certain other transcription factors such as Sp1 and MyoD are reported to be degraded by the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system (30Su K. Roos M.D. Yang X. Han I. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Floyd Z.E. Trausch-Azar J.S. Reinstein E. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22468-22475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reason for these alternative pathways for the degradation of nuclear proteins remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we present evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the turnover of SREBPs. Furthermore, we show that it is the nuclear SREBPs, not their precursors, which are major substrates for proteasome-dependent proteolysis and that stabilized nuclear SREBPs remain active and participate in the induced expression of their responsive genes. SREBP degradation is not specifically controlled by the level of intracellular cholesterol. We further demonstrate that the SREBPs are polyubiquitinated and that it is via that conjugation they are led to proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus, the present data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a crucial role in the control of cellular lipid metabolism.

For the luciferase assay, the cells (35-mm dishes) were transfected with 0.2 μg of pHMG-S, a reporter plasmid containing 0.5 kilobases of the human HMG-CoA synthase promoter (35Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 0.01 μg of pRL-CMV (Promega), and the indicated amount of pME-His-mutUb. To determine the luciferase activities, a Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter System (Promega) was used. COS1 cells were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method with either pME-GFP-SREBP1a-(2–487) or pFPA1 (36Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), an expression plasmid for GFP-Pap1 fusion protein. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml LMB or LMB plus 100 μm ALLN for 2 h. The cellular distribution of GFP-fused proteins was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Previous studies demonstrated that the nuclear SREBPs are rapidly degraded and that a calpain inhibitor, ALLN, can block this degradation (7Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 37Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study we examined whether another cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64-d, or a proteasome-specific inhibitor, lactacystin, could also inhibit the degradation of endogenous SREBPs in HeLa cells. In addition, we examined the effect of LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (38Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), on degradation to determine if nuclear export is involved in SREBP turnover. HeLa cells were cultured under sterol-depleted conditions for 2 days to increase the nuclear SREBPs. During the last 5 h, the cells were incubated with either one or two of the indicated inhibitors, and the nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis for SREBP-1 and -2. In response to sterol depletion, the amounts of nuclear SREBP-1 and -2 were increased, and the addition of ALLN or lactacystin induced a still further increase (Fig.1A), suggesting that the proteasome is involved in the turnover of SREBPs. Neither E-64-d nor LMB treatment changed the rate of turnover. A combination of ALLN and LMB did not enhance the effect of ALLN. These results reveal that the proteasome system, which can be inhibited by either ALLN or lactacystin, degrades the SREBPs and that the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway may be only a minor contributor to SREBP turnover. The membrane fractions were also prepared from the cells incubated with ALLN and/or 25-hydroxycholesterol for the final 5 h to figure out whether the precursors are substrates for the proteasome. Fig. 1B shows that the precursor SREBP levels are not affected by ALLN in the presence or absence of sterols, suggesting that major substrates for the proteasome are likely to be the nuclear SREBPs but not the precursor proteins. Although Fig. 1 shows that the proteasome might be involved in the turnover of the nuclear SREBPs, we cannot rule out the possibility that these inhibitors might slightly stabilize the precursor SREBPs on the ER membrane, resulting in an increase in nuclear forms. To further confirm the direct effects of proteasome inhibitors on the nuclear SREBPs, we assessed the fate of an exogenous nuclear form of SREBPs in CHO cell lines transiently expressing either a human nuclear form of SREBP-1 (amino acids 1–487, CHO-487) or SREBP-2 (amino acids 1–481, CHO-481). These cells constitutively express the lac repressor, thereby blocking the expression of exogenous SREBPs driven by the lac operator-containing promoter. The cells were cultured for 19 h with a medium containing sterols that eliminates the endogenous nuclear SREBPs and IPTG to induce the expression of human nuclear SREBPs. Preliminary Northern blot analysis for HMG-CoA synthase demonstrates that comparable levels of the SREBPs are expressed in stable cells by 1 mm IPTG treatment for CHO-487 and 3 mm for CHO-481. The effect of inhibitors added for the last 5 h on the fate of transiently expressed SREBPs was examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the nuclear forms of SREBPs were not detected in CHO-Lac cells expressing only thelac repressor. The exogenously expressed nuclear forms of both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were stabilized by the proteasome inhibitors, ALLN and lactacystin, but not by E-64-d or LMB, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1. These results strongly support the notion that the nuclear forms of SREBPs, which are released from the precursor proteins, are the substrates for the proteasome-dependent protein degradation. To ensure that LMB was active in the inhibition of nuclear export, we carried out a series of transfection experiments using COS1 cells. A fusion protein, GFP-Pap1, which is a fission yeast AP-1-like transcription factor, was normally localized in the cytoplasm but accumulated in the nucleus when CRM1 was inactivated with LMB (Fig.3), suggesting that LMB was active in the experiment. GFP-SREBP1a-(2–487) localized in the nucleus in the presence or absence of LMB or ALLN. SREBP-1 localization was not altered by ALLN treatment for 24 h (data not shown). To investigate the transcriptional activity of SREBPs stabilized by proteasome inhibitors, we carried out Northern blot analyses for SREBP-responsive genes such as HMG-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, and the LDL receptor. Cholesterol depletion significantly induced the mRNA level of these genes in HeLa cells, and proteasome inhibitor treatment further induced the level 2- to 2.5-fold, suggesting that the nuclear SREBPs stabilized by proteasome inhibitors are active as transcription factors in the nucleus (Fig.4). The induction of mRNA was not observed by treatment with E-64-d or LMB (data not shown). Our next question was whether the turnover of the nuclear SREBPs is controlled by sterols. It is possible that the degradation system might be working only when cells are depleted of sterols and that proteasome-dependent degradation does not occur in the absence of the nuclear SREBPs when cells are sterol-loaded. To address this question, we utilized a mutant CHO cell line, named M19, which lacks S2P (39Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijihawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), resulting in the absence of the nuclear SREBPs. The cells were transfected with an expression plasmid coding a nuclear form of human SREBP-1a (amino acids 2–487), pME-His-SREBP1a-(2–487), and turnover of exogenous SREBP-1 was examined. In these cells one can determine the half-life of exogenous nuclear SREBPs under either sterol-depleted or sterol-loaded conditions in the absence of the endogenous nuclear SREBPs. In the presence of a translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, the amount of SREBP-1 decreased in a time-dependent manner, and sterols had no effect on the turnover rate (Fig. 5). The intensity of the bands corresponding to β-actin in each lane is almost equal and is used for correction for loading differences. The calculated half-life of human nuclear SREBP-1a is approximately 3 h under either the sterol-depleted or sterol-loaded condition. Similar results were obtained when the cells were transfected with an expression plasmid coding His-tagged human nuclear SREBP-2 (amino acids 2–481) (data not shown). To determine if the nuclear SREBPs are polyubiquitinated as a substrate for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, we analyzed the conjugation of ubiquitin to nuclear SREBP-1. COS1 cells were transfected with pSREBP1-(1–487) plus an expression plasmid coding ubiquitin, pME-His-Ub, and synthesized nuclear SREBP-1 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against human SREBP-1. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was carried out using a monoclonal antibody against the His tag. Ubiquitin-SREBP conjugate ladders were observed when the cells expressed both SREBP-1 and ubiquitin (Fig. 6, lane 3), whereas these ladders were not detected under other conditions (lanes 1, 2, and 4). The recovery of SREBP-1 in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-SREBP-1 antibody (lanes 2,3, and 5 in the lower panelin Fig. 6). Nonspecific bands of around 62 kDa are observed in all lanes and are marked by an asterisk. The same results were obtained when COS1 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for SREBP-2-(1–481)(data not shown). These results indicate that the nuclear forms of SREBPs are polyubiquitinated. To verify that SREBP degradation is ubiquitin-dependent, we examined whether an overexpression of mutant ubiquitin is able to block it, bringing about an increase in the amounts of the nuclear SREBPs and mRNA of one of the responsive genes, HMG-CoA synthase. Fig.7A shows that mutant ubiquitin, defective in its ability to form polyubiquitin chains, increased the amount of HMG-CoA synthase mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration of mutant ubiquitin DNA (3 μg) both the nuclear SREBP-1 and -2 increased slightly (Fig. 7B). The same results were further observed when luciferase assays were performed using a reporter gene containing the promoter region of the human HMG-CoA synthase gene. Overexpression of mutant ubiquitin also enhances the luciferase activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8). These results show that blockage of polyubiquitination stabilizes the nuclear SREBPs, resulting in an up-regulation of the expression of the HMG-CoA synthase gene and that the conjugation of a polyubiquitin chain to the SREBPs may be what triggers their degradation.Figure 8Effect of the overexpression of mutant ubiquitin on the luciferase activities of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter-containing reporter gene. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated amount of pME-His-mutUb (mut Ub), 0.2 μg of the reporter gene, and 0.01 μg of pRL-CMV. After 48 h of culture, luciferase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Promoter activities in the absence of mutant ubiquitin are represented as 100%.

It is likely that the major substrates for this degradation are not the precursors of SREBPs but the proteolytically activated SREBPs containing the bHLH-Zip domain. It has been reported that most of the various kinds of nuclear proteins including transcription factors are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 16Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell.

Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that most transcription factors are labile and turnover rapidly after regulating the expression of target genes in the nucleus and that the SREBPs are an example of how these factors are subjected to this degradative regulatory pathway. It has been reported that HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, is degraded in a sterol-dependent manner and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved (40Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 41Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 279: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Another example of sterol-dependent proteolysis is the processing of SREBPs on the ER-Golgi membrane. These facts prompted us to examine whether the fate of nuclear SREBPs is also controlled by sterols. There would seem to be two reasonable hypotheses. The nuclear SREBPs, which are proteolytically generated in response to the intracellular sterol depletion, might be relatively stable in the nucleus, and hence able to induce the transcription of their responsive genes. On the other hand, the nuclear SREBPs might be rapidly degraded and hence lose their transcriptional activities when cells become loaded with sterols. In the current study we transfected M19 cells, defective in generation of the nuclear SREBPs because of the lack of S2P, with an expression plasmid for the nuclear SREBP-1a to determine the turnover rate of the exogenous SREBP-1a under either sterol-loaded or sterol-depleted conditions. The results we obtained show that the turnover rate of SREBPs is not affected by the intracellular sterol levels (Fig. 4), suggesting that the degradation system might be a constitutive process for most transcription factors rather than one that is sterol-mediated. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that both of the active forms of SREBP-1a and -2 contain one or more PEST sequences, sequences that are possessed by many short-lived proteins and that have been reported to be motifs for rapid degradation. The N-terminal transactivation domain of the SREBPs, which is rich in acidic amino acid residues, corresponds to a PEST sequence. In addition, only the active form of SREBP-1 has two more PEST sequences (amino acids 418–446 and 446–468) in the C-terminal region. It is not yet clear how these motifs are functionally related to ubiquitin-proteasome pathway degradation. The observation that the active SREBPs are polyubiquitinated suggests that regions containing one or more lysine residues conjugated with a polyubiquitin chain might be important for degradation. However, no lysine residues are conserved between SREBP-1a and -2 in the N-terminal or C-terminal PEST sequences. There are more than 10 conserved lysine residues located in, or close to, the bHLH-Zip motif in the SREBPs, and we are now investigating which, if any, of these lysine residues is ubiquitinated as well as the biological significance of the PEST sequences for SREBP degradation. Several studies have shown that nuclear export of the substrates is required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of nuclear proteins (25Tomoda K. Yukiko K. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 26Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that the SREBPs might be proteolyzed in the cytoplasm after nuclear export. When CRM1-dependent nuclear export was inhibited by treatment with LMB, the localization of a control protein bearing a nuclear export signal, Pap1, was affected, but neither the degradation nor localization of the SREBPs was changed (Fig. 3). These results raise the possibility that there is a CRM1-independent nuclear export of SREBPs that participates in degradation or that the degradation may occur in the nucleus. When COS1 cells were transfected with GFP-SREBP-1a and its fate followed in the presence of ALLN, the nucleus, not the cytoplasm, was stained even 24 h after treatment (data not shown). This would support the hypothesis that the degradation of SREBPs may not require their nuclear export but rather occurs in the nucleus. The validity of this hypothesis will be the subject of future studies. Ubiquitin is covalently attached in an isopeptide bond via its C-terminal carboxyl to the ε-amino group of specific lysine(s) in the substrate protein. It is thought that a polyubiquitin chain is formed mainly with lysine residue 48 in ubiquitin itself. To eliminate the attachment of ubiquitin to other lysine residues in a ubiquitin molecule, we introduced seven point mutations into ubiquitin (lysine to arginine substitutions). We observed that this mutant ubiquitin does not produce any high molecular weight conjugates observed in COS1 cells expressing both SREBP-1 and wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. 6 and data not shown). Overexpression of mutant ubiquitin in HeLa cells modestly increases the mRNA level for HMG-CoA synthase (Fig.7A) and the nuclear SREBPs (Fig. 7B), suggesting that polyubiquitin conjugation to the active SREBPs leads the substrates to degradation. Because the transfection efficiency of the expression plasmid for mutant ubiquitin does not attain 100%, and since the endogenous ubiquitin in the transfected HeLa cells is likely too abundant to be overcome by an exogenous mutant form, the 1.5-fold increase in the mRNA level (significantly less than the 2.5-fold increase observed in the cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors) might be in line with what should be expected. The luciferase assay with a reporter gene bearing the human HMG-CoA synthase promoter also reveals that the partial block of polyubiquitination by mutant ubiquitin may facilitate the activity of the active SREBPs (Fig. 8). It is notable that the SREBPs stabilized by proteasome inhibitors or mutant ubiquitin are able to stimulate the transcription of their responsive genes. We have not yet identified which SREBP form exerts transcriptional activity, the un-ubituitinated or monoubiquitinated form. It is also possible that proteasome inhibitors or mutant ubiquitin might induce other modifications of SREBPs such as acetylation or sumoylation, the latter being a modification by a ubiquitin-related protein, SUMO-1 (43Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 44Mattsson K. Pokrovskaja K. Kiss C. Klein G. Szekely L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported that both of these modifications also require a lysine residue and are able to regulate protein functions, including DNA binding activity (45Goodson M.L. Hong Y.

https://openalex.org/W1551859885,"We have examined the ability of the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase to correct errors in DNA sequence using single turnover kinetic methods. The rate of excision of single-stranded DNA ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 s−1, depending on the identity of the 3′-base. Excision of the 3′-terminal base from correctly base paired DNA occurred at a rate of 0.05 s−1, indicating that the cost of proofreading is minimal, as defined by the ratio of the kexo for correctly base-paired DNA divided by the rate of forward polymerization (0.05/37 = 0.14%). Excision of duplex DNA containing 1–7 mismatches was biphasic, and the rate and amplitude of the fast phase increased with the number of mismatches, reaching a maximum of 9 s−1. We showed that transfer of DNA from the polymerase to the exonuclease active site and back again occurs through an intramolecular reaction, allowing for a complete cycle of reactions for error correction. For DNA containing a buried mismatch (T:T followed by C:G base pairs), the 3′ base was removed at a rate of 3 s−1. The addition of nucleotide to the reaction that is identical to the 3′ base increased the rate of excision 7-fold to 21 s−1. We propose that the free nucleotide enhances the rate of transfer of the DNA to the exonuclease active site by interrupting the correct 3′ base pair through interaction with the template base. The exonuclease contribution to fidelity is minimal if the calculation is based on hydrolysis of a single mismatch: (kexo +kpol,over)/(kpol,over) = 10, but this value increases to ∼200 when examining error correction in the presence of nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2157204944,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2 (PGHSs) can oxygenate 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, albeit with varying efficiencies. Here we report the crystal structures of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 <i>n</i>-3) and linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 <i>n</i>-6) bound in the cyclooxygenase active site of Co<sup>3+</sup> protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted ovine PGHS-1 (Co<sup>3+</sup>-oPGHS-1) and compare the effects of active site substitutions on the rates of oxygenation of EPA, LA, and arachidonic acid (AA). Both EPA and LA bind in the active site with orientations similar to those seen previously with AA and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DHLA). For EPA, the presence of an additional double bond (C-17/C-18) causes this substrate to bind in a ""strained"" conformation in which C-13 is misaligned with respect to Tyr-385, the residue that abstracts hydrogen from substrate fatty acids. Presumably, this misalignment is responsible for the low rate of EPA oxygenation. For LA, the carboxyl half binds in a more extended configuration than AA, which results in positioning C-11 next to Tyr-385. Val-349 and Ser-530, recently identified as important determinants for efficient oxygenation of DHLA by PGHS-1, play similar roles in the oxygenation of EPA and LA. Approximately 750- and 175-fold reductions in the oxygenation efficiency of EPA and LA were observed with V349A oPGHS-1, compared with a 2-fold change for AA. Val-349 contacts C-2 and C-3 of EPA and C-4 of LA orienting the carboxyl halves of these substrates so that the ω-ends are aligned properly for hydrogen abstraction. An S530T substitution decreases the<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of EPA and LA by 375- and 140-fold. Ser-530 makes six contacts with EPA and four with LA involving C-8 through C-16; these interactions influence the alignment of the substrate for hydrogen abstraction. Interestingly, replacement of Phe-205 increases the volume of the cyclooxygenase site allowing EPA to be oxygenated more efficiently than with native oPGHS-1."

Rhodopsin provides high sensitivity, but the rod synaptic circuitry yields low spatial resolution. The red, green, and blue visual pigments define the three cone types, whose neural circuits mediate color vision and high spatial resolution but require bright light. Extensive anatomical, lineage, and birth dating studies have demonstrated that the genesis of specific photoreceptor types from retinal progenitors is guided by intrinsic genetic programs, inductive cell-cell interactions, and extrinsic factors (3Belliveau M.J.

However, only two transcription factors, NRL and CRX, have so far been implicated directly in modulating photoreceptor-specific gene expression. NRL was isolated from a subtracted human retinal cDNA library and encodes a basic motif-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein (21Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It displays strong homology to Maf proteins, which are involved in differentiation and gene regulation (22Blank V.

NRL was the first transcription factor shown to bind to a cis-regulatory sequence (called NRE or NRL response element) in the rhodopsin promoter and transactivate its activity in cultured cells (23Rehemtulla A.

To delineate further its biological function, we generated a polyclonal antibody against human NRL, characterized the retinal NRL protein, and localized it in fetal and adult human retinas. We show that multiple isoforms of NRL are generated by phosphorylation and are present in rod but not cone photoreceptor nuclei. We have also identified a novel cytosolic protein, p45, which cross-reacts with anti-NRL antibodies and is detected in neuronal tissues. Based on our data and the phenotype observed inNrl−/−mice, 2A. J. Mears, M. Kondo, P. K. Swain, Y. Takada, R. A. Bush, T. L. Saunders, P. A. Sieving, and A. Swaroop, submitted for publication. we hypothesize that NRL is required for differentiation and maintenance of the rod photoreceptors in mammalian retina. Adult human eyes (0–6 h post-mortem) were obtained from the University of Washington, Department of Ophthalmology and Lions Eye Bank (Seattle, WA) and the Ophthalmology Clinic, Strasbourg City Teaching Hospital (Strasbourg, France). Fetal human eyes (within 3 h post-mortem) were obtained from the University of Washington Human Embryology Laboratory. Adult human tissues were also procured from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). Retinas from patients with RP were obtained 5–9.5 h post-mortem from the Foundation Fighting Blindness (Hunt Valley, MD). Genetic defects in these RP donors were unknown. The studies followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and informed consent was obtained from the donors ante-mortem. The research was approved by the human subjects review boards at the participating institutions. The pGEX-NRL construct used for expressing NRL in Escherichia coli was generated by cloningXcmI-HindIII fragment of the human NRL cDNA (21Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), encoding the full-length protein (1–237 amino acids), in pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in-frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST). The eukaryotic expression plasmid, pED-NRL, was constructed by cloningXbaI- HindIII fragment of the human NRL cDNA in pED vector (36Bessant D.A. Payne A.M. Mitton K.P. Wang Q.L. Swain P.K. Plant C. Bird A.C. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Bhattacharya S.S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length NRL was expressed and purified as GST-NRL fusion protein in E. coli (BL21) as described earlier (28Mitton K.P. Swain P.K. Chen S. Xu S. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29794-29799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). GST-NRL was cleaved with thrombin (10 units/mg of protein) to separate NRL from the fusion protein. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed to confirm the identity of the purified NRL protein before raising polyclonal antibodies (pAb) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). NRL-immobilized membranes were used to affinity purify anti-NRL antibodies (called pAb-NRL). Retina and other tissues were sonicated in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 10 bovine retinas by published procedures (38Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma). Extracts were solubilized in 2× SDS lysis buffer by heating at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, and immunoblot analysis was performed according to standard protocols (39Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Sciences. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with the pED-NRL expression plasmid using the DEAE-dextran method, as described earlier (23Rehemtulla A. Warwar R. Kumar R. Ji X. Zack D.J. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). After 72 h, cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis. Transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips were processed for immunocytochemistry (40Yan D. Swain P.K. Breuer D. Tucker R.M. Wu W. Fujita R. Rehemtulla A. Burke D. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19656-19663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection with pED-NRL, the COS-1 cells were incubated for 1 h in either methionine- or phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The deficient medium was then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine or 200 μCi/ml33Pi and incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were washed in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and solubilized in RIPA buffer that included 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Retinal protein extracts (5 μg/μl) were incubated in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C and then for an additional 20 min at 30 °C after adding 20 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; Calbiochem). The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (39Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Sciences. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999Google Scholar). Primary cultures were established from post-mortem human retinas, as reported previously (41Gaudin C. Forster V. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2258-2268PubMed Google Scholar). For immunolabeling, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 15 min in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% NaN3). Coverslips were then double immunolabeled with combinations of either pAb-NRL and monoclonal (mAb) anti-rhodopsin (4D2; from Dr. R. Molday), or pAb-NRL and anti-cone mAb (7G6; from Dr. P. MacLeish) (42Wikler K.C. Rakic P. Bhattacharya N. Macleish P.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 377: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), at a final antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml for 3 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red for pAb and goat anti-mouse IgG-Bodipy fl for mAb) and DAPI (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 10 μg/ml for 1 h. Coverslips were washed thoroughly and viewed under differential interference and fluorescence optics with a Nikon Optiphot 2 microscope. Five normal adult human retinas and five fetal human retinas at 11, 15.4, 17.4, 19, and 21.5 fetal weeks were cryosectioned at 12 μm and processed for immunofluorescence (43Li Z.Y. Kljavin I.J. Milam A.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5429-5438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) were labeled with Cy-2 (green), Cy-3 (red), or Cy-5 (blue) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (red) (Molecular Probes). Control sections were treated in the same way without the primary antibody or with primary antibody adsorbed with a 50-fold excess of the NRL antigen. The rabbit pAb-NRL (1:1,000 dilution) was used with cell-specific monoclonal antibodies (4D2 at 1:40 dilution and 7G6 at 1:250) in double labeling experiments. Cone subtypes were identified by anti-blue cone opsin (JH455 at 1:5,000 dilution; from Dr. J. Nathans) and anti-red/green cone opsin (1:200 dilution; from Dr. J. Saari). Immunolabeled retinal sections were photographed with a Leica epifluorescence microscope or a Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal microscope. One eye of each pair from RP donors was fixed as above, embedded in JB-4 resin (Polysciences, Wilmington, DE), stained with Richardson's methylene blue/azure II mixture, and examined by light microscopy to determine which retinal areas contained cones but not rods. The opposite frozen eye of each pair was opened, and the retinal areas identified by light microscopy in the first eye were dissected for immunoblot analysis. Nrlgenomic sequence, derived from the 129SvJ mouse strain, was cloned in pPNT vector (44Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson P.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) to generate the targeting construct, in which the entire Nrl coding region was replaced with theneomycin resistance cassette. This construct was electroporated into R1 embryonic stem cells (45Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Rode J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Three targeted embryonic stem clones were microinjected into blastocysts. One resulting chimeric male transmitted the targeted allele to the offspring. Heterozygous offspring (Nrl+/−) were then interbred to generate the Nrl−/− mice. Detailed characterization of these mice is reported elsewhere.2 In both immunoblot and immunoprecipitation experiments, pAb-NRL specifically recognized the NRL protein expressed in E. coli (data not shown) and transiently transfected mammalian cells (Fig.1, lane 4). Immunoblot analysis of mammalian retinal extracts with pAb-NRL detected six proteins at 29–35 kDa, which migrated as a cluster, and a higher protein of 45 kDa (called p45) (Fig. 1). These bands were eliminated with preimmune serum or when pAb-NRL was preadsorbed with the antigen (data not shown). These proteins were also identified in Y79 and WERI human retinoblastoma cell lines but not in the kidney cell lines (293 and COS). The 29–35 kDa bands were not detected in any other human (see Fig. 1) or mouse (data not shown) tissue examined. However, p45 was observed in brain tissues (Fig.1). 3P. K. Swain and A. Swaroop, unpublished data. In COS cells transfected with the NRL expression construct, only the 29–35-kDa proteins, but not p45, were identified (Fig. 1). To determine if the multiple NRL bands result from post-translational modifications, the human and bovine retinal extracts were treated with different enzymes. CIAP treatment demonstrated a dramatic reduction in 29–35-kDa proteins with the appearance of a 28 kDa band, which constituted 75% of the total NRL immunoreactivity in the untreated sample (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern was observed with phosphatase treatment of extracts from NRL-transfected COS cells (data not shown). The p45 protein (in human retina or in partially purified bovine retinal extracts) remained unchanged by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2A). This also served as an internal control for nonspecific proteolytic degradation in the CIAP assay. To obtain direct evidence, radiolabeled COS cells transfected with pED-NRL were immunoprecipitated with pAb-NRL and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The NRL protein profile was identical in samples labeled with either [35S]methionine (Fig. 2B) or33Pi (Fig. 2C), suggesting that all NRL isoforms in transfected COS cells are phosphorylated (Fig. 2,B and C). Treatment of the immunoprecipitated33P-labeled NRL with CIAP abolished >90% of the radioactivity observed in 29–35 kDa protein bands (Fig.2D). To ascertain if various NRL-immunoreactive bands show differential subcellular localization, bovine retinal homogenate was subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The p45 protein was detectable only in the cytoplasmic and not in the nuclear fraction. The 29–35-kDa NRL isoforms were enriched in the nuclear fraction, and only some of the bands were present in the cytosol (Fig.3A). In sonicated bovine retinal extract, the 29–35-kDa isoforms were present in the soluble fraction and could be precipitated with 10–50% ammonium sulfate, whereas p45 remained insoluble in the pellet with most of the membrane proteins and could be extracted with the buffers containing non-ionic detergents (see Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and4). To identify NRL isoforms expressed in rodsversus cones, human retinas were obtained from post-mortem eyes of donors with RP, a disease that results initially in rod and later in cone degeneration (46Milam A.H. Li Z.H. Fariss R.N. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Depending on the donor age and genetic subtype, RP retina(s) show varying degree of rod and cone degeneration in peripheral and macular regions (46Milam A.H. Li Z.H. Fariss R.N. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Retinal areas that contained cones but not rods were identified by light microscopy, and corresponding areas were dissected from the opposite frozen eye for immunoblot analysis. Punches from the individual RP retinas were pooled separately. In RP retinas lacking rods, the 29–35-kDa NRL isoforms were undetectable, and the p45 band was reduced in the intensity compared with normal retinas (Fig. 3B). The absence of rods in these retinal punches could be correlated to the loss of 29–35-kDa isoforms. Cones and other retinal cells in RP retinal punches probably contributed to the residual level of the p45 protein (Fig.3B). To confirm the genesis of different NRL-immunoreactive proteins, we performed immunoblot analysis of the retinal extracts from theNrl−/− mice, where the complete Nrlcoding sequence was replaced by the neomycin cassette. A complete loss of the 29–35-kDa isoforms was evident in the homozygous null mouse retina and an equivalent reduction of expression in the heterozygous retina (Fig. 4). The p45 expression was unaltered in the retina and brain from theNrl−/− mice, establishing that theNrl gene does not encode p45. This protein apparently shares a common epitope with the NRL protein, resulting in the cross-reactivity of pAb-NRL in immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Previously,Nrl transcripts were identified in developing mouse retina and brain as early as embryonic day 12.5 (34Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar). However, because of possible sequence overlap of Nrl with the putativep45 gene we re-evaluated Nrl expression in developing mouse retina. By immunoblotting, the 29–35-kDa protein isoforms were detected at birth but increased significantly by postnatal day 3.5, whereas p45 was present at embryonic day 16.5 and did not show temporal changes in expression (Fig.5). Identical immunoblots detected the rhodopsin protein later (postnatal day 10) in development. In transfected COS-1 cells, NRL was localized primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 6). Untransfected cells in the same field or cells transfected with the empty vector DNA in a different well did not show any NRL-positive staining (Fig. 6). Deletion experiments revealed that the bZIP domain is required for efficient nuclear localization of NRL (data not shown). Primary cultures prepared from post-mortem adult human retinas contained large numbers of rod photoreceptors, as identified by anti-rhodopsin immunolabeling (Fig.7I, panel C). Every rhodopsin-positive rod cell had strong NRL immunoreactivity in the nucleus (Fig. 7I, panel D), whereas cones (identified by their expression of 7G6) revealed staining only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7II). Faint NRL immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of other cultured retinal neurons, but the retinal glia were unlabeled (Fig. 7I). Preadsorption of pAb-NRL with the antigen showed no labeling (data not shown). In adult human retinal sections, pAb-NRL labeled all rod nuclei, but cone nuclei were negative (Fig. 8,A, C, and D). Cone outer segments as well as rod and cone inner segments, somata, and synapses were also labeled (Fig. 8, A, C, and D). The cytoplasm of scattered cells in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers was weakly NRL-positive (Fig. 8A). Similar results were obtained with pig retinal sections (data not shown). Sections treated with antigen-adsorbed pAb-NRL showed no labeling (Fig.8B). Because of the steep developmental gradient in fetal retinas (8Hendrickson A.E. Eye. 1992; 6: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), sections cut along the horizontal meridian through the developing macula were studied. All fetal retinas showed a gradient of decreased NRL immunolabeling from the central to peripheral retina. NRL labeling was strongest in the outermost retinal cells near the retinal pigment epithelium (Fig. 8, E–G). In fetal week 11 retinal sections, the cones in the central retina could be identified by their rounded inner segments. Cone cytoplasm was labeled throughout with mAb 7G6 and pAb-NRL, but the cone nuclei were NRL-negative. Staining of adjacent sections revealed that a few of the central cones were also labeled with anti-blue cone opsin. By 15.4 fetal weeks, some cones labeled with anti-red/green cone opsin in the central retina also had cytoplasm that was positive for pAb-NRL. At 17.4, 19, and 21.5 fetal weeks, cones in the central retina were larger than the rods and lay outermost in the retina, adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium (Fig. 8, E and G). Throughout this developmental span, all human fetal cones had pAb-NRL-positive cytoplasm, but their nuclei were negative (Fig. 8, E–G). The differentiating rods were generally vitread to the cones and had smaller nuclei. In fetal weeks 17.4 and 19 central retina, only a few of the cells that stained positively for NRL in the nucleus were positive for rhodopsin (Fig. 8E). In the fetal week 19 peripheral retina, many cells in the developing outer nuclear layer had long, thin NRL-positive nuclei but were rhodopsin-negative (Fig. 8F). These cells may represent newly generated rods (or rod precursors) that had not yet begun to express rhodopsin. By 21.5 fetal weeks, more rods in the central retina had NRL-positive nuclei and rhodopsin-positive cell bodies (Fig. 8G). The manifestation of rod versus cone phenotype and function is dependent on the expression of a cell type-specific visual pigment and corresponding proteins of the transduction machinery. Postmitotic photoreceptor precursors exhibit a lengthy time delay of 5–14 days in mouse (10Morrow E.M. Belliveau M.J. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at least 1 month in primates (9Bumsted K. Jasoni C. Szel A. Hendrickson A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 378: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and up to 2 months in humans (47Xiao M. Hendrickson A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 425: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), before expressing the appropriate opsin. This delay appears to be necessary for achieving “the state of competence” and finalizing the decision to acquire a particular fate (3Belliveau M.J. Cepko C.L. Development. 1999; 126: 555-566PubMed Google Scholar, 6Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Here, we show that NRL, which is involved in regulating rhodopsin expression, is present in rod but not cone nuclei and is undetectable in RP retinas that lack rods. The temporal expression profile in developing retina, multiple phosphorylated isoforms, and specificity of expression suggest that NRL plays a role in rod differentiation. In the mammalian retina, the affinity-purified pAb raised against the human NRL protein (pAb-NRL) specifically detects seven protein bands (a cluster of six proteins from 29 to 35 kDa and p45). Of these, the 29–35-kDa proteins are identified in the retina but not in other human or mouse tissues examined. Several lines of evidence suggest that the 29–35-kDa proteins are generated from the NRL gene and are the product of post-translational modification and not alternative splicing or promoter usage. (i) All six protein bands are detected in COS cells transfected with the human NRL cDNA. (ii) Direct 33Pi labeling and alkaline phosphatase treatment demonstrate that the 29–35-kDa proteins are generated by phosphorylation. In retinal extracts, CIAP treatment produced a major protein species of about 28 kDa, close to the predicted molecular mass of the NRL protein. (iii) Deletion of the Nrlcoding region (exons 2 and 3) in the Nrl−/−mice abolished the 29–35-kDa proteins. Post-translational modifications can alter the activity of transcription factors and thereby regulate gene expression (48Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 49Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

A number of extracellular signals also exert their influence on cell behavior through protein modifications. Perhaps the most studied of these effectors are phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which can modulate transcriptional activity by altering nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and/or protein-protein interaction (50Hunter T.

Our data suggest that multiple NRL isoforms in the retina are the result of differential phosphorylation of distinct serine or threonine residues. Detection of identical isoforms in transfected COS cells indicates that although NRL is a rod-specific protein, its phosphorylation is mediated by widely expressed protein kinase(s). Site-directed mutagenesis of selected serine residues (e.g. serine 50, which is mutated in autosomal dominant RP; 36) can dramatically alter the pattern of phosphorylated NRL isoforms in transfected COS cells.3 However, the mutations in the NRL transactivation domain (including that of serine 50) do not affect its nuclear localization. Distinct NRL isoforms, phosphorylated at different sites, may exhibit varying degrees of interaction specificity with different proteins (e.g. CRX) during transcriptional activation of rod photoreceptor genes. We hypothesize that each phosphorylated isoform has a distinct function in rod gene regulation, as reported for the Mcm1 protein, a Drosophila homologue of the human serum response factor (53Kuo M.H. Nadeau E.T. Grayhack E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During these investigations, we identified a novel protein, p45, which cross-reacts with pAb-NRL but is not encoded by the NRLgene. This suggests that NRL and p45 share a common epitope. A recent search of the human genomic sequence data base revealed that a stretch of 56 residues within the NRL coding region shows >70% identity to two overlapping putative open reading frames of 368 and 428 amino acids (GenBank accession number AF276758; data not shown). Further investigations are needed to identify the gene that encodes p45, which appears to be expressed only in neuronal tissues.3 These results also suggest that the previously reported developmental expression profile of the NRL transcripts (34Liu Q. Ji X. Breitman M.L. Hitchcock P.F. Swaroop A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 207-211PubMed Google Scholar) may indeed represent a combined expression of the NRLand the p45 genes. Immunocytochemical studies of cultured retinal cells and fixed sections from human retina, together with immunoblotting of RP retinas, reveal that the 29–35-kDa NRL isoforms are present only in the rod nuclei. The labeling in the cytosol of cones and other neurons is the result of cross-reactivity of p45 with pAb-NRL. Immunoblot analysis of foveal and peripheral retinal punches from monkey retina is consistent with these studies (data not shown). Specific expression of NRL in developing and mature rods and its demonstrated role in rhodopsin regulation strongly argue in favor of an important function for NRL in rod development and maintenance. In developing mouse retina, Nrl expression precedes the appearance of known markers for differentiated rods and coincides with the birth of postmitotic rod precursors (6Livesey F.J. Cepko C.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 10Morrow E.M. Belliveau M.J. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Nrlis a critical determinant of rod cell fate as revealed by the studies of knockout mice,2 we propose that it is a bona fide marker for rod precursors during retinal differentiation. Isolation and characterization in vitro of NRL-expressing cells from developing retina should provide valuable insights into the molecular events leading to the rod phenotype and function.

We show here that Su(fu) is present in a complex with the oncogenic transcriptional activator β-catenin and functions as a negative regulator of T-cell factor (Tcf)-dependent transcription. Overexpression of Su(fu) in SW480 (APCmut) colon cancer cells in which β-catenin protein is stabilized leads to a reduction in nuclear β-catenin levels and in Tcf-dependent transcription.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A large multiprotein complex that includes APC1 and axin normally facilitates the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin binds to the F-box protein βTrCP and is then modified by ubiquitination and subjected to proteasome-mediated protein degradation. When cells are exposed to the Wnt signal, β-catenin phosphorylation and its subsequent ubiquitination are blocked. β-Catenin is thus diverted from the proteasome; instead, β-catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with members of the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors and activates transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. In tumors, β-catenin degradation is blocked by mutations of APC, axin, or β-catenin itself. As a result, stabilized β-catenin enters the nucleus and β-catenin·Tcf complexes activate oncogenic target genes. Nuclear translocation of β-catenin is of key importance in its ability to regulate transcription, yet little is known about the factors important in controlling the nuclear versuscytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin. β-Catenin lacks a nuclear import signal, and it docks to the nuclear membrane by a mechanism that is Ran-independent and does not require importins (5Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear import of β-catenin is also independent of its association with the Tcf transcription factors because mutant forms of β-catenin that do not bind Tcf proteins can enter the nucleus (6Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection studies show that β-catenin rapidly exits the nucleus, suggesting a role for nuclear export in the regulation of the intracellular distribution of β-catenin (7Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrate that APC is a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein with export from the nucleus inhibited by LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export (8Neufeld K.L. Nix D.A. Bogerd H. Kang Y. Beckerle M.C. Cullen B.R. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12085-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M.

CRM1, also called exportin-1, is an export karypopherin that binds to a leucine-rich nuclear export signal on its target protein and mediates nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins as well as RNA through the nuclear pore. LMB binds directly to CRM1 and inactivates its nuclear export activity (11Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulatory role of APC in β-catenin degradation, these studies suggest that APC promotes nuclear export of β-catenin (8Neufeld K.L. Nix D.A. Bogerd H. Kang Y. Beckerle M.C.

However, several recent studies demonstrate that β-catenin is exported from the nucleus in a CRM1- and Ran-independent manner (12Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. May 3, 2001; 276: 25883-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because the subcellular distribution of β-catenin is affected by many of its interacting proteins, it is possible that some of these β-catenin binding partners are regulated by CRM1-mediated nuclear export and that LMB treatment affects the nuclear localization of β-catenin indirectly. Genetic screens in Drosophila first identified Su(fu) as a suppressor of the Fused kinase, a positive regulator of Hh signaling (14Pham A. Therond P. Alves G. Tournier F.B. Busson D. Lamour-Isnard C. Bouchon B.L. Preat T. Tricoire H. Genetics. 1995; 140: 587-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that Su(fu) acts as a negative regulator of Hh signaling by directly interacting with the Ci/Gli zinc finger transcription factors, which are transducers of Hh signaling (15Monnier V. Dussillol F. Alves G. Lamour-Isnard C. Plessis A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pearse R.V., II Collier L.S. Scott M.P. Tabin C.J. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which Su(fu) functions remain unclear, Su(fu) is thought to control the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Gli/Ci transcription factors through direct protein-protein interactions (18Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S. Ye W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4437-4448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ding Q. Fukami S.

In mammalian cells, overexpression of Su(fu) causes Gli1 to be concentrated in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export by LMB treatment counteracts these effects of Su(fu) overexpression restoring the nuclear distribution of Gli1, thus suggesting that Su(fu) promotes CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Gli1 (20Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandtedt R. Toftgard B. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Here we report that Su(fu) and β-catenin are found in the same complex. In the human colon cancer SW480 cell line, overexpression of Su(fu) results in a reduction of nuclear β-catenin and Tcf-dependent transcription, suggesting that Su(fu) can act as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Studies with LMB treatment indicate that the ability of Su(fu) to regulate β-catenin is mediated by a CRM1-dependent nuclear export mechanism. We propose that Su(fu) can negatively regulate Wnt signaling by promoting nuclear export of β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that Su(fu) overexpression inhibits the growth of SW480 (APCmut) colon cancer cells in nude mice, suggesting a role for Su(fu) as a tumor suppresser. A plasmid encoding mouse Su(fu) was constructed by subcloning the open reading frame of mouse Su(fu) cDNA (19Ding Q. Fukami S. Meng X. Nishizaki Y. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Dlugosz A. Nakafuku M. Hui C.-C.

A Myc-tagged Su(fu) construct used for stable transformation studies was also generated in the pcDNA3 vector. Su(fu) deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subcloned into the pCMV5β vector with an amino-terminal Myc epitope tag. The stabilized β-catenin mutant (Mut-β-catenin) was generated using polymerase chain reaction mutatgenesis, converting the four serine or threonine phosphorylation sites (codons 33, 37, 41, and 45) to alanine using the full-length β-catenin gene (obtained from S. Hirohashi (21Shibata T Ochiai A. Kanai Y. Akimoto S. Gotoh M. Yasui N. Machinami R. Hirohashi S. Oncogene. 1999; 13: 883-889Google Scholar)), and was subcloned into the pCMV5β vector. All polymerase chain reaction-generated constructs were verified by sequencing. The GluGlu-tagged ΔN89-β-catenin (obtained from P. Polakis) was subcloned into the pCMV5β vector, and the wild type APC gene in a CMV vector (obtained from B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler (22Kinzler K.W. Nilbert M.C. Vogelstein B. Bryan T.M. Levy D.B.

Human 293T cells (kidney epithelial cell line) were passaged to 50% confluence, and transfection was carried out with DNA using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection. Lysates were prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-β-catenin antibody, anti-GluGlu antibody, anti-Myc antibody, or anti-HA antibody, and protein G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western analysis was performed using the indicated primary and corresponding secondary horseradish peroxidiase-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The β-catenin antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratory; the Su(fu) antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthesized peptide fragment from amino acid residues 440–457 of mSu(fu); the anti-GluGlu and anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Babco; and the anti-Myc antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation of native proteins was also performed using lysates from the SW480 colon cancer cell line in an identical manner. Cells plated on 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected in triplicate with 1 µg of the luciferase reporter construct pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH (23Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar). In addition, some cell dishes were also co-transfected with 1 µg of ΔN89-β-catenin, 1 µg of mutant β-catenin, 1 µg of the full-length APC gene, or empty vector controls. Where indicated, some of the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml LMB (obtained from M. Yoshida) for 90 min or 16 h before measuring Tcf transcriptional activation. Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions, and in all cases, a Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase expression vector was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase enzyme activity was measured using a luminometer, and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. A ratio of the normalized pTOPFLASH/pFOPFLASH luminescence was calculated for each cell dish. The means and standard deviations, determined for each cell type and transfection condition, were compared using the two-way t test. SW480 cells were transfected with or without appropriate expression constructs. Where indicated, 20 ng/ml LMB was added to the cells 90 min or 16 h before harvesting. After transfection with Myc-Su(fu) in a pcDNA3 expression vector, stable SW480 transformants were isolated after 8 days of G418 selection. The clones were then expanded and analyzed for Myc-Su(fu) expression using Western blot analysis. Two clones, clone 2 and clone 7, were used for this study; clone 7 expresses Myc-Su(fu) at a level about 5-fold higher than clone 2. The cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized in methanol for 2 min. Endogenous β-catenin was detected by monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratory) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Myc-Su(fu) and its mutants were detected by polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For fluorescence microscopy, a Zeiss confocal microscope was used. Nuclei were isolated from cell cultures using a process of freezing, thawing, and lysing as reported by Wood and Earnshaw (24Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Western analysis for β-catenin, actin, and histone was perfomed on the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as previously reported (25Alman B.A. Li C. Pajerski M.E. Diaz-Cano S. Wolfe H.J. Am J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 329-334PubMed Google Scholar). The β-catenin protein levels in the cytoplasmic or nuclear fraction were compared between cultures by normalizing the β-catenin level to tubulin or nuclear histone protein level. SW480 cells, SW480 cells expressing Su(fu) at a low level (clone 2), and SW480 cells expressing Su(fu) at a high level (clone 7) were used to produce xenograft tumors in nude mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). One million cells from each cell type were injected into a separate subcutaneous location on the dorsum of the proximal hind limbs. Ten injection sites (five mice, two injection sites for each cell type in each mouse) for each cell type were analyzed. The size of the tumor was assessed by a blinded observer on a weekly basis. To determine whether Su(fu) interacts with β-catenin, epitope-tagged Su(fu) was transiently expressed, either alone or in combination with a stabilized form of β-catenin (ΔN89-β-catenin, which lacks the first 89 amino acid residues important for protein degradation (26Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfield B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, Myc-tagged Su(fu) co-precipitates with endogenous β-catenin (lane 7) as well as GluGlu-tagged ΔN89-β-catenin (lane 11), when Myc-tagged Su(fu) is immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. Conversely, Myc-Su(fu) is also present in the immunocomplex of β-catenin precipitated with either an anti-β-catenin or anti-GluGlu antibody (data not shown). Interactions between endogenous Su(fu) and β-catenin were also verified using a polyclonal antibody raised against Su(fu) in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in 293 cells (Fig. 1, lane 5) and the human colon cancer SW480 cell (data not shown). These results show that Su(fu) interacts with β-catenin and that this interaction occurs in the absence of the first 89 amino acids of β-catenin, which have previously been shown to be required for binding of the F-box protein, βTrCP. In response to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it regulates transcription of Wnt-responsive genesvia interactions with the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors. To determine whether Su(fu)-β-catenin interactions have any effects on the transcriptional function of β-catenin, a Tcf-luciferase reporter assay was employed. Tcf-dependent transcriptional activation was measured using the pTOPFLASH (luciferase reporter with optimized Tcf-binding sites) and pFOPFLASH (luciferase reporter with mutant Tcf-binding sites) constructs in transient expression assays (23Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, where endogenous β-catenin levels are low, only weak Tcf-dependent transcriptional activation was detected (Fig. 2). Expression of either of the stabilized forms of β-catenin (either ΔN89-β-catenin or Mut-β-catenin) in these cells resulted in a 2–3× increase in Tcf-dependent transcription, whereas Su(fu) itself had no obvious effects. Co-expression of Su(fu) with either of the stabilized forms of β-catenin resulted in a slight but significant reduction of Tcf-dependent transcription. The inhibition of Tcf-dependent transcription by Su(fu) is weaker than that by APC but is comparable with the level of inhibition as reported in several β-catenin-interacting proteins, such as duplin, pontin52, and reptin52 (27Bauer A. Chauvet S. Huber O. Usseglio F. Rothbacher U. Aragnol D. Kemler R. Pradel J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6121-6130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sakamoto I Kishida S. Fukui A. Kishida M. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Michiue T. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32871-32878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations suggests that Su(fu)-β-catenin interactions result in a down-regulation of Tcf-dependent transcription. To further investigate the action of Su(fu) on Tcf-dependent transcription and β-catenin levels, we studied the human colon cancer cell line SW480, which exhibits elevated levels of β-catenin because of a truncating mutation inAPC (29Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of β-catenin in SW480 cells was examined by confocal microscopy. In SW480 cells, high levels of β-catenin were found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Strikingly, SW480 cells overexpressing Su(fu) showed a drastic reduction of nuclear staining of β-catenin (Fig.3, A–C). This result suggests that Su(fu) overexpression reduces nuclear β-catenin levels, which lead to a down-regulation of Tcf-dependent transcription. The effect of Su(fu) on the regulation of nuclear β-catenin was examined by using several Su(fu) deletion mutants. In SW480 cells, wild type Su(fu) was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 3 B), whereas, in contrast, Su(fu) mutants with carboxyl-terminal deletions showed significant nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3, E andH). Interestingly, these Su(fu) mutants have lost the ability to reduce nuclear β-catenin level (Fig. 3, F andI) and to down-regulate Tcf-dependent transcription (Fig. 3m). In contrast, a Su(fu) mutant lacking only the amino-terminal region has activities similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 3, L and M). Although these mutant proteins exhibit distinct activities, they all retain their ability to form a complex with β-catenin as assayed by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of Su(fu) is required for reduction of nuclear β-catenin levels and thus down-regulation of Tcf-dependent transcription. Because APC is mutated in SW480 cells, we were intrigued by the possibility that Su(fu) might regulate the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin level in an APC-independent manner. To address this, we treated transiently transfected SW480 cells with LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export (11Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Strikingly, LMB treatment restored a high level of β-catenin staining in the nucleus of Su(fu)-overexpressing cells, suggesting that the reduction of nuclear β-catenin level is mediated through a CRM1-mediated nuclear export mechanism (Fig. 4, B–D andF–H). To further examine the CRM1-dependence of Su(fu) function, stable SW480 transformants overexpressing Su(fu) were established. As in our transient expression studies, Su(fu) overexpression resulted in a reduction of nuclear β-catenin levels (Fig. 4, J–L, and data not shown) and down-regulation of Tcf-dependent transcription in the stable transformants (Fig. 4 Q). LMB treatment counteracted the effects of Su(fu) overexpression in these SW480 transformants (Fig. 4, N–Q, and data not shown). Similar results were observed in cells with LMB treatment for 90 min or 16 h. The subcellular distribution of Su(fu) itself is regulated by nuclear export, as Su(fu) could readily be detected in the nucleus of LMB-treated cells, suggesting that it is transiently present in the nucleus and actively exported (Fig. 4, G andO). These results suggest that the subcellular location of Su(fu) regulates β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcription. To determine the subcellular distribution of β-catenin in a more quantitative manner, we examined protein levels in cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions using Western analysis. Extracts from SW480 cells and SW480 cells expressing Su(fu) (clone 7) with or without LMB treatment were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. The purity of the fractions was determined by Western analysis using actin and histone as markers for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Consistent with the results of confocal microscopy studies, SW480 cells with Su(fu) overexpression had a lower level of nuclear β-catenin, and LMB treatment increased the level of nuclear β-catenin in these cells to those of the parental SW480 cells (Fig. 4 R). Together, these results indicate that Su(fu) reduces nuclear β-catenin levels through a CRM1-dependent nuclear export mechanism. Because Su(fu) can promote nuclear export of β-catenin in the absence of normal APC function, we compared the effects of APC overexpression versus Su(fu) overexpression in SW480 cells (Fig. 5). In SW480 cells, APC overexpression resulted in a drastic reduction of Tcf-dependent transcription, whereas the inhibitory effect of Su(fu) overexpression was significantly less pronounced (Fig.5 A). Consistent with the notion that Tcf-dependent transcription is regulated by the level of nuclear β-catenin, a low level of β-catenin was found in Su(fu)-expressing cells (Fig. 5, B–D), whereas very little or no β-catenin staining could be detected in APC-expressing cells (Fig. 5, H–J). Since we demonstrated that reduction of nuclear β-catenin level by Su(fu) overexpression was abolished by treating the cells with LMB (Fig. 5, E–G), we examined the consequences of simultaneous overexpression of APC and Su(fu) in SW480 cells. The effects were additive, with APC and Su(fu) expression resulting in an almost complete elimination of β-catenin (Fig. 5, O–Q). After LMB treatment, β-catenin remained undetectable in the nucleus of the APC- and Su(fu)-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, S–U), suggesting that the role of APC in promoting β-catenin protein degradation is dominant over that of Su(fu). In this case, β-catenin is mostly degraded in the cytoplasm through the action of wild type APC, and very little β-catenin can be translocated to the nucleus. These results are consistent with the notion that Su(fu) acts to regulate the activity and localization of β-catenin after nuclear translocation of β-catenin. To determine whether Su(fu) alters the oncogenic function of β-catenin, the size of xenograft tumors formed after subcutaneous injection of SW480 cells into nude mice was compared using SW480 cells with or without overexpression of Su(fu). As shown in Fig.6, Su(fu) overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of growth of these tumors. There was also a correlation between the level of Su(fu) expression and the effect on tumor growth; Clone 7, which expresses higher levels of Su(fu), showed less tumor growth than clone 2, which has lower Su(fu) expression. These results indicate that Su(fu) overexpression can suppress the oncogenic functions of β-catenin. We have shown that Su(fu) and β-catenin reside in the same complex and that Su(fu) negatively regulates Tcf-dependent transcription by reducing nuclear β-catenin levels. These inhibitory activities of Su(fu) are sensitive to LMB treatment indicating that the reduction of nuclear β-catenin is accomplished through a CRM1-mediated nuclear export mechanism. Interestingly, although APC is implicated in both nuclear export and cytoplasmic degradation of β-catenin, Su(fu) promotes β-catenin nuclear export in SW480 cells, which lack normal APC function. Thus, our results indicate that Su(fu) regulates Wnt signaling through APC-independent mechanism in which CRM1-mediated nuclear export plays a role. We also showed that the action of APC is dominant over that of Su(fu); LMB treatment failed to block the reduction of nuclear β-catenin level in cells overexpressing both APC and Su(fu) (see Fig. 5). In normal cells, once β-catenin is synthesized in the cytoplasm, it will be targeted for degradation by the destruction complex; this targeting involves APC, axin, and GSK3β (1Waltzer L. Bienz M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 3Kikuchi A. Biochem.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although a role for Su(fu) in the cytoplasmic compartment cannot be excluded, our results suggest that the major role of Su(fu) is after nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In APC-overexpressing SW480 cells, because most β-catenin will be degraded in the cytoplasm, and very little β-catenin is imported into the nucleus; the role of Su(fu) in β-catenin signaling thus becomes minimal. The accumulation of Su(fu) in the nucleus of LMB-treated cells suggests that the intracellular distribution of Su(fu) itself is regulated by CRM1-mediated nuclear export. We propose that there is a nuclear-cytoplasmic exchange of Su(fu) itself and that Su(fu) interacts with β-catenin in the nucleus, facilitates the nuclear export of β-catenin, and eventually leads to a down-regulation of β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcription. Because mutant forms of Su(fu) lacking the carboxyl-terminal region are enriched in the nucleus, this carboxyl-terminal region may be essential for the efficient nuclear export of Su(fu). Elevated β-catenin-mediated transcription in this case indicates that either these same regions of Su(fu) are important for the ability of Su(fu) to regulate β-catenin mediated transcription or that nuclear export of Su(fu) is necessary for it to reduce nuclear β-catenin levels. In this latter possibility, Su(fu) might act in a complex to export β-catenin from the nucleus. What is the role of Su(fu) in β-catenin signaling in vivo? Numerous studies have suggested that nuclear localization of β-catenin is a key step in Wnt signaling and that the intracellular localization of β-catenin is controlled by the availability and affinity of its binding partners (1Waltzer L. Bienz M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 3Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We propose that Su(fu) is one of these binding partners and that Su(fu) functions to control the level of nuclear β-catenin in cells receiving Wnt signals. As β-catenin signaling is over-activated in many benign and malignant tumors, Su(fu) would thus be expected to act as a tumor suppressor. Consistent with this notion, we find that overexpression of Su(fu) in SW480 cells suppresses tumor growth in nude mice. It will now be important to examine whether inactivating mutations of Su(fu) are found in tumors with activated β-catenin signaling. The primary focus here has been on the role of Su(fu) in β-catenin signaling. However, it is also clear that Su(fu) acts as a negative regulator of Hh signaling in both flies and mammals. Several studies have suggested that Su(fu) might possess multiple functions controlling the activities of Ci/Gli transcription factors, including cytoplasmic sequestration (17Murone M. Luoh S.M.

Biol. 1999; 212: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The present study has revealed a novel role for Su(fu) in the regulation of β-catenin signaling through CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Because Ci/Gli transcription factors possess nuclear export signals and LMB treatment has been shown to increase nuclear localization of Ci in Drosophila (33Chen C.-H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and to inhibit cytoplasmic sequestration of Gli1 (20Kogerman P. Grimm T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we propose that Su(fu) also regulates the activity of β-catenin and Ci/Gli transcription factors through a similar CRM1-mediated mechanism. In both cases, it is possible that Su(fu) acts to regulate the nuclear location of these transcriptional regulators through an export-related mechanism. Finally, the observation that Su(fu) is involved in the regulation of β-catenin signaling provides further evidence that multiple levels of cross-talk exist between Wnt and Hh signaling during development and cancer. In Drosophila, the F-box protein and β-TrCP homolog, Slimb, is known to regulate the degradation of Armadillo (β-catenin homolog) and Ci (34Jiang J. Struhl G.

All 32 exons and adjacent regions of the MRP2 gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Two novel mutations were identified in exon 25. One mutation, 3517A→T, predicting a I1173F substitution, was found in 22 homozygous Iranian Jewish DJS patients from 13 unrelated families and a second mutation, 3449G→A, predicting a R1150H substitution, was found in 5 homozygous Moroccan Jewish DJS patients from 4 unrelated families. Use of four intragenic dimorphisms and haplotype analyses disclosed a specific founder effect for each mutation. The mutations were introduced into an MRP2 expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected into HEK-293 cells, and analyzed by a fluorescence transport assay, immunoblot, and immunocytochemistry. Continuous measurement of probenecid-sensitive carboxyfluorescein efflux revealed that both mutations impaired the transport activity of MRP2. Immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry showed that MRP2 (R1150H) matured properly and localized at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. In contrast, expression of MRP2 (I1173F) was low and mislocated to the endoplasmic reticulum of the transfected cells.

PCR fragments were sequenced either directly or after subcloning into pGEM-T vector using pGEM-T vector System (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformation into JM109-competent cells (Promega). Plasmid DNA was isolated using Wizard™ Plus Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega). Sequencing was carried out in an automatic sequencer (ABI Prism 377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following identification of mutations and intragenic polymorphisms by sequence alterations, methods for their easy detection were designed using amplified DNA segments and restriction analyses. Amplified DNA segments were digested by 5U of the respective enzymes (EcoRV, BsaHI,BbsI, BsaBI, Psp1406I, andNlaIII) and the products were separated on 3–4% agarose or metaphor gels (FMC-Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). Allele frequencies for identified mutations and polymorphisms were determined in patients with DJS and in control populations. Haplotypes of informative alleles from patients with DJS and controls were determined. Assessments of founder haplotypes were based on χ2 analysis. Mutations were introduced into the pcDNA3.1/MRP2 vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Incorporation of the mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Two sets of primers were used to introduce the I1173F mutation:1) the forward primer (5′-CAGGTTTGCCAGTTTTCCGTGCCTTTGAGC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCTCAAAGGCACGGAAAACTGGCAAACCTG-3′); 2) the forward primer (5′-CCGTATCAGGTTTGCCAGTTTTCCGTGCCTTTGAGC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GCTCAAAGGCACGGAAAACTGGCAAACCTGATACGG-3′). This was done to ensure that low expression of this construct was not due to unexpected interference in any region of the vector except for the desired mutation. The primers used to introduce the R1150H mutation are the forward primer (5′-GCCAGCTGAGGCATCTGGACTCTGTCACCAG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTGGTGACAGAGTCCAGATGCCTCAGCTGGC-3′). All procedures were as suggested by the manufacturer. Positive clones were selected on ampicillin agar plates and all clones were verified by sequencing. At least three clones of each mutant were analyzed for activity, and all six clones of the I1173F mutant were analyzed for expression by Western blot. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The expression vectors containing WT or the mutated MRP2 were transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Cells were used 48–72 h after transfection. For stable expression, cells were selected with 1000 μg/ml G418. HEK-293 cells were plated on a sterile 22 × 22-mm coverslips. On the following day, WT or mutant MRP2 plasmids and GFP-expressing plasmid were co-transfected into the cells. 48–72 h after transfection, coverslips with cells attached to them were washed once with a Hepes-buffered solution and assembled to form the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The Hepes-buffered solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCL, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH, osmolarity 310 with NaCl). GFP-expressing cells were identified by viewing GFP fluorescence and one cell was selected. GFP fluorescence intensity was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and used to normalize MRP2 expression in different experiments. Subsequently, cells were loaded with carboxyfluorescein (CF) by a 10-min incubation at room temperature in Hepes-buffered solution containing 100 μm carboxyfluorescein diacetate and 1.5 mm probenecid. CF fluorescence was continuously monitored, and after it exceeded GFP fluorescence by at least 10-fold, the cells were perfused with Hepes-buffered solution containing 1.5 mm probenecid to establish a base line. Since inhibition by probenecid is completely reversible, transport of CF by MRP2 was initiated by removing probenecid from the perfusate. CF fluorescence was measured from single cells at excitation wavelengths of 490 and 440 nm using the recording setup from PTI (PTI Delta Ram, Brunswick, NJ). Since the fluorescence at the excitation wavelength of 440 nm is the isosbestic point for pH sensitivity of CF, fluorescence recorded at 440 nm was used to evaluate CF efflux. The fluorescence recorded at 490 nm was used to follow intracellular pH during the experiment to verify that the observed effect was not secondary to changes in pHi. HEK-293 cells, transiently or stably transfected with WT or mutant MRP2, were disrupted in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The clarified supernatant was recovered, and protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Between 13 and 55 μg of protein was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm Trizma base, 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with a 1:100 dilution of M2III-6 antibody in 5% skim milk in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm Trizma base, 0.1% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) at a 1:1000 dilution was used as a secondary antibody, and the signal was detected using ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). For PNGase F digestion assay, samples (25 μl) were incubated with 1000 units of PNGase F for 2 h at 37 °C before separation and probing as above. Stable or transiently transfected HEK-293 cells cultured on 12-mm glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking serum (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatinin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 5% normal goat serum in PBS). The cells were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the M2III-6 antibody diluted 1:20 in the blocking serum, washed with PBS, and reincubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA; dilution 1:100 in the blocking serum). The cells were than mounted on glass slides and examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). Screening of all 32 exons of the MRP2 gene in an Iranian Jewish patient disclosed a 3517A→T transition in exon 25, predicting an I1173F substitution. The mutation was detectable by restriction analysis of nested PCR performed as follows. First, exon 25 was amplified by the forward and reverse primers depicted in TableI, and then nested PCR was carried out using a mutated forward primer (5′-ACCGTATCAGGTTTGCCAGAT-3′) that created with the reverse primer an EcoRV restriction site in the normal sequence of exon 25. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRV and its products analyzed by 4% metaphor gel electrophoresis (Fig.1A). All 22 Iranian Jewish patients were homozygous for the 3517A→T mutation, 2 affected siblings of mixed Iranian and Moroccan Jewish origin were heterozygous, and 11 non-Iranian Jewish patients did not bear this mutation. In the general Iranian Jewish population, heterozygosity for this mutation was observed in 14/243 subjects examined (5.8%), whereas none of 164 Moroccan Jews and 108 Ashkenazi Jews carried this mutation. The estimated allele frequency of the mutation in the general Iranian Jewish population was 2.9% (95% confidence interval of 1.6–4.8%) (Table II).Table IIAllele frequencies of the 3517A →T and the 3449G→A mutations and of the 4 polymorphisms in the MRP2 gene in Iranian, Moroccan, and Ashkenazi JewsEthnic groupMutationsPolymorphismsExon 25 3517A→TExon 25 3449G→A5′-Untranslated region −24C→TExon 7 842G→AExon 10 1249G→AIntron 29 IVS −35G→AAlleleFrequencyAlleleFrequencyAlleleFrequencyAlleleFrequencyAlleleFrequencyAlleleFrequency%%%%%%Iranian JewsT2.9A0T12.3A0.6A31.2A5.4A97.1G100C87.7G99.4G68.8G94.6(n = 486)2-an, number of alleles examined.(n = 312)(n = 228)(n = 336)(n = 202)(n = 280)Moroccan JewsT0A0.9T26.1A5.6A18.4A5.9A100G99.1C73.9G94.4G81.6G94.1(n = 328)(n = 452)(n = 284)(n = 284)(n = 222)(n = 238)Ashkenazi JewsT0A0T21.9A0.9A18.3A3.5A100G100C78.1G99.1G81.7G96.5(n = 216)(n = 312)(n = 224)(n = 222)(n = 180)(n = 286)2-a n, number of alleles examined. Open table in a new tab A different mutation in the MRP2 gene, a 3449G→A transition in exon 25, was identified in a Moroccan Jewish patient. The mutation predicts an R1150H substitution and results in loss of a BsaHI restriction site. For detection of this mutation, exon 25 was amplified by the primers depicted in Table I, then digested with BsaHI (New England Biolabs) and the products analyzed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). All 5 Moroccan Jewish patients were homozygous for the 3449G→A mutation, whereas none of the 28 non-Moroccan patients carried it. The 2 affected siblings of the mixed Moroccan and Iranian Jewish origin were heterozygous for the mutation, and were thus compound heterozygotes for the 3449G→A and the 3517A→T mutations (Fig. 1C). The mother of these siblings of Moroccan Jewish origin was heterozygous for the 3449G→A mutation, and the father, of Iranian Jewish origin, was heterozygous for the 3517A→T mutation. In the general Moroccan Jewish population, heterozygosity for the 3449G→A mutation was observed in 4/226 subjects examined (1.8%), whereas none of 156 Iranian Jews and 156 Ashkenazi Jews carried this mutation. The estimated allele frequency of the mutation in the general Moroccan Jewish population was 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.24–2.27%) (Table II). Four dimorphisms in the MRP2 gene were identified: 1) −24C→T in the 5′-untranslated region, 2) 842G→A in exon 7 predicting a S281N substitution, 3) 1249G→A in exon 10 predicting a V417I substitution, and 4) IVS29–35G→A. 842G→A and IVS29–35G → A are novel polymorphisms, whereas −24C→T and 1249G→A were recently published (40Ito S. Ieiri I. Tanabe M. Suzuki A. Higuchi S. Otsubo K. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Methods were devised for simple detection of these four polymorphisms by PCR and restriction analysis (Fig.2). Table II shows the allele frequencies of the four dimorphisms in Iranian, Moroccan, and Ashkenazi Jews. A pronounced difference was observed for the rare 842G→A dimorphism; in Moroccan Jews, its frequency was 6-fold higher than in Ashkenazi Jews and 9-fold higher than in Iranian Jews. Haplotype analysis disclosed that all 26 alleles of 13 unrelated Iranian Jewish patients carried the same haplotype (−24C, 842G, 1249A, IVS29–35A), whereas none of 144 informative alleles (out of 168 examined) of control Iranian Jews carried the same haplotype (Table III). The common haplotype among Iranian Jewish controls was −24C, 842G, 1249G, IVS29–35G; it accounted for 63% of the alleles. Statistical analysis yielded highly significant differences in the haplotype distribution between patients and controls (χ2 = 271, p < 0.0001).Table IIIFrequency of haplotypes in Iranian Jewish and Moroccan Jewish controls and DJS patientsHaplotype5′-Untranslated region −24C→TExon 7 842G→AExon 10 1249G→AIVS29–35 G→AFrequency in Iranian Jews3-an indicates number of informative alleles of unrelated individ"

Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar).We reported recently that in VSMC, cPLA2-catalyzed arachidonic acid release induced by NE or angiotensin II is significantly reduced by the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 and by an antisense oligonucleotide that decreases CaM kinase II expression (3Muthalif M.M.

J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 388-398PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that activation of MAP kinase in VSMC also occurs in response to NE and angiotensin II. Antisense oligonucleotide directed against CaM kinase II and the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 reduced MAP kinase activation by ∼50%, whereas agents that decrease MAP kinase activity (antisense oligonucleotides directed against MAP kinase and a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor) have no effect on CaM kinase II activation (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CaM kinase II acts upstream of MAP kinase in NE-stimulated VSMC (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although CaM kinase II seems to be the major activator of cPLA2 in these cells (as measured by arachidonic acid release as noted above), MAP kinase may partially contribute to the activation of cPLA2, because antisense oligonucleotides against this kinase, as well as a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, reduce arachidonic acid release by ∼30% (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This signaling between CaM kinase II and cPLA2 activation and MAP kinase activation may involve oxygenated metabolites of cPLA2-released arachidonic acid, because pharmacological inhibition of cytochrome P450 and 12- and 15-lipoxygenase reduce NE- and angiotensin II-stimulated MAP kinase activity to near basal level (cyclooxygenase inhibitors were without effect) (4Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Based on all of this evidence, it has been proposed that CaM kinase II activation in VSMC in response to NE and angiotensin II leads to cPLA2activation. cPLA2-catalyzed arachidonic acid release may fuel an amplification of this response by providing fatty acid precursor to oxygenating enzymes for the production of mediators, including 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, that activate MAP kinase (4Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The latter could cause additional activation of cPLA2.In the current study, we set out to explore the possibility that CaM kinase II phosphorylates cPLA2 directly, leading to its activation and arachidonic acid release in rabbit and human VSMC stimulated with the physiological agonist NE. By using rigorous protein chemical techniques, we provide strong evidence to suggest that CaM kinase II is the major kinase that activates cPLA2 in these cells and that cPLA2 phosphorylation occurs on a novel site (Ser-515).DISCUSSIONCollectively, the data in this study indicate that CaM kinase II phosphorylates and activates cPLA2 both in vitroand in NE-stimulated rabbit and human VSMC. CaM kinase II interacts directly with cPLA2 and phosphorylates it at a single site, Ser-515. This phosphorylation leads to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cPLA2 enzymatic activity measured with an in vitro assay. Several laboratories have reported that phosphorylation of cPLA2 on Ser-505 by MAP kinases also leads to a 2- to 3-fold increase in cPLA2 enzymatic activity (15Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).In platelets, HeLa cells, and CHO cells, cPLA2 is phosphorylated by members of the MAP kinase family on Ser-505. Phosphorylation of cPLA2 also occurs on Ser-727 in these cells and is dependent on a protein kinase that is activated by the MAP kinase family member (23Hefner Y. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Murakami M. Wilde J.I. Pasquet S. Schieltz D. Ghomashchi F. Yates J.R. Armstrong C.G. Paterson A. Cohen P. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Kudo I. Watson S.P. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37542-37551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This explains why suppression of both Ser-505 and Ser-727 phosphorylation is seen when platelets, HeLa cells, and CHO cells are treated with inhibitors of the MAP kinases. In NE-stimulated VSMC, Ser-505 phosphorylation was not detected. This is based on the fact that cPLA2 radiophosphorylated on Ser-505 by MAP kinase treatment in vitro gives rise to a chymotryptic peptide that elutes from the HPLC column at 75 min, and no corresponding peak could be detected in the HPLC trace of the chymotrypsin digest of cPLA2 isolated from NE-stimulated, radiolabeled human VSMC (Fig. 4). Ser-727 cPLA2phosphorylation was also not detected following HPLC analysis of the trypsin digest of cPLA2 isolated from NE-stimulated, radiolabeled human VSMC (not shown). This was expected based on the lack of observation of Ser-505 phosphorylation, because Ser-505 and Ser-727 phosphorylation are linked as noted above.In our previous studies we have shown that antisense suppression of CaM kinase II or addition of the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 completely suppresses NE-induced arachidonic acid release in rabbit VSMC (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MAP kinase is activated in these cells downstream of CaM kinase II activation suggesting that MAP kinase could contribute to cPLA2 activation in these cells. Both an antisense oligonucleotide and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD-098509 suppress NE-stimulated arachidonic acid release in rabbit VSMC, but the effect is small (30% reduction in arachidonic acid release compared with complete reduction in the presence of CaM kinase II inhibitors) despite the fact that MAP kinase activation was inhibited completely (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that a small amount of Ser-505 phosphorylation occurs in NE-stimulated human VSMC but that the cpm incorporated is below the detection limit of our radiometric analysis of chymotryptic peptides. Alternatively the modest, MAP kinase-dependent activation of cPLA2 may occur by a mechanism other than phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAP kinase. It is not known whether MAP kinase can phosphorylate cPLA2 once it has translocated from the cytosol to the membrane. In NE-stimulated VSMC, MAP kinase activation occurs subsequent to CaM kinase II activation and a rise in intracellular calcium. This variation in the temporal activation of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase may be the reason why cPLA2 is mainly phosphorylated on Ser-515 by CaM kinase II in VSMC. In any case, it is clear that Ser-515 phosphorylation of cPLA2 by CaM kinase II is the major mechanism of cPLA2 activation in these cells.After the completion of our studies, Handlogten et al. (36Handlogten M.E. Huang C. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13941-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) reported that cPLA2 is activated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that have been transfected with the calcium-sensing receptor in a MAP kinase-independent way involving Gq, phospholipase C, Ca2+-CaM, and CaM kinase II (as shown by transfection studies and use of a CaM kinase II inhibitor) (36Handlogten M.E.

It would be interesting to determine the site(s) of cPLA2phosphorylation in these cells. Many cellular stimuli produce oscillations in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+. Ca2+-/calmodulin (CaM)1-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II), a multifunctional protein kinase, decodes the frequency of Ca2+ spikes and regulates the activity of a range of cellular targets involved in many physiological processes including control of cell cycle, apoptosis, gene expression, neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and early after-depolarization (1De Koninck P.

We have shown previously that the adrenergic transmitter norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II increase CaM kinase II activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), leading to activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (3Muthalif M.M.

Rigorous studies to map the phosphorylation sites on cPLA2 have been carried out only with platelets, HeLa cells, and CHO cells, and these studies reveal that cPLA2is phosphorylated on Ser-505 and Ser-727 (22Borsch-Haubold A.G.

More recent work has shown that Ser-727 phosphorylation is catalyzed by MNK1 or a closely related isoform, which is a protein kinase that is activated by members of the MAP kinase family, and that both Ser-505 and Ser-727 phosphorylation are required for full activation of cPLA2(23Hefner Y.

Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MAP kinase is activated in these cells downstream of CaM kinase II activation suggesting that MAP kinase could contribute to cPLA2 activation in these cells. Both an antisense oligonucleotide and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD-098509 suppress NE-stimulated arachidonic acid release in rabbit VSMC, but the effect is small (30% reduction in arachidonic acid release compared with complete reduction in the presence of CaM kinase II inhibitors) despite the fact that MAP kinase activation was inhibited completely (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that a small amount of Ser-505 phosphorylation occurs in NE-stimulated human VSMC but that the cpm incorporated is below the detection limit of our radiometric analysis of chymotryptic peptides. Alternatively the modest, MAP kinase-dependent activation of cPLA2 may occur by a mechanism other than phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAP kinase. It is not known whether MAP kinase can phosphorylate cPLA2 once it has translocated from the cytosol to the membrane. In NE-stimulated VSMC, MAP kinase activation occurs subsequent to CaM kinase II activation and a rise in intracellular calcium. This variation in the temporal activation of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase may be the reason why cPLA2 is mainly phosphorylated on Ser-515 by CaM kinase II in VSMC. In any case, it is clear that Ser-515 phosphorylation of cPLA2 by CaM kinase II is the major mechanism of cPLA2 activation in these cells. After the completion of our studies, Handlogten et al. (36Handlogten M.E. Huang C. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Miller R.T. J. Biol.

Each of the four nucleotides bind and incorporate with similar kinetics; the average dissociation constant for ground state binding is 0.8 μm, and the average rate of polymerization is 37 s−1, defining a specificity constant kcat/Km = 4.6 × 107m−1 s−1. Mismatched nucleotides show weaker ground-state nucleotide binding affinities ranging from 57 to 364 μm and slower rates of polymerization ranging from 0.013 to 1.16 s−1.

The mutation rate observed for replication of some regions of human mitochondrial DNA, including mitochondrial rRNA and tRNA sequences, is 20–100-fold higher than that of nuclear DNA (1Pesole G. Gissi C. De Chirico A. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA mutations are associated with several chronic degenerative diseases affecting brain, heart, and endocrine systems. Disease-related point mutations in mitochondrial DNA are generally maternally inherited defects in tRNA or rRNA genes (2Marin-Garcia J. Goldenthal M.J. Pediatr. Neurol. 2000; 22: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, point mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial tRNALys have been associated with autism, hearing loss, and cardiomyopathy (3Graf W.D. Marin-Garcia J. Gao H.G. Pizzo S. Naviaux R.K.

Additionally, large scale deletions or rearrangements in mitochondrial DNA give rise to disorders such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome (5Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Nature. 1988; 331: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). The 16-kilobase pair mitochondrial genome is replicated by the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ),1 a nuclearly encoded enzyme that is imported into mitochondria. Previously, several laboratories have examined in vitro replication by pol γ in various assays involving gain or loss of gene function to estimate mutation rates (6Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kunkel T.A. Mosbaugh D.W.

In this report, we explore the kinetic parameters governing the fidelity of human pol γ during replication using a defined primer-template system and enzyme single-turnover conditions. The native enzyme is a dimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (140 kDa) containing both polymerase and exonuclease sites and an accessory protein (54 kDa) with no known catalytic activities. Recombinant enzyme was prepared by truncating each gene to mimic the removal of the mitochondrial import leader sequence of each protein and then recombining the two to create the holoenzyme (10Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of the polymerase to discriminate the proper substrate as well as correct an error, we directly challenged the enzyme with incorrect dNTPs or mismatched DNA using wild-type enzyme or an exonuclease deficient mutant (E200A). In the accompanying article (30Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we define the contributions of exonuclease proofreading to the overall fidelity. Overexpression and purification of recombinant human pol γ were as described previously (10Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We previously examined polymerization by the holoenzyme using an accessory subunit containing a 6-histidine tag and a 56-amino acid amino-terminal truncation to mimic the natural processing during mitochondrial import (10Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We performed several experiments to assess the effect of the histidine tag, as well as the choice of site for truncation, on polymerization kinetics. The maximum rate of polymerization, and the dissociation constant for DNA and nucleotide substrates were examined using holoenzyme containing accessory subunit with or without a histidine tag, and containing either a 25- or a 56-amino acid deletion from the amino-terminal end of the protein. Removal of the histidine tag had no effect on polymerase kinetics or accessory subunit solubility (data not shown). Additionally, accessory subunit with a 25-amino acid deletion exhibited similar solubility and kinetics as our original accessory subunit containing a 56-amino acid deletion. Another group reported that a 55-amino acid truncation of the accessory subunit resulted in low solubility and lack of polymerase-enhancing activities (12Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Perhaps these difficulties were avoided in our work due to induction of the protein at 15 °C and gentle lysis of the bacteria. We had no solubility problems with the accessory protein with the 56-amino acid deletion. All of the studies reported here utilized the accessory subunit with a 56-amino acid deletion. An exonuclease-deficient catalytic subunit was created to allow examination of the polymerization reaction in the absence of exonucleolytic proofreading. Glutamate 200 was changed to alanine using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Mutated plasmid was sequenced to confirm the desired changes and DNA encoding the exo−catalytic subunit was expressed in a baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (11Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The exo−enzyme was shown to bind DNA and to catalyze correct base pair insertion with kinetics identical to wild type enzyme (data not shown). The mutation D198A alone or in combination with E200A showed a 5-fold reduction in the rate of polymerization (data not shown) and therefore was rejected as a possible mutant for further studies. Mutant protein was treated identically to wild type for purification and experimental purposes. Wild-type polymerase was used to determine polymerization parameters for correct base pairs, for exonuclease experiments, and for the koff measurement of mismatched DNA. Exo− pol γ was used for all other experiments, as noted. Protein concentrations were determined by active site titration versus known concentrations of DNA as described (10Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was reconstituted with a 1:5 ratio of catalytic subunit to accessory subunit, and was employed unless otherwise stated. DNA sequences used are listed in Table I. Primers were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was terminated by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Primers were annealed to corresponding 45mer templates by combining at an equi-molar ratio, heating to 95 °C and then cooling to room temperature. All misincorporation products are listed as nucleotide:template; for example, a G:T mismatch is a dGTP incorporation opposite a template dTMP.Table IDNA primer-template combinations25/45GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG1-aTemplate base opposite primer 26th nucleotide varied to allow for base pairing to measure incorporation parameters for correct nucleotides.26/45GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCATCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGAAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG27/45GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCATCCGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG1-a Template base opposite primer 26th nucleotide varied to allow for base pairing to measure incorporation parameters for correct nucleotides. Open table in a new tab All polymerase assays were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2. Generally, the catalytic and accessory subunits were preincubated to form the holoenzyme in reaction buffer lacking magnesium for 20 min on ice. DNA was then added to the holoenzyme and incubated for another 20 min on ice. Reactions were initiated by the addition of nucleotide and magnesium in the same reaction buffer at 37 °C. All concentrations given define final conditions during the reaction after mixing. Since the reaction was initiated by a 1:1 mixing, the concentrations of enzyme and DNA during the pre-incubation were double that reported for the final concentrations. Polymerase assay products were separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, imaged on a Storm 860, and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed at various concentrations of nucleotide to examine the effects of nucleotide concentration on the incorporation rate. Burst conditions (45 nm polymerase, 250 nm DNA) and a range of dNTP concentrations were used to examine correct nucleotide incorporations. A reaction time course was determined for each concentration of nucleotide, and the time course for formation of product (26-mer DNA) was fit to a burst equation, [26-mer] = A[1 −e−kt] +ksst. The burst rates (k) were plotted versus dNTP concentration and then fit to a hyperbola, rate =kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP]) to obtain the Kd and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each correct dNTP. To examine misincorporation, single turnover conditions with excess enzyme were employed (100 nm polymerase, 75 nmDNA). This was necessary to directly measure polymerization rates when the rate of incorporation was slower than the rate of dissociation of the enzyme-DNA complex, so as to prevent complications introduced by multiple enzyme turnovers. Incorrect nucleotide incorporation was examined using the 25/45 DNA shown in Table I, allowing formation of T:T, G:T, and C:T mispairs, except in the case of the dCTP misincorporation, the 19th template base was changed from a G to an A to preclude multiple incorporations. A single turnover time course was performed for each concentration of dNTP. The concentration of 26-mer product DNA was plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential ([26-mer] = A*e−kt +C). The observed rates were plotted versusnucleotide concentration and the data were fit to a hyperbola (observed rate = kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+ [dNTP]) to obtain the Kd and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each incorrect dNTP. exo− polymerase (100 nm) was preincubated with 75 nm 26/45 DNA, containing a terminal T:T mismatch as shown in Table I. Magnesium and dCTP (50–1200 μm) were added to initiate the reaction, to form a correct C:G base pair following the T:T mismatch. Rates of product formation were determined as described above. Exo− polymerase (100 nm) was preincubated with 90 nm 27/45 DNA containing a T:T mismatch buried by a single G:C base pair (TableI). Magnesium and dCTP (1–500 μm) were added to initiate the reaction, to form a correct C:G base pair. Rates of product formation were determined as described above. Exo− polymerase (100 nm) was preincubated with non-radiolabeled 26/45 DNA (100 nm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5′-32P-labeled 25/45 DNA, 50 μm dATP, and magnesium. Accumulation of 26-mer products is limited by and thereby measures the rate of dissociation of 26/45 DNA, since binding and extension of 25/45 DNA are faster than release of the enzyme from the mismatched DNA. The concentration of 26-mer product DNA was plotted versus time and fit to a single exponential ([26-mer] =A*e−kt + C), wherek represents koff for 26/45 DNA. In addition, unlabeled 27/45 DNA was preincubated with enzyme to determine the dissociation rate for this DNA using the same method. As a first step to examining polymerase fidelity, the rates of incorporation of correct nucleotides were examined for all four dNTPs, utilizing a template containing the appropriately matched base. Pre-equilibrated polymerase-DNA complex was mixed with various concentrations of dNTP to examine formation of correct base pairs. The rates of the pre-steady state bursts were plotted as a function of dNTP concentration and fit to a hyperbola (burst rate =kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP])) to yield the Kd and maximum polymerization rate,kpol, for each nucleotide incorporation. The data for dTTP incorporation are shown in Fig.1, and the results for correct incorporations of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP are summarized in TableII. Correct nucleotides interact with the polymerase with an average dissociation constant of 0.8 μm and polymerization proceeds at an average rate of 37 s−1, without much variability according to identity of the base pair at this particular incorporation position.Table IIIncorporation parameters for correct and incorrect nucleotideskpolKdkpol/KdDiscrimination2-aDefined as (kpol/Kd)dATP/(kpol/Kd)incorrect dNTPfor holoenzyme or catalytic subunit.s−1μmμm−1s−1Correct dNTP dATP45 ± 10.8 ± 0.0657 ± 61 dTTP25 ± 20.6 ± 0.1639 ± 13 dGTP37 ± 20.8 ± 0.1345 ± 10 dCTP43 ± 20.9 ± 0.2347 ± 14Incorrect dNTP dTTP0.013 ± 0.000357 ± 50.00023260,000 dCTP0.038 ± 0.003360 ± 800.0001570,000 dGTP1.16 ± 0.0671 ± 9.60.0163,563Catalytic subunit Correct dATP2-bFrom Ref. 11.8.7 ± 1.14.7 ± 2.01.851 Incorrect dTTP0.0012 ± 0.000111.7 ± 1.90.00018,5002-a Defined as (kpol/Kd)dATP/(kpol/Kd)incorrect dNTPfor holoenzyme or catalytic subunit.2-b From Ref. 11Graves S.W.

Open table in a new tab It is important to test whether the results seen examining single nucleotide incorporation events mimic the process of processive polymerization. We performed a limited processivity experiment by examining primer extension from 25/45 to 30/45 DNA in the presence of three nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, and dTTP) to allow quantitative analysis of the sequential incorporation events. Fitting the data by computer simulation yielded an average polymerization rate of 34 s−1 for the first four nucleotide extension (data not shown). Therefore, our single nucleotide incorporation assay accurately reflects the rate under conditions of multiple incorporations. Misincorporation experiments cannot be performed with wild type human pol γ because creation of a mismatch or extension beyond a mismatch are not observed in the presence of the exonuclease function (data not shown; Ref. 13Kaguni L.S. Olson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, an exonuclease-deficient derivative of pol γ was created in order to perform experiments in the absence of proofreading activity. Mutation of both conserved exonuclease active site residues Asp-198 and Glu-200 to alanine resulted in enzyme with drastically reduced polymerase activity (data not shown; Ref. 14Vanderstraeten S. Van den B.S. Hu J. Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23690-23697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Single point mutagenesis of D198A led to enzyme with normal DNA binding but an ∼4.5-fold reduced rate of polymerization. Therefore, neither mutant containing the D198A substitution was used for further studies. Individual mutagenesis of Glu-200 to alanine produced enzyme with reduced exonuclease activity of single base excision from duplex DNA (<0.1% over 2 h) but with polymerase parameters matching those of the wild type enzyme (Kd, DNA = 19.6 ± 5.3 nm, Kd,dATP = 0.95 ± 0.19 μm, kpol = 52.7 ± 2.4 s−1); and so E200A pol γ was used in these studies. Exo− pol γ was used to investigate misincorporation of dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP opposite a template dTMP. Single turnover experiments were performed to examine incorporation of each incorrect nucleotide. The kinetics of formation of a T:T mismatch by exo− pol γ are shown at various nucleotide concentrations in Fig. 2A. The single exponential rates from Fig. 2A were plotted as a function of the dTTP concentration and fit to a hyperbola to yield aKd of 56.7 ± 4.6 μm and akpol of 0.013 ± 0.0003 s−1(Fig. 2B). Kinetic parameters for the formation of G:T and C:T base pairs are also shown in Table II. In order to examine the function of the accessory subunit in proper nucleotide selection by the polymerase, misincorporation by the catalytic subunit alone to form a T:T mismatch was also examined, and the results are shown in Fig. 2C. The exo− catalytic subunit was preincubated with 25/45 DNA, and polymerization was initiated by the addition of dTTP and Mg2+. The rates of the incorporation were plotted versus dTTP concentration and fit to a hyperbola to define a Kd of 11.7 ± 1.9 μm and a maximum polymerization rate,kpol = 0.0012 ± 0.0001 s−1. Note the difference in axes (Fig. 2, compare B andC). A series of burst experiments following correct dATP incorporation were performed with increasing concentrations of dTTP added as a competitive inhibitor. The exo− polymerase (50 nm) was preincubated with 200 nm 25/45 DNA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a mixture containing 5 μm dATP, 2.5 mm magnesium, and 0–4000 μm dTTP. The burst rates were plotted versus dTTP concentration and the data were fit to a hyperbola: observed rate = (kpol*[dTTP]/(Kapp+[dTTP])) + C (Fig. 3) whereKapp = 230 μm. Calculation ofKi = 31 ± 4.9 μm was derived from Kapp = Ki*(1 + [dATP]/Kd,dATP) for competitive inhibition where [dATP] = 5 μm andKd,dATP = 0.78 μm. The calculated Ki for dTTP is only slightly lower than the value of 57 ± 5 μm obtained by direct measurement of misincorporation (Table II). We next examined insertion of the correct nucleotide, in this case a dCTP opposite a template G, following a T:T mismatch. The exo−enzyme (100 nm) was pre-equilibrated with 26/45 DNA (75 nm), the DNA that results following the formation of a T:T mismatch in the experiment described in Fig. 2. This pre-equilibrated complex was reacted with various concentrations of dCTP, and the rate of the single turnover was measured. The data were fit to a hyperbola, providing a Kd of 404 ± 51 μmand a maximum incorporation rate of kpol = 0.52 ± 0.03 s−1 (Fig.4). The incorporation of a second correct base pair following an embedded T:T mismatch was explored to determine whether a mismatch buried by one base pair had further effects on processive polymerization. A series of single turnover experiments were performed using dCTP incorporation following an incorrect T:T base pair (26th primer nucleotide T) followed by a correct C:G base pair (27th primer nucleotide C) to create a 28/45 product. Polymerase (100 nm exo−) was preincubated with 90 nm 27/45 DNA, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of magnesium and 1–500 μmdCTP. The rates of incorporation were plotted versus dCTP concentration, and the data were fit to a hyperbola to yield aKd of 74.6 ± 11.2 μm and akpol of 2.0 ± 0.1 s−1 (Fig.5). The rate of release of mismatched DNA substrates from the polymerase was examined for both the catalytic subunit and the holoenzyme (Fig.6). The exo− polymerase (100 nm) was preincubated with an equimolar concentration ofunlabeled 26/45 mismatched DNA (100 nm). As a result, this DNA species is not tracked in the reaction. Magnesium, dATP (50 μm), and 5′ 32P-labeled 25/45 DNA (50 nm) were added to the reaction mixture to allow polymerization to occur. Following rate-limiting dissociation of the unlabeled DNA, the extension of labeled 25/45 substrate to form the 26/45 product by the addition of one dATP was then observed. The fit of the data to a single exponential yielded a koffof 0.18 ± 0.02 s−1 for DNA containing a 3′ T:T mismatch. The accessory subunit had no effect on dissociation of mismatched DNA, as identical rates were observed for the catalytic subunit and holoenzyme. An identical experiment to analyze the dissociation rate for 27/45 DNA yielded a koffof 0.01 ± 0.0003 s−1 for DNA containing a buried mismatch (data not shown). We have systematically examined the kinetics of misincorporation during polymerization by pol γ. A comparison of specificity constants for correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation defines the probability of forming a mismatch, as summarized in Table II. We also examined the events following formation of a T:T mismatch through two subsequent cycles of polymerization to determine the effect that this mismatch has on forward replication. Human pol γ is capable of accurate, processive polymerization, and pauses following misincorporation to provide the enzyme the opportunity to correct a mistake. Conclusions from the experiments presented here are discussed and illustrated in Scheme 1 of the accompanying paper (30Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in relation to the relevant exonuclease rate measurements. Correct nucleotide incorporation occurs through a two-step process where nucleotide binding is followed by a rate-limiting incorporation reaction. For several other well characterized polymerases, a protein conformational change has been shown to limit the rate of incorporation (reviewed in Ref. 15Johnson K.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 336: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but this has not yet been examined for pol γ. Like other polymerases, the kinetics of incorporation of all four correct base pairs are quite similar (16Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A.

If the ground state binding is a rapid equilibrium and is followed by a single rate-limiting step, then Kd and kpolmeasured in a single turnover experiment define Kmand kcat, respectively, and thereby define the specificity constant,kcat/Km, governing selectivity. Although one cannot in general equateKm to binding affinity, in the case of a rapid equilibrium binding mechanism as shown to apply for other related DNA polymerases, the equality of Km =Kd appears to be approximately correct. The critical distinction as to whether Km = Kdand indeed whether the single turnover experiments provide a direct measurement of Kd is based upon the rapid equilibrium assumption, namely that nucleotide binding comes to equilibrium prior to the rate-limiting step. Specifically, this is true if the nucleotide dissociates faster than the rate of the step limiting incorporation. The major evidence in support of this conclusion is based upon the observation that the kinetics of incorporation fit a single exponential at all concentrations of nucleotide. Additionally, in a direct competition assay (Fig. 3), the Ki for dTTP inhibition of dATP incorporation was approximately equal to theKd seen for dTTP misincorporation, supporting the notion of rapid equilibria. It appears that pol γ from several sources exhibits relatively tight nucleotide binding. The Km of dTTP forDrosophila and porcine liver pol γ are 0.97 ± 0.1 and 0.4 μm, respectively (18Wernette C.M.

The observed DNA release rate of 0.02 s−1 leads to an overall processivity of 37/0.02 = 1850 nucleotides incorporated per binding event. Discrimination against incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide results from weaker ground state binding and a slower polymerization rate catalyzed by T7 DNA pol, HIV-1 RT, and rat pol β (16Wong I.

When faced with an incorrect dNTP as a substrate, exo− pol γ also exhibits a decreased rate of polymerization as well as weaker nucleotide binding. The ability of the polymerase to discriminate against the wrong nucleotide varied for each of the mismatched base pairs examined. A T:T base pair forms with the slowest rate, while the weak binding of dCTP provides selection against formation of a C:T base pair. As observed for other polymerases, a G:T base pair forms relatively easily (17Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol.

We used recombinant wild type p53, recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) (EC 2.4.2.30), and βNAD+. Our results show that the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 is a time-dependent protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction and that the addition of this tumor suppressor protein to a PARP-1 automodification mixture stimulates total protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation 3- to 4-fold. Electrophoretic analysis of the products synthesized indicated that short oligomers predominate early during hetero-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, whereas longer ADP-ribose chains are synthesized at later times of incubation. A more drastic effect in the complexity of the ADP-ribose chains generated was observed when the βNAD+concentration was varied. As expected, increasing the βNAD+ concentration from low nanomolar to high micromolar levels resulted in the slower electrophoretic migration of the p53-(ADP-ribose)n adducts. Increasing the concentration of p53 protein from low nanomolar (40 nm) to low micromolar (1.0 μm) yielded higher amounts of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 as well. Thus, the reaction was acceptor protein concentration-dependent. The hetero-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 also showed that high concentrations of p53 specifically stimulated the automodification reaction of PARP-1. The covalent modification of p53 resulted in the inhibition of the binding ability of this transcription factor to its DNA consensus sequence as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In fact, controls carried out with calf thymus DNA, βNAD+, PARP-1, and automodified PARP-1 confirmed our conclusion that the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 results in the transcriptional inactivation of this tumor suppressor protein.

However, over the last 4 years, and since the last International Symposium on protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (4163 pp.Google Scholar), other novel and less abundant PARP-like proteins have been identified and reported (5Johansson M.

In this report, we have focused on the biochemical characterization of p53 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation as well as the functional consequences of the substantial covalent modification of this tumor suppressor protein on its DNA-binding properties. Tumor suppressor p53 is an inducible protein that accumulates in the nucleus following DNA damage. Interestingly, the increased expression of p53 has recently been shown to initially parallel the expression of PARP-1 in high grade lymphomas (21Menegazzi M. Scarpa A. Carceri de Patri A. Menestrina F. Suzuki H. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and these events apparently precede the enzymatic activation of the latter in DNA-damaged cells (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, both p53 (22Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar) and PARP-1 (23Chaterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been “classified” as guardians of the eucaryotic genome. In fact, both DNA-binding proteins have been shown to physically associate via specific protein-protein interactions in genotoxically treated cells (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The molecular association between these DNA damage protein sensors may actually result in the βNAD+-dependent covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the tumor suppressor protein both in vitro (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and in vivo (26Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Luo R. Smulson M.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2190-2194PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 as a transcription factor remain to be elucidated. It should be mentioned that the tumor suppressor p53 functions as a cell cycle checkpoint in maintaining genomic stability in mammals. In fact, over half of most human cancers contain mutations in thep53 tumor suppressor gene and over 90% of thep53 missense mutations are clustered within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain. Overwhelming experimental evidence suggests that the functional inactivation of p53, especially its DNA-binding activity, is a crucial, and often obligatory step in the complex process of tumorigenesis. By contrast,p53 is either induced or activated in response to a plethora of stimuli, including DNA damage. The activation of p53leads to one of two major cellular pathways: apoptosis or cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase preventing progression through the S phase until damaged DNA is repaired (27Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional properties of p53 are well established in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage, this is not necessarily so in p53-mediated apoptosis. The tumor suppressor protein p53 may also function as a repressor of a variety of viral and cellular gene promoters that lack p53 binding sites (28Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampat A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably via its carboxyl-terminal fragment (31Wiederschain D. Gu J. Yuan Z.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27999-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that the main function of this tumor suppressor protein is as a transcription factor in which p53 up-regulates specific cell cycle arrest-related genes (32Brugarolas J. Chandrasekran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 33Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, p53 recognizes a specific consensus DNA sequence consisting of two copies of the 10-bp motif, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GpyPyPy-3′, separated by a 0- to 13-bp spacer. Wild type p53 transactivates the expression of specific target genes by specifically binding to p53-binding sites in the sequences of these genes (32Brugarolas J. Chandrasekran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 33Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). However, little is known about what kind of biochemical signals regulate the sequence-specific DNA binding affinity of p53. Because p53 has been shown to physically interact with PARP-1 (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP-ribose polymers (34Malanga M. Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 11839-11842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in DNA-damaged cells (see above), we have proceeded to accomplish the following goals. First, to biochemically characterize poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 and second, to determine the ability of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 to bind to its consensus DNA sequence by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Our results clearly demonstrate the extensive poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of wild type p53 as a function of: (i) the time of incubation, (ii) the βNAD+ substrate concentration, and (iii) the p53 protein concentration. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 does not efficiently bind to its consensus DNA sequence by EMSA. Electrophoresis molecular weight markers and reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA); [adenylate-32P]NAD (specific activity 500 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA); T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from USB Corp. (Cleveland, OH); [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA); wild type recombinant p53 and the consensus binding motif for wt-p53 contained in the oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGGACT3′ and its complimentary strand were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was purified to homogeneity as previously described (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Chang, W.-J., and Alvarez-Gonzalez, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). A 50-μl incubation reaction mixture containing T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer and unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide were incubated with 200 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37 °C. The product was purified by a series of precipitations and extractions with 330 mm ammonium acetate and 1% ice-cold ethanol. The final radiospecificity of the product was 6 μC/pmol as determined by scintillation counting. Triplicate samples containing the required concentrations of wt-p53 were incubated with 18 nm PARP-1 in the presence of 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol as well as [32P]βNAD+ and activated calf thymus DNA at 37 °C as indicated in the corresponding figure legend. 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer was added to one of each triplicate sample and loaded onto a 4–15% polyacrylamide gel. The poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins were detected by autoradiographic analysis of the dried gel. Two samples from each triplicate were precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed, and counted to determine the total incorporation of ADP-ribose under each distinct set of conditions. One of the duplicate samples was used to determine the ADP-ribose polymer size distribution by high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see below). A final concentration of 5 μmβNAD+ was used for the synthesis of unlabeled ADP-ribose polymers as necessary to analyze the effect of p53 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on DNA binding. Acid-precipitable material was processed for analysis of the ADP-ribose chains as previously published (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the ADP-ribose polymers were chemically detached from protein acceptor with 0.1 n NaOH and 20 mm EDTA for 2 h at 60 °C, neutralized, and diluted in 60 mmtris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, pH 8.3. Protein-free ADP-ribose polymers were then subjected to electrophoresis on a (20 × 20 cm) 20% polyacrylamide gel. The size distribution of the ADP-ribose chains was visualized following overnight autoradiographic exposure to Kodak (Biomax-MR) film. The effect of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of wt-p53 on the binding to its32P-radiolabeled consensus oligodeoxynucleotide sequence was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as reported elsewhere (36Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. First, either native or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 were incubated with 0.4 ng of γ-32P-radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide probe in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm KCl, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol for 15 min at 37 °C. Immediately following incubation, samples were loaded onto a native 4–20% acrylamide-TBE gradient gel and electrophoresed in TBE buffer at 150 V for ∼60 min at 4 °C. Binding of wt-p53 to its consensus DNA sequence (20-mer) was analyzed by autoradiography following exposure of the dried gel to x-ray film. Recently, we (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), as well as others (24Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2190-2194PubMed Google Scholar), have shown the physical association of p53 with PARP-1 in DNA-damaged and apoptotic cells. However, this protein-protein association usually does not result in the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the tumor suppressor protein (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wesierska-Gadek J. Schmid G. Cerni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H.

In fact, the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 only takes place under specific conditions, e.g. when PARP-1 has not yet been proteolyzed by caspases 3 or 7 in apoptotic cells. That is why we could only confirm the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 in an apoptotic HeLa cell extract (19Kumari S.R. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar) after calf thymus PARP-1 was exogenously added. To gain further insight into the physiological significance of p53 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA-damaged and apoptotic cells, we decided to biochemically characterize the enzymology of this reaction and its consequences in the sequence-specific DNA binding properties of this tumor suppressor protein. To confirm that wild type p53 is a covalent target for protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, the tumor suppressor protein was incubated with 18 nm PARP-1, and 200 nm [32P]βNAD+ under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1A shows the amount of ADP-ribose incorporated as a function of the time of incubation from 0 to 120 min of incubation. We reproducibly observed that the level of protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was 3- to 4-fold higher in the presence of wt-p53 (circles) than in its absence (squares), suggesting that not only was PARP-1 efficiently auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating but that the tumor suppressor protein was also covalently modified. To confirm the covalent association of ADP-ribose polymers with wt-p53, we carried out SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through a 4–15% acrylamide gradient gel. Fig.1B shows the Coomassie Blue-stained gel where the relative migration of wt-p53 (162 nm) is clearly indicated to theleft of the gel. Under these staining conditions, the 100 ng of PARP-1 (18 nm) utilized were not sufficient for strong staining. By contrast, Fig. 1C illustrates the signals developed upon autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel. Lanes 1–7 show the increase in p53 radiolabeling as the time of incubation was extended from 0 to 120 min. Fig. 1C also clearly shows that, although wt-p53 was clearly covalently radiolabeled as a function of time, the efficiency of PARP-1 automodification also increased to the point where the intensity of the PARP-1 band significantly expanded as a result of hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Therefore, it appeared as if the modification of wt-p53 increased the efficiency of PARP-1 automodification (see below). Due to the dramatic change in the electrophoretic behavior of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated-PARP-1, we next decided to determine the size distribution of the protein-bound ADP-ribose polymers. We accomplished this by high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were processed after chemical release from protein under alkaline conditions in the presence of EDTA (35Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1D shows the size distribution of the protein-free ADP-ribose chains synthesized when PARP-1 (18 nm) and wt-p53 (81 nm) were co-incubated as a function of time (see above). Lanes 1, 2, and 3 show the mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation step of ADP-ribose polymer synthesis predominated in the first 5 min of incubation (AMP band). Also shown are ADP-ribose chains of up to 20 ADP-ribose units (lane 4) or more (lanes 5–7), which represent the polymers synthesized at 1 and 2 h of incubation. Lanes 8,10, and 11 show the absence of protein-bound ADP-ribose polymers when DNA, βNAD+, or PARP-1 was omitted from the incubation mixture. By contrast, lane 9shows the polymer size distribution of the enzyme products generated in the absence of wt-p53. Although the distribution of polymers was very similar without (lane 9) and with (lanes 5–7) wt-p53, the overall yield of (ADP-ribose)n-protein adducts was consistently higher in the presence of the tumor suppressor protein. Recently, we have reported (37Mendoza-Alvarez H. Chavez-Bueno S. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar) that the size distribution of the enzyme-bound ADP-ribose polymers synthesized during the automodification reaction is determined by the concentration of βNAD+ in the assay regardless of the protein concentration in the incubation mixture. Therefore, we next proceeded to determine the effect that increasing the βNAD+ concentration would have on the electrophoretic mobility of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated-PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53. Fig. 2A shows the significant decrease in the Coomassie Blue staining intensity of the wt-p53 (250 nm) band as the concentration of βNAD+ was increased from 0–1 μm (lanes 1–4) to 100–1000 μm (lanes 5–7). The remarkable decrease in staining intensity of this protein is apparently due to the increased levels of wt-p53 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation at more physiological levels of βNAD+, namely 0.5–1.0 mm substrate concentration, because under these conditions, the protein adducts stay at the top of the gel. Our interpretation was later confirmed by autoradiographic analysis of the same gel upon exposure to x-ray film. As expected, Fig. 2B shows that the electrophoretic migration of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated-(PARP-1) significantly decreased from the typical 113-kDa position (lane 2) at 250 nm βNAD+, to the origin of the gel (lanes 4–7) at micromolar levels of βNAD+(10, 100, 500, and 1000 μm, respectively). Therefore, we conclude that the molecules of wt-p53 that become covalently modified transform into heavily poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated protein adducts that do not migrate into the gel, just like hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated-PARP-1. To our knowledge, human wt-p53 (this report) and TFIIF (18Rawling J.M. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are the only transcription factors that have been carefully characterized in terms of the biochemistry of protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Thus, to evaluate the influence of all molecular components in the protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation mixture, we next determined the effect of p53 protein concentration in the modification of this tumor suppressor protein. Fig.3 illustrates the effect of p53 protein concentration on its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by PARP-1 (18 nm) and βNAD+ (200 nm) after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. Fig. 3A shows the Coomassie Blue-stained gel of this experiment as the wt-p53 protein concentration was increased from 0 to 1000 nm (lanes 1–7). Lanes 4 through 7 represent 160 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm, and 1.0 μm, respectively. These levels of p53 concentration were the only ones that contained enough protein for Coomassie Blue staining. Fig. 3B shows the autoradiograph of the same gel. We observed that, although a ratio of 2:1 of p53/PARP-1 was not enough for the ADP-ribose polymer modification of these polypeptides (Fig.3B, lane 2), a ratio of at least 4:1 p53/PARP-1 was required for a positive signal (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Needless to say that higher concentrations of p53 (lanes 4–7) resulted in a stronger protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation signal. Interestingly, although the βNAD+ concentration remained constant (200 nm), the efficiency of the PARP-1 automodification reaction increased as the total amount of wt-p53 in the incubation reaction mixture was elevated (compare the thickness of the PARP-1 radiolabeled band on lanes 1 and7). Once we reproducibly confirmed the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of human wt-p53, we proceeded to determine its effect on the sequence-specific DNA binding of this tumor suppressor protein by EMSA. Fig.4 shows the EMSA analysis of both native p53 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p53 upon incubation with its32P-radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide consensus DNA sequence. Lane 1 displays the electrophoretic migration of the oligodeoxynucleotide probe alone. Lane 2 shows the mobility shift caused by the addition of 400 ng of wt-p53. Lanes 3, 4, and 5 display the effect of individual protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction components on the wt-p53 DNA sequence-specific mobility shift. Although addition of βNAD+, the ADP-ribosylation substrate alone, did not affect the mobility shift signal (lane 3), addition of active calf thymus DNA significantly inhibited the mobility shift (lane 4). This was a fully anticipated result, because p53 is also known to possess nonspecific single-stranded DNA binding properties in its carboxyl-terminal domain (38Foord O.S. Bhattacharya P. Reich Z. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5191-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Bakalkin G. Selivanova G. Yakovleva T. Kiseleva E. Kashuba E. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Klein G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the result shown in Fig. 4, lane 4, is simply a competition effect for DNA binding. By contrast, the light inhibition observed upon addition of PARP-1 alone (lane 5) probably reflects the fact that PARP-1itself is a DNA-binding protein that binds to DNA free ends, such as those present at 5′ and/or 3′ of the oligodeoxynucleotide probe. Presumably, the effect of PARP-1 inhibition is not quantitative, because it does not bind the probe efficiently, even at high nanogram levels (see Fig. 5below). Surprisingly, addition of all protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation ingredients (Fig. 4, lane 6) caused the strongest inhibition of p53 sequence-specific DNA binding. Therefore, we conclude that the direct covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of wt-p53, PARP-1, or both directly result in the specific inhibition of wt-p53 bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2044677374,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins. To elucidate the physiological roles of LPL in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, we generated transgenic rabbits expressing human LPL. In postheparinized plasma of transgenic rabbits, the human LPL protein levels were about 650 ng/ml, and LPL enzymatic activity was found at levels up to 4-fold greater than that in nontransgenic littermates. Increased LPL activity in transgenic rabbits was associated with as much as an 80% decrease in plasma triglycerides and a 59% decrease in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Analysis of the lipoprotein density fractions revealed that increased expression of the LPL transgene resulted in a remarkable reduction in the level of very low density lipoproteins as well as in the level of intermediate density lipoproteins. In addition, LDL cholesterol levels in transgenic rabbits were significantly increased. When transgenic rabbits were fed a cholesterol-rich diet, the development of hypercholesterolemia and aortic atherosclerosis was dramatically suppressed in transgenic rabbits. These results demonstrate that systemically increased LPL activity functions in the metabolism of all classes of lipoproteins, thereby playing a crucial role in plasma triglyceride hydrolysis and lipoprotein conversion, and that overexpression of LPL protects against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

Through the hydrolysis of TG in these particles, LPL converts these lipoproteins to denser lipoproteins such as chylomicron remnants, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL) (1Santamarina-Fojo S. Dugi K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Olivecrona T. Hultin M. Bergo M. Olivecrona G. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1997; 56: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This process generates free fatty acids (FFA), which are taken up and used for metabolic energy or stored as TG after re-esterification and also results in the generation of surface remnants, which give rise to high density lipoproteins (HDL). It has been suggested that LPL influences not only plasma TG levels but also plasma HDL levels (4Brunzell J. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1913-1932Google Scholar). LPL is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells such as adipose and muscle cells and then transported to the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium, where it is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Small amounts of LPL are also present in other types of tissues, including the adrenals, brain, lung, and spleen (5Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPL is also expressed by macrophages and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions (6O'Brien K. Gordon D. Deeb S. Ferguson M. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Araki M. Fan J. Watanabe T. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 31: 485-492Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that LPL modulates vascular functions and may be involved in atherogenesis. Elucidation of the precise roles of LPL in atherosclerosis has been compounded by the fact that LPL has multiple functions in lipoprotein metabolism through its catalytic properties and acts as a ligand for the LDL receptor-related protein (8Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) or a bridge between lipoproteins and HSPG (9Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In humans, it has been found that familial LPL deficiency resulted in premature atherosclerosis associated with chylomicronemia (10Benlian P. De Gennes J.L. Foubert L. Zhang H. Gagne S.E. Hayden M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that increased LPL activity may be either proatherogenic or antiatherogenic, depending on the site of LPL expression. For example, systemically incremental expression of LPL in either LDL receptor or apoE knock-out (KO) mice showed protection against atherosclerosis (11Shimada M. Ishibashi S. Inaba T. Yagyu H. Harada K. Osuga J.I. Ohashi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1677-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in bone marrow-transplanted LDL receptor or apoE KO mice, macrophage-derived LPL enhanced the lesion development (13Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Babaev V.R. Patel M.B. Semenkovich C.F. Fazio S. Linton M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26293-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanisms of the LPL role in lipoprotein metabolism and its multiple functions in atherosclerosis, we attempted to generate transgenic rabbits that express elevated levels of LPL in either a systemic or macrophage-specific fashion. Rabbits have been used successfully to express a number of transgenes (15Fan J. Challah M. Watanabe T. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As an experimental model for the study of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, rabbits have several advantages over mice (16Brousseau M.E. Hoeg J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbits have higher levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins than mice, a lipoprotein profile more like that of humans, and a pattern of hepatic apoB100 and intestinal apoB48 synthesis resembling that of humans. Like humans, and unlike mice, rabbits have cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which has been showed to exert dual (proatherosclerosis as well as antiatherosclerosis) functions in the development of atherosclerosis (17Barter P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2029-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The larger plasma volumes in rabbits permit metabolic studies of lipoprotein subclasses and facilitate lipoprotein turnover studies. Furthermore, rabbits are very susceptible to the development of atherosclerosis, with the lesions resembling those seen in human atherosclerosis. For these reasons, we created human LPL transgenic rabbits and characterized the effects of the constitutively increased systemic expression of human LPL on plasma lipoproteins in the transgenic rabbits. We found that essentially all classes of lipoproteins were affected by the presence of elevated levels of LPL. Finally, LPL transgenic rabbits showed protection against cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Transgenic rabbits were produced by the method described previously (15Fan J. Challah M. Watanabe T. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, specific pathogen-free Japanese white rabbits (Tokyo Laboratory Animal Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used. Zygotes were microinjected with human LPL cDNA transgenic constructs under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter (18Shimada M. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Yamamoto K. Kawamura M. Inaba T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), designated as CBA-hLPL. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Animal Research Committee of the University of Tsukuba. The presence of the transgene in founder transgenic rabbits was examined by Southern blotting using a human LPL cDNA probe (19Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of the transgenic rabbits (aorta, heart, lung, kidney, adrenal, liver, spleen, intestine, stomach, muscle, thymus, brain, bone marrow, and testis) using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and alveolar macrophages were collected as described (20Herscowitz H.B. Holden H.T. Bellanti J.A. Ghaffar A. Manual of Macrophage Methodology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 1-17Google Scholar). Ten µg of RNA was denatured in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, and glyoxal was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Nitran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.). The membrane was hybridized with the 32P-labeled human LPL cDNA probe. Postheparin plasma was prepared from a blood sample taken 10 min after a bolus injection of heparin at a dose of 30 units/kg, body weight, and preheparin plasma was collected from a blood sample taken before the injection of heparin. For determination of the amount of LPL protein, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed by using anti-human LPL monoclonal antibody (21Ikeda Y. Takagi A. Ohkaru Y. Nogi K. Iwanaga T. Kurooka S. Yamamoto A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1911-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of LPL was determined using a 14C-labeled triolein emulsion substrate. The presence of human LPL in postheparin plasma was further studied by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against human LPL (5D2). The plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of LPL transgenic rabbits were compared with those of age-matched control littermates at the age of 4–5 months. Blood was collected in both the fasting and postprandial states to evaluate the lipoprotein changes caused by LPL expression. Blood samples were collected from rabbits after 16 h of food deprivation. A second bleeding was performed after these animals were fed a chow diet for 6 h after overnight fasting. Plasma TG, total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and free fatty acids (FFA) were determined using Wako assay kits (22Fan J. Challah M. Shimoyamada H. Shiomi M. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1004-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the apolipoprotein distribution in transgenic rabbit lipoproteins, plasma lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation as described (23Fan J. Ji Z.-S. Huang Y. de Silva H. Sanan D. Mahley R. Innerarity T. Taylor J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2151-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These lipoprotein fractions were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with Fat red 7B or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with goat anti-apoB, -apoAI, and -apoE polyclonal Abs (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), and immunocomplexed proteins were identified by reaction with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse Ab to goat IgG, followed by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Fan J. Challah M. Shimoyamada H. Shiomi M. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1004-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TC and TG contents in each density fraction were measured using Wako assay kits. The distribution of cholesterol and TG within the plasma lipoproteins was also determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on two columns of TSK gel Lipopropak XL (TOSOH, Tokyo) as described before (24Okazaki M. Komoriya N. Tomoike H. Inoue N. Usui S. Itoh S. Hosaki S. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 709: 179-187Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Okazaki M. Usui S. Hosaki S. Rifai N. Warnick G.R. Dominiczk M.H. Handbook of Lipoprotein Testing. AACC Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 647-669Google Scholar). This technique has been shown to give good separation of mouse plasma into VLDL, LDL, and HDL and simultaneously depict the contents of cholesterol and TG (12Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1677-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of LPL in remnant lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, seven male CBA-hLPL transgenic rabbits and 10 nontransgenic littermates aged 5 months were fed a 0.3% cholesterol diet, which led to hypercholesterolemia caused by accumulation of remnant lipoproteins. The plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and aortic atherosclerosis were analyzed as described (26Fan J. Shimoyamada H. Sun H. Honda K. Marcovina S. Watanabe T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated lipoprotein density fractions from cholesterol-fed animals were examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Aliquots of a diluted lipoprotein fraction on an electron microscopic grid were stained with 1% sodium phosphotungstate for 30 s, and micrographs were taken of random areas of several grids by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, 100-CX, Tokyo). The lipoprotein sizes on the micrographs were measured by Macscope image analysis system (Mitani Inc., Tokyo). Plasma lipids were expressed as mean ± S.D. and assessed for significance with Student'st test. In all cases, statistical significance was set atp < 0.05. As shown in TableI, three surviving CBA-hLPL transgenic founders (designated L01, L04, and L17) were obtained. All three CBA-hLPL transgenic founders showed various levels of human LPL proteins in the postheparin plasma, which resulted in an ∼4-fold increase of LPL enzymatic activity compared with rabbit endogenous LPL activity in nontransgenic rabbits (TableII). Hepatic lipase activities in postheparin plasma were not different in transgenic and nontransgenic rabbits. Founder rabbit L01 was sterile due to “spray-leg” (27Lindsey J. Fox R. Manning P. Ringler D. Newcomer C. The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 293-391Crossref Google Scholar). Founder rabbit L04 was fertile, but transgene transmission was not found, suggesting that this founder may be mosaic. Founder rabbit L17 was mated with normal rabbits, and germ line transmission was confirmed. The current study was performed on F1 heterozygous transgenic rabbits from the L17 transgenic line. Northern blot analysis using an hLPL cDNA probe revealed that hLPL in transgenic rabbits was expressed in multiple tissues such as muscle, aorta, heart, adipose tissue, spleen, kidney, and lung (Fig.1A). Western blot analysis revealed that hLPL was present in the postheparin plasma but not in the preheparin plasma, indicating that human LPL can be associated with HSPG on the endothelial cell surface. The molecular mass of hLPL produced by transgenic rabbits was ∼60 kDa, the same size as LPL found in human postheparin plasma (Fig. 1 B).Table INumber of animals used to generate transgenic rabbitsnDonor rabbits (total)297Zygotes recovered (total)4045Zygotes implanted2664Recipient rabbits116Pregnancy rate (%)48 (41%)Bunnies born (total)166Transgenic positive founders (surviving)7 (3) Open table in a new tab Table IIHuman LPL protein contents and enzymatic activity in transgenic (Trg) rabbit postheparin plasmaSexTransgene copy no.hLPL protein massEnzymatic activityng/mlµmol FFA/ml/minCBA-hLPL Trg (F0)2-aF0, transgenic founder rabbits.L01Male33950.455L04Male21570.234L17Male106520.897Control rabbits (n = 8)2-bFor control rabbits, four females and four males were analyzed.NA2-cNot applicable.2-dRabbit endogenous LPL protein was not detected by the antibody to human LPL in this assay.0.244 ± 0.082-a F0, transgenic founder rabbits.2-b For control rabbits, four females and four males were analyzed.2-c Not applicable.2-d Rabbit endogenous LPL protein was not detected by the antibody to human LPL in this assay. Open table in a new tab As summarized in Table III, CBA-hLPL transgenic rabbits showed a marked reduction of plasma lipids; there were 70 and 80% reductions of TG in the fasting and postprandial states compared with the levels in control rabbits. Total cholesterol contents were slightly reduced in transgenic rabbits due to 56% (fasting) and 59% (postprandial) reductions of HDL-C and the disappearance of VLDL and IDL cholesterol (also see Fig. 3). In addition, the plasma nonesterified fatty acids were significantly decreased in fasting transgenic rabbits compared with nontransgenic littermates (Table III).Table IIIPlasma lipids in CBA-hLPL transgenic and nontransgenic littermate rabbitsTriglyceridesTotal cholesterolHDL-CNEFA3-aNonesterified fatty acids.FastedFedFastedFedFastedFedFastedFedmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlµeg/literControl (n = 15)42 ± 6.651.4 ± 8.832.5 ± 9.233.6 ± 9.216 ± 7.818 ± 7.15.46 ± 0.51.65 ± 1.0Transgenic (n = 10)12.2 ± 5.63-bp < 0.05 versuscontrol.10.2 ± 6.63-bp < 0.05 versuscontrol.27 ± 13.328 ± 15.57 ± 3.53-bp < 0.05 versuscontrol.7.3 ± 3.43-bp < 0.05 versuscontrol.3.25 ± 1.03-bp < 0.05 versuscontrol.0.73 ± 0.5Rabbits were 4–5 months of age at the time of analysis.

Lipoprotein profiles on agarose gels stained with Fat Red 7B showed that pre-β VLDL lipoproteins were consistently absent in both fasting and postprandial transgenic rabbits (Fig.2A). We also compared the apoB levels of transgenic rabbits with those of nontransgenic rabbits in the fasting and postprandial conditions. Transgenic rabbits had lower levels of apoB100 in the fasting state than nontransgenic rabbits. Six hours after animals were fed a chow diet, apoB100 levels in control rabbits were elevated, and a small amount of apoB48 was also detected. However, in transgenic rabbits, apoB100 levels were consistently lower than those of controls in both the fasting and fed states, and apoB48 was not detected (Fig. 2 B). Plasma lipoproteins from F1 male transgenic and nontransgenic rabbits were separated by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation, resolved further by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and stained with Fat red 7B. The major lipoprotein classes in each fraction were as follows:d < 1.006 g/ml, pre-β-migrating VLDL;d = 1.006–1.02 g/ml, IDL; d = 1.02–1.04 g/ml, large LDL; d = 1.04–1.06 g/ml, β-migrating small LDL and α-migrating HDL1;d = 1.06–1.08 and 1.08–1.10 g/ml, HDL1and HDL2; and d = 1.10–1.21 g/ml, HDL3. Quantitative analysis of TC and TG in each fraction consistently showed three prominent changes in the relative amounts of different lipoproteins. First, transgenic rabbits had remarkably low levels of VLDL and IDL. As shown in Fig.3, cholesterol contents in the VLDL and IDL fractions of transgenic rabbit lipoproteins were not detectable, and TG contents were 10 and 20%, respectively, of those of nontransgenic rabbits. Second, transgenic rabbits had a significant increase of LDL (d = 1.04–1.06 g/ml) cholesterol level, and third, the HDL content, especially the content of HDL2 (d = 1.06–1.10 g/ml), was notably reduced in transgenic rabbits compared with nontransgenic littermates. We also assessed the distribution of TG and TC within plasma lipoprotein fractions by HPLC to confirm the results obtained from the ultracentrifugation studies. On a standard chow diet, there were striking reductions of VLDL and HDL levels accompanied by dramatic increases in LDL-C in the transgenic rabbits compared with age- and sex-matched nontransgenic rabbits (Fig.4A). The distribution of apolipoproteins among the various density lipoprotein fractions was examined by the reaction of specific antibodies with Western blots of lipoproteins that had been resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). The observed decreases in VLDL and IDL contents in transgenic rabbits were confirmed by notable reductions in the amount of apoB and apoE, whereas the increase of small density LDL (d = 1.06–1.10 g/ml) content was accompanied by increased apoB and apoE. It seems that apoB/apoE-rich β-migrating particles in transgenic rabbits were shifted from the lower density range (d = 1.006–1.04 g/ml) to the high density range (d = 1.06–1.08 g/ml), presumably due to enhanced lipolysis. In addition, the apoAI content was decreased in HDL1–2 fractions in transgenic rabbits compared with controls. When fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 16 weeks, transgenic rabbits showed a consistent suppression of the diet-induced hypercholesterolemia throughout the experiment (Fig.6A). Triglyceride levels were not significantly affected by cholesterol-rich diet consumption in either transgenic or nontransgenic rabbits, while transgenic rabbits had a consistently lower level of plasma TG than nontransgenic rabbits (Fig. 6 A). In cholesterol-fed animals, the hypercholesterolemia is characterized by an increase in remnant lipoproteins (β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml), IDL (d = 1.006–1.06 g/ml)) and the appearance of cholesterol-rich lipoprotein referred to as HDLc (d = 1.02–1.06 g/ml), which had α mobility but lacked the apoB (28Mahley R.W. Holcombe K.S. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 314-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 B, these remnant lipoproteins (d < 1.006 and d = 1.02–1.06 g/ml) were dramatically diminished in transgenic rabbits. The reduction of remnant lipoproteins was associated with decreased levels of apoB and apoE in transgenic rabbits (Fig. 7). The HDL contents in transgenic rabbits were reduced, as were the levels of apoAI (Fig. 7). HPLC analysis showed that plasma remnant lipoproteins in the transgenic rabbits were dramatically reduced (Fig.4 B), as evaluated in an ultracentrifugation assay.Figure 7Plasma apolipoprotein analysis of cholesterol-fed rabbits. Plasma lipoproteins from a control (upper panel) and a CBA-hLPL transgenic (lower panel) rabbit fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 16 weeks were separated by sequential density ultracentrifugation using the density ranges shown above the gels. An equal volume of each fraction was resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. Lipoproteins were visualized using Fat red 7B staining, and apolipoproteins were identified by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against apoB, apoE, and apoAI. α and β indicate electrophoretic mobility.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The average diameters of the apoB-containing lipoproteins in each density fraction and the size distribution are illustrated in Fig.8, A and B. There was little difference in lipoproteins within d = 1.006–1.02 and d = 1.02–1.04 g/ml between transgenic and control rabbits. The mean sizes of lipoproteins withind < 1.006 and d = 1.04–1.6 g/ml in transgenic rabbits were relatively larger than those in control rabbits due to the appearance of a small number of large particles in transgenic rabbits. The large particles in the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction were postulated to be chylomicrons (>90 nm in diameter), and the small particles were thought to be VLDL and remnant lipoproteins (<90 nm), whereas in the d = 1.04–1.6 g/ml fraction, the large lipoproteins (>14 nm) were thought to be LDL, and the small lipoproteins (<14 nm) were thought to be cholesterol-rich HDLc as evaluated by their electrophoretic mobility and apolipoprotein content. Since the absolute number of the particles in each fraction was reduced in transgenic rabbits compared with control rabbits, a relative increase of these large particles may reflect the fact that small particles such as chyloremnants and HDLc were presumably removed from the circulation. Since plasma cholesterol levels in transgenic rabbits were 5-fold lower than those of nontransgenic rabbits after 16 weeks of consuming a cholesterol-rich diet, we expected that transgenic rabbits would have fewer lesions of atherosclerosis than control rabbits. We found that nontransgenic rabbits had up to 20% aortic arch lesions, whereas transgenic rabbits virtually had no gross lesions, as defined by Sudanophilic areas (Fig.9A). Microscopic study confirmed that the lesions in nontransgenic rabbits were mainly composed of macrophage-derived foam cells (fatty streak), but transgenic rabbits did not have any lesions (Fig.9 B). LPL is the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of lipoprotein TG and has been hypothesized to exert either pro- or antiatherogenic effects, depending on its localization (reviewed in Ref. 2Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, it is essential to establish appropriate animal models such as transgenic animals that overexpress the LPL gene in a tissue-specific fashion. For this purpose, we generated transgenic rabbits that have increased LPL expression either under the control of a systemic expression promoter as shown here or a macrophage-specific expression promoter. 2J. Fan, unpublished data. The rabbit was specifically selected for this undertaking because of its usefulness in investigating the relationship of lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism to the development of atherosclerosis (see reviews in Refs. 15Fan J. Challah M. Watanabe T. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 16Brousseau M.E. Hoeg J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cDNA sequence of human LPL shows about 80% homology to that of rabbit LPL. 3H. Deng, H. Unoki, and J. Fan, unpublished data. Successful generation of transgenic rabbit lines required extensive effort and was made more difficult by a high rate of variability in the number of fertilized zygotes recovered from each donor rabbit, the small number of pups, and the relatively high rate of neonatal mortality, including cannibalism, as shown in Table I. A transgenic line (L17) was established and used for the current study. In this study, we characterized the plasma lipid levels and lipoprotein levels in CBA-hLPL transgenic rabbits fed both normal chow and cholesterol-rich diets. In CBA-hLPL transgenic rabbits, human LPL was expressed in multiple tissues (Fig. 1), resulting in 4-fold higher LPL activity in postheparin plasma (but not in preheparin plasma) than that in nontransgenic rabbits. This suggests that hLPL was bound to the vascular surface via HSPG. On a standard chow diet, increased LPL activity in CBA-hLPL transgenic rabbits led to a remarkable reduction of the levels of plasma TG, especially in VLDL and IDL, suggesting that LPL activity determines the rate of hydrolysis of lipoprotein-triglycerides. This was found to be true in both the fasting and postprandial states in transgenic rabbits. Reduced VLDL and IDL levels indicate that these particles were rapidly cleared from the plasma, possibly through the receptor-mediated uptake by the liver (29Kawamura M. Shimano H. Gotoda T.

Here we have tested the hypothesis that TGF-β-induced changes in osteoblast shape promote bone resorption by increasing the surface area of bone that is accessible to osteoclasts. The addition of TGF-β1 to MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in cytoskeletal reorganization, augmented expression of focal adhesion kinase, and cell elongation, accompanied by an increase in the area of cell-free substratum. TGF-β1 also triggered activation of Erk1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor PD169316, but not an inhibitor of the Erk1/2 pathway, abrogated the effect of TGF-β1 on cell shape. The matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 also interfered with osteoblast elongation. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells seeded at confluence onto bone slices to mimic a bone lining cell layer with TGF-β1 also induced cell elongation and increased pit formation by subsequently added osteoclasts. These effects were again blocked by PD169316 and GM6001.

J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 2Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The major players in the remodeling of bone are two specialized and functionally coupled cell types: osteoblasts, which deposit organic and inorganic matrix, and osteoclasts, which remove bone matrix. Osteoclast function is controlled by both systemic and local factors, most of which act through or are produced by osteoblasts. Similarly, the ability of osteoblasts to deposit bone matrix is stimulated by factors that are produced by osteoclasts or released from bone in the wake of matrix dissolution. Thus, in living bone, osteoblasts play a paramount role in determining the functional state of osteoclasts, and osteoclasts are of supreme importance for osteoblast function. Most of the arguments concerned with the quest for identification of key mechanisms that produce bone resorbing osteoclasts,i.e. those mechanisms involved in osteoclast precursor proliferation and commitment, and osteoclast migration, fusion, and resorption focus on the direct effect of molecules found in the extracellular space or on the cell surface of osteoblasts or other stromal cells on osteoclast precursors and maturing osteoclasts (3Suda T. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 87-102Google Scholar). However, based on the observation that cells of the osteoblast lineage, the bone lining cells, display a cobblestone morphology and cover the bone surface in an epithelium-like manner, an additional mode of how osteoblasts may modulate the ability of osteoclasts to resorb bone has been proposed (4Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 5Zambonin Z.A. Teti A. Primavera M.V. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 235: 561-564PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, bone lining cells mechanically hinder the access of osteoclasts to the bone surface. Consequently, in order to allow osteoclasts to degrade bone matrix, bone lining cells must retreat from part of the bone surface. One of the few examples in the literature that illustrates how this may take place is parathyroid hormone (PTH)1-induced osteoblast retraction (6Tram K.K. Spencer M.J. Murray S.S. Lee D.B. Tidball J.G. Murray E.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 29: 981-987PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miller S.S. Wolf A.M. Arnaud C.D. Science. 1976; 192: 1340-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In response to PTH, osteoblasts in culture adopt a stellate morphology and expose the underlying substratum. Osteoblast retraction occurs within 1 h, is reversible, and involves cyclic AMP signaling and activation of intracellular proteases. However, whether or not the retraction of osteoblasts triggered by PTH is indeed able to increase recruitment of osteoclasts to the bone surface and, hence, to promote bone resorption has never been investigated. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is another growth factor that profoundly alters osteoblast shape (8Hurley M.M. Abreu C. Gronowicz G. Kawaguchi H. Lorenzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is one of the most abundant growth factors in skeletal tissues (9Bonewald, L. F., and Mundy, G. R. (1990) Clin. Orthop. 261–276.Google Scholar) and, in mammals, comprises three isoforms, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, all of which are expressed by bone cells (10Horner A. Kemp P. Summers C. Bord S. Bishop N.J. Kelsall A.W. Coleman N. Compston J.E. Bone. 1998; 23: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and interact with the known TGF-β receptors types I, II, and III (betaglycan) (11Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All TGF-β isoforms display similar biological activities (12Bonewald L. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 647-659Google Scholar), although one isoform may be more potent than another in a given assay (13Joyce M.E. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Bolander M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2195-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of TGF-β-induced changes in osteoblast morphology is largely unknown, numerous studies suggest that TGF-β has multiple functions in bone metabolism. In vivo studies involving the application of exogenously administered recombinant TGF-β show that TGF-β can increase bone formation and promote fracture healing (12Bonewald L. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 647-659Google Scholar,14Rosier, R. N., O'Keefe, R. J., and Hicks, D. G. (1998)Clin. Orthop. S294-S300.Google Scholar). TGF-β1 knock-out mice display an about 30% decrease in tibial length and a reduction in bone mineral content (15Geiser A.G. Zeng Q.Q. Sato M. Helvering L.M. Hirano T. Turner C.H. Bone. 1998; 23: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that TGF-β functions as a bone-forming agent. On the other hand, overexpression of TGF-β2 controlled by the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin promoter leads to bone loss (16Erlebacher A. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and mice expressing a dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor have no obvious skeletal defects apart from joint abnormalities that are probably due do chondrocyte malfunction (17Serra R. Johnson M. Filvaroff E.H. LaBorde J. Sheehan D.M. Derynck R. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting results are also reflected in numerous studies in cell and tissue cultures, where TGF-β, in dependence on particular experimental parameters, modulates various bone cell activities in opposite ways. For instance, both increases and decreases in osteoclast formation, bone resorption, osteoblast proliferation, and osteoblast differentiation have been reported (12Bonewald L. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 647-659Google Scholar, 18Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). Like the functional aspects of TGF-β action on bone cells, the intracellular signals triggered by binding of TGF-β to its receptor are numerous and complex. They include phosphorylation and activation of Smad transcription factors, regulation of Ras, Rho, and other small G-proteins, activation of protein kinases such as TGF-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and Src, recruitment of adaptor proteins and regulation of ion channels (19Visser J.A. Themmen A.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly then, TGF-β regulates expression of a spectrum of genes with potential significance for bone cell function, such as those coding for various extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors, proteinases and proteinase inhibitors, cell-cell adhesion molecules, and growth factors. The fact that some of the signaling pathways downstream from the TGF-β receptor are also common to and/or modulated by a variety of other growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules would also explain the seemingly contradictory results obtained with TGF-β in various functional assays as outlined above, i.e. the precise nature of the cellular microenvironment may determine the outcome of TGF-β action. Promotion of osteoclast recruitment through morphological transformation of osteoblasts as a result of local release and/or activation of TGF-β may represent an attractive model to explain spatiotemporal regulation of bone resorption and the functional coupling of osteoblast and osteoclasts. In this study, we set out to better define the effect of TGF-β on cell shape and to investigate the mechanism by which TGF-β induces osteoblast elongation. We provide evidence that two classes of molecules that are regulated by TGF-β1, MAP kinases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), play a pivotal role in TGF-β1-induced alterations in osteoblast shape and that osteoblast elongation promotes osteoclastic bone resorption. The mouse osteoblast cell lines MC3T3-E1 (MC) (20Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) was routinely maintained and passaged in growth medium consisting of αMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. For experiments, MC cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2 into 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar) or onto glass coverslips and maintained under serum-free conditions in α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h unless otherwise indicated. Substrata were either left untreated or coated with 30 µg/ml type I collagen (Nitta Collagen). Unless otherwise indicated, growth factors and inhibitors were added at the time of plating at the following concentrations: TGF-β1 2.5 ng/ml, bFGF 2 ng/ml, and PTH 10 nm (R&D Systems); GM6001 10 µm(AM Scientific); PD169316 10 µm, SB203580 10 µm, PD98059 10 µm, genistein 2 µm, LY294002 1 µm, chelerythrine 1 µm, aprotinin 10 µm, pepstatin 10 µm, and E-64 10 µm (Calbiochem). To analyze osteoclastic bone resorption in the presence of a bone lining cell layer, MC cells were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells/cm2 onto slices of bovine femur cortical bone (6 mm in diameter, 0.2 mm thick) placed in 96-well plates, and cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h, after which time they had formed a confluent layer of bone lining cells. MC cells were then washed once with serum-free medium, and 200 µl of cell suspension containing ∼500 osteoclasts in α-MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum were added on top of the bone lining cell layer. After a settling period of 90 min, nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the medium with αMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The culture was then continued for a further 48 h. To analyze osteoclastic bone resorption in the absence of a bone lining cell layer, MC cells were mixed with osteoclasts at the time of plating. In one set of experiments, bone lining cells were fixed with 96% ethanol for 20 min at −20 °C and washed three times with medium before osteoclasts were seeded on top of the bone lining cells. Osteoclasts were obtained as unfractionated bone cells according to the method described by Tezuka et al. (21Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, long bones from 10-day-old rabbits were minced in αMEM and gently agitated for 30 s with a vortex mixer. After sedimentation of bone fragments for 1.5 min, the supernatant was harvested and washed twice by centrifugation at 45 × gfor 2 min. Cells were then resuspended and plated as described above. To quantify cell number, the Alamar Blue assay (Trek Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. MMP-2 expression and activity were determined by gelatinase zymography (22Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) using 0.5 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) as a substrate in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were washed three times with 2.5% Triton X-100 in water and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 3 mmNaN3, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in a closed container. Gels were then stained for 30 min with 0.25% Coomassie R-250 (Sigma) in 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol and destained for 30 min with 20% acetic acid, 20% methanol, 17% ethanol, 0.6% diethylether. Gels were then dried and scanned for documentation. Western blotting was performed on total cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation buffer (30 mmNaCl, 5 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mm NaF and 50 mmNa3VO4. Loading of the gels was normalized to the amount protein, which was proportional to cell numbers as measured by Alamar Blue assay. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5) containing 5% milk powder. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with antibodies against MMP-2, MMP-13, and MMP-14 (MT-1 MMP) (from Chemicon Int.), p38 MAP kinase, phospho-p38 MAP kinase, ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase), phospho-ERK1/2, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and phospho-JNK (from New England Biolabs), and β-catenin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (from Transduction Laboratories). After washing vigorously with TBST for 1 h, membranes were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (DAKO) and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECLTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In case of immunoblotting, to detect FAK, blots were striped for re-blotting in 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62,5 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min followed by blocking and re-probing as described above. To study cell shape, cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed extensively with water, and stained with 0.5% toludine blue (Sigma) in 2.5% Na2CO3. Cell shape changes were quantified with ImagePro software by measuring the areas of the substratum that were covered and not covered by the cell monolayer. To quantify pit formation by osteoclasts at the end of the culture period, cells were scraped gently off of the bone slices with a cotton stick. The bone slices were then washed with water and stained for resorption pits with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma). After brief sonication in a water bath and subsequent washing, the resorbed area was measured using CAST-GRID software (Microsoft, Olympus). For detection of FAK by indirect immunofluorescence, cells were maintained on glass coverslips, fixed with formalin, and processed as described (23Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). FAK expression was visualized using mouse monoclonal antibodies from Transduction Laboratories and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies from Jackson Laboratories. For actin staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized with acetone for 5 min at −20 °C. Cells were rinsed several times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h in PBS. Cells were mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories) for visualization of nuclei. Osteoblasts maintained in the presence of serum have repeatedly been shown to transform from a cuboidal or cobblestone to an elongated morphology in response to TGF-β1 (8Hurley M.M. Abreu C.

When MC cells that were plated at high cell density on tissue culture plastic in chemically defined medium were exposed to TGF-β1, cell elongation was apparent after 16–24 h in culture but not at earlier time points (Fig.1A and not shown). These shape changes were accompanied by a decrease in cell spreading and, hence, by an increase in the area of cell-free substratum (Fig. 1, Aand B). Furthermore, they occurred regardless of whether TGF-β1 was added at the time of cell plating (Fig.1A) or when cells were allowed to establish a cobblestone morphology prior to TGF-β1 treatment, i.e. when TGF-β1 was added 1 day after cell plating (not shown). The effect of TGF-β1 on cell shape was dose-dependent and maximal at 2.5 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). When cells were plated on a type I collagen substratum, TGF-β1 also induced cell elongation, albeit to a lesser extent than on tissue culture plastic (Fig. 1A), an observation consistent with the reported decrease in expression of the TGF-β1 receptors in cells exposed to type I collagen (27Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The effect of TGF-β1 on cell shape was reversible when cells were treated for 1 day with TGF-β1 and subsequently maintained for another 4 days without TGF-β1 (Fig. 1C). Similar results were also obtained with cells maintained in serum-containing medium (Fig.1C). Under serum-free conditions, cell numbers increased only slightly during a 5-day culture period and were unaffected by TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, TGF-β1 reduced the time-dependent increase in cell numbers observed in serum-containing medium (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the effect of TGF-β1 on cell shape is unrelated to and independent of its effect on osteoblast proliferation. The morphological transformation in response to TGF-β1 suggests that TGF-β1 alters focal adhesion contacts and cytoskeletal organization in MC cells. To address this question, cells were labeled with phalloidin, and antibodies against FAK. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, stress fibers were much more elaborate in osteoblasts treated with TGF-β1, and localization of FAK at focal contacts was increased. Furthermore, expression of FAK protein was increased in response to an 8- and 24-hour treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 2C). MAP kinases control cell function and shape through integration of signals from the extracellular matrix and growth factors (28Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of MAP kinases by TGF-β1 has been described in several cell types (19Visser J.A. Themmen A.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the expression and activation of MAP kinases in MC cells stimulated with TGF-β1. Expression levels of the three MAP kinase members, Erk1/2, p38 MAP kinase, and JNK, were not altered by TGF-β1 (Fig.3). However, Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, but not JNK, were activated as determined by phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation/activation of Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase was obvious between 1 and 9 h after the addition of TGF-β1. At 24 h, Erk1/2 activation was no longer detectable, but p38 MAP kinase still displayed increased phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This suggests that the effect of TGF-β1 on cell shape, which is apparent after 24 h but not after 9 h of TGF-β1 treatment, is mediated by sustained activation of p38 MAP kinase but not by Erk1/2. To determine the consequences of MAP kinase activation for osteoblast morphology, cells were treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, which specifically blocks the Erk1/2 pathway and not the p38 MAP kinase pathway (29Dudley D.T.

Cells treated with TGF-β1 and PD98059 had a morphology similar to cells maintained with TGF-β1 alone (Fig.4A). In contrast, cells treated with TGF-β1 and PD169316 had morphologies similar to cells not treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, PD169316 but not PD98059 strongly reduced the increase in cell-free substratum area observed in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 4B). Results similar to those obtained with PD169316 were also obtained with the related p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (not shown). None of the MAP kinase inhibitors tested affected cell shape in the absence of TGF-β1 (not shown). To verify the specificity of the inhibitors used, we tested the effect of SB203580, PD169316, and PD98059 on both the p38 and p44/42 MAP kinase activity. PD98059 did not inhibit the p38 MAP kinase activity but totally abrogated the p44/42 MAP kinase activity as previously reported (30Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). SB203580 and PD169316 did not inhibit the p44/42 MAP kinase but blocked p38 MAP kinase activity as previously reported (31Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol.

The broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 had no significant effect on cell shape in the presence (Fig. 4, C andD) or absence (not shown) of TGF-β1. The protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine had a slight but insignificant effect on cell shape and only in the presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 4D and not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that p38 MAP kinase plays a central role in the TGF-β1-induced conversion of osteoblasts from cuboidal to elongated. It has recently been shown that MMPs can trigger the morphological transformation of epithelial cells from a cobblestone to an elongated and fusiform morphology, both in culture and in vivo (23Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar,32Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Thus, to further delineate the mechanism underlying TGF-β1-induced changes in osteoblast morphology, we next examined whether TGF-β1 alters expression of major MMPs produced by osteoblasts, namely MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-13 (collagenase-3), and MMP-14 (membrane-type 1 MMP). As judged by gelatin zymography, MC cells expressed proteolytic activity corresponding to the molecular mass of latent (72 kDa) but not active MMP-2 (67 kDa) (Fig.5). Expression of latent MMP-2, which was found in both cell culture medium and cell lysate, was not altered by TGF-β1 (Fig. 5). Likewise, MMP-14 expression, as visualized by immunoblotting, was unaffected by TGF-β1 (Fig. 5). In contrast, using immunoblot analysis, we found that MMP-13, which was barely detectable in untreated cultures, was strongly up-regulated when cells were incubated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 5). Most of the MMP-13 induced by TGF-β1 was found in the cell culture medium at both 6 and 24 h after the addition of TGF-β1, whereas only a small amount of MMP-13 was found in cell lysates and only 6 h after initiation of TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 5). Neither expression nor activation of MMP-13 induced by TGF-β1 was influenced by PD169316 (not shown), indicating that p38 MAP kinase-independent signals are involved in the up-regulation of MMP-13 expression by TGF-β1. To investigate whether MMPs contribute to the regulation of morphology by TGF-β1, cells were maintained in the presence of the broad-spectrum hydroxamate MMP inhibitor GM6001 (33Grobelny D. Poncz L. Galardy R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7152-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). GM6001 reduced cell elongation and inhibited the increase in cell-free substratum area in response to TGF-β1 by about half (Fig.6, A and B). Similar results as those with GM6001 were also obtained with the hydroxamate-type MMP inhibitor BB-94 (34Davies B. Brown P.D. East N. Crimmin M.J. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2087-2091PubMed Google Scholar) and with the phosphinate-type MMP inhibitor 11A (35Buchardt J. Ferreras M. Krog-Jensen C. Delaissé J.-M. Foged N.T. Meldal M. Chem. Eur. J. 1999; 10: 2877-2884Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (not shown). This effect of MMP inhibitors was specific, because the serine proteinase inhibitor aprotinin, the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64, and the aspartyl proteinase inhibitor pepstatin were without effect on the TGF-β1-induced changes in cell shape (Fig. 6, A and B). None of the proteinase inhibitors used affected cell number or cell shape in the absence of TGF-β1 (not shown). GM6001 did not affect the induction by TGF-β of either the p38 or p44/42 MAP kinase (not shown). Thus, MMPs appear to play an important role in the TGF-β1-induced shape changes. To examine whether p38 MAP kinases and MMPs are selectively involved in the regulation of cell shape by TGF-β1, the ability of PD169316 and GM6001 to interfere with the inhibition of proliferation by TGF-β1 was studied in serum-containing medium. Under these conditions, Neither PD169316 nor GM6001 affected cell number in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 7A). The same observati"

Although significant information has been reported on the molecular mechanisms by which Sp1-like activators function, relatively little is known about mechanisms for repressor proteins. Here we report the functional characterization of BTEB3, a ubiquitously expressed Sp1-like transcriptional repressor.

Reporter and gel shift assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells show that BTEB3 can also mediate repression by competing with Sp1 for BTE binding. Thus, the characterization of this protein expands the repertoire of BTEB-like members of the Sp1 family involved in transcriptional repression.

Thus, understanding how Sp1-like proteins bind DNA and regulate transcription is important to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying a large number of cellular events.The existence of at least 17 different Sp1-like proteins offers a significant challenge for understanding how individual members regulate gene expression in a tissue-, cell-, and promoter-specific manner. One mechanism leading to specificity among Sp1-like proteins is a differential pattern of expression. For instance, Sp1, TIEG2, and BTEB11 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the KLF proteins are restricted to certain tissues. Specificity among Sp1-like proteins is also dictated by recognition of DNA. For example, the Sp proteins preferentially bind GC sites (19Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 20Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) whereas the KLF subgroup prefers the CA site (21Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Matsumoto N. Laub F. Aldabe R. Zhang W. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, co-expressed Sp1-like proteins exhibiting similar binding specificity, such as Sp1 and Sp3, but often display opposite transcriptional regulatory properties (24Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J.

Chem. 1999; 270: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, activators and repressors that bind to the same sequence may have evolved to turn on and off a discrete set of promoters by competing for this site. In this regard, emerging evidence indicates that Sp1-like proteins are able to compete for DNA binding, such as has been reported for BTEB1/Sp1/GKLF (8Zhang W. Shields J.M. Kazuhiro S.

Together, the results of these mechanistic studies on competition between Sp1-like proteins validate many of the predictions derived from sequence homology data, suggesting that these proteins regulate similar sequences in vivo.The molecular mechanisms behind the function of the Sp1-like activators have been extensively reported in the literature. For example, both Sp1 and EKLF have been shown to activate transcription by interacting with co-activators (13Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms involved in the function of Sp1-like repressor proteins are less defined. The Sp1-like proteins involved in transcriptional repression include the TIEG proteins (9Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T. Cook T. Urrutia R. J. Clin.

Biol. 1999; 19: 194-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, only BKLF and a closely related protein, BKLF2/KLF8, have been shown to associate with co-repressors (34van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because it is likely that these proteins bind similar sequences, an important question that remains is whether the mechanism of repression is similar between all Sp1-like repressors or whether Sp1-like subfamilies are defined by distinct mechanisms of repression.In this study, we have pursued this question by characterizing the human transcriptional repressor BTEB3, a novel Sp1-like protein that is significantly related to BTEB1. A partial sequence of this protein was recently published with the name of NSLP1 from our laboratory (37Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but in light of its sequence similarity and functional conservation with BTEB1, we have renamed it BTEB3. This study focuses on the characterization of BTEB3 as a transcriptional repressor with two mechanisms of action: competition with the activator Sp1 and interaction with the co-repressor mSin3A and the histone deacetylase protein HDAC-1. These results expand our understanding of the functional properties of BTEB-related Sp1-like proteins and suggest that these proteins have evolved at least in part to balance the activating function of Sp1. Our data also provide evidence that different subfamilies of Sp1-like transcriptional repressor proteins, such as BTEBs and BKLFs, may function via association with distinct co-repressors.DISCUSSIONHere, we have characterized the transcriptional repressor and DNA binding activities of BTEB3, a novel member of the BTEB subfamily of Sp1-like proteins. We demonstrated that the BTEB3 N-terminal repressor activity was TSA-sensitive and associated with mSin3A and HDAC-1in vivo (Fig. 2). However, TSA did not completely reduce BTEB3-mediated repression, a phenomenon also observed for the well characterized mSin3A-interacting protein Mad1 (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R.

Interestingly, mSin3A lacking the HDAC-1 interacting domain can still repress (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which indicates that other mechanisms participate in mSin3a-mediated repression. Thus, in a similar manner, other histone deacetylase-independent co-repressors or chromatin remodeling complexes may contribute to BTEB3 repression activity.The N terminus of BTEB3 contains three separable repressor domains (R1, R2, and R3) (Fig. 3). R1 is separated from R2 by a linker and exhibits homology to the R1 domains of TIEG proteins, which bind to mSin3A (50Zhang J.-S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as a distinct repressor domain in vivo. In contrast, since a linker does not separate R2 and R3, these may comprise a single repression domain. Fig. 4 shows that each domain silences transcription of a BTE-containing promoter via the native DNA binding domain to the same extent as the full-length protein. This is different from the data of the GAL4 assay (Fig. 3), which show that each domain is less potent than the entire N terminus. This discrepancy may be due to different basal promoters present in the reporter constructs (promoter context). In addition, different DNA binding domains and associated proteins may influence the function of these domains. Currently, it is difficult to define which of these possibilities is operating in vivo. Fig. 4Ddemonstrates that the repression domains of BTEB3 bind mSin3A, but not HDAC-1, supporting a model in which BTEB3 directly interacts with mSin3A, to recruit HDAC-1. These data are consistent with results showing that mSin3A and HDAC-1 co-precipitate with BTEB3 (Fig.2C). Thus, BTEB3 represses transcription by a mechanism involving the recruitment of the HDAC-1·mSin3A complex via three N-terminal repression domains.Since Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed, displacing it from promoters by competition may be a significant mechanism of repression. Fig. 5 shows that BTEB3 binds the BTE element with an affinity comparable to Sp1, suggesting that competition between the two proteins is possible. Fig.6 shows that BTEB3 does compete with Sp1 to antagonize its activation function. These data support a model in which competition with Sp1 via the zinc finger domain can contribute to the repressor function of BTEB3. To evaluate the contribution of each mechanism to the overall repression of BTEB3, we created a BTEB3 mutant containing the zinc fingers and evaluated its ability to compete with and antagonize Sp1. Fig. 6A shows that this domain can compete with Sp1 similar to the full-length protein. It also retains its ability to repress a BTE-containing promoter, although to a lesser degree than the full-length protein (Fig. 6C). Since the BTEB3 zinc finger domain alone is not able to interact with co-repressor proteins (Fig.2C) but retains partial repression activity, this further supports the idea that BTEB3 represses transcription by competing with Sp1. Thus, it is likely that, in vivo, the competition for DNA binding as well as direct repressor function are acting together to suppress transcription at promoters activated by Sp1. However, the contribution of these mechanisms to the overall repression activity may vary according to promoter context, co-repressor availability, or signaling. This model is attractive since a potent repression mechanism of this type may be required to counterbalance Sp1-mediated activation, the major GC binding activity detected in most mammalian cells. Indeed, several Sp1-like proteins may function according to this model, including BTEB1 (26Sogawa K. Kikuchi Y. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Sp3 (25Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol.

In addition, like BTEB3, some of these proteins also contain an N-terminal repressor activity. Thus, it is likely that both of these mechanisms of regulation may be a common motif among a subset of Sp1-like proteins.Recently, BTEB3 has been reported to display activator function (41Martin K.

Indeed, the activation previously reported for BTEB3 was observed in a different promoter context and includes the SV40 (41Martin K. Cooper W. Metcalfe J. Kemp P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), β-globin (40Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RANTES (42Song A. Chen Y. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T. Krensky A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) promoters. In addition, the cell lines used for these studies may also express other factors that have an effect on both the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activity of BTEB3. These differences in the systems need to be taken into consideration when evaluating the data and will require further investigation to better understand BTEB3-mediated transcriptional control.In summary, the fact that BTEB3 can repress transcription through at least two mechanisms makes it a good candidate for a repressor that can counterbalance the potent activator function of Sp1 on GC promoters. More importantly, we show that BTEB3 represses transcription by a mechanism different from that of BKLF proteins, suggesting that Sp1-like proteins can be classified into subgroups based on the mode of repression. However, it remains possible that these proteins interact with different co-repressors under different conditions and future experiments may better clarify these data. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that Sp1-like proteins with similar DNA binding domains but different transcription regulatory properties have evolved to provide fine-tune gene expression regulation on certain GC-rich sequences present in mammalian promoters. Sp1-like proteins, defined by the presence of three highly homologous C-terminal zinc finger motifs and variant N-terminal domains, are emerging as important regulators of cell homeostasis. Promoters containing Sp1-like sites are essential for the expression of numerous genes necessary for cell cycle progression (1Muller C. Yang R. Beck-von-Peccoz L. Idos G. Verbeek W. Koeffler H.P. J.

In addition, the disruption of some Sp1-like genes in mice shows that these proteins are critical for normal development (12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M.

Thus, understanding how Sp1-like proteins bind DNA and regulate transcription is important to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying a large number of cellular events. The existence of at least 17 different Sp1-like proteins offers a significant challenge for understanding how individual members regulate gene expression in a tissue-, cell-, and promoter-specific manner. One mechanism leading to specificity among Sp1-like proteins is a differential pattern of expression. For instance, Sp1, TIEG2, and BTEB11 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the KLF proteins are restricted to certain tissues. Specificity among Sp1-like proteins is also dictated by recognition of DNA. For example, the Sp proteins preferentially bind GC sites (19Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 20Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) whereas the KLF subgroup prefers the CA site (21Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Matsumoto N. Laub F. Aldabe R. Zhang W. Ramirez F. Yoshida T. Terada M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Interestingly, co-expressed Sp1-like proteins exhibiting similar binding specificity, such as Sp1 and Sp3, but often display opposite transcriptional regulatory properties (24Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 270: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, activators and repressors that bind to the same sequence may have evolved to turn on and off a discrete set of promoters by competing for this site. In this regard, emerging evidence indicates that Sp1-like proteins are able to compete for DNA binding, such as has been reported for BTEB1/Sp1/GKLF (8Zhang W. Shields J.M. Kazuhiro S.

Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Together, the results of these mechanistic studies on competition between Sp1-like proteins validate many of the predictions derived from sequence homology data, suggesting that these proteins regulate similar sequences in vivo. The molecular mechanisms behind the function of the Sp1-like activators have been extensively reported in the literature. For example, both Sp1 and EKLF have been shown to activate transcription by interacting with co-activators (13Billon N. Carlisi D. Datto M.B. van Grunsven L.A. Watt A. Wang X.F. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 29Ryu S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms involved in the function of Sp1-like repressor proteins are less defined. The Sp1-like proteins involved in transcriptional repression include the TIEG proteins (9Tachibana I. Imoto M. Adjei P. Gores G.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T. Cook T. Urrutia R. J. Clin.

Biol. 1999; 19: 194-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, only BKLF and a closely related protein, BKLF2/KLF8, have been shown to associate with co-repressors (34van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because it is likely that these proteins bind similar sequences, an important question that remains is whether the mechanism of repression is similar between all Sp1-like repressors or whether Sp1-like subfamilies are defined by distinct mechanisms of repression. In this study, we have pursued this question by characterizing the human transcriptional repressor BTEB3, a novel Sp1-like protein that is significantly related to BTEB1. A partial sequence of this protein was recently published with the name of NSLP1 from our laboratory (37Cook T. Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 880: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but in light of its sequence similarity and functional conservation with BTEB1, we have renamed it BTEB3. This study focuses on the characterization of BTEB3 as a transcriptional repressor with two mechanisms of action: competition with the activator Sp1 and interaction with the co-repressor mSin3A and the histone deacetylase protein HDAC-1. These results expand our understanding of the functional properties of BTEB-related Sp1-like proteins and suggest that these proteins have evolved at least in part to balance the activating function of Sp1. Our data also provide evidence that different subfamilies of Sp1-like transcriptional repressor proteins, such as BTEBs and BKLFs, may function via association with distinct co-repressors. DISCUSSIONHere, we have characterized the transcriptional repressor and DNA binding activities of BTEB3, a novel member of the BTEB subfamily of Sp1-like proteins. We demonstrated that the BTEB3 N-terminal repressor activity was TSA-sensitive and associated with mSin3A and HDAC-1in vivo (Fig. 2). However, TSA did not completely reduce BTEB3-mediated repression, a phenomenon also observed for the well characterized mSin3A-interacting protein Mad1 (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mSin3A lacking the HDAC-1 interacting domain can still repress (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar,47Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which indicates that other mechanisms participate in mSin3a-mediated repression. Thus, in a similar manner, other histone deacetylase-independent co-repressors or chromatin remodeling complexes may contribute to BTEB3 repression activity.The N terminus of BTEB3 contains three separable repressor domains (R1, R2, and R3) (Fig. 3). R1 is separated from R2 by a linker and exhibits homology to the R1 domains of TIEG proteins, which bind to mSin3A (50Zhang J.-S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as a distinct repressor domain in vivo. In contrast, since a linker does not separate R2 and R3, these may comprise a single repression domain. Fig. 4 shows that each domain silences transcription of a BTE-containing promoter via the native DNA binding domain to the same extent as the full-length protein. This is different from the data of the GAL4 assay (Fig. 3), which show that each domain is less potent than the entire N terminus. This discrepancy may be due to different basal promoters present in the reporter constructs (promoter context). In addition, different DNA binding domains and associated proteins may influence the function of these domains. Currently, it is difficult to define which of these possibilities is operating in vivo. Fig. 4Ddemonstrates that the repression domains of BTEB3 bind mSin3A, but not HDAC-1, supporting a model in which BTEB3 directly interacts with mSin3A, to recruit HDAC-1.

Thus, BTEB3 represses transcription by a mechanism involving the recruitment of the HDAC-1·mSin3A complex via three N-terminal repression domains.Since Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed, displacing it from promoters by competition may be a significant mechanism of repression. Fig. 5 shows that BTEB3 binds the BTE element with an affinity comparable to Sp1, suggesting that competition between the two proteins is possible. Fig.6 shows that BTEB3 does compete with Sp1 to antagonize its activation function. These data support a model in which competition with Sp1 via the zinc finger domain can contribute to the repressor function of BTEB3. To evaluate the contribution of each mechanism to the overall repression of BTEB3, we created a BTEB3 mutant containing the zinc fingers and evaluated its ability to compete with and antagonize Sp1. Fig. 6A shows that this domain can compete with Sp1 similar to the full-length protein. It also retains its ability to repress a BTE-containing promoter, although to a lesser degree than the full-length protein (Fig. 6C). Since the BTEB3 zinc finger domain alone is not able to interact with co-repressor proteins (Fig.2C) but retains partial repression activity, this further supports the idea that BTEB3 represses transcription by competing with Sp1. Thus, it is likely that, in vivo, the competition for DNA binding as well as direct repressor function are acting together to suppress transcription at promoters activated by Sp1.

J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), β-globin (40Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RANTES (42Song A. Chen Y. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T. Krensky A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) promoters. In addition, the cell lines used for these studies may also express other factors that have an effect on both the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activity of BTEB3. These differences in the systems need to be taken into consideration when evaluating the data and will require further investigation to better understand BTEB3-mediated transcriptional control.In summary, the fact that BTEB3 can repress transcription through at least two mechanisms makes it a good candidate for a repressor that can counterbalance the potent activator function of Sp1 on GC promoters. More importantly, we show that BTEB3 represses transcription by a mechanism different from that of BKLF proteins, suggesting that Sp1-like proteins can be classified into subgroups based on the mode of repression. However, it remains possible that these proteins interact with different co-repressors under different conditions and future experiments may better clarify these data. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that Sp1-like proteins with similar DNA binding domains but different transcription regulatory properties have evolved to provide fine-tune gene expression regulation on certain GC-rich sequences present in mammalian promoters. Here, we have characterized the transcriptional repressor and DNA binding activities of BTEB3, a novel member of the BTEB subfamily of Sp1-like proteins. We demonstrated that the BTEB3 N-terminal repressor activity was TSA-sensitive and associated with mSin3A and HDAC-1in vivo (Fig. 2). However, TSA did not completely reduce BTEB3-mediated repression, a phenomenon also observed for the well characterized mSin3A-interacting protein Mad1 (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mSin3A lacking the HDAC-1 interacting domain can still repress (46Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar,47Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which indicates that other mechanisms participate in mSin3a-mediated repression. Thus, in a similar manner, other histone deacetylase-independent co-repressors or chromatin remodeling complexes may contribute to BTEB3 repression activity. The N terminus of BTEB3 contains three separable repressor domains (R1, R2, and R3) (Fig. 3). R1 is separated from R2 by a linker and exhibits homology to the R1 domains of TIEG proteins, which bind to mSin3A (50Zhang J.-S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as a distinct repressor domain in vivo. In contrast, since a linker does not separate R2 and R3, these may comprise a single repression domain. Fig. 4 shows that each domain silences transcription of a BTE-containing promoter via the native DNA binding domain to the same extent as the full-length protein. This is different from the data of the GAL4 assay (Fig. 3), which show that each domain is less potent than the entire N terminus. This discrepancy may be due to different basal promoters present in the reporter constructs (promoter context). In addition, different DNA binding domains and associated proteins may influence the function of these domains. Currently, it is difficult to define which of these possibilities is operating in vivo. Fig. 4Ddemonstrates that the repression domains of BTEB3 bind mSin3A, but not HDAC-1, supporting a model in which BTEB3 directly interacts with mSin3A, to recruit HDAC-1. These data are consistent with results showing that mSin3A and HDAC-1 co-precipitate with BTEB3 (Fig.2C). Thus, BTEB3 represses transcription by a mechanism involving the recruitment of the HDAC-1·mSin3A complex via three N-terminal repression domains. Since Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed, displacing it from promoters by competition may be a significant mechanism of repression. Fig. 5 shows that BTEB3 binds the BTE element with an affinity comparable to Sp1, suggesting that competition between the two proteins is possible. Fig.6 shows that BTEB3 does compete with Sp1 to antagonize its activation function. These data support a model in which competition with Sp1 via the zinc finger domain can contribute to the repressor function of BTEB3. To evaluate the contribution of each mechanism to the overall repression of BTEB3, we created a BTEB3 mutant containing the zinc fingers and evaluated its ability to compete with and antagonize Sp1. Fig. 6A shows that this domain can compete with Sp1 similar to the full-length protein. It also retains its ability to repress a BTE-containing promoter, although to a lesser degree than the full-length protein (Fig. 6C). Since the BTEB3 zinc finger domain alone is not able to interact with co-repressor proteins (Fig.2C) but retains partial repression activity, this further supports the idea that BTEB3 represses transcription by competing with Sp1. Thus, it is likely that, in vivo, the competition for DNA binding as well as direct repressor function are acting together to suppress transcription at promoters activated by Sp1. However, the contribution of these mechanisms to the overall repression activity may vary according to promoter context, co-repressor availability, or signaling. This model is attractive since a potent repression mechanism of this type may be required to counterbalance Sp1-mediated activation, the major GC binding activity detected in most mammalian cells. Indeed, several Sp1-like proteins may function according to this model, including BTEB1 (26Sogawa K. Kikuchi Y. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Sp3 (25Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol.

In addition, like BTEB3, some of these proteins also contain an N-terminal repressor activity. Thus, it is likely that both of these mechanisms of regulation may be a common motif among a subset of Sp1-like proteins. Recently, BTEB3 has been reported to display activator function (41Martin K. Cooper W. Metcalfe J. Kemp P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,42Song A. Chen Y. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T. Krensky A.

In this regard, although we do not rule that this protein may have activator function, the detailed characterization reported here strongly supports a repressor role for this gene.

Release from this store regulates the bulk average [Ca2+]c both directly (1Somlyo A.V. Bond M. Somlyo A.P. Scarpa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5231-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and indirectly either via modulation of the plasmalemmal membrane potential (2Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D.

Sci. 1994; 15: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The magnitude, time course, and frequency of the SR Ca2+ signal depend on the functional interaction, localization, and arrangement of the Ins(1,4,5)P3R and RyR on the SR store(s). Although, morphologically, the SR appears as an interconnected network of tubules (4Somlyo A.P. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), it may adopt different configurations within the cell and components may detach and reattach thereby influencing the pattern and distribution of the RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R (6Lee C. Chen L.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,7Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In Purkinje neurons, for example, Ins(1,4,5)P3R-expressing regions may detach from other internal store elements (8Yamamoto A. Otsu H. Yoshimori T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, different Ca2+concentrations have been found within the lumen of the SR (10Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggesting that discontinuities may exist within the structures surrounding the lumen itself. This provides a morphological basis for the existence of various arrangements of Ca2+ stores. The SR Ca2+ stores in smooth muscle are classified on the basis of the arrangement of Ins(1,4,5)P3R and RyR; yet conflicting evidence exists regarding their number. A single store, containing both RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R, has been proposed, based on the observation that caffeine (which activates RyR) prevented Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release (e.g. 11–16). Two separate Ca2+ stores have also been proposed, one that expresses only RyR, the other only Ins(1,4,5)P3R. In support of this latter view, depletion of the RyR-sensitive store failed to abolish agonist-evoked Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release and vice versa (17Young S.H. Ennes H.S. MacRoberts J.A. Chaban V.V. Dea S.K. Mayer E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1204-G1212PubMed Google Scholar). More elaborate arrangements of SR Ca2+ stores have also been proposed. In some smooth muscles (e.g. taenia coli, pulmonary artery, myometrium) one store may express both RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R, whereas a second, in the same cell, may express Ins(1,4,5)P3R alone (18Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Iino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 45-52Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Yamazawa T. Iino M. Endo M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Conversely, one store expressing both RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R and a second separate store RyR alone have also been suggested (21Baró I. Eisner D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 247-258Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further support for the existence of two separate stores has come from studies on the response of each of the receptors to inhibitors of the SR Ca2+ pump, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), each of which depletes the stores of Ca2+. Differences in the sensitivity to the pump inhibitors of the Ca2+ release evoked by either caffeine or Ins(1,4,5)P3 have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of separate stores for each receptor (5Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 16Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J.

For example, in arterial myocytes the ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive store was not sensitive to either thapsigargin or CPA, whereas the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ store was depleted by each (16Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C22-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tribe R.M. Borin M.L. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5908-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The situation has been complicated further by the proposed existence in murine bladder smooth muscle cells (23Sugita M. Tokutomi N. Tokutomi Y. Terasaki H. Nishi K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of three Ca2+ stores, one containing RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R, another expressing only Ins(1,4,5)P3R, and a third containing only RyR. Whereas the proposed arrangements of RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R may reflect the complexity of the underlying biology, differences in experimental approaches may also have contributed to the variety of views expressed. For example, caffeine, commonly used to activate RyR, also inhibits Ins(1,4,5)P3R (24Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Bezprozvanny I. Bezprozvanny S. Ehrlich B.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In some studies (e.g. 12Bolton T.B. Lim S.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 409: 385-401Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Baró I. Eisner D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 247-258Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) caffeine remained present while an Ins(1,4,5)P3-generating agonist was applied. Invariably, such experiments demonstrated an inhibition of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated response and the results have been taken as evidence for the existence of a common Ca2+ store. Inhibition of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor by caffeine, rather than depletion of a common store, could have accounted for the absence of response to an Ins(1,4,5)P3-generating agonist. Additional difficulties in the classification of SR Ca2+stores, i.e. their location and number, have followed the use of plasmalemmal agonists and the multiple, yet separate, biochemical pathways so activated. Two particular aspects of such difficulties are evident. First, when membrane currents are used as indicators of [Ca2+]c, agonists may modify these currents independently of SR Ca2+ release (e.g.28Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1528-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schubert R. Noack T. Serebryakov V.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C648-C658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, regulation of the RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P3R by Ca2+ derived from agonist activation of several different biochemical pathways may occur with misleading consequences. For example, in rabbit portal vein, depletion of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store, by norepinephrine, abolished the response to caffeine (which acts on the RyR (27Komori S. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), consistent with both receptors residing on a common Ca2+ store. On the other hand, Ca2+ released from the SR via Ins(1,4,5)P3R activation may have triggered a regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) at the RyR (11Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1528-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could have amplified the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient. If so, two outcomes could be anticipated (a) the continued presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3 could deplete the RyR-sensitive Ca2+ pool; (b) depletion of the RyR-sensitive Ca2+ pool would reduce the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3. Either of these results could be misinterpreted as support for the existence of a common Ca2+ store. Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is important to determine the arrangement of Ca2+ stores in smooth muscle to help clarify the precise mechanisms of Ca2+ release, a vital ingredient in our understanding of contractility. This problem has been addressed in the current investigation by seeking answers to the following questions: 1) Are Ins(1,4,5)P3R and RyR present on the same store or on separate stores of the SR? 2) Does Ca2+released from the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store trigger CICR via activation of the RyR? 3) Are there differences between the refilling mechanisms of Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive and ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores? In this study freshly isolated single smooth muscle cells rather than multicellular preparations were used, removing the difficulty of there being different store characteristics existing in different cells or of store reorganization, which may accompany the use of cell culture preparations. Ca2+ influx was controlled under voltage clamp conditions and directly measured in this investigation. Flash photolysis of caged Ins(1,4,5)P3(Ins(1,4,5)P3) and caffeine were each used to minimize activation of second messenger systems so that a clearer understanding of the control of Ca2+ release from the receptors could be obtained. From the results of the present study it is proposed that two functionally distinct SR Ca2+ stores exist in colonic myocytes; one expressing both Ins(1,4,5)P3R and RyR and dependent upon an external Ca2+ source for replenishment and a second store containing only RyR, which can be refilled form [Ca2+]c. From male guinea pigs (500–700 g) stunned by a blow to the head and immediately killed by exsanguination, a segment of distal colon (∼5 cm) was removed. The circular muscle was separated from the longitudinal layer, and single cells were prepared from the former using a two-step enzymatic process (30McCarron J.G. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 149-161Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), stored at 4 °C, and used the same day. Cells were voltage-clamped in the dialyzed whole cell configuration. Currents were amplified by an Axopatch 1D (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), low pass filtered at 500 Hz (8-pole Bessel filter, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), and digitally sampled at 1.5 kHz using a Digidata interface, pCLAMP software (version 6.0.1, Axon Instruments), and Axotape (Axon Instruments) and stored for analysis. Cells were held at a membrane potential (Vm) of −70 mV unless otherwise indicated.

The Ca2+-free bathing solution contained MgCl2 (3 mm) and EGTA (1 mm). The pipette solution contained (mm): Cs2SO4, 85; CsCl, 20; MgCl2, 1; MgATP, 3; pyruvic acid, 2.5; malic acid, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1; creatine phosphate, 5; GTP, 0.5; HEPES, 30; fluo-3 penta-ammonium salt, 0.1; caged Ins(1,4,5)P3, 0.025; pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH. The access afforded by the whole cell patch electrode allowed entry into the cell of the membrane-impermeant fluo-3 and caged Ins(1,4,5)P3. [Ca2+]c was measured using the membrane-impermeable fluo-3 (penta-ammonium salt). Fluorescence measurements were made using a microfluorometer consisting of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot) and a photomultiplier tube with a bi-alkali photocathode. Fluo-3 was excited at 488 nm (bandpass 9 nm) from a PTI Delta Scan (Photon Technology International Inc., East Sheen, London, UK) through the epi-illumination port of the microscope (using one arm of a bifurcated quartz fiber optic bundle). Excitation light was passed through a field stop diaphragm, to reduce background fluorescence, and reflected off a 505-nm long-pass dichroic mirror; emitted light was guided through a 535-nm barrier filter (bandpass 35 nm) to a photomultiplier in photon-counting mode. Longer wavelengths, from bright field illumination with a 610-nm Shott glass filter, were reflected onto a charge-coupled device camera (Sony model XC-75) mounted onto the viewing port of the Delta Scan thus allowing the cell to be monitored during experiments. Interference filters and dichroic mirrors were obtained from Glen Spectra (London, UK). To photolyze caged Ins(1,4,5)P3 the output of a xenon flashlamp (Rapp OptoElektronic, Hamburg, Germany) was passed though a UG-5 filter to select ultraviolet light and merged into the excitation light path of the microfluorometer using the second arm of the quartz bifurcated fiber optic bundle. The nominal flash lamp energy was 57 mJ, measured at the output of the fiber optic bundle. The flash duration was about 1 ms. Caffeine (10 mm) was applied by hydrostatic pressure (Pneumatic PicoPump PV820, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (18–22 °C), and drugs were applied either hydrostatically via a pipette or into the bathing solution as indicated in the text. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ were expressed as a ratio (F/Fo) of the fluorescence counts (F) relative to baseline counts before stimulation (Fo). ΔF/Fo indicates the magnitude of the change in F/Fo at the peak of the evoked transient relative to the baseline ratio. Original fluorescence records were not filtered, smoothed, or averaged. Background fluorescence was not subtracted. Statistical analyses were performed using either Mann-Whitney tests (on normalized data) or paired Student's t tests (on raw data). Summarized data are shown as means ± S.E. and taken to be statistically significant whenp < 0.05. n indicates numbers of cells used. fluo-3 penta-ammonium salt was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Caged Ins(1,4,5)P3 trisodium salt, thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and ryanodine were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. Thapsigargin, forskolin CPA, and ryanodine were each dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, to give a final bath concentration <0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Ca2+-free Eagle's minimum essential spinner medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). Papain and collagenase were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., UK or Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, UK (Poole, UK). Depolarization from a membrane potential (Vm) of −70 mV to 0 mV (Fig. 1C) activated a voltage-dependent Ca2+ current averaging −160 ± 18 pA (Fig. 1D) and a transient increase in [Ca2+]c, which averaged 1.83 ± 0.15 F/Fo units above baseline (ΔF/Fo; n = 59;p < 0.001;Fig. 1A). Flash photolysis of caged Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Ins(1,4,5)P3,upward-pointing arrows) increased [Ca2+]c by an average of 2.26 ± 0.19 ΔF/Fo (n = 59;p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). Caffeine (Fig.1B) elevated [Ca2+]c by 2.05 ± 0.18 ΔF/Fo (n = 59;p < 0.001) through activation of RyR. Ins(1,4,5)P3 and caffeine each evoked reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c when applied at ∼50-s intervals. To test this, the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3, following depletion of the ryanodine-sensitive store by caffeine, was examined. At −70 mV, Ins(1,4,5)P3 evoked approximately reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c (3.28 ± 0.35 ΔF/Fo; n = 5; Fig.2, A and B) as did caffeine (Fig. 2C, 3.12 ± 0.2 ΔF/Fo, n = 5, Fig.2, A and B). Caffeine-evoked Ca2+transients were inhibited to 6 ± 3% of controls by ryanodine (50 μm; 0.14 ± 0.08 ΔF/Fo; n = 5;p < 0.001). Significantly, after this inhibition of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient, the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient was reduced to 7 ± 2% of control values (0.19 ± 0.04 ΔF/Fo; n = 5;p < 0.001; Fig. 2). These results are compatible with the view that Ins(1,4,5)P3R and RyR exist on a common SR Ca2+ store. If on the other hand two separate stores exist, i.e. one for Ins(1,4,5)P3R and another for RyR, release of a small amount of Ca2+ from the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store could trigger a further, larger release of Ca2+ from the separate ryanodine-sensitive store by CICR. If so, depletion of the ryanodine-sensitive store, by caffeine and ryanodine, would reduce the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked response. If Ca2+, released through the Ins(1,4,5)P3R, triggered CICR at the RyR, ryanodine alone would reduce Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transients. This was not observed (Fig.3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 evoked reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c of similar magnitude in the presence (50 μm) and absence of ryanodine (n = 5, Fig. 3, Vm = −70 mV). Thus Ca2+ released by Ins(1,4,5)P3 did not subsequently trigger CICR from the RyR, and this provides further evidence for the existence of a common Ca2+ store. In other investigations, reduction, by ryanodine, of the Ca2+transient evoked by Ins(1,4,5)P3-generating agents was interpreted as evidence that Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ activates CICR at the RyR (11Boittin F.X. Macrez N. Halet G. Mironneau J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C139-C151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jaggar J.H. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1528-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmalemma agonists used in these experiments to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3could also have activated other second messengers that in turn sensitized the RyR to Ca2+ enabling Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ release to activate CICR at the RyR. Alternatively, Ca2+ release from the SR store may activate further Ca2+ release under conditions of “store overload” (31Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C148-C159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Trafford A.W. Lipp P. O'Neill S.C. Niggli E. Einser D.A. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such store overload conditions could conceivably arise in some smooth muscle types, facilitating CICR. To ensure that the absence of an Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient following depletion of the ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive store (Fig. 2) was due neither to inactivation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3R by caffeine (24Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Bezprozvanny I. Bezprozvanny S. Ehrlich B.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) nor to allocation of an inadequate period for store refilling after caffeine, the time course of recovery of the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 after caffeine was examined at −70 mV. The magnitude of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked transient was reduced to 3 ± 1% 10 s after caffeine (n = 5; Fig.4, A and G). Recovery was time-dependent; 50 s after exposure to caffeine the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient had returned to 92 ± 5% of controls (n = 6; Fig.4, E and G). These results suggest that, at the time intervals used (50–60 s), neither inactivation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3R by caffeine nor an insufficient time period for store refilling accounted for the inhibition of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient by caffeine and ryanodine (Fig. 2). Collectively, the data (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) suggest that all Ins(1,4,5)P3R exist on a store that also contains RyR. To determine whether or not all RyR were present on the store that contained Ins(1,4,5)P3R, the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store was depleted by removal of external Ca2+ and the ability of caffeine to activate the RyR and evoke a Ca2+ transient was examined. Refilling of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store is dependent on external Ca2+ (33McCarron J.G. Flynn E.R.M. Bradley K.N. Muir T.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 113-124Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and removing it reduced the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 to 5 ± 2% of controls (n = 6; p < 0.05;Vm = −70 mV, Fig. 5). However, after the almost complete loss of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked transient, caffeine evoked a Ca2+ transient that averaged 74 ± 25% of control values (n = 6; p < 0.05; Fig. 5). These results are consistent with there being a second separate Ca2+ store that contains only RyR. The above results (Fig. 5) raised the possibility that the degree of dependence of the two stores on external Ca2+ for Ca2+ release may differ. This was examined following withdrawal of external Ca2+ by investigating the refilling of the RyR- and Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive stores after either caffeine or Ins(1,4,5)P3. The caffeine-evoked Ca2+transient (via RyR; Fig. 6A) was reduced, on average, to some 87 ± 9% of controls (n = 5; p = 0.5; Fig. 6, Aand B). In contrast, the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transient (acting through Ins(1,4,5)P3R) was reduced to 6 ± 2% of controls (Fig. 6B; see Fig.5). These results suggest that, unlike the situation with the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ store (Fig. 5), Ca2+ release from the RyR by caffeine may be recycled so that refilling is largely independent of external Ca2+. Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase activity and so may elevate the intracellular concentration of cAMP ([cAMP]c) (34Butcher T.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1244-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The persistence of the store Ca2+content, in the absence of external Ca2+, as indicated by the maintained amplitude of the caffeine-evoked Ca2+transient, could have arisen from stimulation of SERCA by an elevated [cAMP]c due to caffeine (35Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) rather than to a difference in the refilling mechanism. To examine this possibility, dependence of Ins(1,4,5)P3 store refilling on external Ca2+was examined when [cAMP]c had been increased (a) by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (500 μm) and (b) by forskolin (1 μm), which stimulates adenylate cyclase thereby raising [cAMP]c. In the absence of either drug, Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+transients of approximately reproducible amplitude that averaged 1.89 ± 0.12 ΔF/Fo(n = 6). Following incubation (10 min) with either IBMX or forskolin, Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked transients of approximately reproducible amplitude (2.18 ± 0.67 ΔF/Fo; n = 6; Fig.7, for IBMX), which were not significantly different from controls. Upon removal of external Ca2+, in the continued presence of either IBMX or forskolin, repeated application of Ins(1,4,5)P3 depleted the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive store as evidenced by the decline in the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient. With IBMX, after the fourth Ins(1,4,5)P3 challenge, the Ca2+ increase averaged 15 ± 3% of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ transients observed in IBMX in the presence of external Ca2+ (0.56 ± 0.31 ΔF/Fo; p < 0.01;n = 6; Fig. 7). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with forskolin. Removal of external Ca2+ again inhibited the amplitude of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked transient significantly to 8 ± 3% of controls (p< 0.05 by Mann-Whitney test; data not shown; Vm = −70 mV). In these same cells only 3 ± 2% of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked transient remained in the presence of forskolin (1 μm) following the removal of external Ca2+ (n = 3; p < 0.05 by Mann-Whitney test). Together the results with IBMX and forskolin indicated that elevation of [cAMP]c is unlikely to offset the effect of external Ca2+ withdrawal on store content. Ca2+ stores have been differentiated on the basis of their sensitivity to the SERCA inhibitors cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin (5Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 36Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.-C. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

The ability of CPA and thapsigargin to each inhibit Ins(1,4,5)P3- and caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients was therefore examined. Cells were once again held at a membrane potential of −70 mV. Ins(1,4,5)P3 and caffeine (Fig.8, C and F) each produced reproducible increases in [Ca2+]c at ∼50-s intervals (Fig. 8, B and E). Thapsigargin (500 nm) increased resting [Ca2+]cfrom 1.07 ± 0.05 F/Fo to 1.73 ± 0.12 F/Fo after 5 min (n = 10; p < 0.001; Fig.8B), and inhibited the responses to both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and caffeine (Fig. 8 A andB). Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+transients were reduced, from an average of 4.19 ± 0.40 ΔF/Fo in control to 0.23 ± 0.06 ΔF/Fo in the presence of thapsigargin (n = 10; p < 0.001; Fig.8A). The caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transient was also reduced from 3.81 ± 1.38 ΔF/Fo in control to −0.04 ± 0.06 ΔF/Fo in the presence of thapsigargin (n = 10; p < 0.001; Fig.8A). CPA (10 μm) also increased resting [Ca2+]c from 1.18 ± 0.09F/Fo immediately prior to CPA to 1.46 ± 0.11 F/Fo after 5 min in the drug (n = 16; p < 0.001; Fig.8E). CPA inhibited both the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked and caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients (Fig. 8, Dand E). On average, the response to Ins(1,4,5)P3was reduced from 1.70 ± 0.32 ΔF/Fo to 0.09 ± 0"
https://openalex.org/W1529338908,"Protozoan parasites of the order Kinetoplastida are responsible for a significant proportion of global morbidity and economic hardship. These organisms also represent extremely distal points within the Eukarya, and one such organism, Trypanosoma brucei, has emerged as a major system for the study of evolutionary cell biology. Significant technical challenges have hampered the full exploitation of this organism, but advances in genomics and proteomics provide a novel approach to acquiring rapid functional data. However, the vast evolutionary distance between trypanosomes and the higher eukaryotes presents significant problems with functional assignment based on sequence similarity, and frequently homologues cannot be identified with sufficient confidence to be informative. Direct identification of proteins in isolated organelles has the potential of providing robust functional insight and is a powerful approach for initial assignment. We have selected the nucleus of T. brucei as a first target for protozoan organellar proteomics. Our purification methodology was able to reliably provide both nuclear and subnuclear fractions. Analysis by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and immunoblotting against trypanosome subcellular markers indicated that the preparations are of high yield and purity, maintain native morphology, and are well resolved from other organelles. Minor developmental differences were observed in the nuclear proteome for the bloodstream and procyclic stages, whereas significant morphological alterations were visible. We demonstrate by direct sequencing that the NUP-1 nuclear envelope antigen is a coiled coil protein, containing approximately 20 near-perfect copies of a 144-amino acid sequence. Immunoelectron microscopy localized NUP-1 to the inner face of the nuclear envelope, suggesting that it is a major filamentous component of the trypanosome nuclear lamina."

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). These cells originate from blood-borne monocytes that enter focal areas of the subendothelium, followed by differentiation into macrophages and accumulation of cholesterol (“foam cells”) (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Specific consequences of macrophage foam cell formation include physical effects, such as intimal thickening, and biological effects, such as internalization of lipoproteins and secretion of biologically active molecules (1Ross R.

Indeed, many studies, including recent in vivoinvestigations, have provided evidence that macrophage foam cells play roles both in early atherogenesis and in late lesional events (2Libby P.

The accumulation of massive amounts of intracellular cholesteryl ester (CE1) is the hallmark of macrophage foam cell formation (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and CE accumulation likely triggers or amplifies some of the physical and biological effects of macrophages during atherogenesis (6Lendon C.L. Davies M.J. Born G.V.R. Richardson P.D. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 87: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 7Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Kranzhöfer R. Clark S. Libby P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the cellular processes involved in cholesterol loading of macrophages can be summarized as follows (8Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar): differentiated macrophages in the subendothelium engage and internalize “atherogenic” lipoproteins, leading to lysosomal hydrolysis of lipoprotein-CE to free cholesterol (FC). Lysosomal FC rapidly distributes to cellular membranes, predominantly the plasma membrane. After the cellular FC content reaches a “threshold” level, there is transfer of the FC to the esterifying enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) (9Xu X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17040-17048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the accumulation of intracellular CE. As is evident from the above summary, the critical initiating step in macrophage foam cell formation is the engagement and internalization of subendothelial lipoproteins. How does this occur? The usual in vitro models of macrophage-lipoprotein interactions, while useful in several aspects, fail to account for some key cellular events that likely occur in vivo. In particular, most previous studies have studied foam cell formation by incubating soluble monomeric lipoproteins with monolayers of macrophages plated on tissue culture plastic. A substantial quantity of lipoproteins in lesions, however, are avidly bound to matrix (11Smith E.B. Massie I.B. Alexander K.M. Atherosclerosis. 1976; 25: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Furthermore, both biochemical and morphological studies of human and animal lesions have shown that many of the matrix-bound lipoproteins are in a fused or aggregated state (14Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Fogelman A.M. Mottino G. Frank J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hoff H.F. Morton R.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In this regard, our laboratory has provided evidence that an arterial-wall secretory sphingomyelinase (SMase) contributes to the process of subendothelial lipoprotein aggregation (17Tabas I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This point is crucial, because cell culture studies have shown that aggregated/fused lipoproteins are among the most potent inducers of massive CE loading of macrophages (16Tabas I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Suits A.G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, macrophages in lesions most likely engage matrix-bound and often aggregated lipoproteins. In this regard there are probably unique cellular processes that occur in vivo during foam cell formation that would clearly be missed in the typical experimental model, which emphasizes receptor-mediated endocytosis. Indeed, using an experimental system in which macrophages are plated on top of matrix-retained and SMase-aggregated LDL (21Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Wu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown previously that there is an initial period of prolonged contact between macrophages and matrix-retained lipoproteins during which LDL-CE hydrolysis exceeds LDL-protein degradation (22Buton X. Mamdouh Z. Ghosh R. Du H. Kuriakose G. Beatini N. Grabowski G.A. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32112-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This process clearly does not occur during typical receptor-mediated endocytosis, which involves rapid uptake of whole lipoprotein particles and parallel degradation of the CE and protein moieties of the lipoproteins (22Buton X. Mamdouh Z. Ghosh R. Du H. Kuriakose G. Beatini N. Grabowski G.A. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32112-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,23Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated the cellular events that occur after the initial contact of macrophages with retained and aggregated lipoproteins. In this second phase, which is perhaps the most important because of the quantity of internalized cholesterol, the macrophages take up large pieces of the matrix-retained and aggregated lipoproteins. We reasoned that one or more steps in this phase may involve cytoskeleton-mediated processes that are necessary to engage large lipoprotein aggregates and release them from the matrix. Such processes, which might include cellular motility, filopodia extension and retraction, and phagocytosis, would clearly distinguish this event from receptor-mediated endocytosis of soluble lipoproteins. Herein we demonstrate that the internalization of matrix-retained LDL requires actin polymerization, myosin ATPase activity, Rho family GTPases, and other signaling events that are not needed for the internalization of soluble lipoproteins. These findings define fundamental cellular processes that may be involved in foam cell formation in vivo but have been missed by the use of previous cell culture models.

Lipoprotein lipase (LpL), isolated from bovine milk, was a gift from Dr. Kevin J. Williams (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Bacillus cereussphingomyelinase (SMase), cytochalasin D, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), wortmannin, lactoferrin from bovine colostrum, bovine serum albumin (BSA, essentially fatty acid free), and Hepes were products of Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Alexa-488-labeled phalloidin and Alexa-546 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Carrier-free Na125I (17.4 Ci/mg) and [1-14C]oleic acid (50 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Tissue culture media, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY), and tissue culture flasks and plates were from Corning Glass Works (Corning, NY). Organic solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). A stock culture of J774 macrophages was grown in suspension in a spinner flask in DMEM (4.5 g/liter glucose and no sodium pyruvate), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A stock culture of bovine aortic SMCs was grown in monolayer culture in the same medium as above, except with sodium pyruvate, and used for experiments within 10 passages. Both cell types were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were harvested from the peritoneum of mice 3 days after the intraperitoneal injection of 40 μg of concanavalin A (28Tang W. Walsh A. Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and then used immediately for the experiments described below. Experiments were performed in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA except where noted. SMCs were plated at 50,000 cells per 11-mm dish (48-well plate) and incubated for a total of 4 days (2 days post-confluent) in DMEM, 10% FBS. After three washes with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, the SMC monolayer was air-dried for 15 min and then extracted twice with 3:2 hexane:isopropanol (v/v) for 30 min. The lipid extracts were removed and discarded, and the wells were dried for 15 min at room temperature under a tissue culture hood. After washing three times with binding buffer (3% BSA, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), the matrix was incubated with binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific sites. LDL was labeled with 125I using Iodogen-coated tubes (Pierce) and Na[125I] as described previously (22Buton X. Mamdouh Z. Ghosh R. Du H. Kuriakose G. Beatini N. Grabowski G.A. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32112-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); the labeled LDL had a specific activity of 150–300 cpm/ng of protein and was used within 3 weeks of iodination. LDL was labeled with Alexa-546 using the manufacturer's protocol except that the amount of LDL-protein used in the labeling reaction was increased by 50% over the recommended value. On the day of the experiment,125I- or Alexa-546-LDL was aggregated by incubation with bacterial SMase as previously described (29Marathe S. Choi Y. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of LDL protein/ml of PBS was incubated with 50 milliunits/ml SMase in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 4 h under argon without shaking, and then 10 mm EDTA was added to stop the reaction. The LDL was then diluted with binding buffer (above) to a concentration of 250 μg/ml unless noted otherwise. In preparation for LDL-matrix binding, 1 μg of LpL was added to each well of the lipid-extracted SMC matrix (above) for 1 h at room temperature unless otherwise noted in the text. Next, 100 μl of the SMase-treated LDL (or monomeric LDL where indicated) was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 18 h in a humidified atmosphere. The unbound LDL was then removed by extensive washing with DMEM, 0.2% BSA, which was the medium used for all of the following incubations. J774 or mouse peritoneal macrophages were preincubated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA in the absence or presence of various compounds as indicated in figure legends; for preincubation periods longer than 30 min, the medium was buffered with 20 mmHepes. The macrophages were then added on top of the matrix with retained LDL at a density of 500,000 cells in 0.8 ml per 11-mm well (48-well plate), which led to a confluency of ∼90–100%. In certain experiments, macrophages were preincubated as above but were first added to the matrix without LDL for 30 min, followed by the addition of 5–25 μg/ml monomeric 125I-LDL to the well. Unless noted otherwise, all incubations were performed in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 5 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was collected and assayed for 125I-LDL degradation as described (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). As a control for cell-independent lipoprotein degradation, a set of triplicate wells had matrix-retained aggregated 125I-LDL or non-retained monomeric 125I-LDL, but no macrophages; these no-cell degradation values were always <10% of the degradation observed in the presence of macrophages. For the knockout macrophage and inhibitor studies, the data are expressed as a percentage of LDL degradation by wild-type or untreated macrophages, which was in the range of ∼40–200 ng/well for retained and aggregated125I-LDL and ∼25–125 ng/well for non-retained soluble125I-LDL. To quantify the amount of matrix-bound 125I-LDL, the matrix was washed three times with 0.5 ml/well ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and then once with 1 ml/well PBS, followed by solubilization in 0.5 ml/well 0.5 n NaOH at room temperature for 18–24 h. The125I label amounts (cpm) of the solubilized material were then determined. To determine cholesteryl esterification, 5 μl of [14C]oleate-BSA complex (10 cpm/pmol) (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) was added to each well 30 min after the addition of macrophages. At the end of the incubation period, the wells were washed as above, and cell lipids were extracted twice (30 min each) with 3:2 hexane:isopropanol (v/v). The lipid extracts were then assayed for cholesteryl [14C]oleate by thin-layer chromatography as described (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The degradation of125I-acetyl-LDL and activated125I-α2-macroglobulin was assayed exactly as described for 125I-LDL (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). SMCs were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip dishes (∼50,000 cells per 11-mm coverslip area) for a total of 4 days (2 days post-confluent) in DMEM, 10% FBS. The SMCs were rinsed three times in DMEM, 0.2% BSA and fixed in −20 °C methanol for 10 min to prevent phalloidin staining of the SMC F-actin cytoskeleton. SMC-derived matrix was then prepared as described above and, after addition of LpL, incubated with SMase-treated Alexa-546-labeled LDL. J774 macrophages were resuspended in DMEM, 0.2% BSA and then preincubated at 37 °C with either 100 ng/ml C. difficile toxin B for 6 h or 2.5 μm cytochalasin D for 20 min. The cells were then plated on the matrices containing aggregated and retained SMase-treated Alexa-546-LDL for 30 min, 1.5 h, or 5 h in the continued presence of either toxin B or cytochalasin D. After each incubation time, the wells were briefly rinsed with DMEM, 0.2% BSA and simultaneously fixed, permeabilized, and stained for F-actin using 6.6% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, 250 μg/ml saponin, and 5 units/ml Alexa-488-labeled phalloidin in PBS for 5 min. Addition of Alexa-labeled phalloidin to the fixation/permeabilization buffer was required to stabilize as well as stain the F-actin. Fixation was then quenched by a 15-min incubation with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, followed by a final rinse in PBS. The cells were viewed with an LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Excitation on the LSM 510 unit was with a 25-milliwatt (mW) argon laser emitting at 488 nm and a 1.0-mW helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm; emissions were collected using a 505- to 530-nm band pass filter to collect Alexa-488 emissions and a 585-nm long pass filter to collect Alexa-546 emissions. Typically, 0.5-μm vertical steps were used, with a vertical optical resolution of <1.0 μm. Macrophages were incubated for 3 h in the presence or absence of 400 ng/ml C2IN-C3 fusion protein, C2IIa, or both components together. Next, lysates from these macrophages were incubated in vitro with [32P]NAD in the presence of C3 exoenzyme and then subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (31Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this assay, the radiographic signal is high if RhoA was unmodified at the time of cell lysis, and the signal is low if RhoA had already been ADP-ribosylated in vivo (i.e. prior to cell lysis; see “Results” section). Results for all bar graph values are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3); absent error bars in the bar graphs signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. In an attempt to model the interaction of arterial-wall macrophages with subendothelial lipoproteins, SMase-treated 125I-LDL was first incubated with matrix derived from aortic smooth muscle cells that had been previously preincubated with lipoprotein lipase (LpL). A secretory form of SMase is present in the arterial wall, and there is evidence that this enzyme causes the aggregation and fusion of LDL that is known to occur in the subendothelium (17Tabas I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). LpL is also present in the subendothelium and is thought to non-enzymatically bridge LDL to matrix (32Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 18–24 h of incubation, non-bound 125I-LDL was removed, and macrophages were then added to the dish. As shown in Fig.1A, the amount of125I-LDL bound to the matrix was directly proportional to the concentration of 125I-LDL initially added. Typically, ∼5% of the 125I-LDL added was associated with the matrix after 18–24 h, and >95% of this matrix-bound material remained bound during subsequent incubations (not shown). When macrophages were added to different amounts of matrix-bound125I-LDL, ∼30–40% of the bound lipoprotein was degraded up to a certain point, and then no further degradation occurred (Fig.1B). Degradation increased with time of incubation up to ∼12 h (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, the relationship between matrix-bound LDL and stimulation of ACAT-mediated cholesterol esterification was very similar to the relationship between matrix-bound LDL and 125I-LDL degradation (compare with Fig. 1B). The similarity of these two curves is consistent with the idea that lipoprotein degradation, by increasing cellular cholesterol stores, directly drives cholesterol esterification (8Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In an additional experiment, we tested the effect of omitting LpL from the experimental system. Surprisingly, both the amount of SMase-aggregated 125I-LDL bound to the matrix and the amount of 125I-LDL degradation by macrophages was the same in the presence or absence of LpL. In contrast, omission of SMase treatment of 125I-LDL (i.e. monomeric125I-LDL—see below) led to a 65% decrease in125I-LDL bound to matrix and an 80% decrease in125I-LDL degradation by macrophages. Thus, in this particular model, as opposed to one in which ammonium hydroxide-insoluble smooth muscle cell-derived matrix was used (21Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Wu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the retention and macrophage uptake of SMase-aggregated LDL was independent of LpL. 2For the rest of the experiments in this study, LpL was included in the model system because it is known to be associated with matrix in vivo (32Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies will be needed to determine if LpL has any effects in the current model other than those involved in LDL retention and degradation.Treatment of LDL with SMase, however, was important for both matrix retention and degradation by macrophages. The complex nature of macrophages interacting with matrix-bound aggregated lipoproteins likely involves multiple cell-surface molecules. To assess if known lipoprotein receptors play partial roles in this interaction, we conducted a series of experiments using peritoneal macrophages from receptor knockout mice or inhibitors of J774 macrophage lipoprotein receptors. As shown in Fig.2A, neither the LDL receptor nor CD36, a receptor for oxidized LDL (33Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was necessary for the uptake and degradation of retained and aggregated LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages. Similarly, antibodies against either CD36 or the type A scavenger receptor on J774 macrophages did not inhibit the uptake and degradation of retained and aggregated LDL by these cells (Fig. 2B); as a positive control for the anti-type A scavenger receptor antibody, we showed that it was able to block the degradation of 10 μg/ml 125I-acetyl-LDL by 60%. Finally, treatment of J774 macrophages with heparinase I had no effect on this process (data not shown). We next examined the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), which has been reported to mediate the uptake of non-retained monomeric LDL by macrophages (34Wu S.M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and non-retained vortex-aggregated LDL by smooth muscle cells (35Llorente-Cortes V. Martinez-Gonzalez J. Badimon L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1572-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We confirmed the former report by showing that the degradation of soluble 125I-LDL was inhibited ∼35% in the presence of receptor-associated protein (RAP), a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP (36Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D,cross-hatched bar). Moreover, we found that RAP inhibited the uptake and degradation of non-retained SMase-aggregated LDL by ∼65% (Fig. 2D, gray bars). For comparison, RAP inhibited the degradation of activated125I-α2-macroglobulin, a known ligand for LRP (37Herz J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 107-113Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), by ∼70% (Fig. 2D, diagonal-hatched bar). To assess the role of LRP in the interaction of macrophages with matrix-retained and SMase-aggregated LDL, we tested the effect of three LRP inhibitors: lactoferrin (38Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RAP, and a specific anti-LRP blocking antibody (39Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). All three molecules had almost identical effects, namely, ∼35% inhibition of lipoprotein degradation. The control IgG, which is a non-blocking antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of LRP, had no effect. Thus, LRP partially mediates the interaction of macrophages with matrix-retained and SMase-aggregated LDL. However, one or more cell-surface molecules in addition to LRP, but different"

The α9 integrin subunit is most closely related to the α4 subunit; the two are 41% identical at the nucleotide sequence level and 39% identical at the amino acid level.

Furthermore, the α9 and α4 cytoplasmic domains are quite similar (52% identity), and α9 contains an amino acid motif that is similar to the paxillin binding site in the α4 tail (Fig.1A). Here we have examined the interaction of the α9 cytoplasmic domain with paxillin. We report that the α9 cytoplasmic domain binds paxillin directly and tightly and that the α9-paxillin association inhibits cell spreading. Furthermore, we have identified amino acid residues in the α9 cytoplasmic domain (Trp999 and Trp1001) that are critical for paxillin binding, and alanine substitution of either Trp999 or Trp1001 blocks paxillin binding. These mutations also reverse the effect of the α9 tail on cell spreading. Thus, direct binding of paxillin to the α9 cytoplasmic domain mediates some of the biological activities of the α9β1 integrin. The following antibodies were obtained commercially: monoclonal antibodies against paxillin (clone 349; Transduction Laboratories; reactive with both paxillin and Hic-5); human integrin α4 (HP2/1; Jackson); human integrin α5 (ImmunoTech); and HA1 tag (12CA5; American Type Culture Collection). Monoclonal antibody against human α9β1, Y9A2, was kindly provided by Dr. Dean Sheppard (University of California at San Francisco). The monoclonal antibody against αIIbβ3, D-57, has been described previously (12Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against paxillin were produced by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant paxillin-GST fusion protein and further isolated with protein A-Sepharose column. Biotin-labeled anti-paxillin antibodies were prepared by labeling polyclonal anti-paxillin antibodies withN-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Synthetic peptides used in the competition assays were synthesized on an ABI 430 peptide synthesizer and were 95% homogeneous as judged by a reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (Vydac) by the Peptide Synthesis Core at The Scripps Research Institute. Masses of all synthetic peptides were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Human Jurkat T cells and a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1680 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin and streptomycin. All Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma). All cell lines were cultured in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator. CHO cell lines expressing different chimeric αIIbβ3integrins were created and maintained as described previously (10Liu S.

Briefly, the cytoplasmic domain of α9, α9(W999A), or α9(W1001A) was connected to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIbintegrin subunit, respectively. The cytoplasmic domain of β1A integrin subunit was connected to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of β3 integrin subunit. These αIIb and β3 chimeric integrin subunits were co-transfected into CHO cells. CHO cells expressing the chimeric αIIbβ3 integrin were selected with neomycin, and clonal cell lines were isolated by single cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting using D-57, an antibody specific for the αIIbβ3 integrin. CHO cells expressing αIIbα4β3β1A or αIIbα6Aβ3β1Ahave been described previously (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H.

Briefly, polymerase chain reaction was used to generateHindIII-BamHI fragment for each wild-type or mutant integrin cytoplasmic domain. This fragment was ligated into the modified pET15b vector as described previously (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen), isolated by Ni2+-charged resins, and further purified to >90% homogeneity using a reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (Vydac). Masses of all proteins were assessed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on an API-III quadrupole spectrometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada) and varied by <0.1% from the predicted masses. Recombinant integrin cytoplasmic tails were bound to Ni2+-charged His-Bind resins (Novagen) and used for affinity chromatography as described previously (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of each recombinant integrin tail dissolved in PN buffer (5 ml of 20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8) plus 1 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5) was bound to 100 μl of Ni2+-charged His-Bind resins (Novagen) at 4 °C overnight. Resins were then washed twice with PN buffer and stored in an equal volume of PN buffer plus 0.1% sodium azide. Jurkat T cells (or human platelets) were lysed on ice for 1 h with buffer A (10 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8) plus 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (plus 0.1 mm E-64, a calpain inhibitor, for platelet lysate). After clarification by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, 3 mm MgCl2was added to the cell lysate, which was then added to 50 μl of integrin tail-coated resins prepared as described above. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation overnight, and then the resins were washed three times with buffer A plus 3 mmMgCl2. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and detected by immunoblotting or Coomassie Blue staining. The expression and isolation of recombinant human GST-paxillin fusion protein have been described previously (16Salgia R. Li J.-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E.

Aliquots of recombinant GST-paxillin were mixed with 300 μl of buffer A (14Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) plus 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA); added to integrin tail-loaded resins; and incubated at room temperature with rotation for 2 h. Resins were then washed three times with the same buffer. Bound proteins were extracted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected with an antibody specific for the HA tag (12CA5). For peptide competition assays, recombinant paxillin binding to the integrin tails was performed in the presence of competing peptides at the concentration indicated in each experiment. CHO or HEK293 cells were cell surface-labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in an immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmbenzamidine HCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) (17Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.-P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The clarified cell lysate was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose coated with antibodies specific for each integrin or an irrelevant mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed with the same buffer four times, and the precipitated polypeptides were extracted with SDS sample buffer. Precipitated cell surface biotin-labeled polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and detected with streptavidin peroxidase followed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In parallel, lysates of unmodified cells were precipitated with antibodies specific for each integrin, and co-precipitated paxillin was detected with biotin-labeled polyclonal anti-paxillin antibodies. Assays of cell adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen (Fg) or fibronectin (FN) were performed as described previously (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the cell adhesion assay, 24-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml Fg or FN in coating buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4, and 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA (incubation at 80 °C for 30 min) at 37 °C for more than 1 h. Different CHO cell lines were labeled with fluorescent dye (CellTracker Green CMFDA; Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. Equal numbers of labeled cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1 mg/ml BSA were then plated on the Fg- or FN-coated wells and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 30–45 min. At the end of each experiment, unattached cells were washed away with phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescence of attached cells was detected using a Cytofluor II fluorescence reader (Millipore). For cell spreading assays, coverslips in 24-well plates were coated with different concentrations of either Fg or FN, resuspended in coating buffer at 4 °C overnight, and blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA at 37 °C for at least 1 h. Cells were detached, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1 mg/ml BSA, and resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml. The cells (5–10 × 104 cells/well) were permitted to attach to the coverslips at 37 °C for 1 h. Unattached cells were washed away with phosphate-buffered saline. Attached cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and examined by phase microscopy. Cells that revealed visible lamellipodia under a microscope were scored as spreading cells, and cells that revealed round-up morphology were scored as nonspreading cells. The percentage of cell spreading was examined by two individuals. Photo images were taken with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a Sensys cooled charge-coupled device video camera. The α9 integrin subunit is similar to α4, and paxillin binding to α4 regulates α4-dependent cellular behaviors (7Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To determine whether paxillin binds to the α9 integrin cytoplasmic domain, we made recombinant α9 cytoplasmic domain model proteins by fusing the cytoplasmic tail of α9 to amino-terminal modules that contain four heptad-repeat sequences as described previously (14Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Muir T.W. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. Kent S.B.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This α9 tail model protein was used for tail affinity chromatography with lysates of Jurkat T cells. Proteins that bound to the α9 tail were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for different cellular proteins. Paxillin was enriched (∼20-fold enrichment) in the α9-bound fraction relative to the starting cell lysate (Fig.1B, top panel), with enrichment similar to that of paxillin bound in the α4 tail (∼21-fold enrichment; data not shown). In contrast, there was no detectable paxillin binding to αIIb tail. Thus, paxillin specifically binds to the α9 cytoplasmic tail; furthermore, this binding is not mediated by the amino-terminal 7 amino acids shared among different α integrin subunits because paxillin failed to bind αIIb, α3A, α5, or α6A integrin tail (Fig. 1B; data not shown) (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Hic-5 and leupaxin are two paralogues of paxillin that bind to the α4 tail (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, their binding to the α9 cytoplasmic tail was examined in the current study. Both Hic-5 and leupaxin were enriched in the α9tail-bound fraction, whereas there was no detectable binding to the αIIb tail (Fig. 1B, middle and bottom panels). Thus, the α9 cytoplasmic tail specifically binds paxillin and its two paralogues, Hic-5 and leupaxin. In the experiments described above, we used cell lysates as a protein resource of paxillin. To exclude an indirect interaction, we made purified recombinant paxillin-GST fusion protein and examined its binding to the α9 tail. Recombinant paxillin bound directly to the α9 tail, but not to the αIIb tail. The direct binding was saturable and tight with an effector concentration at half-maximum response (EC50) of ∼40 nm (Fig. 1C). In addition, when the GST-fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin, the isolated paxillin bound to the α9 tail, whereas GST failed to do so (data not shown). Thus, paxillin binds to the α9 cytoplasmic tail directly and tightly. Because paxillin binds to the α9 cytoplasmic tail in vitro, we hypothesized that paxillin may also bind to the intact α9β1 integrin. To test this idea, we used HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line that expresses α4β1, α5β1, and α9β1 integrins (data not shown), for co-immunoprecipitation. HEK293 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the α4, α5, or α9 integrin. Paxillin was detected in the anti-α9 or anti-α4 immunoprecipitate (data not shown), but not in the anti-α5 immunoprecipitate or in an irrelevant IgG immunoprecipitate (Fig.2, top panel). Analysis of surface proteins in the immune complexes confirmed the activities of each specific antibody (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Thus, the intact α9β1 integrin also associates with endogenous paxillin. To determine whether the α9 cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to mediate association of an intact integrin with paxillin, we constructed a chimeric integrin by fusing the α9cytoplasmic domain to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIb integrin. To provide an appropriate β partner, the β1A cytoplasmic domain was fed to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of β3 integrin. These chimeric integrin subunits were stably expressed in CHO cells. A CHO cell line that expresses αIIbα6Aβ3β1Achimeric integrin (13Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was used as a control. Immunoprecipitation was performed using D-57, an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of αIIbβ3 (12Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Similar quantities of chimeric integrin from each cell line were precipitated (Fig.3, bottom panel). Approximately 9-fold more paxillin was co-precipitated with chimeric integrin bearing the α9 tail than with that bearing the α6A tail (Fig. 3, top panel). Thus, the α9 cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to mediate intact integrin-paxillin association. To localize the site within the α9 cytoplasmic domain that is required for paxillin binding, we performed peptide competition assays to examine the capacity of synthetic peptides derived from the α9cytoplasmic domain sequence to compete for purified paxillin binding to the α9 tail. We synthesized three pentadecapeptides that cover different regions of the α9 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4, top panel). The middle, α9(Ala988-Val1002), and C-terminal, α9(Arg992-Gln1006), peptides competed for paxillin binding with an IC50 of ∼150 and ∼200 μm, respectively. In contrast, the N-terminal pentadecapeptide, α9(Lys974-Ala988), did not inhibit paxillin binding to the α9 tail at a concentration of 550 μm. Furthermore, scrambled peptide with a composition identical to that of α9(Ala988-Val1002) had no inhibitory effect on paxillin binding at a concentration of 550 μm. Thus, both α9(Ala988-Val1002) and α9(Arg992-Gln1006) peptides specifically block paxillin binding. Comparison of the amino acid sequence compositions of these two α9 peptides, α9(Ala988-Val1002) and α9(Arg992-Gln1006), indicated that both of these peptides contained a sequence of 11 amino acids, RKENEDSWDWV. Furthermore, we compared this 11-amino acid sequence with the 9 amino acid residues (ENRRDSWSY) in the α4 integrin cytoplasmic domain, which is sufficient for paxillin binding (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22736-22742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both RKENEDSWDWV and ENRRDSWSY sequences contained a DSWXØ (Ø, aromatic amino acid residue) motif in which the Tyr residue in α4 tail is critical for paxillin binding (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on this region of the α9 tail to identify the amino acid residues that are required for paxillin binding. We made several single alanine substitutions in the α9cytoplasmic tail based on the similarity of the sequence to that of the α4 tail, and we examined the effect of these alanine substitutions on the paxillin binding properties of the intact α9 tail. Recombinant full-length α9 tail with alanine substitutions at Lys993, Glu994, Asp997, Ser998, Trp999, and Trp1001 (Fig. 5A) was assessed for binding of native paxillin. Jurkat T-cell lysate was used as a source of the protein. Affinity chromatography with model proteins containing α9(W999A) and α9(W1001A) mutations revealed a dramatic reduction of paxillin binding relative to the wild-type α9 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the α9(E994A) mutation partially blocked paxillin binding. In contrast, alanine substitution at either Glu997 or Ser998 had no effect, and alanine substitution of Lys993 had much less effect on paxillin binding to the α9 tail. To confirm theses results, we further examined the purified recombinant paxillin binding to these α9 tail mutants. Similar results were obtained as described above for each mutant (Fig. 5C; data not shown). Thus, alanine substitution of Trp999, Trp1001, or, to a lesser extent, Glu994, in the α9cytoplasmic domain can disrupt paxillin binding. We further tested the binding of two paralogues of paxillin, Hic-5 and leupaxin, to the α9 mutants α9(W999A) and α9(W1001A). Both of these mutants also disrupted Hic-5 binding to the α9 tail (Fig. 5D, top panel). However, the binding of leupaxin to these mutants was only reduced by ∼50% relative to that of the wild-type α9 tail (Fig. 5D, bottom panel). Thus, mutation of Trp999 or Trp1001 in the α9 cytoplasmic domain did not disrupt leupaxin binding. As described above, we have identified mutations in the α9 tail, α9(W999A) and α9(W1001A), that disrupted paxillin binding (Fig. 2). To determine whether these mutations also interfere with the association of an intact integrin with paxillin, we introduced these mutations into the αIIbα9 chimeric integrin. β3β1A and αIIbα9(W999A) or αIIbα9(W1001A) were co-expressed into CHO cells. Clonal cell lines with similar levels of surface expression for each chimeric integrin (data not shown) were chosen for the following studies. Immunoprecipitation was performed on these cell lines as well as the CHO cell line expressing wild-type αIIbα9β3β1Ausing D-57 antibody. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig.6, similar quantities of the chimeric integrin were precipitated. However, much less paxillin was co-precipitated with either αIIbα9(W999A)β3β1Aor αIIbα9(W1001A) than with wild-type αIIbα9β3β1Achimeric integrin (Fig. 6, top panel). Thus, α9(W999A) and α9(W1001) mutations also disrupted the association of paxillin with an intact integrin. The α4 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cell spreading (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar,20Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and paxillin is required for the diminished cell spreading induced by the α4 integrins (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because α9 is the only other member of the α4 subfamily, and α9 cytoplasmic tail also binds paxillin directly and tightly, we hypothesized that the association of paxillin with the α9tail might also inhibit cell spreading. To test this idea, we compared cell spreading of CHO cell lines expressing αIIbα9β3β1A, αIIbα6Aβ3β1A, and αIIbα4β3β1Achimeric integrins. α9 cytoplasmic tail did not alter αIIbβ3- dependent cell adhesion to fibrinogen (73 ± 8, 75 ± 7, and 72 ± 11 for αIIbα9β3β1A-CHO, αIIbα6Aβ3β1A-CHO, and αIIbα4β3β1A-CHO cells, respectively), a ligand for integrin αIIbβ3 integrin. However, the α9 tail and α4 tail (data not shown) inhibited cell spreading on fibrinogen at the different coating concentrations examined (Fig. 7,A and B, top panels). In contrast, all three cell lines spread to the same extent on fibronectin, a ligand for endogenous α5β1 integrin (Fig. 7B, bottom panel). Thus, α9 tail inhibits cell spreading. To determine whether integrity of the paxillin binding site in the α9 tail is required for inhibition of cell spreading by the α9 tail, we assessed the functional effect of the mutants that disrupt paxillin binding to the α9 tail (Figs. 5 and 6). CHO cell lines expressing wild-type αIIbα9β3β1A, αIIbα9(W999A)β3β1A, and αIIbα9(W1001A)β3β1Awere subjected to cell adhesion and spreading assays. These mutations in the α9 tail did not affect cell adhesion on Fg (data not shown). However, the cells expressing these mutants spread extensively on Fg (Fig. 7A, middle and bottom panels, and Fig. 7B, top panel), whereas cells expressing wild-type αIIbα9β3β1Aspread poorly on Fg at the different coating concentrations examined. This difference in cell spreading was not due to clonal defects of cell lines in cell spreading because these cell lines spread equally well on fibronectin (Fig. 7B, bottom panel), a ligand for CHO cell endogenous α5β1 integrin. Thus, mutations in the α9 tail that disrupt paxillin binding reduce the capacity of the α9 tail to inhibit cell spreading. In the current study, we have demonstrated: 1) that the α9 integrin binds paxillin directly and tightly, and the α9 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to mediate the association of an intact integrin with paxillin; 2) that the α9 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cell spreading, and this inhibition of cell spreading is mediated by its binding to paxillin; and 3) that the Trp999, Trp1001, and, to a lesser extent, Glu994 amino acid residues in the α9 cytoplasmic domain are critical for paxillin binding, alanine substitution of Trp999 or Trp1001disrupted the paxillin binding ability of α9 bothin vitro and in vivo, and, furthermore, introduction of W999A or W1001A mutation into the intact integrin restored cell spreading. Thus, direct binding of paxillin to the α9 cytoplasmic domain inhibits cell spreading. Based on the facts that α9 and α4 integrin subunits share the highest sequence homology among different integrin α subunits (there is a 39% identity at the amino acid level between α4 and α9) and that they both do not contain an I(nserted) domain and an extracellular disulfide-linked cleavage site, they form a structural subfamily of integrin α subunits (7Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The α9β1 and α4β1 integrins have common ligands (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and osteopontin), they are both expressed in neutrophils, and they mediate neutrophil migration across tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelial monolayers (8Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting that they might also share some functional similarities. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that α4 integrins increase cell migration and inhibit cell spreading, and these unusual functional properties of α4 are conveyed by the α4cytoplasmic domain (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 20Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence demonstrating that direct binding of paxillin to the α4 cytoplasmic domain accounts for some of the unusual functional properties mediated by the α4 integrins (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have shown that the α9 cytoplasmic domain also inhibits cell spreading and that direct binding of paxillin to the α9cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the inhibition of cell spreading.

Because transgenic mice overexpressing human apoA-I from the liver (h-apoA-I TgN) are protected from the atherogenesis induced by apoE deficiency, we hypothesized that the presence of apoA-I in the vessel wall could reduce the negative effect of apoE deficiency on lesion growth. To address this issue, we used both retroviral transduction and transgenic approaches to producein vivo systems where apoA-I is expressed from macrophages. In the retroviral transduction study, apoA-I-deficient (apoA-I−/−) mice reconstituted with apoE-deficient (apoE−/−) bone marrow cells that were infected with a retroviral vector expressing human apoA-I (MFG-HAI) had 95% lower atherosclerotic lesion area than that of recipients of apoE−/− bone marrow cells infected with the parental virus (MFG). To determine whether the protective effect of locally produced apoA-I was due to the lack of systemic apoA-I, we conducted a different experiment using h-apoA-I TgN mice as recipients of apoE−/− bone marrow with or without human apoA-I (driven by a macrophage-specific transgene defined as mφ–AI). Aortic lesion area in apoE−/−/mφ-AI → h-apoA-I TgN mice was decreased by 85% compared with apoE−/− → h-apoA-I TgN mice. These data demonstrate that expression of apoA-I from macrophages protects against atherogenesis without affecting plasma apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

The protective effects of HDL are attributed to its ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells and mediate the transport of cholesterol to the liver for catabolism (3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of the HDL effect on atherogenesis remain unclear, and it is possible that a large portion of this effect may be due to events localized in the vessel wall.Secretion of apolipoprotein (apo)E by macrophages has been proposed to prevent the conversion of arterial macrophages into foam cells by stimulating the efflux of free cholesterol. In support of this hypothesis, Brown and Goldstein (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that macrophage-derived foam cells release an excess of free cholesterol associated with apoE within HDL particles (4Brown M.S.

These data support a protective role for apoE expression by the macrophage in the early stages of atherogenesis. Furthermore, our studies indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells are important players in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, and can modulate lesion development by enhancing cholesterol efflux and activating reverse cholesterol transport (7Bellosta S.

ABCA1 knockout mice have greatly reduced HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels, and accumulation of foam cells in tissues.

These studies show that increased levels of human apoA-I in plasma effectively delay the progression of atherosclerosis. However, it is still unclear whether local effects of apoA-I within the atherosclerotic lesion are responsible for some of these results.ApoA-I is synthesized by the liver and small intestine but, unlike apoE, is not naturally synthesized by macrophages (21Zannis V.I.

Based on the knowledge that lipid-free apoA-I in the extracellular space induces cholesterol efflux in macrophages in vitro, we hypothesized that macrophage-specific expression of human apoA-I would enhance cholesterol efflux from the macrophage in vivo, resulting in delayed foam cell formation and reduced atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that retroviral transduction of bone marrow can be used to induce expression of foreign proteins in macrophages and to induce long-term expression and stem cell transmission of transgenesin vivo (24Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Brandt S.J. Babaev V.R. Gleaves L.A. Fazio S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This retroviral transduction approach may have therapeutic applications. The present studies were designed to test whether apoA-I expression from macrophages would protect against atherosclerosis development in mice. Our results support the concept that apoA-I expression from macrophages can reduce lesion growth induced by the lack of apoE in the vessel wall irrespective of the presence or absence of apoA-I in plasma.RESULTSRetroviral Transduction StudyEffects of Macrophage Expression of Human ApoA-I on the Lipid ProfileFemale apoA-I−/− mice were transplanted with bone marrow cells transduced with apoE+/+MFG (n = 8), apoE−/−MFG (n = 10), apoE+/+MFG-HAI (n= 8), or apoE−/−MFG-HAI (n = 8) and were placed on butterfat diet after 4 weeks post-BMT. In all groups, cholesterol levels increased throughout the study in a time-dependent manner. No relevant differences in serum among the groups were detectable at 16 weeks post-BMT (TableI), although in early time points some of differences between groups reached statistical significance. Agarose gel electrophoresis of serum lipoproteins showed no differences among groups before and after BMT, although the pre-β and β migrating bands (very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein, respectively) increased in all groups on a butterfat diet (Fig.1). HDL cholesterol levels increased in a time-dependent matter, but no differences were detected among the four groups (Table I).Table ITotal serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol levels in transduction study before and after transplantationDonorRecipientSerum lipidBaseline4 weeks post-BMT4 weeks on butterfat diet8 weeks on butterfat diet12 weeks on butterfat dietApoE+/+MFGApoAI−/−Cholesterol20.8 ± 1.120.1 ± 1.030.5 ± 1.836.8 ± 3.044.7 ± 3.7n = 8Triglyceride40.6 ± 3.038.9 ± 3.445.2 ± 3.440.9 ± 2.228.6 ± 2.2HDL cholesterol710122033ApoE−/−MFGApoAI−/−Cholesterol21.3 ± 1.915.6 ± 1.728.0 ± 3.735.5 ± 2.141.6 ± 3.1n = 9Triglyceride40.0 ± 1.644.0 ± 2.545.6 ± 3.735.6 ± 3.132.6 ± 2.4HDL cholesterol86122031ApoE+/+MFG-HAIApoAI−/−Cholesterol20.6 ± 1.017.7 ± 1.824.6 ± 1.529.9 ± 2.844.5 ± 2.8n = 8Triglyceride38.6 ± 4.243.8 ± 1.944.5 ± 3.535.7 ± 3.033.2 ± 2.8HDL cholesterol710101829ApoE−/−MFG-HAIApoAI−/−Cholesterol20.3 ± 1.315.1 ± 2.035.3 ± 2.938.5 ± 2.645.4 ± 3.5n = 8Triglyceride48.5 ± 2.756.0 ± 4.549.1 ± 4.238.9 ± 3.532.3 ± 2.4HDL cholesterol77151526The baseline values were obtained on a diet of 4.5% fat rodent chow (Rodent Diet 5010, PMI).

ApoA-I−/− recipient mice reconstituted with the apoE−/− marrow developed significantly more aortic atherosclerosis than did recipients of the apoE+/+ marrow, confirming our previously reported observation in C57BL/6 mice (5Fazio S. Babaev V.R. Murray A.B. Hasty A.H. Carter K.J. Gleaves L.A. Atkinson J.B. Linton M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this setting, the expression of human apoA-I from macrophages decreased atherosclerosis in both apoA-I-deficient and apoA-I-overexpressing mice. This indicates that human apoA-I produced by apoE-negative macrophages affects atherosclerotic lesion formation. Our studies clearly establish that macrophage apoE is involved in foam cell formation and that, in the absence of apoE, apoA-I produced by macrophages re-establishes an appropriate cholesterol homeostasis.Macrophages express apoE abundantly in atherosclerotic lesions, and apoE secretion by macrophages has been proposed to be a protective process, which prevents foam cell formation by stimulating cholesterol efflux and/or facilitating reverse cholesterol transport from the arterial wall (5Fazio S.

We showed that low level expression of apoE secretion by arterial macrophages in apoE-deficient mice delays atherogenesis (24Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Brandt S.J. Babaev V.R. Gleaves L.A. Fazio S. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others demonstrated that lack of apoE expression by the macrophage promotes foam cell formation in wild-type mice (5Fazio S. Babaev V.R. Murray A.B. Hasty A.H. Carter K.J.

The present study confirms these observations by showing that the mean lesion area in aortic cross-sections was increased by 85% in mice reconstituted with apoE−/−MFG compared with apoE+/+MFG mice, in the absence of differences in plasma lipid lipoprotein levels or apoE expression in serum. These data also support the concept that apoE expression from macrophages is able to modulate atherogenesis even if normal levels of apoE are present in serum.Although the inverse relationship between HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, and atherosclerosis risk has long been recognized, the mechanism by which HDL and apoA-I lower the risk of coronary heart disease is unclear. The process of cholesterol efflux remains the focus of the majority of studies aimed at understanding the protective role of HDL and apoA-I. Rubin et al. (18Rubin E.M. Krauss R.M. Spangler E.A. Verstuyft J.G. Clift S.M. Nature. 1991; 353: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) created human apoA-I transgenic mice to evaluate the effect of apoA-I on the development of atherosclerosis. Total plasma apoA-I and HDL cholesterol concentrations were increased 2-fold in transgenic animals compared with control animals. The expression of the human apoA-I transgene from the liver resulted in complete protection from the development of atherosclerosis in transgenic animals. One mechanism by which apoA-I and HDL may act to prevent atherosclerosis progression in this model is the enhancement of cholesterol efflux. In vitro studies confirmed that cholesterol efflux is increased when Fu5AH hepatoma cells are incubated with sera from apoA-I transgenic versus control rabbits (17Duverger N. Kruth H. Emmanuel F.

https://openalex.org/W2146972992,"To study the structural and functional roles of the cysteine residues at positions 36, 41, and 46 in the transmembrane domain of phospholamban (PLB), we have used Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis to prepare α-amino-n-butyric acid (Abu)-PLB, the analogue in which all three cysteine residues are replaced by Abu. Whereas previous studies have shown that replacement of the three Cys residues by Ala (producing Ala-PLB) greatly destabilizes the pentameric structure, we hypothesized that replacement of Cys with Abu, which is isosteric to Cys, might preserve the pentameric stability. Therefore, we compared the oligomeric structure (from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and function (inhibition of the Ca-ATPase in reconstituted membranes) of Abu-PLB with those of synthetic wild-type PLB and Ala-PLB. Molecular modeling provides structural and energetic insight into the different oligomeric stabilities of these molecules. We conclude that 1) the Cys residues of PLB are not necessary for pentamer formation or inhibitory function; 2) the steric properties of cysteine residues in the PLB transmembrane domain contribute substantially to pentameric stability, whereas the polar or chemical properties of the sulfhydryl group play only a minor role; 3) the functional potency of these PLB variants does not correlate with oligomeric stability; and 4) acetylation of the N-terminal methionine has neither a functional nor a structural effect in full-length PLB.

PLB is predominantly a homopentamer, with a small fraction of monomer, as assayed by SDS-PAGE (2Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

The residues presumed responsible for stabilizing the pentameric structure of PLB are located in the hydrophobic transmembrane domain (10Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M.

These transmembrane domain residues are largely composed of Leu and Ile, but this arrangement is punctuated with three cysteines in a five-residue repeat (Fig. 1). Mutation of these cysteines (at positions 36, 41, and 46 to Ser, Ala, or Phe, respectively) induces changes in the oligomeric stability of PLB (13Fujii J. Maruyamma K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation Cys-41 to Phe shows the strongest effect, decreasing the apparent pentameric stability. We have found that Cys-41 is unreactive and is located at a crucial site for the maintenance of the pentameric structure (5Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on these results, a structural model for the PLB pentamer has been proposed, in which each pair of subunits is stabilized by interhelical interactions between leucines 37, 44, and 51 with isoleucines 40 and 47 to form a Leu/Ile zipper (5Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M.

The transmembrane Cys residues do not appear to be involved in intermolecular disulfide bonding (2Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the chemical and steric packing properties of the cysteines in the pentameric structure of PLB as well as their function, we have used Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis to design a sterically identical PLB derivative. In the present study, we replaced all cysteine residues in PLB with α-amino-n-butyric acid (Abu), which is isosteric to cysteine (16Ferrer M. Woodward C. Barany G. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like many eukaryotic proteins, PLB is “capped” at the N-terminal methionine by posttranslational acetylation (17Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cytoplasmic portion of WT-PLB has a net charge of +3 with the posttranslational acetylation, but this charge increases to +4 in the absence of the acetyl group. It is not known whether this acetyl group in the full-length PLB is necessary for pentameric stabilization and interaction with the Ca-ATPase. No effect of nonacetylated PLB1–25 was reported, and only acetylated peptide Ac-PLB1–25 showed inhibition of the Ca-ATPase (18Starling A.P. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To clarify this subject, we determined the oligomeric states of acetylated and nonacetylated Abu-PLB in detergent solution by SDS-PAGE. The synthetic peptides were then co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase in lipid vesicles, and Ca-ATPase inhibition assays were performed in comparison to WT-PLB. Materials, solvents, instrumentation, and general methods of solid-phase peptide synthesis were essentially as described in our previous publications (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G.

We used acetic anhydride for the acetylation of the N-terminal amino group (23Tarr G.E. Black S.D. Fujita V.S. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). First, an Fmoc removal step was carried out on 200 mg of peptide resin (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), followed by treatment with 0.5 m acetic anhydride in 10 ml ofN,N-dimethylformamide. After 2 h, the acetylated peptide resin was filtered and then used for cleavage and purification (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fractions containing peptides were lyophilized to yield 26 mg of Abu-PLB (Fig. 1) (12% yield based on starting resin). Edward McKenna (Merck Research Laboratories), who synthesized the protein using an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer, graciously provided WT-PLB. WT-PLB was expressed in Sf21/baculovirus insect cell system and purified by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography as described previously (7Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

SR vesicles were prepared from the fast-twitch skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits (24Fernandez J.L. Rosemblatt M. Hidalgo C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 599: 552-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The Ca-ATPase from the SR vesicles was purified using a reactive-red affinity column (25Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using 16.5% Tris/Tricine gel (Bio-Rad) (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The peptide samples from the stock methanol/chloroform 2:1 solution were dried overnight. 20 µl of 1% SDS was added to the samples that contained 5 µg of Abu-PLB and WT-PLB. For SDS-PAGE, samples contained 20 µl of Tricine sample buffer (26Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) with a final SDS concentration of 1.5%. The temperature was controlled during electrophoresis by using a recirculating water bath. For the quantitation of Abu-PLB and WT-PLB monomers, the gels were scanned by a densitometer using the transmittance mode, and then the bands were quantitated using the volume (area × density) analysis method (27Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mass spectral data was acquired with a Bruker Biflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight system, which is equipped with an N2-laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length) and a microchannel plate detector. The data was collected in the linear mode, positive polarity, with an accelerating potential of 19 kV. Each spectrum is the accumulation of 100–400 laser shots. The samples were co-crystallized with the matrix 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid). The method used for the functional reconstitution of Ca-ATPase with PLB has been described (28Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In short, 33 µg of Abu-PLB or its analogues was dried and solubilized in 240 µl of chloroform containing 2.4 mg of lipids (DOPC/DOPE, 4:1). The dried film of lipid and PLB was hydrated with 120 µl of 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, by vortexing followed by a brief sonication. The resulting vesicles were diluted to 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol. Then, 4.8 mg of β-octyl glucoside was added, followed by 60 µg of purified Ca-ATPase. The final volume was adjusted to 300 µl with buffer. The detergent was then removed by incubation with 120 mg of hydrated Biobeads for 3 h at room temperature. The Ca-ATPase/PLB lipid vesicles were separated from Biobeads and assayed immediately. All Ca-ATPase/PLB co-reconstitution in the present study used a fixed molar ratio of 10 PLB/Ca-ATPase. As shown previously (27Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this ratio gives substantial effects, comparable to those in cardiac SR. Ca-ATPase activity was measured by an enzyme-linked assay performed in microtiter plates (200 µl total volume in each well) as described previously (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Madden T.D. Chapman D. Quinn P.J. Nature. 1979; 279: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Each well contained 0.2–0.6 µg of Ca-ATPase (1–3 µl of vesicles) and was added to a buffer containing 50 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 IU of pyruvate kinase, 2 IU of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1–2 µg of calcium ionophore (A23187). Each assay was done in triplicate at each of 12 different free calcium concentrations. The absorbance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm to determine the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The assays were performed at 15 and 25 °C in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Each data point represents average ± S.E. (n ≥ 6). A t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the differences between peptides and the effects of temperature. We started with our previously constructed, experimentally verified model for the PLB transmembrane domain (residues 35–52) (5Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This model was derived from that of Adamset al. (30Adams P.D. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (PDB entry 1PSL) by capping the N and C termini with N-acetyl and N′-methylamide groups, respectively, and then rotating each helix counter-clockwise around its axis by about 50° to produce a structure conforming to a leucine-zipper motif (12Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as supported by cysteine reactivity and site-directed spin labeling (5Karim C.B. Stamm J.D. Karim J. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12074-12081Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This structure was then used as the starting point for simulations carried out using AMBER 5.0 (31Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 32Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell T.E. Cheatham T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V.

University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar), as recently updated for the peptide backbone parameters (parm96.dat). Before energy minimization, side chain rotamers were generated using the program SQWRL (33Dunbrack R.L. Karplus M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) to relieve unfavorable interactions between side chains. Side chains were found to be in the most favorable conformation for an α-helix (33Dunbrack R.L. Karplus M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The template was energy-minimized using a 12-Å nonbonded cutoff, a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 r, and a converge criterion of 5 × 10−5 kcal/mol Å in the root mean square of the Cartesian elements of the energy gradient. Positional constraints were imposed on the backbone heavy atoms using a harmonic potential with a force constant of 5 kcal/mol Å2. Minimum energy conformations of the mutants were generated by replacing the side chains while maintaining the same backbone templates as in the wild-type protein. Interhelical energy differences were obtained as ΔEh = Eh –Eh0, where Eh is the nonbonded interchain energy per helix (34Némethy G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), andEh0 is the value for WT-PLB. The buried surface area was defined as ΔA = (Ai + Aj) –Aij, where Ai andAj are the surface areas of the individual helicesi and j, and Aij is the surface area of the dimer complex. Values were averaged over the five helix interfaces of the pentamer. Surface areas were generated using GRASP (35Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) with a probe size of 1.4 Å. Free energies of disassociation were estimated from the buried surface area by considering a penalty of 20 cal mol−1 Å–2 upon loss of interfacing surface (36Fleming K.G. Ackerman A.L. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy for acetylated Abu-PLB (Fig. 2) yielded anm/z value of 6066, [M + H], which is in agreement with the predicted value of 6066.44 Da. Mass spectral analysis of the free N-terminal Abu-PLB showed a peak at 6025 m/z, [M + H], which corresponded to the calculated molecular mass of 6023.40 Da. Amino acid analysis was also consistent with the expected composition (data not shown). We compared expressed WT-PLB (Fig. 3,lane 1) with synthetic acetylated (lane 2) and nonacetylated Abu-PLB (lane 3) on SDS-PAGE. WT-PLB and Abu-PLB each appears primarily as a 30-kDa pentamer, with a faint band at 6 kDa (monomer). This shows that in SDS solution at 25 °C, the pentamer is just as stable for Abu-PLB as for WT-PLB. Fig.4 shows the effects of synthetic WT-PLB and Abu-PLB on Ca-ATPase activity as a function of Ca2+concentration, measured in reconstituted membranes. Both WT-PLB and Abu-PLB decrease the activity of the Ca-ATPase at pCa below 5.5, resulting in an increase in pKCa (the calcium concentration, in pCa units, required for 50% calcium activation). Abu-PLB shifted pKCa by – 0.27 (control, 6.23 ± 0.02; Abu-PLB, 5.96 ± 0.02), whereas the shift by WT-PLB was –0.20 (6.03 ± 0.03) for this co-reconstitution system. There is a significant difference between the control and Abu-PLB (p = 2.5 E-06) but not between Abu-PLB and WT-PLB (p = 0.2). Thus, Abu-PLB shows similar inhibitory activity to WT-PLB, and Cys residues are not required for inhibition of the Ca-ATPase. To study the function of the acetyl group capping the N terminus, acetylated and nonacetylated Abu-PLB were reconstituted in membranes. Both peptides showed the same increase in pKCa (Fig. 5). There is no significant difference between acetylated and nonacetylated Abu-PLB (p = 0.60). This result shows that the acetyl group plays no role in the inhibition of the Ca-ATPase. Fig.6 shows the inhibitory effects of Ala-PLB and WT-PLB on Ca-ATPase activity. Ala-PLB decreases pKCa by 0.29 (control, 6.31 ± 0.02; Ala-PLB, 6.02 ± 0.02), whereas the decrease from WT-PLB is 0.20 (6.03 ± 0.03). There is a significant difference between the control and Ala-PLB (p = 1.7 E-09) but not between Ala-PLB and WT-PLB (p = 0.6). Table I summarizes the inhibitory potencies, measured as in Figs. 4 and 6, and oligomeric stabilities, measured from densitometry of SDS-PAGE, of the three PLB derivatives at three different temperatures. There was no significant difference in inhibitory potency among the three peptides, nor was there a significant temperature dependence. In contrast, there were substantial differences in oligomeric stability. At all three temperatures, WT-PLB was predominantly pentameric, and Ala-PLB was completely monomeric. At low temperature, Abu-PLB exhibited high pentameric stability, comparable to that of WT-PLB, but the Abu-PLB pentamer was much less stable at 37 °C. Fig.7 shows a comparison of the mobilities of the WT-PLB, Abu-PLB, and Ala-PLB on SDS-PAGE at room temperature. WT-PLB and Abu-PLB showed mobility characteristic of pentamers, whereas Ala-PLB was completely monomeric.Table IInhibitory effects and monomeric fractions of WT-PLB, Abu-PLB, and Ala-PLB, at 12, 25, and 37 °C12 °C25 °C37 °CInhibitionFraction monomerInhibitionFraction monomerInhibitionFraction monomerpKCashift%pKCa shift%pKCa shift%WT-PLB−0.23 ± .0712 ± 7−0.25 ± .0318 ± 5−0.25 ± .0522 ± 5Abu-PLB−0.34 ± .088 ± 5−0.27 ± .0232 ± 41-aSignificantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01).−0.30 ± .0478 ± 41-aSignificantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01).Ala-PLB−0.25 ± .07100 ± 21-aSignificantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01).−0.29 ± .02100 ± 21-aSignificantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01).−0.27 ± .04100 ± 21-aSignificantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01).1-a Significantly different from WT-PLB (p < 0.01). Open table in a new tab Previous studies have shown that mutations of the three cysteines in PLB to serine, alanine, or phenylalanine disrupts the pentameric structure of PLB, suggesting that the cysteine side chains are crucial for the oligomeric stability of PLB (12Simmerman H.K.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12950-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal goal of the present study was to determine whether the steric properties of Cys are sufficient for pentameric stability or whether the specific chemical properties of the thiol group are important. Another goal was to clarify the role of the N-terminal acetyl group for pentameric stability and interaction with the Ca-ATPase. We synthesized acetylated and nonacetylated Abu-PLB, an analogue of PLB in which the three Cys residues were replaced with Abu (Fig. 1), an amino acid analogue that is known to be isosteric with cysteine. SDS-PAGE of Abu-PLB indicated that it is primarily pentameric, as is WT-PLB (Fig. 3), indicating clearly that the apparent requirement of the three Cys residues for pentameric stability of PLB is based primarily on steric packing, not on the chemical properties of the thiol groups. N-terminal acetylation of Abu-PLB indicated no difference in the oligomeric stability and inhibitory function. Fig. 8 illustrates a structural model for helix packing in the transmembrane domain of the pentameric WT-PLB (left), Abu-PLB (middle), and Ala-PLB (right), focusing on the role of one of the three Cys residues, Cys-36. Note that the steric structure of the helix interface is indistinguishable for WT-PLB and Abu-PLB, showing excellent matching of the two helical surfaces. In this steric view, Abu-36 substitutes perfectly for Cys-36. However, in Ala-PLB, there is clearly a cavity created due to the smaller side chain of Ala-36, which should result in a loss of interhelical van der Waals stabilization energy. TableII summarizes calculations of predicted energetic properties of these three structures, focusing on the interhelical potential energy. Unlike total energies, interhelical potential energies can be compared between peptides with different sequences and can provide a direct comparison between mutants to estimate relative stability (34Némethy G. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We calculated interhelical energies,Eh, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” for the structural models of WT-PLB, Abu-PLB, and Ala-PLB (Fig. 8) by placing the side chains of residues at positions 36, 41, and 46 in the gauche(+) (χ1 = –60°) conformation.Table IIMolecular modeling of oligomeric stabilityWT-PLBAbu-PLBAla-PLBMonomers (%)2-aFrom SDS PAGE (25 °C).1532100ΔEh(kcal/mol)2-bTotal interchain nonbonded interaction energy per helix, relative to WT-PLB (Eh0 = −45.1 ± 1.0 kcal/mol).

Open table in a new tab As shown in Table II, the decreased pentameric stability (increased percentage of monomer) of Ala-PLB correlates with a calculated loss of energetically favorable interhelical van der Waals interactions, due to the smaller Ala side chain compared with Cys (ΔEh). In contrast, the isosteric Abu and Cys side chains result in isoenergetic interactions. These results mirror the calculated loss in free energy of association (ΔΔG in Table II), as obtained from a loss in the buried interhelical surface area, which is significantly less for Ala-PLB than for either WT-PLB or Abu-PLB. The estimated ΔΔG = 0.72 kcal/mol for an Ala-PLB dimer interface is about 50% of that calculated for the glycophorin mutants L75A and I76A (36Fleming K.G. Ackerman A.L. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The smaller values for Ala-PLB reflect the smaller volume change for a Cys to Ala mutation, as compared with a Leu (Ile) to Ala mutation. Whereas the PLB-Ala peptide is mostly monomeric, as measured by SDS-PAGE, the truncated peptide (residues 26–52) is mostly oligomeric (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The different behavior between full-length and truncated peptide suggest that a decrease in van der Waals interactions upon Cys-to-Ala mutation is not sufficient for depolymerization but that the N-terminal region also contributes to the energetics of the PLB pentamer (15Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the pentameric stabilities of WT-PLB and Abu-PLB are far more similar than that of Ala-PLB, SDS-PAGE at higher temperatures showed clearly that the WT-PLB pentamer is significantly more stable than Abu-PLB (Table I). This difference must be explained by interactions other than van der Waals, probably involving the specific chemical (polar) properties of the thiol group. Examination of the model structure reveals a possible hydrogen bond between Cys-36 and the backbone oxygen of Leu-37 and between Cys-36 and Cys-41 (Fig.9). These two interactions are absent in the model previously proposed by Arkin et al. (37Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. Bruenger A.T. Aimoto S. Engelman D.M. Smith S.O. J."

Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) and the characterization of their role in the onset of osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation, respectively. Nonetheless, some of the issues remain unresolved. One of the most important ones is that although, unquestionably, various members of the TGF-β superfamily are involved in these differentiation processes, their precise role and the gene transcription programs they modulate are not clear. The molecular aspects of signaling by the TGF-β1 family of ligands are well characterized and have been reviewed extensively (6Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dimeric ligands bind to a cognate type II receptor, allowing it to associate with type I receptor into a tetrameric complex. After the formation of signaling receptor complexes, the type I receptor phosphorylates various intracellular proteins such as the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads). Following the phosphorylation, the activated R-Smads heterodimerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus of the cell. There they directly bind to DNA and/or interact with transcription factors/cofactors, affecting gene expression. The issue of the signaling specificity is not yet completely resolved, because ligands display a certain degree of promiscuity towards different combinations of receptors. Based on experiments in vitro, it is generally acknowledged that the R-Smads 1, 5, and 8 are involved in transducing BMP, whereas R-Smads 2 and 3 signal TGF-β activity. Because activated R-Smads function predominantly in the cell nucleus, the investigation of their mechanism of action has resulted in the isolation and characterization of various nuclear Smad-interacting proteins. One such protein is Smad-interacting protein 1 (8Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol.

SIP1 is one of a few novel proteins isolated by the virtue of its interaction with activated, but not latent, R-Smads. It is a member of an emerging family of two-handed zinc finger transcription factors including two other proteins: Drosophila melanogaster zfh1 (9Fortini M.E. Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar),Danioreriokheper (10Muraoka O. Ichikawa H. Shi H. Okumura S. Taira E. Higuchi H. Hirano T. Hibi M. Miki N. Dev.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DNA binding specificity of SIP1 is defined by a CACCT/CACCTG bipartite site wherein the two sequences are separated by a variable distance ranging from 8 bp in the mouse follistatin promoter 2K. Verschueren and D. Huylebroeck, unpublished data.2K. Verschueren and D. Huylebroeck, unpublished data. to 44 bp in the E-cadherin promoter (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Analysis of other known TGF-β-responsive promoters revealed that a few other genes contain putative SIP1 binding sites, among them the liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (LBK-ALP) gene. At least five different genes, Akp 1–5, encode various forms of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1.) (www.jax.org). Depending on the expression pattern of those genes, we can distinguish embryonic, intestinal, or liver/bone/kidney (also known as tissue-nonspecific) alkaline phosphatases (13Hahnel A.C. Rappolee D.A. Millan J.L. Manes T. Ziomek C.A. Theodosiou N.G. Werb Z. Pedersen R.A. Schultz G.A. Development. 1990; 110: 555-564PubMed Google Scholar, 14Manes T. Glade K. Ziomek C.A. Millan J.L. Genomics. 1990; 8: 541-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the expression of theLBK-ALP gene in vivo is not restricted to bone, the up-regulation of this gene in vitro has been generally associated with the onset of osteogenic differentiation. The gene is using at least two promoters; one of them, located upstream of exon 1A, is responsible for the expression of LBK-ALP in multiple tissues including bone. The second promoter, located upstream from exon 1B, is activated only in heart muscle. Few regulatory sequences were identified in the first promoter, but none of them has been linked directly to the previously documented induction of endogenousLBK-ALP gene transcription by BMP (15Weiss M.J. Ray K. Henthorn P.S. Lamb B. Kadesch T. Harris H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12002-12010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsuura S. Kishi F. Kajii T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Terao M. Studer M. Gianni M. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We decided to reanalyze the regulatory region of the LBK-ALPgene upstream of the exon IA using the well characterized system of BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. This mouse skeletal muscle progenitor cell line was used initially to study myogenesis induced by serum starvation (18Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). It has been subsequently discovered that the differentiation process could be inhibited by exposure of cells to ligands of the TGF-β family. Interestingly, TGF-β and BMP2 have different effects on C2C12 differentiationin vitro. Both ligands are able to inhibit myogenesis, but only BMP2 can redirect C2C12 cells into the osteogenic differentiation pathway (19Filvaroff E.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Development. 1994; 120: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar, 20Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). The reason for that striking difference is not quite clear. In the present study we investigated whether SIP1 could be a candidate regulator of LBK-ALP transcription in C2C12 cells. We demonstrate here that SIP1 can repress LBK-ALP promoter activity. Moreover, we show that this repression is related to the binding of SIP1 to the CACCT/CACCTG sites in this promoter. Interestingly, SIP1 and alkaline phosphatase expression domains in developing mouse limb are mutually exclusive, suggesting a possibility that SIP1 might also be involved in the transcriptional regulation ofLBK-ALP in vivo. All culture media, sera, and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. unless stated otherwise. The C2C12 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (4.5 g/liter) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml ampicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were passaged at 90% confluence and split 1:10 or 1:20, depending on the desired density. To induce differentiation the cells were placed in starvation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose, 2% horse serum supplemented with 10 mg of bovine insulin/ml, 10 mg of transferrin/ml, and 3 × 10−8m selenium. All cells were grown in a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere, in 95% humidity, at 37 °C. Cos-1 cells used for eukaryotic expression were maintained in the same medium and supplements as described above. The cells were split 1:10 upon reaching 80% confluence. For transfections, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates (NUNC) 24 h prior to the transfection. The fragments of the first and the secondLBK-ALP promoters were provided kindly by E. Garattini (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy), and constitutively active type I receptors (CA Alks) were obtained from P. ten Dijke (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All other constructs were generated in our laboratories using PCR. PCR fragments used in reporter assays were cloned into the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) containing thymidine kinase minimal promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. Transfections were carried out using the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche) according to manufacturer instructions. We found that in our case the optimal Fugene/DNA ratio was 2 µl of Fugene to 1 µg of DNA; therefore, when necessary, the amount of DNA was adjusted to 1 µg/well with the empty expression vector DNA. In all the assays the results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity values obtained from the cotransfected RSVLacZ expression plasmid (1 ng/well). Transfected cells were washed once with PBS at room temperature, and then 50 µl of PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 (Ultrapure, Pierce) was added to the wells. After two freeze-thaw cycles at −80 °C the lysates were transferred to round-bottom 96-well plates, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g. For all subsequent assays 5 µl of the lysates was used, and the remaining lysates were stored at −80 °C for future use. For the luciferase reporter assays we used a luciferase kit from Promega, β-galactosidase expression was measured with the TropiX Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the endogenous ALP was measured with the ALP kit (KPL Laboratories). The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The expression plasmid encoding N-terminally Myc-tagged SIP1 (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W.

Processing of the cells and subsequent EMSAs were carried out as described before (8Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R.

Appropriate probes were obtained by PCR, purified as described below, and end-labeled with 32P using Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h. The probe was subsequently purified on MiniElute Columns (Qiagen), and 40,000 cpm of the labeled probe was used for one EMSA reaction. DNA fragments used for EMSAs and reporter cloning were generated as follows. The appropriate oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) carrying the desired point mutations were used as primers in a PCR reaction on a wild-type DNA target. All PCRs were carried out in a 10-µl volume in a 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by denaturation at 96 °C for 5 s, annealing at 60 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The first five cycles were applied using Taqpolymerase (Eurogentec, Belgium). Subsequently, a 1-µl aliquot of the product was used as a template in a reaction with a proofreadingPfu-turbo polymerase (Stratagene). Using this strategy, we produced a small amount of template containing the mutation that would otherwise be repaired by the Pfu enzyme. Subsequently,Pfu was used to produce blunt-ended fragments used either in EMSAs or for cloning to generate the necessary reporter plasmids. The PCR fragments were purified using the MiniElute PCR purification system (Qiagen). The cloning of the PCR products was done using the PCR Script kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer protocol with minor modifications. All cloned fragments were subsequently sequenced to ascertain that only the desired mutations were present.LBK-ALP primers used in the course of this work were: PT133-Alp-sense, AAGGGTGTGAGGCTCAGAGG; PT135-Alp-Asense2, TCTGTGAACCCACCTGGCTC; PT153-Alp-sense-mut, AAGGGTGTGAGGCTCAGAGATG; and PT154-Alp-Asense1-mut, TCTGTGAACCCATCTGGCTC. Detection of Myc-tagged SIP1 by Western blotting was carried out as described elsewhere (8Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T.

The in situhybridizations were carried out using dioxygenin-labeled probe and thein situ hybridization kit from Roche Diagnostics (21Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Signal detection was carried out using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies. The photographs were taken with a Leica HC microscope using a Spot2 digital camera and collection software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). High affinity binding of SIP1 to DNA requires a bipartite and spaced CACCT(G) (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). An analysis of available promoter sequences of genes known to be regulated by BMPs (hercules.tigem.it/TargetFinder.html) revealed that one of these genes, mouse LBK-ALP, contains a cluster of potential SIP1 binding sites separated by 54 bp located in the promoter upstream of exon 1A near the TATA box (Fig.1A, upper panel). Additionally, we found a similar site distribution in the humanLBK-ALP gene (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Because two other examples of promoters were published in which SIP1 binding sites formed a very similar cluster near the putative TATA boxes (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we decided to carry out EMSA to determine whether N-terminally tagged Myc-SIP1 could bind to the mouseLBK-ALP promoter in vitro. As a probe, we used a32P end-labeled 92-bp fragment of the mouseLBK-ALP promoter containing CACCT/CACCTG sites (using the PT133xPT135 primer combination; see Fig. 1 B). Indeed, SIP1 did interact with the promoter fragment of LBK-ALP as demonstrated by EMSA and subsequent supershift of the SIP1 band with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Fig.2A).Figure 2SIP1 binds to the LBK-ALPpromoter fragment. A, the end-labeled PCR product of 92 bp containing SIP1 binding sites separated by 54 bases was incubated with extracts from Cos-1 cells transfected with an expression construct encoding Myc-tagged SIP1. Lane 1, mock-transfected cells; lane 2, extracts from cells expressing Myc-tagged SIP1; lane 3, the same extract as described in lane 2 but incubated with the anti-Myc antibody.

The arrow indicates the SIP1-shifted band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify whether the binding depended on the presence of the bipartite CACCT … CACCTG motive, we carried out competition assays. We generated four different competing probes: wild-type PT133xPT135, right-site mutant PT133xPT154, left-site mutant PT153xPT135, and the double mutant PT153xPT154 (primers are shown in Fig.2 B). As can be seen in Fig. 2 C, lane 1, the wild-type promoter fragment competed for SIP1 binding with a 30-fold molar excess of the wild-type, unlabeled, probe. The double mutant (Fig.2 B, lane 4), as expected, was unable to compete for binding to SIP1, but single-site mutants competed in a distinct fashion. The right-site mutant (lane 2) was not able to abrogate the SIP1 binding to the radiolabeled probe, whereas the left-site mutant (lane 3) did compete partially for the binding. This indicated that the right site (the E2 site CACCTG) alone was still able to bind SIP1, although with apparently lower affinity, whereas the left site alone could not. Taken together, the above results indicate that SIP1 can bind to theLBK-ALP promoter fragment in vitro and that this binding depends on the presence of an intact bipartite CACCT/CACCTG binding site. BMP signaling induces LBK-ALP activity in vitro in a number of cellular systems. In addition, previous studies of the regulation of the Xbra gene (8Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol.

Development. 2000; 127: 2729-2739PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that SIP1 could act in that case as a transcriptional repressor. Therefore we decided to test whether SIP1 could repress BMP-inducedLBK-ALP activity in vitro. To investigate the response only in cells overexpressing SIP1, instead of using ligand, we cotransfected cells with constitutively active forms of BMP type I receptors. We first determined the conditions leading to the highest up-regulation of LBK-ALP by transiently transfecting C2C12 cells with CA BMP receptors in conjunction with various wild-type R-Smads. Neither CA Alk4 nor CA Alk5 induced measurable LBK-ALP activity (data not shown and Ref. 23Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Constitutively active Alk1, Alk2, Alk3, or Alk6 did induce the endogenous LBK-ALP activity (Fig.3). Smads 1 or 5, separately or combined, also led to increased levels of endogenous ALP, but that induction always remained low (Fig. 3, pCS2 lane, and data not shown), whereas the cotransfection of CA Alks with R-Smads induced the endogenous Alp in a synergistic manner (Fig. 3, gray columns). Because CA Alk2 in combination with Smad1/Smad5 consistently gave the strongest induction of the endogenous ALP, we chose these conditions for all subsequent experiments. We then transiently transfected C2C12 cells with CA Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 combinations and cotransfected with expression constructs encoding SIP1. The induction of endogenous ALP activity by CA Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 was repressed strongly by cotransfection with SIP1 (Fig.4). To test whether the repression was related to SIP1 binding to DNA, we transfected a SIP1 mutant that could not bind to the DNA target because both zinc finger clusters had been mutated (SIP1NZF3CZF3) (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4., this mutant failed to repress efficiently the endogenousLBK-ALP activity. The lack of repression was not related to the levels of produced SIP1 (data not shown). Next, we determined whether the repressive activity of SIP1 could be assigned to the DNA fragment containing the SIP1 bipartite binding site. First, we cloned the available promoter fragment located upstream of the exon 1A of LBK-ALP into pGL3. Subsequently, we transfected this plasmid into C2C12 cells and cotransfected with CA-Alk2 and Smad1/Smad5. As demonstrated in Fig.5A, this reporter was, similar to the endogenous gene, induced by CA-Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 and repressed by cotransfection with SIP1. Thus, the 1.9-kilobase promoter fragment ofLBK-ALP contains the regulatory sequences directing the response of the reporter gene to CA ALK2/Smad1/Smad5 induction and SIP1 repression. Because EMSA demonstrated that a 92-bp fragment of this promoter could specifically bind SIP1, we repeated the reporter assays using this promoter fragment. As shown in Fig. 5 B, shaded bars, the reporter containing the wild-type sequences was induced in a similar way by CA Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 and again repressed by SIP1 as we have shown for the endogenous gene or the 1.9-kilobase promoter fragment (Figs. 4 and 5 A, respectively). To confirm that the reporter response was related directly to SIP1 binding to DNA, we used a mutant reporter in which the right binding site (CACCTG) was mutated to CAACTG. This mutant reporter could still be induced by CA Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 but failed to be repressed by SIP1 (Fig.5 B). To demonstrate that the above effect was related directly to SIP1 binding to DNA, we cotransfected the cells with the SIP1NZF3CZF3 expression plasmid. This SIP1 mutant protein, which binds to DNA with very low affinity (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), failed to interfere with the induction of the wild-type reporter, although its synthesis levels were comparable with the wild-type SIP1 (data not shown). The above results identify in the promoter of the mouseLBK-ALP gene a region (between −326 and −381) necessary and sufficient for SIP1-mediated repression. The results obtained during our in vitro studies indicated that, at least mechanistically, SIP1 could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the mouseLBK-ALP gene. To begin addressing the biological significance of this observation we compared the expression of SIP1 mRNA and ALP in developing mouse limbs. As can be seen in Fig.6, the expression patterns of both genes are quite distinct and not overlapping. At 12.5 dpc, ALP was not yet detectable (Fig. 6 A, left paneland Ref. 24MacGregor G.R. Zambrowicz B.P. Soriano P. Development. 1995; 121: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SIP1 mRNA, on the other hand, was expressed in a discrete pattern as seen in Fig. 6 A, right panel. One day later, at 13.5 dpc, the ALP could be detected around the cartilaginous core of the phalanges. SIP1 mRNA expression was excluded from that area but was present in a broad area around the putative tendon. Detailed expression analysis of the midgestation mouse embryo did not reveal any tissues in the developing mouse limb that would show a clear overlap of the expression domains of both genes (data not shown). In this paper we provide evidence that SIP1 can bind in vitro to a CACCT/CACCTG sequence cluster in the promoter of the mouse LBK-ALP gene. Not only is this binding specific, but it is also responsible for the repression of reporter constructs carrying that promoter fragment. These data suggest that SIP1 could be a candidate repressor protein for the LBK-ALP gene. The promoter of the LBK-ALP gene has been analyzed partially in mouse as well as in rat. The initial characterization of the mouse gene (17Terao M. Studer M. Gianni M. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) led to the discovery of two promoters of that gene. The first promoter, located upstream of the exon 1A, is responsible for the expression of LBK-ALP in a number of tissues including bone. The second promoter, located upstream from the exon 1B is activated uniquely in heart. Subsequent studies focused on the identification ofcis-regulatory elements in the promoter of the gene. They resulted in the identification of promoter elements directly involved in the up-regulation of LBK-ALP by retinoic acid (25Heath J.K. Suva L.J. Yoon K. Kiledjian M. Martin T.J. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 636-646PubMed Google Scholar) or by a combination of vitamin D3 and TGF-β (26Johnson-Pais T.L. Leach R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 67-74Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the fact that BMPs are known to be very potent inducers of the endogenous LBK-ALP in vitro, no cis-acting promoter elements in that gene could be linked directly to this effect (27Kobayashi T. Sugimoto T. Kanzawa M. Chihara K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 683-691PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we delineate a promoter region from position −326 to −381 that is sufficient to mediate BMP-dependent induction and SIP1-dependent repression through the bipartite CACCT/CACCTG cluster. Similar domain distribution has been found in the human LBK-ALP promoter, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the regulatory elements between mouse and human. How might SIP1 be involved in the regulation of LBK-ALPtranscription? One possible explanation could involve the induction ofLBK-ALP transcription through a derepression mechanism whereby the activity of SIP1 is extinguished. A similar mode of action was reported for Drosophila brinker, a transcriptional repressor of dpp-responsive genes. In that case,dpp (a Drosophila homologue of BMP2) down-regulated brinker transcription and consequently up-regulated a number of downstream targets (28Jazwinska A. Kirov N. Wieschaus E. Roth S. Rushlow C. Cell. 1999; 96: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Marty T. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A recent analysis of the regulation of the collagen type II promoter by δEF1 (30Murray D. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3610-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) provides an interesting context for our observations. SIP1 and δEF1 are two distinct members of the same family of two-handed zinc finger proteins. Their domain structure is very similar, with the highest degree of amino acid sequence conservation in the areas encoding the N- and C-terminal zinc finger clusters (8Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20489-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The DNA binding specificity of these zinc finger clusters is identical in vitro (12Remacle J.E. Kraft H. Lerchner W. Wuytens G. Collart C. Verschueren K. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and the in vivo mRNA expression data suggest only a limited overlap between Sip1 and δEF1 expression in developing mouse limbs 3P. Tylzanowski, K. Verschueren, D. Huylebroeck, and F. P. Luyten, unpublished data. (31Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus likely that both genes might act as transcriptional repressors in different tissues and that SIP1-mediated repression ofLBK-ALP transcription prior to osteogenic differentiation is akin to δEF1-mediated repression of collagen type II prior to the chondrogenic one (30Murray D. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3610-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, targeted inactivation of δEF1 in mouse yielded a specific albeit complex skeletal phenotype (31Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some aspects of that phenotype such as hypoplasia of Meckell's cartilage and intervertebral disks as well as shortening and broadening of the long bones and joint fusions resemble phenotypes arising from inactivation of other genes known to be involved in chondrogenesis,e.g. Indian hedgehog, PTH/PTHrP, noggin (www.jax.org), or from GDF5/CDMP1 overexpression (32Tsumaki N. Tanaka K. Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Nakase T. Kimura T. Thomas J.T. Ochi T. Luyten F.P. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus it will be interesting to see if the targeted inactivation of SIP1 would result in skeletal abnormalities. Finally, a limited analysis of the gene expression pattern in the developing mouse revealed that SIP1 and ALP have distinct nonoverlapping areas of expression. ALP expression in the developing limb was detected from 13.5 dpc onward around the developing cartilage anlage demarcating the cells actively undergoing osteogenic differentiation. SIP1, on the other hand, was detected earlier (12.5 dpc), initially in the central part of the limb. Subsequently, at 13.5 dpc, the expression was seen ventrally to the cartilage anlage and around putative tendon but excluded from the alkaline phosphatase-positive areas. This mutual exclusivity of expression patterns resemble that of δEF1 and collagen type II (30Murray D. Precht P. Balakir R. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3610-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, if the extinguishing of δEF1 expression is a prerequisite for the induction of collagen type II, one could envision a similar situation for SIP1 in the case of LBK-ALP. Here, only tissues not expressing SIP1 would be competent to express LBK-ALP. Obviously, in vivo, the situation is most probably more complicated, and a number of other transcription factors may contribute to the regulated expression of alkaline phosphatase. On the other hand, the absence of SIP1 could be a prerequisite for the activation ofLBK-ALP transcription. It is noteworthy that SIP1 is expressed around developing tendons. Not much is known about the molecular players participating in tendon formation, although expression of a few genes has been associated with that tissue. The Six1 and Six2 genes, both encoding homeodomain proteins, have been reported to be expressed in tendon and muscle during mouse development (33Oliver G. Wehr R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cheyette B.N. Hartenstein V. Zipursky S.L. Gruss P. Development. 1995; 121: 693-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheEph-related receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cek-8 was detected in developing chick tendons (34Patel K. Nittenberg R. D'Souza D. Irving C. Burt D. Wilkinson D.G. Tickle C. Development. 1996; 122: 1147-1155PubMed Google Scholar) and Eya1 and Eya2 transcriptional activators (35Xu P.X. Cheng J. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11974-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have been associated with patterning of tendons during mouse development. Finally, GDF5 and GDF7 have been implicated in the induction of tendons (36Wolfman N.M. Hattersley G. Cox K. Celeste A.J. Nelson R. Yamaji N. Dube J.L. DiBlasio-Smith E. Nove J. Song J.J. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The broad expression pattern of SIP1 around but not inside developing mouse tendon might suggest that only the cells that are at early stages of differentiation would be expressing this gene. Indeed, perhaps down-regulation of SIP1 expression is one of the prerequisites for terminal differentiation also in this tissue. The biological function of SIP1 and other family members of that group of transcription factors remains an open question. Some indication came from experiments in transgenic frog embryos. In this case, a mutation of 1 bp in the promoter of Xbra abolishing SIP1 binding caused ectopic expression of Xbra mRNA in the gastrula (22Lerchner W. Latinkic B.V. Remacle J.E. Huylebroeck D. Smith J.C. Development. 2000; 127: 2729-2739PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this ectopic expression was suppressed in later stages of frog development clearly indicating that there are other players involved in the regulation of Xbra. Thus, the SIP1/δEF1 group of transcriptional repressors might be required to control spatio-temporal expression of target genes by repression rather than activation and thus be involved in the maintenance of a pool of undifferentiated cells required for later stages of development and/or tissue repair. In summary, we have shown that a CACCT/CACCTG DNA cluster in the promoter of mouse LBK-ALP can bind SIP1 in vitroand that this binding depended on the integrity of those sites. Moreover, CA Alk2/Smad1/Smad5 could up-regulate a reporter plasmid carrying this construct and SIP1 could repress it. SIP1 had the same effect on the activity of the endogenous ALP indicating that the intact CACCT/CACCTG DNA cluster in the promoter of mouse LBK-ALPwas necessary and sufficient for the SIP1-mediated repression of its activity.

https://openalex.org/W1983158433,"Early preneoplastic cells (sup+) exhibit increased susceptibility to apoptosis, which is lost in late stage preneoplastic cells (sup−). Sup+ cells, which undergo apooptosis when cultured in low serum, show little or no DNA binding activity to nuclear factor (NF)-κB either in 10% or 0.2% serum. In contrast sup− cells, which are resistant to apoptosis in low serum, show a sustained constitutive activation of NF-κB. The constitutive activation of NF-κB observed in sup− cells is not due to loss of IκBα.

In sup− cells in low serum, addition of BAPTA-AM also resulted in a significant (∼50%) increase in caspase-3 activity. Raising extracellular Ca2+ in sup+ cells resulted in a slight activation of IκB kinase and in enhanced NF-κB DNA binding activity. Using proteasome and calpain inhibitors, we determined that the basal activity of NF-κB in sup− cells is largely proteasome-independent, but sensitive to calpain inhibitors. Taken together these data suggest that the elevated Ca2+ in sup− cells causes a modest activation of IKK, which likely contributes to the enhanced basal activation of NF-κB in sup− cells; however, the predominant effect of Ca2+ appears to be mediated by Ca2+-enhanced degradation by calpain.

It has been shown that signals that lead to proliferation frequently stimulate apoptosis unless they are counteracted by specific survival signals (1Finco T. Westwick J. Norris J. Beg A. Der C. Baldwin Jr., A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Mayo M. Baldwin A. Biochem. Biophys.

Thus it is not surprising that a common feature of early preneoplastic cells is a susceptibility to apoptosis, which is overcome in later stage neoplastic cells by either stimulating survival signals or by inhibiting apoptotic signals (2Mayo M. Baldwin A. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar, 4Preston G. Lang J. Maronpot R. Barrett J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand how cells overcome apoptosis during neoplastic progression, we have examined variants of Syrian hamster embryo cells that have been mutagenized to yield two immortalized cell lines representing different stages of neoplastic progression. It has been shown previously that early preneoplastic cells (sup+) are more susceptible to apoptosis than late preneoplastic cells (sup−) (4Preston G. Lang J. Maronpot R. Barrett J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism involved in this altered susceptibility to apoptosis could have important implications for carcinogenesis. Many apoptotic stimuli activate NF-κB1 (8Marinovich M. Viviani B. Corsini E. Ghilardi F. Galli C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Grimm S. Bauer M. Baeuerle K. Shulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and it was originally assumed that the increase in NF-κB activity might be involved in stimulating apoptosis. However, recent studies have shown that if NF-κB activation is inhibited, apoptosis is enhanced (5Wang C. Mayo M. Baldwin A.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 6Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar, 7Van Antwerp D. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of NF-κB in apoptosis we were interested in investigating whether there were differences in NF-κB activity in early versus late preneoplastic cells, as these cells have differing sensitivity to apoptosis. NF-κB is a transcription factor that is activated by numerous cytokines and stresses. NF-κB is normally maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm, because it is bound to inhibitors of the IκB family. Phosphorylation of IκB targets it for degradation, thereby leading to activation of NF-κB. We found a sustained basal activation of NF-κB in late (sup−), but not early stage (sup+) preneoplastic cells. The sustained activation of NF-κB in the sup− cells correlates with their resistance to apoptosis following treatment with medium containing low serum, a condition that leads to apoptosis in the sup+ cells. We examined possible mechanisms for the sustained activation of NF-κB in the sup− cells and noted a correlation with elevated cytosolic calcium. The late preneoplastic sup− cells have a basal cytosolic free Ca2+ level that is more than double that observed in the early preneoplastic sup+ cells. An elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ is commonly noted in transformed cells and has been proposed to be important in signaling cell proliferation (10Berridge M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar,11Wojnowski L. Hoyland I. Mason W. Schwab A. Westphale H. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data showing that an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ can also provide survival signals by contributing to a sustained activation of NF-κB. Two cell lines (sup+ and sup−), originally immortalized via asbestos mutagenesis of Syrian hamster embryo cells, were used in these studies (12Koi M. Barrett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5992-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified IBR medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 10% CO2/90% air. Low serum conditions were either 0.2 or 0.8% fetal calf serum, depending upon the age of the serum. As the serum aged, later experiments required the higher percentage of fetal calf serum. Extracts of nuclear proteins were prepared using a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (13Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Syrian hamster embryo cells were plated at a density of 1.1 × 106 cells/150-mm diameter plate in 20 ml of IBR medium with 10% FCS for 24 h, then switched to various treatments for 16–18 h. Cells were scraped into medium plus 20 ml of cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS), centrifuged at 480 ×g, and then washed in 10 ml of cold CMF-PBS. Following centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), vortexed, and the nuclei pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mmorthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected and protein content quantified using the Pierce BCA assay. Binding reactions for NF-κB/DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF) using 10 μg of nuclear protein, 169 pg of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 18 μl. Bound complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels, and densitometry of autoradiographs was performed using the software package NIH Image. Cytosolic calcium was measured as described previously (14Jayadev S. Petranka J. Cheran S. Bierman J. Barrett J. Murphy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8261-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/plate in IBR medium with 10% serum in 30-mm plates containing 22-mm diameter round glass coverslips. Fura-2 AM (2 μm) was introduced to each plate 30 min prior to measurements. Following the loading period, coverslips were washed twice with CMF-PBS and placed in a custom-built holder. The entire unit was placed on the stage of a Nikon inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled to a PTI Deltascan dual excitation wavelength spectrofluorometer. Measurements were taken in a window containing two to six cells. Cells were excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emitted fluorescence was measured at 510 nm. Background fluorescence, measured from a field not containing cells, was subtracted. Cells were seeded in 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and grown for 24 h. Cells were washed with CMF-PBS, and 10 ml of the appropriate treatment medium was added. After 16–18 h, cells (adherent and floating cells) were harvested by scraping into treatment medium followed by centrifugation at 480 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 5 ml of cold CMF-PBS, centrifuged as above, and the resulting pellets lysed in 40 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) followed by four cycles of freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. The lysate was centrifuged in a 4 °C microcentrifuge for 20 min at 16,000 × g. Supernatants were collected and protein content quantified using the Pierce BCA assay. The caspase-3 activity assay was performed according to the protocol in the CaspACE Assay System (Promega). Data are expressed as caspase activity (change in arbitrary fluorescence units) corrected for background caspase activity. Activity of IκB kinase (IKK) was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by a phosphorylation assay. Cells were seeded in 100-mm diameter plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/plate and grown for 24–40 h before treatments. Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into medium, centrifuging at 480 × g, and washing the pellets twice with 5 ml of cold CMF-PBS. Pellets were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatants taken for immunoprecipitation, which was performed in 500 μl of lysis buffer for 2–3 h at 4 °C using 200 μg of cell lysate and an agarose-conjugated antibody to IKK-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-7182AC). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (Cell Signaling Technology catalog number 9802), supplemented with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Kinase reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-IκB-α substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number 4094), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μm ATP. Reactions were terminated with 5× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled 5 min at 95 °C before performing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 8% Tris-glycine gels. Densitometry of autoradiographs was performed using NIH image. Cells were plated at a density of 1.1 × 106 cells/150-mm diameter plate in 20 ml of IBR medium with 10% serum for 24 h, then switched to various treatments for 16–18 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into medium plus 20 ml of cold CMF-PBS, centrifuging at 480 ×g, and then washing two times in 5 ml of cold CMF-PBS. Pellets were then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 400 μm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA assay, and 25 μg of total protein per lane was loaded on a 10% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Following Western blotting to a nitrocellulose membrane, IκB-α and IκB-β were detected using Santa Cruz antibodies sc-371 and sc-945, respectively, and Bcl-2 was detected using Transduction Laboratories antibody numberB46620. The NF-κB oligonucleotide probe was purchased from Promega, proteinase K from Boerhinger-Mannheim, and RNase A from 5 Prime → 3 Prime. BAY 11-7082, lactacystin, proteasome inhibitor-I, EST, and calpain inhibitor-V were obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were acquired from Sigma/Aldrich. IBR medium was obtained from Life Technologies Inc., and fetal calf serum was obtained from Summit Technologies. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. For comparison between two groups, statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. For multiparameter comparisons, statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance, adjusting for multiple comparisons using Tukey's post hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Previous studies have shown that early stage preneoplastic sup+ cells have enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis under antiproliferative conditions such as treatment with low serum, whereas later stage preneoplastic sup− cells do not (4Preston G. Lang J. Maronpot R. Barrett J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in determining the basis for this difference in susceptibility to apoptosis. We examined whether there were differences in Bcl-2 expression levels between sup+ and sup− cells. As shown in Fig.1, there is no significant difference in Bcl-2 levels in sup+ and sup− cells. Because NF-κB activation has been shown to be anti-apoptotic, we next investigated whether differences in NF-κB activation between the two cell lines might explain the difference in apoptotic susceptibility. To determine whether NF-κB activation differs in sup+versus sup− cells, we cultured each cell line in medium supplemented with 10% FCS for 24 h. The medium containing 10% FCS was then replaced with medium containing either 10% or low serum for an additional 18 h prior to cell harvest. Extracts enriched for nuclear proteins were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Sup+ cells showed relatively little DNA binding activity of NF-κB, either in 10% or low serum (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, sup− cells showed constitutive NF-κB activation in 10% FCS (∼5.3 times sup+ levels in 10% serum) and even stronger activation when switched to low serum (∼15.8 times sup+ levels in low serum). Because sup− cells have constitutive activation of NF-κB and decreased susceptibility to apoptosis in low serum, we tested whether pharmacological lowering of NF-κB in sup− cells would render them more susceptible to apoptosis. BAY 11-7082 has been reported to inhibit phosphorylation of IκB and thus to decrease NF-κB activation (15Pierce J. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S. Collins T. Gerritsen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar,16Thevenod F. Friedmann J. Katsen A. Hauuser I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1887-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sup− cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated for 18 h with 1 or 2 μm BAY 11-7082. NF-κB activation was decreased with BAY 11-7082 treatment (Fig.3A). BAY 11-7082 treatment also inhibited IKK activity (Fig. 3B). Similarly treated sup− cells were assayed for apoptotic induction using caspase-3 activity as a measure of apoptosis after 18 h treatment in low FCS, with and without BAY 11-7082. As shown in Fig. 3C, caspase-3 activity was significantly higher in low serum-treated sup− cells in the presence of BAY 11-7082, compared with sup− cells in low serum alone. Fig. 3C further shows that caspase-3 activity in sup− cells in low serum plus BAY 11-7082 was similar to that in sup+ cells in low serum. We were interested in the mechanism responsible for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in the sup− cells. Constitutive activation of NF-κB is observed in many tumor and viral-infected cells. Some tumor cells have constitutive activation of NF-κB due to mutation or loss of IκBα (17Cabannes E. Khan G. Aillet F. Jarrett R. Hay R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 18Krappmann D. Emmerich F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, loss of IκBα does not account for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in sup− cells, because we found slightly increased levels of IκBα in sup− versus sup+ cells (see Fig. 4A). An increase in IκBα in sup− cells is consistent with constitutive activation of NF-κB in these cells, because expression of IκBα has been shown to be up-regulated by NF-κB (19Chiao P. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 20de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of NF-κB can also occur because of hypophosphorylation of IκBβ (21Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 4B, IκBβ has a similar electrophoretic mobility in sup+ and sup− cells, suggesting a similar level of phosphorylation. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5, sup− cells, which have constitutive activation of NF-κB, have a 2-fold increase in cytosolic Ca2+ compared with sup+ cells, which lack basal NF-κB activation. Cytosolic free Ca2+ in sup− cells was 220 ± 26 nm, a value double that measured in the sup+ cells (97 ± 18 nm). An elevation in Ca2+ has been suggested to activate NF-κB (22Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kanno T. Siebenlist U. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5277-5283PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sun L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Tando Y. Algul H. Wagner M. Weidenbach H. Adler G. Schmid R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G678-G686PubMed Google Scholar, 26Han B. Logsdon C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C344-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the constitutive activation of NF-κB in sup− cells is related to the observed increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, we treated sup− cells in medium plus 10% serum with the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. Cells were grown for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm BAPTA-AM for 1 or 2 h. Base-line NF-κB binding activity decreased to ∼34% of control at 1 and 2 h after treatment with BAPTA-AM (Fig.6). To determine whether BAPTA-AM treatment in fact lowered cytosolic Ca2+ levels, intracellular Ca2+ was measured spectrofluorometrically in fura-2-loaded cells. Cells were treated with BAPTA-AM for 2 h, loaded with fura-2 AM for 30 min, washed in PBS, and fluorescence was measured. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels of BAPTA-AM-treated sup− cells decreased by ∼31% compared with untreated sup− cells (Fig.7). Thus, lowering cytosolic Ca2+ levels with BAPTA-AM also lowers NF-κB binding activity. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.8, lowering cytosolic Ca2+with BAPTA-AM resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity measured at 4 h after treatment of sup− cells in low serum. Sup− cells placed in low serum showed only minimal activation of caspase-3. However, lowering cytosolic Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM resulted in a 48% increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 8). Caspase-3 activity was measured at 4 h to ensure that measurements were made at a time point comparable with the NF-κB and cytosolic Ca2+measurements, as well as to ensure that BAPTA-AM was still present in the cells. These data suggest that the lowering cytosolic Ca2+ in the sup− cells causes a decrease in NF-κB activation and an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, reducing NF-κB in sup− cells increases apoptosis, as would be expected if activation of NF-κB in sup− cells is responsible for their observed resistance to apoptosis.Figure 6Base-line levels of NF -κB activation are diminished in sup− cells treated with the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM. NF-κB EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from cells grown in medium containing 10% FCS and then treated for 1 or 2 h with 10 μm BAPTA-AM. Data are representative of four similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Cytosolic free Ca2+ is reduced in sup− cells treated with BAPTA-AM.

As shown in Fig.9, raising extracellular Ca2+to 3 mm also resulted in a slight but significant activation of NF-κB. We also investigated whether altering cell calcium altered the activity of IKK. As shown in Fig.10, raising extracellular calcium also caused a significant, but modest, 39% increase in IKK activity in sup+ cells. In contrast, lowering cytosolic calcium with addition of BAPTA-AM significantly decreased (by 66%) IKK activity in sup− cells.Figure 10Effect of Ca2+ manipulations on IKK kinase activity measured in an in vitro kinase assay. Sup+ cells were treated for 2 h with 3 mmCa2+ (A), and sup− cells were treated for 2 h with 25 μm BAPTA-AM (B). Note that the gels and densitometry in A and B are from different gels and therefore cannot be compared directly. In a separate experiment we measured IKK activity in sup+ and sup− cells (10%) with the same exposure on the same gel and found that sup+ cells had an activity that was ∼53% of that observed in sup− cells. *, indicates significantly different than pooled controls (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Raising extracellular Ca2+ in sup+ has a very modest effect of NF-κB activation and IKK activity. These data contrast with the robust Ca2+ dependence of IKK and NF-κB activity in sup− cells. Fig. 11 shows the relationship of cytosolic Ca2+ to NF-κB activation and to IKK activity, standardized to their activities in sup+ cells in 10% FCS. In sup+ cells, increased cytosolic Ca2+ results in a proportionately similar increase in IKK and NF-κB. Sup− cells show a Ca2+-related increase in IKK, which is similar to that observed in sup+ cells; however, in sup− cells increased Ca2+ correlates with a much larger percentage increase in NF-κB activity versus IKK activity. These data suggest that a large proportion of the enhancement of NF-κB activation attributable to Ca2+ is not mediated by IKK. To better understand the mechanism involved in the Ca2+-induced activation of NF-κB, we examined the effect of proteasome and calpain inhibition on the basal activity of NF-κB in sup− cells. Fig. 12Ashows that neither the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin nor proteasome inhibitor-I reduced the level of basal NF-κB activity. Fig.12A further demonstrates that the inability of proteasome inhibitors to block basal NF-κB activation is not due to lack of an effective concentration, because both inhibitors significantly inhibited the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB. Since the basal NF-κB activity in sup− cells is Ca2+-dependent, but proteasome-independent, we examined whether calpain inhibition would affect basal NF-κB activity. As shown in Fig. 12B, the calpain inhibitors EST and calpain inhibitor-V significantly reduced basal NF-κB activity. Taken together these data suggest that the elevated Ca2+ in sup− cells causes a modest activation of IKK, which likely contributes to the enhanced basal activation of NF-κB in sup− cells; however, the predominant effect of Ca2+appears to be mediated by Ca2+-enhanced degradation by calpain. Two preneoplastic Syrian hamster embryo cell lines representing different stages of neoplastic progression have been used for these studies. Early stage preneoplastic cells (sup+) have been shown to suppress tumorogenicity when hybridized with tumor cells, whereas sup− cells do not suppress tumorogenicity in cell hybrids. The RB and p53 genes are wild type in both cell types. Previous studies have shown that the sup+ cells are more susceptible to apoptosis than the later stage preneoplastic sup− cells (4Preston G. Lang J. Maronpot R. Barrett J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4214-4223PubMed Google Scholar, 27Preston G. Barrett J. Biermann J. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report that late stage preneoplastic cells that are resistant to apoptosis have a high basal level of NF-κB activation. As NF-κB has been reported to be anti-apoptotic, we examined whether pharmacologically reducing NF-κB in sup− cells would enhance apoptosis. As shown in Figs. 3 and 8, reducing the level of NF-κB in the sup− cells, with either BAY 11-7082 or BAPTA-AM, enhanced their susceptibility to apoptosis in low serum. A common feature of neoplastic progression is a reduced susceptibility to apoptosis, although early preneoplastic cells often exhibit enhanced apoptosis (28Schulte-Hermann R. Bursch W. Grasl-Kraupp B. Mullauer L. Ruttkay-Nedecky B. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activation of cell proliferation can lead to apoptosis unless cell survival pathways such as NF-κB are also activated (1Finco T. Westwick J. Norris J. Beg A. Der C. Baldwin Jr., A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 2Mayo M. Baldwin A. Biochem. Biophys.

This study suggests that increased activation of NF-κB is involved in the reduced apoptotic susceptibility of the late stage preneoplastic sup− cells. To gain insight into how cells activate NF-κB as part of the neoplastic progression, we investigated the mechanism by which NF-κB is activated under basal conditions in sup− cells. Loss or mutation of IκBα has been reported to activate NF-κB in some tumor cells (17Cabannes E. Khan G. Aillet F. Jarrett R. Hay R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 18Krappmann D. Emmerich F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, loss of IκBα does not account for the enhanced NF-κB levels in sup− cells. In fact we find enhanced levels of IκBα in sup− cells, consistent with NF-κB regulation of the promoter for IκBα (19Chiao P. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 20de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated IκBβ has also been reported to lead to constitutive activation of NF-κB (21Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we find no evidence for hypophosphorylation of IκBβ. There are recent data suggesting that Ca2+ can modulate NF-κB activity (22Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kanno T. Siebenlist U. J.

Since we find a greater than 2-fold higher basal cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in sup− cells compared with sup+ cells, we considered the possibility that the elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ might be involved in the increased NF-κB activation observed in the sup− cells. In support of this hypothesis, we report that lowering cytosolic Ca2+ by addition of the cell-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM to sup− cells reduced NF-κB activation and significantly reduced IKK activity. Furthermore, the BAPTA-AM-dependent lowering of NF-κB binding also rendered the sup− cells susceptible to apoptosis in low serum. These data suggest that the increased NF-κB binding in the sup− cells is secondary to the increase in Ca2+ and is responsible for the reduced apoptosis observed in the sup− cells. An elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ is a common observation in transformed cells (10Berridge M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It has been shown that lowering extracellular Ca2+ results in a reversible block of the cell cycle in normal cells, whereas SV40-transformed cells continue to proliferate in low Ca2+ media (11Wojnowski L. Hoyland I. Mason W. Schwab A. Westphale H. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The data in this manuscript are consistent with the hypothesis that high cytosolic Ca2+ in transformed cells may provide the cell with a reduced susceptibility to undergo apoptosis by activating NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic factor. The mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates NF-κB is unclear, and there are data to suggest that multiple pathways may be involved (22Miyamoto S. Seufzer B. Shumway S. Mol. Cell.

Lowering Ca2+ in the sup− cells causes a large reduction in NF-κB, consistent with the hypothesis that the higher Ca2+ in sup− cells is necessary for the higher basal NF-κB. However, raising Ca2+ in the sup+ cells only slightly elevates NF-κB and is not sufficient to elevate NF-κB to the same level as found in sup− cells. Thus the data suggest that high Ca2+ in the sup− cells is required for activation of NF-κB, but raising Ca2+ in the sup+ cells is not sufficient. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 11 suggest that the constitutive activation of NF-κB in sup− cells is Ca2+-dependent, but largely IKK-independent. These data are consistent with Ca2+ activation of NF-κB in sup− cells being primarily mediated by calpain. Calpain is a Ca2+-activated protease, which has been reported to play a role in the degradation of IκBα (31Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R. Brasier A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and calpain 3 deficiency is associated with increased apoptosis in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (33Baghdiguian S.

(30Fields E. Seufzer B. Oltz E. Miyamoto S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4762-4767Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have reported that the constitutive activation of NF-κB in B lymphocytes is calcium-dependent, but proteasome-independent. In summary, many transformed cells exhibit an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. We demonstrate that lowering cytosolic Ca2+ reduces the activation of NF-κB and confers susceptibility to apoptosis in sup− cells. We further show that the constitutive activation of NF-κB observed in sup− cells is proteasome-independent. Taken together these data suggest that an elevation in Ca2+, which is common in tumor cells, may provide these cells with resistance to apoptosis via activation of NF-κB.

By usingPg-lacZ fusions we have demonstrated that Pg is a promoter only inducible in the stationary phase when cells are grown on glucose as the sole carbon and energy source. This strict catabolite repression control is mediated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). This event does not require the presence of the specific HpaR repressor or the 4-HPA permease (HpaX), excluding the involvement of a typical inducer exclusion mechanism. However, the acetic acid excreted in the stationary phase by the cells growing in glucose acts as an overflow metabolite, which can provide the energy to produce cAMP and to adapt the cells rapidly to the utilization of a new less preferred carbon source such as the aromatic compounds. Although Pg is not a ς38-dependent promoter, it is activated by the global regulator integration host factor (IHF) in the stationary phase of growth. Gel retardation assays have demonstrated that both CRP and IHF simultaneously bind to the Pg upstream region. DNase I footprint experiments showed that cAMP-CRP and IHF binding sites are centered at −61.5 and −103, respectively, with respect to the transcription start site +1 of the Pg promoter.

Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1177-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Dı́az E. Prieto M.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, very often additional regulatory circuits are found superimposed onto the gene-specific effects. Together they allow a coordinated response to the catabolic status of the bacteria (3Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The classic example of this phenomenon is the repression of the synthesis of many catabolic enzymes in enteric bacteria by the presence of glucose in the culture medium (4Busby E. Ebright H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, termed “glucose effect,” regulates the transcription of catabolic operons by modulating transcription factor availability. The prototype system, which has been well characterized, is the glucose-lactose diauxie in the lactose operon of Escherichia coli (5Loomis W.F. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1397-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). First, glucose prevents the entry of lactose into the cell, resulting in an increase in the concentration of the inducer-freelac repressor (LacI). This process, called “inducer exclusion,” requires a functional phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS).1 The phosphorylatable PTS protein IIAGlc (glucose-specific IIA protein) controls the activity of the sugar-specific targets, e.g. it controls the permease LacY of the lac operon (6Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A slight variant on the strategy for inducer exclusion is found in the glpoperon for glycerol utilization, which involves facilitated diffusion. The target of IIAGlc protein in this case is the first catabolic enzyme (7Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, glucose lowers the level of the CRP-cAMP complex by reducing cAMP levels due to a decrease in the phosphorylated form of enzyme IIAGlc (8Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It also decreases the CRP concentration by diminishing the rate of transcription initiation at the crp promoter (9Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hence, in the case of thelac operon, the disruption of the lacI gene or the use of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside as inducer only partially abolished the glucose effect (6Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), indicating that catabolite repression due to changes in cAMP/CRP levels does partially contribute to the glucose effect in this system (11Hogema B.M. Arents J.C. Inada T. Aiba H. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, although CRP and cAMP provide the principal means of affecting catabolite repression (4Busby E. Ebright H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), cAMP-independent mechanisms mediating catabolite repression in E. coli have been also described (12Ullmann A. Danchin A. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1983; 15: 1-53Google Scholar). Although it is well known that E. coli controls the expression of the catabolic pathways of less preferred substrates, such as lactose, by a catabolite repression mechanism, very few data are available concerning the influence of this mechanism on the regulation of the catabolism of aromatic compounds (13Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Prieto M.A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2941-2947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a detailed study of the glucose effect on the mineralization of these compounds has not been reported. Moreover, since E. coli contains specific transport proteins for some of these substrates (17Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the glucose effect could be mediated by a conventional inducer exclusion process. The hpa cluster of E. coli W codes for a group of proteins involved in the catabolism of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) (14Prieto M.A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 111-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The catabolic genes are organized in two operons: the hpaBC operon, encoding the two-component 4-HPA monooxygenase, which transforms 4-HPA into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPC) (18Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22823-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Galán B. Dı́az E. Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the so-called meta operon (hpaGEDFHI), which codes for the enzymes that cleave the aromatic ring of HPC and allows its complete mineralization (14Prieto M.A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 111-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThehpaX gene codes for a member of the superfamily of transmembrane facilitators involved in 4-HPA uptake (17Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transcription of the hpa cluster is controlled by the products of the HpaA and hpaR genes. HpaA is an activator belonging to the XylS/AraC family of regulatory proteins that regulates the expression of the upper pathway operon (hpaBC) but does not seem to be involved in the regulation of the meta operon (13Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Carbon catabolite repression control has also been described for the hpaBC operon (13Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the meta operon, Roperet al. (20Roper D.I. Fawcett T. Cooper R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have suggested that HpcR (the HpaR homologue inE. coli C) represses its expression and that 4-HPA and HPC are the inducers of the system. HpaR has been identified through amino acid sequence comparisons as a member of the MarR family, a group of regulatory factors whose activity is modulated in response to environmental signals such as those of phenolic compounds derived from plants (2Dı́az E. Prieto M.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Prieto M.A. Garcı́a J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, sequence analyses revealed a putative CRP binding site localized upstream the −35 promoter region of thePg promoter driving the expression of the metaoperon (Fig. 1) (14Prieto M.A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 111-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Roper D.I. Fawcett T. Cooper R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this work, we have used different genetic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate that the expression of the meta operon of the 4-HPA pathway of E. coli W is repressed by a very severe glucose effect, and we provide evidence that the integration host factor (IHF) acts in collaboration with the CRP-cAMP system, designing a novel complex mechanism to regulate tightly the catabolism of this aromatic substrate. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Unless otherwise stated, bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

When required, 1 mm 4-HPA was added to the M63 minimal medium. Overnight cells grown in M63 minimal medium with acetate, glycerol, or glucose were diluted 1:10 in identical medium and incubated. The appropriate selection antibiotics, kanamycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (3 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), or rifampicin (50 μg/ml) were added when needed.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids with relevant genotype and phenotypeStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype or phenotypeSource or referenceE. coli K-12S17–1(λpir)Host for pUT-derived plasmidsRef. 21De Lorenzo V.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli cells was carried out by using the RbCl method or by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad) (28Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). RNA dot blot analyses were performed as previously described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To construct the Lac probe containing thelacZ gene, plasmid pUJ9 was digested with SacI and BamHI endonucleases, and the 1.7-kilobase pair DNA fragment was isolated and labeled with digoxygenin by using a Dig DNA Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nucleotide sequences were determined directly using plasmid pBM1 (Table I). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo-1000M nucleotide synthesizer (Beckman Instruments). Standard protocols of the manufacturer for TaqDNA polymerase-initiated cycle sequencing reactions with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators (Applied Biosystems Inc.) were used. The sequencing reactions were analyzed using an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). DNA fragments were purified by standard procedures using Gene Clean (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). To construct a translational fusion of the Pg promoter region ofhpaG and the lacZ reporter gene, a 314-bp DNA fragment covering this promoter region was amplified by PCR using 10 ng of plasmid pAJ40 (Table I) as template and the following primers: PG5 (5′-AACGCAAGAATTCGTGAGTCGTGCATTATCTTTCCCC-3′; an engineeredEcoRI site is underlined) and PG3 (5′-GATAGTGGGATCCATGGTACCACTCCTCGGATTCGATC-3′; the start codon and the original RBS of the hpaG gene are indicated in boldface letters, and an engineered BamHI site is underlined). To create plasmid pBM1 (Table I), the PCR-amplified fragment was cut with EcoRI and BamHI endonucleases and ligated to the EcoRI and BamHI double-digested promoterless lacZ vector pUJ9 (Table I). The correct fusion was verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid pPG11 was constructed by subcloning the NotI cassette of pBM1 into the mini-Tn5 delivery plasmid pUT-Km (Table I), and it was used for the insertion of the Pg::lacZ fusion into the chromosome of E. coli AF15, AFMC, AFSB, RH90, S90CRif, and DPB101Rif strains (Table I) by the filter-mating technique (22Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The generated exconjugants containing the lacZtranslational fusions stably inserted into their chromosome were selected for the transposon marker, kanamycin, on rifampicin-containing LB medium to give the strains WPG11, MCG11, SBSG11, S90G11, and DPBG11 and selected on tetracycline-containing LB medium for RHG11. In each case, the final strain was selected among three different exconjugants with similar expression levels and expression profile of the reporter gene. The relevant genotypes of the resulting strains are indicated in Table I. The DNA fragments PR-PG, PG, and PR, of 314, 147, and 179 bp, respectively, used as probes were amplified by PCR using 10 ng of plasmid pAJ40 (Table I) as template and the following primers: PG5 (see above) and PG3 (see above) for PR-PG fragment; PG3 and PGDE (5′-CCGGAATTCTGTAAATAGTTTGTTAATTAG-3′) for PG fragment; and PG5 (see above) and PRDE (5′-CCGGAATTCGATAAGAATATATTAAATATC-3′) for PR. The DNA fragments were labeled at their 5′-end with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 220-bp lac fragment was isolated by PCR using plasmid pBRlac as a template together with γ-32P-labeled primer 5′-GGCGTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCG-3′ and primer 5′-GCTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCCGA-3′ (29Schaeffer F. Kolb A. Buc H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 nm DNA probe, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm (competitor) DNA, and purified IHF (kindly provided by F. Boccard) or CRP prepared as described (30Ghosaini L.R. Brown A.M. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 7: 5257-5261Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in a 20-μl final volume. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gels buffered with 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For DNase footprinting experiments, the PR-PG DNA fragment was synthesized by PCR with the primers PG5 and PG3 (see above) using a combination of one unlabeled primer and the second primer end-labeled with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The PCR fragment was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Complexes with the labeled promoter region (at 1 nm final concentration) were formed for 20 min at room temperature in 15 μl of a glutamate buffer solution (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm potassium glutamate) containing 200 μm cAMP and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin using purified CRP and IHF. Then 3 μl of DNase I solution (1 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 125 mm potassium chloride) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 180 μl of a solution containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg of tRNA/ml, 5 μg of DNA/ml. The samples were extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol before analysis on a 7% (v/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Protected bands were identified by comparison with the migration of the same fragment treated for the A + G sequencing reaction (31Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 560-564Crossref Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). The metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants were analyzed with Gilson HPLC equipment using an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm) (Bio-Rad) at 30 °C and a flow of H2SO4 125 μm mobile phase pumped at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Peaks with retention times of 15.6 and 9.3 min, corresponding to those of authentic standard acetic acid and glucose, respectively, were monitored in a Refractive Index Detector 132 (Gilson). β-Galactosidase activities were measured with permeabilized cells as described by Miller (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). We have analyzed in vivo the influence of the carbon source on expression driven by the Pg promoter (Fig.1) by constructing a translational fusion with the reporter lacZ gene. ThePg::lacZ fusion was first inserted into the chromosome of E. coli AF15 (lacZ-mutant of E. coli W), generating strain WPG11. It should be noted that the WPG11 strain, like the parental W strain, contains the complete hpa cluster in the chromosome (Fig. 1). When WPG11 cells were grown in M63 minimal medium containing acetate, glycerol, or glucose as carbon sources in the presence or absence of 1 mm 4-HPA, we observed that the lacZ gene was only expressed in the presence of the 4-HPA inducer (Fig.2). With glycerol or acetate, the maximumlacZ expression was detected during the exponential phase of growth and decreased at the onset of the stationary phase (Fig. 2). However, in the case of glucose, the production of β-galactosidase was only detected in the late stationary phase. These results suggested that the system was under catabolite repression control and that, when the cells were cultured in a glucose-containing medium, thePg promoter was not induced and behaved as a stationary phase promoter even in the presence of the 4-HPA inducer. As already mentioned, the LacI repressor, the reduction in cAMP and CRP levels, and the inducer exclusion mechanism mediated by the PTS system all contribute to prevent the expression of thelac operon when E. coli cells are grown on glucose and lactose is used as inducer. This multivalent mechanism of control can be considerably bypassed when isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside is added to the medium (6Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J.

This means that a typical catabolic repression mechanism such as that controlling the expression of the lac operon would be insufficient to control the expression of an operon if the inducer can enter the cell by passive diffusion. Previously, we have shown that when 4-HPA is present in the medium at concentrations lower than 10 μm, E. coli W is able to use an active uptake system mediated by the HpaX permease, whereas when 4-HPA is present at 1 mm, E. coli W takes up this compound by passive diffusion (17Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the strong repression of thePg promoter observed in the presence of glucose, when 4-HPA was added to the medium at high concentrations (1 mm), cannot be ascribed to a typical inducer exclusion mechanism. However, the inhibition of other catabolic enzymes, as in the case of theglp operon (7Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), could contribute to the observed glucose effect and restrict the expression of the Pg promoter in the stationary phase. Other possibilities were that the HpaR repressor could be insensitive to the effect of the inducer during growth on glucose or could be turned into an activator only during stationary phase. To determine if the presence of the HpaR regulator or other genes of the hpa cluster were necessary for Pgrepression during exponential phase, we analyzed the expression of thePg-lacZ fusion in E. coli K12, which is devoid of the complete hpa cluster (14Prieto M.A. Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 111-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli AFMC, an MC4100 derivative, was selected as host for thePg::lacZ fusion, generating the strain MCG11 (Pg::lacZ hpa−) (TableI). In glucose-containing M63 medium, the MCG11 strain yields higher β-galactosidase levels during the exponential phase of growth than the strain WPG11, due probably to the lack of hpaR. However, we observed the highest expression of the reporter gene in the late stationary phase as previously found in the WPG11 strain (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the activation of the Pg promoter in the stationary phase is independent of the presence of the HpaR protein or other proteins encoded by the hpa cluster. They also strongly suggested that the repression during exponential phase of growth was mediated by an extreme catabolic repression mechanism that switches off the Pg promoter when the cells are using glucose as carbon source, even in the presence of 4-HPA that can enter the cell by passive diffusion. To test if the depletion of glucose was the key factor for the activation of thePg promoter, WPG11 cells previously grown in glucose, without 4-HPA, were harvested, washed, and resuspended in different media. These cells were incubated for 2 h in fresh M63 salt medium containing only 1 mm 4-HPA or in spent M63-glucose medium (medium that had already supported cell growth during 10 h, filtered and sterilized after adjustment of the pH to 7.0) plus 1 mm 4-HPA (Fig.4A). Although we could not detect a significant increase in cell density, the cells exposed to spent M63-glucose medium produced 4.7-fold more β-galactosidase than cells diluted in fresh M63 medium (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the spent medium contains a compound that facilitates the rapid response of the expression system. Interestingly, the addition of 10 mm glucose to the spent M63-glucose medium inhibited the production of β-galactosidase (data not shown), implying that the activation effect of the spent medium is abolished by catabolite repression. To ascertain whether the β-galactosidase levels determined in strain WPG11 reflected the transcriptional state of thePg promoter, the lacZ mRNA levels were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows thatlacZ mRNA levels detected in cells exposed to spent M63-glucose medium were significantly higher than those observed in cells incubated in fresh M63 medium. Therefore, taken together, these findings show that the induction of the Pg promoter is due not only to the depletion of glucose but also to the presence of another compound in the spent culture medium.Figure 5Transcriptional analysis of the expression of the Pg::lacZ translational fusion in spent M63-glucose medium and in fresh M63 medium. E. coli W strain WPG11 (wild type) and K12 strains MCG11 (wild type) and RHG11 (crp−) were grown as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. Total RNAs were isolated from cells exposed for 2 h to spent M63-glucose medium (top) and fresh M63 medium (bottom) in the presence of 1 mm 4-HPA as inducer. 10 μg of total RNA were loaded on the membrane and hybridized with Lac probe (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that the extracellular concentration of cAMP increases upon glucose ex"

Escherichia coli SecA contains seven conserved motifs characteristic of superfamily II of DNA and RNA helicases, and it has been shown previously to possess RNA helicase activity. SecA has also been shown to be an autogenous repressor that binds to its translation initiation region on secM-secA mRNA, thereby blocking and dissociating 30 S ribosomal subunits. Here we show that SecA is an ATP-dependent helicase that unwinds a mimic of the repressor helix of secM-secA mRNA. Mutational analysis of the seven conserved helicase motifs in SecA allowed us to identify mutants that uncouple SecA-dependent protein translocation activity from its helicase activity. Helicase-defectivesecA mutants displayed normal protein translocation activity and autogenous repression of secA in vivo. Our studies indicate that SecA helicase activity is nonessential and does not appear to be necessary for efficient protein secretion andsecA autoregulation.

Current thinking indicates that certain membrane proteins are delivered to the translocon co-translationally via SRP and its receptor FtsY, while other membrane and secretory proteins rely on interactions with cytoplasmic chaperones such as SecB as well as SecA protein for their membrane targeting (3Koch H.-G.

SecYE is the presumed preprotein channel and SecA receptor (8Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W.

Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). While SecG and SecDFyajC are not essential under all conditions, they greatly enhance the rate of protein translocation by regulating SecA membrane cycling (12Nishiyama K.-I. Suzuki T. Tokuda H. Cell. 1996; 85: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Matsumoto G. Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13567-13572Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SecA is central to protein translocation, since it binds to presecretory and certain membrane proteins, and it acts as a motor protein to drive protein translocation at the translocon (see references in Ref. 1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). One current model proposes that SecA undergoes ATP-driven cycles of insertion and retraction at SecYE, thereby promoting the stepwise translocation of proteins (15Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another model posits that protein translocation takes place from SecA that is permanently inserted into the plasma membrane (18Chen X. Xu H. Tai P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By catalyzing perhaps the first committed step in the protein translocation cycle, SecA occupies a pivotal position in this pathway. It is the only component of the Sec machinery that is known to be regulated by the protein secretion status of the cell. Inhibition of protein secretion by either genetic or biochemical means results in an ∼10-fold increase in the rate of secA translation (19Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Schmidt M. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 643-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Oliver D. Cabelli R. Dolan K. Jarosik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). secA is the second gene in thesecM-secA operon, and its translation is coupled to that ofsecM (22Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Analysis of this system has revealed that ribosomes translating the distal portion of secM are needed to disrupt the repressor helix (helix II) that normally occludes thesecA Shine-Dalgarno site (23McNicholas P. Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SecM, a nonessential periplasmic protein, has been found recently to regulatesecA expression by a mechanism involving a coupling of its translation and secretion (25Rajapandi T. Dolan K.M. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7092-7097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oliver D. Norman J. Sarker S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5240-5242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a translation pause site distal in secM that controls helix II formation has been demonstrated, and the duration of the pause was regulated by the rate of SecM secretion and translocon activity within the cell (27Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This mechanism explains how secA translation rate is controlled by the protein secretion status of the cell with SecM export serving as the secretion monitor. In addition to this elegant system of regulation, it has been shown previously that SecA protein itself acts as an autogenous repressor during excess protein secretion capacity by binding to and blocking its translation initiation region (28Dolan K.M. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23329-23333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecA can also prevent its translation by specifically dissociating a 30 S tRNAfMet-secM-secA RNA initiation complex (29Salavati R. Oliver D. RNA. 1995; 1: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role that SecA repressor activity may play in regulating the secM translation pause-release system remains unexplored. Little attention has been paid to the report by Koonin and Gorbalenya (30Koonin E. Gorbalenya A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that SecA protein may belong to the superfamily II of DNA and RNA helicases and that this activity could be important for secAautoregulation. By alignment of the SecA protein sequence with a number of known helicases, the authors were able to identify the seven conserved helicase motifs within SecA. Indeed, SecA has been reported to possess ATP-dependent helicase activity utilizing an RNA duplex from hepatitis C virus (31Park S. Kim D. Choe J. Kim H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have further characterized SecA helicase activity and explored its potential role in autoregulation. In particular, we felt that characterization of SecA helicase activity utilizing the more natural substrate, secM-secA RNA, was important. Our results confirm those published previously that SecA is an ATP-dependent helicase. Furthermore, we report the effect of mutations in the seven conserved helicase motifs on SecA's various biochemical activities. This approach allowed us to uncouple SecA-dependent protein translocation activity from its helicase activity and show that the latter activity is nonessential for efficient protein secretion and secA autoregulation. BL21.14 (pT7secA2) and BL21.19 (pT7secA2), which overproduce SecA protein, have been described previously (32Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). BL26 (λDE3) (BL21 Δ(argF-lac)U169 (λDE3)) and BL26.1 (BL21 Δ(argF-lac)U169 recA::CAT (λDE3)) are BL21 (λDE3) derivatives (33Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) that were constructed by P1 transduction. Plasmid pLG552.1 is a derivative of pLG552, a pSC101 plasmid that carries a 13.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing thesecM-secA operon (34Jones C.A. Holland I.B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was modified by in vivorecombination to contain Φ(secA-lacZ)f181(Hyb) (35Riggs P.D. Derman A.I. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1988; 118: 571-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was verified by PCR analysis using appropriate primers to regions of secA and lacZ. A plasmid that overproduced SecA with a C-terminal His6 tag under T7 promoter control, pT7secA-his, was constructed as follows: (i) thekan gene from pET-29b (Novagen) was removed usingAlwNI and DraIII and replaced with thebla gene from pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) to give pET29V; (ii) the secA gene from pT7secA2 was PCR1-amplified using primers 5′-TTTTCATATGCTAATCAAATTG-3′ and 5′-GGACTCGAGTTGCAGGCGGCCATGGCACTGCTTG-3′; (iii) this PCR product was cleaved with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET29V that had been similarly cleaved; and (iv) to avoid sequence errors due to PCR amplification, an NcoI DNA fragment comprising nearly the entire secA gene was isolated from pT7secA2 and used to replace the newly constructed secAplasmid, resulting in pT7secA-his. pT7secA-his was verified by DNA sequence analysis, in vivo complementation of thesecA defect of BL21.19 at 42 °C, and Western blot analysis using a Ni2+-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen). pT7secA-D209N-his was made by replacing the NcoI fragment of pT7secA-his with that from pT7secA-D209N (32Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This plasmid was unable to complement BL21.19 at 42 °C, although it overproduced SecA-D209N-his as verified by Western blot analysis with Ni2+-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. All othersecA mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pT7secA-his utilizing a QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene) and the appropriate oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis at the University of Pennsylvania DNA Sequencing Facility. DNA restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase and polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs, while Pfu DNA polymerase and T3 RNA polymerase were from Stratagene. LB broth (Sigma) and M63 minimal medium have been described previously (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, most other chemicals and proteins were from Sigma or an equivalent supplier and were laboratory grade or better. To study the effect that the secA helicase mutations had on protein secretion and secA autoregulation, the following strains were constructed. BL26 (λDE3) leu::Tn5Φ(secA-lacZ)f181(Hyb)recA::CAT carrying the appropriate pT7secA-his plasmid was constructed by P1 transduction utilizing the appropriate donor strains. The azide sensitivity, super sensitivity, or resistance of the resulting strain was scored to confirm the presence of the appropriate secA allele. MCH2 is a derivative of MC4100 containing secA-S458C leu::Tn10 and was constructed as follows. An EcoRI-XhoI DNA fragment containing the secA-S458C allele was isolated from pT7secA-S458C-his and subcloned into pBluescript II SK. The resulting plasmid was transformed into BG13.1 (secA13(Am) supD43,74 sueA sueC trp(Am) tsx relA rpsL Δlac leu::Tn10). A derivative of this strain that recombined the secA-S458Callele into the chromosomal secA locus and had lost thesecA13(Am) allele was selected by plating for recombinants that could grow at 42 °C and that also tested as being resistant to 2 mm sodium azide. This isolate was used to introduce thesecA-S458C allele into MC4100 by P1 transduction, utilizing its linkage to leu::Tn10. The presence of thesecA-S458C allele in MCH2 was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis after PCR amplification and cloning of an appropriate DNA fragment into pGEM-T (Promega). Laboratory glassware was treated by baking at 180 °C for 12 h, and wherever possible, solutions were treated with 0.1% (v/v) diethylpyrocarbonate for at least 12 h to avoid any nuclease activity. SecA proteins were overproduced and purified from BL21.19 (pT7secA-his) derivatives by affinity chromatography on nickel columns (Novagen), and they were stored in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol at −80 °C. Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Prolonged incubation of RNA with purified SecA protein did not give any evidence of contaminating nuclease activity as determined by PAGE analysis. The secM-secA RNA fragments RS294 and RS170 were prepared by in vitrotranscription of secM-secA DNA fragments with T3 RNA polymerase as described previously (29Salavati R. Oliver D. RNA. 1995; 1: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar). For the filter-binding assay, RNA was labeled by adding [32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the in vitro transcription reaction. DNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA2s consisted of the following sequence 5′-TCGCCCTCAAACGCCCCGCATTTT-3′ (where the underlined nucleotides are complementary to the helix II region ofsecM-secA RNA (23McNicholas P. Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). 6 pmol of DNA oligonucleotide and RNA transcript were annealed in a 1:1 ratio in 50 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA by heating to 98 °C for 2 min followed by gradual cooling over 3 h to room temperature and overnight incubation at 4 °C. The duplex was purified on native 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the duplex band was excised from the gel, crushed, and extracted with 0.4 m NaOAc, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2 and stored frozen until needed. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained H buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 20 units of RNase Block (Stratagene)), 3 fmol (150 pm) of DNA-RNA duplex, and 1 mm ATP unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the indicated amount of SecA protein. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time period, reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 μl of loading buffer (1.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 250 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated for 5 min on ice. As controls, one sample lacked any SecA protein (total duplex), while another contained DNA-RNA duplex that was heated at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by rapid chilling on ice (total single-stranded DNA). Samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were dried, and the radioactivity in bands was quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The data were evaluated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The radioactivity of each band was normalized for the total radioactivity added to each lane. The intensity of each band was expressed as the percentage of total duplex or total single-stranded DNA. Unless indicated otherwise, ATPase assays were performed as described previously (32Mitchell C. Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 40 μg/ml SecA protein, 25 μg/ml IMV from CK1801.4 (for membrane and translocation ATPase activity) (21Oliver D. Cabelli R. Dolan K. Jarosik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ATPase activity was calculated using the following formulas: endogenous ATPase activity = ATPase activity in the presence of SecA − ATPase activity in the absence of SecA; membrane ATPase activity = ATPase activity in the presence of SecA and IMV − (ATPase activity in the presence of IMV + endogenous ATPase activity); translocation ATPase activity = ATPase activity in the presence of preprotein, IMV, and SecA − (ATPase in the presence of preprotein and IMV + membrane ATPase activity). SecA-bound RNA was determined using a Bio-Rad filtration apparatus providing support for 12 filters of 13-mm diameter. Filters were presoaked in TKMD-BSA (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA) at 4 °C, and a sandwich was made by positioning the nitrocellulose filter (HA, pore size 0.45 μm, Millipore Corp.) on top of a DEAE filter (pore size 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell), which were placed on the frits of the apparatus. The former filter retains RNA-protein complexes, while the latter one retains free RNA. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 0.5 μm SecA protein and 0.58 fm (3.4 × 106 cpm/fmol) RS170 RNA in TKMD-BSA. They were filtered by gentle suction, rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of TKMD-BSA, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting.32P-labeled RNA bound in the absence of SecA protein was less than 2.5% of that bound in the presence of SecA protein and subtracted in each case. The sum of bound and free RNA was at least 90% of the total input RNA. Analysis of the data from the helicase, ATPase, and RNA-binding assays utilized Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). RNA folding was performed using the online version of mFold 3.0 software (available on the World Wide Web at mfold.wustl.edu/∼folder/rna/form3.cgi) by Michael Zuker (Washington University School of Medicine). The energy calculation for annealing of oligonucleotides was performed using RNAstructure 3.5 software. We found that SecA purified by our standard procedure often contained contaminating nuclease activity. In order to circumvent this problem, we constructed a SecA variant with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, SecA-his, which generally lacked any discernible nuclease activity when purified on a nickel column (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The SecA-his protein exhibited normal activity as accessed by in vivo complementation of the secA(Am) supF(Ts) mutant strain BL21.19 at 42 °C as well as analysis of its ATPase activities (Table I, Fig.1). In studying SecA helicase activity, we wanted to employ the portion of secM-secA mRNA that binds SecA protein with high affinity and acts as a target forsecA autorepression. We have previously demonstrated the existence of three RNA helices within the translationally regulated region of secM-secA mRNA (helix I, II, and III; see Fig.2) (24Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Helix II was shown to sequester the secA Shine-Dalgarno sequence and was necessary for proper secA repression (23McNicholas P. Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, SecA's footprint was shown to overlap with the secA ribosome-binding site, thereby blocking translation initiation and facilitating autogenous regulation (29Salavati R. Oliver D. RNA. 1995; 1: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar). In order to prepare a putative physiological substrate mimic to study SecA helicase activity, we synthesized and purified a 290-nucleotide RNA molecule, RS290, whose structure and high affinity SecA binding activity have been characterized previously (24Salavati R. Oliver D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Salavati R. Oliver D. RNA. 1995; 1: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar). A32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide, DNA2s, was prepared in order to hybridize within the repressor helix (helix II) region of RS290 (Fig. 2). The duplex formed should contain 14 base pairs flanked by single-stranded DNA tails of five nucleotides each. The stability calculated for this duplex is −16.8 kcal/mol, or a melting temperature of 62.4 °C. Appropriate annealing conditions were found for duplex formation, and the duplex was purified on a native polyacrylamide gel (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The helicase assay consisted of monitoring the release of DNA2s from the duplex by PAGE. SecA-his protein promoted the release of DNA2s from the duplex in a time- and ATP-dependent manner (Fig.3). Neither ADP nor the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, were active in the reaction. In addition, the helicase activity was inhibited by the addition of affinity-purified antibody against SecA (data not shown), strongly suggesting that SecA was responsible for the observed helicase activity. This inference received additional support by the isolation of helicase-defective SecA mutant proteins (see below). The helicase activity followed a first order reaction with a half-life of ∼11 min (Fig. 3C), which is exceptionally slow for a typical helicase. This result may be due to a missing co-factor in the helicase reaction, or alternatively, it could be that our nucleic acid substrate is not optimally configured for SecA helicase activity.Table IIn vivo characterization of secA helicase mutantsStrainMotifComplementationGrowth on azide (mm)0.511.523Azide sensitivityWild type++++/−−−AzisD209NII−S213CII++−−−−AzissT391A,T393AIII−T393CIII−S458CIV++++/−+/−−AziRS462AIV+++++/−+/−AziRA498CV++++−−AzisM506CV++++++/−AziRG508SV+−−−−−AzissQ570AVI−R577AVI−Strains were BL21.19 with the indicated allele on pT7secA-his.

To continue to test the hypothesis that SecA belongs to helicase superfamily II, we constructed a series of mutations within the proposed helicase motifs II–VI of secA (Fig.4) (30Koonin E. Gorbalenya A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specific amino acid residues were chosen based on sequence alignments with other helicases of this superfamily as well as published observations regarding the effect that such alterations had on the ATPase and/or helicase activities of these proteins (reviewed in Ref. 39Hall M. Matson S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Helicase motifs I and II coincide with the Walker A and B motifs, respectively, that facilitate nucleotide binding. Motif III is potentially involved in coupling ATP hydrolysis to unwinding activity (40Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Biol.

The enhancement of human leukocyte antigen-DRα expression is at least due to the TPA-dependent induction of the IFN-γ receptor 1 chain and IFN-γ receptor 2 chain genes.

This can lead to the generation of armed effector CD4 T cells specific for the ingested microorganism. An important function of these armed effector T cells is to enhance the ability of the macrophages to kill the ingested bacteria, many of which have evolved strategies for surviving and proliferating inside phagocytic cells. The induction of antimicrobial activity in macrophages is known as macrophage activation (1Munoz F.M. Fernandez M.A. Fresno M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Stout R.D. Bottomly K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 760-765PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nacy C.A. Meltzer M.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and many of the intracellular events leading to this have been determined. The macrophage-activating factor interferon-γ (IFN-γ)1 binds to IFN-γR and activates a Janus kinase (Jak)/Stat signaling pathway consisting of Jak1 and Jak2 as well as the transcription factor signaling transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). STAT1 binds to the cytoplasmic portion of the ligand-activated IFN-γR via the Src homology 2 domain and is phosphorylated by Jak on a single tyrosine residue (Tyr-701). This phosphorylation results in the Src homology 2 domain-mediated formation of a dimer of STAT1, which is then translocated to the nucleus to bind to the IFN-γ-responsive element leading to transcriptional activation of IFN-γ-responsive genes (4Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5090) Google Scholar, 5Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3421) Google Scholar, 6Decker T.

Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II genes is induced by IFN-γ in macrophages (9Korman A.J. Boss J.M. Spies T. Sorrentino R. Okada K. Strominger J.L. Immunol.

Steimle V. Martinez S.E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that the induction of expression of the HLA-DRα gene by IFN-γ was significantly enhanced in TPA-activated THP-1 cells (14Tomoda T. Kurashige T. Taniguchi T. Immunology. 1992; 76: 15-19PubMed Google Scholar) and showed that this was due to an increase in levels of IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 following the TPA treatment (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the mechanism of the TPA-induced increase in IFN-γR1 expression and have identified an essential TPA-responsive cis-element in the promoter region of IFNGR1, which is activated by Sp1 in response to TPA treatment. THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml and treated with or without 10 ng/ml TPA for 24 h and then with 100 units/ml IFN-γ for 15, 30, and 60 min. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml and treated with or without 10 ng/ml TPA for 24 h. Anti-STAT1, anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) and anti-phospho-STAT1 (Ser-727) antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc., Cell Signaling Technology, and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-IFN-γR1 and anti-Sp1 were products of Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells (1 × 107cells) were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted by sonication. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the resultant supernatants were used as cell lysates. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by the Bradford method (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). The proteins in the cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against either STAT1 (1:1000), Tyr-701 phospho-STAT1 (1:1000), Ser-727 phospho-STAT1 (1:1000), or IFN-γR1 (1:1000). Following hybridization, the membrane was washed and incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequently developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First we constructed a luciferase reporter gene containing the IFNGR1 promoter −840 to +28 bp sequence. The DNA fragment consisting of the −840 to +28 bp sequence was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA from THP-1 cells as the template. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BglII and HindIII, and the digested fragments were ligated into theBglII/HindIII sites of the promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector pGV-B (Toyo Ink Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The forward primer containing the BglII site and reverse primer containing the HindIII site were as follows: sense, 5′-GGAAGATCTACAGTAGGGCGGGGTAA-3′; antisense, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAAGGGGTAGGAGAAAGAGGA-3′. The design of these primers is based on sequence information of the IFNGR1 gene (GenBankTM accession number U19241). To construct the IFNGR1 promoter −109 to +1 bp sequence luciferase reporter gene, the −840 to +1 bp sequence reporter gene was digested with NaeIand HindIII, and the DNA fragment consisting of the −109 to +1 bp sequence was subcloned into theSmaI/HindIII sites of pGV-B. To construct the other luciferase reporter genes, the IFNGR1 promoter −840 to +28 bp sequence luciferase reporter gene was used as the template in polymerase chain reaction with the following forward primers, each containing a BglII site: −840 to +1 bp, 5′-GGAAGATCTACAGTAGGGCGGGGTAA-3′; −540 to +1 bp, 5′-GGAAGATCTTCTTGGTCAAGCCGATT-3′; −240 to +1 bp, 5′-GGAAGATCTCCTCCCACACCCAGAAG-3′; −160 to +1 bp, 5′-GGAAGATCTGCGGCTTCCCGGACTTG-3′; −128 to +1 bp, 5′-GGAAGATCTGGTCCCGCCTCCTGCCGA-3′; and a reverse primer (nucleotide +1) containing a HindIII site, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCTGCTACCGACGGTCGCTG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested and subcloned into theBglII/ HindIII sites of pGV-B. The reporter plasmid pGV-TK77 contains the minimal promoter sequence of the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) gene from −46 to +31 bp fused to the BglII/HindIII sites of pGV-B. pGV-TK77-TRE was constructed by inserting the −128 to −109 bp sequence of the IFNGR1 gene upstream of the TK minimal promoter of pGV-TK77. THP-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (17Zhang Y. Broser M. Rom W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells were centrifuged and washed once with TBS (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 7 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2). The cell pellets were resuspended in TBS, and 1 × 107 cells were placed in 15-ml tubes. The tubes were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of TBS containing 10 μg of the reporter plasmid DNA, 2.5 μg of internal control plasmid, HSV-TK promoter-driven Renilla reniformis luciferase (pRL-TK), and 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. The cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the transfection was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of culture medium. Cells were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of fresh medium and cultured for 42 h. Following this, the transfected cells were harvested for luciferase assays. When required, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TPA for 24 h before the cell extraction. To normalize the transfection efficiencies, except for the reporter assays using pGV-TK77 or pGV-TK77-TRE, the IFNGR1 promoter-driven luciferase activity was divided by the control thymidine kinase promoter-driven R. reniformis luciferase activity. 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/3-cm plate, and 100 ng of pGV-TK77-TRE or pGV-TK77 were transfected. After 12 h, transfected 293 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TPA for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and disrupted, and 20 μg of the cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Toyo Ink Co. Ltd.) with a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). All transfection experiments were repeated three to five times. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (18Lichtsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence of the TPA-responsive element (TRE), 5′-GGTCCCGCCTCCTGCCGA-3′, was used as a probe. It was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each 10-μl reaction mixture contained 20,000 cpm (6 ng) of the double-stranded, end-labeled TRE fragment, 1.5 μg of nuclear proteins, and 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 100 V for 1 h. The DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts (1.5 μg) were incubated with 1 or 2 μg of anti-Sp1 IgG for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of the 32P-labeled probe DNA. In this study, we carried out immunoblotting experiments with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize either Tyr-701 phospho-STAT1 or Ser-727 phospho-STAT1 to examine whether TPA and IFN-γ signals affect phosphorylation at these residues. Cells were incubated for 24 h with or without TPA and then stimulated with IFN-γ for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. Cells were lysed, and equal amounts of lysates (30 μg of proteins) were immunoblotted with the phospho-specific antibodies. Under these conditions, phosphorylation on Tyr-701 was markedly increased in TPA-pretreated THP-1 cells stimulated with IFN-γ for 30 and 60 min compared with cells that had not undergone pretreatment (Fig. 1A,lanes 7 and 8). There was only minimal phosphorylation on Ser-727 in TPA-pretreated cells, and this was not affected by treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8). Lysates were also immunoblotted with an anti-STAT1 antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of STAT1. An increased amount of STAT1 was detected when TPA-pretreated cells were stimulated with IFN-γ for 30 and 60 min (Fig.1C, lanes 7 and 8). However, in THP-1 cells that were treated with IFN-γ but not with TPA, a small amount of STAT1 production and Tyr-701 phosphorylation could only be detected when 300 μg of the lysates were used for immunoblotting (data not shown). These observations seem to reflect not only the IFN-γ-inducible phosphorylation of STAT1 but also the TPA-facilitated production of STAT1 molecules. Since activation of IFN-γRs by IFN-γ increases the production of STAT1 and its phosphorylation on Tyr-701 (12Lee Y.J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1559-1568PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of IFN-γR1 in THP-1 cells under various conditions (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of IFN-γR1 was significantly increased by treatment with TPA but not with IFN-γ (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar). These results possibly explain why pretreatment of THP-1 cells with TPA results in enhanced STAT1 production and phosphorylation on Tyr-701 following treatment with IFN-γ. We next investigated the mechanism of transcriptional control of IFNGR1 by TPA. To identify a putative cis-acting element responsive to TPA, we constructed luciferase reporter genes that were regulated by various regions of the promoter of IFNGR1. These constructs were transfected into THP-1 cells, and luciferase activity was measured. Fig.2 shows the structure of the various deletion derivatives and the corresponding promoter activities. The reporter gene containing the promoter fragment −840 to +1 bp showed a high level of luciferase activity. The ratio of the luciferase activity of the reporter construct containing the −840 to +1 bp fragment over the internal control (pRL-TK) was arbitrarily set as 1.0. Removal of the 5′-region from −840 to −160 bp resulted in 0.53 retention of promoter activity. When the 5′-region from −840 to −128 bp was removed, only 0.28 of the promoter activity remained. The promoter activity was almost completely lost after removal of the 5′-region from −840 to −109 bp. These results suggest that the element located between positions −128 and −109 plays a role in the basal promoter activity of IFNGR1. We further examined the deletion constructs in either untreated or TPA-treated THP-1 cells to identify a TPA-responsive element in the promoter region of IFNGR1. Fig.3A shows that constructs containing promoter segments from −840 to +1 bp and −128 to +1 bp exhibit high levels of induction of luciferase activity following treatment with TPA. However, constructs containing the promoter segment from −109 to +1 bp produced very little luciferase activity in TPA-treated cells. These results suggest that the promoter segment from −128 to −109 bp is responsible for the activation of transcription by TPA.Figure 3Identification of the TRE in the IFNGR1 promoter. A, on the left, the structure of each construct is shown. On the right, the corresponding promoter activities are shown as the relative intensity of the luciferase activity in THP-1 cells obtained by transient transfection experiments. Relative luciferase activities were defined as mentioned in the legend to Fig. 2. The closed columns show controls, and the open columns show the results of treatment with TPA. A relative value of 1.0 was equivalent to a normalized relative value of 1.28 (−840 to +1/−TPA), 7.5 was equivalent to 9.7 (−840 to +1/+TPA), 0.2 was equivalent to 0.32 (−128 to +1/−TPA), 8.9 was equivalent to 11.4 (−128 to +1/+TPA), 0.0078 was equivalent to 0.01(−109 to +1/−TPA), and 0.085 was equivalent to 0.11 (−109 to +1/+TPA). These values were the averages of triplicate determinations. The assays with these constructs were performed independently three times with similar results. B, the nucleotide sequence of the IFNGR1 promoter. The DNA sequence shown in bold is a candidate cis-element responsive to TPA in the IFNGR1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the segment from −128 to −109 bp responded to treatment with TPA, we constructed luciferase reporter genes that contained a minimal TK promoter (nucleotides −46 to +31) (pGV-TK77) and inserted the −128 to −109 bp fragment into the upstream region of this TK promoter (pGV-TK77-TRE). We failed to measure any activity for pGV-TK77 or pGV-TK77-TRE using a transient transfection system in THP-1 cells probably because the transcriptional apparatus in THP-1 cells is insufficient to transcribe the minimal TK promoter (data not shown). Therefore, we used 293T cells in which the minimal TK promoter could be transcribed (Fig. 4). In transient transfection assays in 293T cells, constructs containing the −128 to −109 bp fragment exhibited high levels of induction of luciferase activity following TPA treatment (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the fragment from −128 to −109 bp is essential for TPA responsiveness in IFNGR1. To investigate interactions of proteins with the TRE of IFNGR1, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the TRE (−128 to −109 bp) oligonucleotide as a probe. The TRE oligonucleotide produced one major DNA-protein complex with the nuclear extract from TPA-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 5, lane 1). Since the TRE of IFNGR1 contains a nucleotide sequence homologous to the Sp1 motif (Fig. 3B), we used an anti-Sp1 antibody for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The nuclear extracts from TPA-treated THP-1 cells were incubated with the anti-Sp1 antibody and then mixed with the TRE. This resulted in the disappearance of the major DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and3). These results suggest that treatment of cells with TPA results in the binding of Sp1 to the TRE of IFNGR1 to activate its expression. We have been studying the regulatory mechanisms of the IFN-γ-inducible HLA-DRα gene for several years. We have previously shown that treatment of THP-1 cells with TPA results in increased levels of IFN-γRs that lead to an increase in STAT1 and CIITA, resulting in increased HLA-DRα gene expression (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the mechanism resulting in the TPA-induced increase in IFN-γR may provide an important clue to help solve the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, such as Grave's disease in which the number of HLA-DR molecules is anomalously increased (20Hanafusa T. Pujol B.R. Chiovato L. Russell R.C. Doniach D. Bottazzo G.F. Lancet. 1983; 2: 1111-1115Abstract PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In the present study, we first examined the effect of IFN-γ on phosphorylation of Tyr-701 and Ser-727 of STAT1 in TPA-treated THP-1 cells. Steimle et al. (21Steimle V. Siegrist C.A. Mottet A. Lisowska G.B. Mach B. Science. 1994; 265: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) have reported that staurosporine, a specific inhibitor of Tyr-701 phosphorylation (22Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 23Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), blocks induction of CIITA by IFN-γ. Van Wagner et al. (24Van Wagoner N. O'Keefe G.M. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 85: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that H7, an inhibitor of Ser-727 phosphorylation (25Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), abrogates IFN-γ-induced expression of CIITA and major histocompatibility complex class II genes. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-701 and Ser-727 of STAT1 leads to CIITA expression, which is a key factor in the induction of HLA-DRα by IFN-γ. Consequently, results shown in Fig. 1, A and B, together with these observations suggest that, in TPA-treated THP-1 cells that contain increased levels of IFN-γR, enhanced expression of HLA-DRα (14Tomoda T. Kurashige T. Taniguchi T. Immunology. 1992; 76: 15-19PubMed Google Scholar) is due to the increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr-701 and Ser-727 of STAT1 following treatment with IFN-γ. Recently Kovarik et al.(26Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have shown that Ser-727 of STAT1 is phosphorylated through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by using SB 203580, a specific p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, it has been known that TPA activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (27Schafer C. Ross S.E. Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24173-24180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,28Schultz H. Engel K. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and this activation is inhibited by SB 203580 (28Schultz H. Engel K. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These observations taken together with our results shown in Fig.1B suggest that STAT1 is phosphorylated on Ser-727 by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase following activation by TPA. IFN-γ binds to a heterodimeric receptor composed of IFN-γR1, which is able to bind to the ligand with high affinity (29Aguet M. Dembic Z. Merlin G. Cell. 1988; 55: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and IFN-γR2, which is required for signal transduction (30Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our previous observations (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the expression of IFN-γR1 is increased by TPA treatment alone, which is in good agreement with the observations of Mao et al. (31Mao C. Merlin G. Aguet M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4688-4696PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IFN-γ to the IFN-γR complex results in phosphorylation of Tyr-701 of STAT1 (19Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results (Fig. 1A) together with our previous results (15Sakamoto S. Nie J. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4381-4384PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that in the TPA-pretreated cells, the enhanced phosphorylation of Tyr-701 of STAT1 following treatment with IFN-γ may be due to the increase in the levels of IFN-γRs. We also investigated the transcriptional control mechanisms associated with the TPA-induced up-regulation of IFNGR1. To identify the transcriptional regulatory element that responds to TPA, we performed deletion analysis of the promoter region of IFNGR1 reporter constructs in THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the DNA region located between positions −128 and −109 plays an important role in the regulation of IFNGR1 expression. Furthermore, we used this cis-element (−128 to −109 bp) and the minimal HSV TK promoter to construct a reporter gene and confirmed that this region was a TPA-responsive element (Fig. 4). TPA-responsive elements have been well characterized in some promoters (32Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 33Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 34Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) such as the 7-bp sequence 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ and the 8-bp sequence 5′-CCCCAGGC-3′ (35Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 157-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the −109 to +1 bp fragment of IFNGR1 contains one 5′-TGAGTCA-3′ motif (−83 to −76 bp) and one 5′-CCCCAGGC-3′ motif (−46 to −35 bp) (Fig. 3B), it did not respond to TPA (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the −128 to −109 bp fragment alone is the sole region responsible for TPA activation of the IFNGR1 gene, although this cis-element is different from other previously characterized TPA-responsive elements (35Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 157-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sequence of this TRE in the promoter of IFNGR1 was G + C-rich and correlated well with the known binding sequence for Sp1 (36Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The IFNGR1 promoter also lacked a TATA sequence motif (37Merlin G. van der Leede B.J. McKune K. Knezevic N. Bannwarth W. Romquin N. Viegas P.E. Kiefer H. Aguet M. Dembic Z. Immunogenetics. 1997; 45: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been shown to be an important constituent for correct transcription initiation from “TATA-less” promoters (38Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 39Anderson G.M. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell.

In addition, recent studies have shown that Sp1 is implicated in the TPA-induced expression of the WAF/CIP1 gene in U937 cells (41Biggs J.R. Kudlow J.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and expression of the thromboxane receptor gene in K562 cells (42D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G. Davis M.G. McCluskey T.S. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19696-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, Sp1 was identified as the DNA binding factor that bound to the TRE of IFNGR1 in TPA-treated THP-1 cells. Furthermore, deletion of the TRE-containing Sp1 binding motif resulted in almost complete elimination of both basal and TPA-induced promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the binding of Sp1 to the TRE of IFNGR1 must be important for the control of both basal IFNGR1 expression and TPA-enhanced expression. Recently, Langmann et al. (43Langmann T. Buechler C. Ries S. Schaeffler A. Aslanidis C. Schuierer M. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. de Jong P. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 870-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the amount of Sp1 protein was markedly increased in TPA-treated THP-1 cells. Thus, we suggest that the TPA-induced synthesis of Sp1 is involved in the up-regulation of IFNGR1 expression. However, Sp1 is known to interact with several transcription factors such as Oct-1 (44Strom A.C. Forsberg M. Lillhager P. Westin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), TATA-binding protein (45Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), nuclear factor-Y (46Roder K. Wolf S.S. Beck K.F. Sickinger S. Schweizer M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), SREBP-2, Elf-1, and transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene (47Gunther M. Laithier M. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 210: 131-142Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, other groups have demonstrated that phosphorylation and glycosylation of Sp1 also regulate its activity (48Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of how Sp1 activity is controlled and its role in the regulation of IFNGR1 expression will require extensive work in the future.

The dynamics of the dissociation of ANP from GCA were investigated in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant GCA receptors. The rate of dissociation of specifically bound 125I-ANP-(1–28) from intact CHOGCAWT cells at 37 °C was extremely rapid (Koff = 0.49 ± 0.02 min−1), whereas in isolated membranes prepared from these cells, the dissociation at 37 °C was >10-fold slower (Koff = 0.035 ± 0.006 min−1). The dissociation of ANP from CHOGCAWT cells showed remarkable temperature dependence. Between 22 and 37 °C,Koff increased ∼8 times, whereas between 4 and 22 °C, it increased only 1.5 times. Total deletion of the cytoplasmic domain or of the catalytic guanylyl cyclase sequence within this domain abolished ANP-induced increases in cGMP, dramatically slowed receptor-ligand dissociation by at least 10-fold, and abolished the temperature dependence of the dissociation of ANP. Deletion of the kinase-like domain led to maximal constitutive activation of guanylyl cyclase, markedly decreased Koff to 0.064 ± 0.006 min−1, and also abolished the temperature dependence of dissociation. Substitution of Ser506 by Ala and particularly the double substitution of Gly505 and Ser506 by Ala within the kinase-like domain markedly reduced ANP-induced increases in cGMP, whereasKoff decreased modestly (albeit significantly) to 0.36 ± 0.03 and 0.24 ± 0.02 min−1, respectively. As a whole, the results demonstrate for the first time that temperature per se or ATP alone cannot account for rapid GCA receptor-ligand dissociation under physiological conditions and suggest that ligand dissociation is modulated in part by the interaction of still unidentified cytosolic factors with the cytoplasmic domain of GCA.

Two distinct classes of ANP receptors, named clearance and guanylyl cyclase (GC) receptors, have been biochemically and functionally well characterized (1Atlas S.A. Maack T. Windhager E.E.

This clearance function is accomplished by an efficient mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Endocytosed ANP is delivered to lysosomes, where it is hydrolyzed to its constituent amino acids, and the internalized receptors are recycled to the cell membrane (10Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A.

The efficiency of this receptor-mediated endocytic mechanism is enhanced by a relatively low rate of dissociation of ANP from cell-surface receptors (12Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G.

GCA receptors have a single transmembrane domain, an extracellular ligand-binding domain, and a cytoplasmic domain constituted by a catalytic GC sequence and a tyrosine kinase-like (TK) sequence interposed between the transmembrane and the catalytic domains (14Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Between the TK and GC sequences there is an amphipathic α-helical region that is involved in higher order oligomerization of GCA receptors (15Wilson E.M. Chinkers M.

Under basal conditions, the TK domain has an inhibitory effect on GC activity. It has been postulated that upon ANP (or brain natriuretic peptide) binding to the extracellular domain, ATP binds to the TK domain and allosterically activates the catalytic GC domain (14Chinkers M.

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the native GCA in cultured glomerular mesangial and renomedullary interstitial cells is a constitutive membrane resident protein that does not undergo endocytosis and does not mediate lysosomal hydrolysis of ligand (18Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11987-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the dissociation of ANP from native GCA is very slow at subphysiological temperatures and increases exponentially at near physiological temperatures (18Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11987-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that the rapid dissociation of ANP from surface GCA receptors at physiological temperatures was due to an interaction of a cytoplasmic factor with the cytoplasmic domain of GCA. This mechanism would allow for rapid onset of ANP effects upon increasing plasma levels of the hormone and a rapid termination of effects when plasma levels of ANP fall (2Maack T. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol.

In this study, we examined the dynamics and some of the molecular mechanisms of dissociation of ANP from transfected wild-type and mutant GCA receptors stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It will be shown that there is a remarkable temperature dependence of receptor-ligand dissociation that is observed only in intact cells and not in isolated membrane preparations. The very fast dissociation of ANP depends on cell integrity, the intactness of the cytoplasmic domain of GCA, and near physiological temperatures.

The Muta-Gene M13 mutagenesis kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides were from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The MC1061 bacterial strain and Sequenase DNA sequencing kit were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The Wizard DNA purification kits, JM109 bacterial strain, and competent cells were from Promega (Madison, WI). M13 bacteriophage vectors, DNA restrictases, and other enzymes were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The protein assay reagent kit was from Pierce. The pAXNEO mammalian expression vector and full-length clones of the human kidney GCA receptor (GCAWT) and the cytoplasmic domain-deleted GCA receptor (GCACYT−) were a kind gift from Dr. John Lewicki (Scios Inc., Mountain View, CA). Rat ANP-(1–28) was from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), and GF/C filter membranes were from Whatman (Kent, United Kingdom). HEPES, protease inhibitors, BSA, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. For mutagenesis constructs, full-length transfected GCAWT (19Lowe D.G. Chang M.S. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Singh S. Garbers D.L. Goeddel D.V. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) was first cloned intoSalI-XbaI cloning sites of the M13 bacteriophage vector. The mutagenesis procedures were performed following the method of Kunkel et al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit. Point mutations within the TK domain of GCA were performed in Hanks' subdomain I, which is well conserved in the GCA receptor (16Garbers D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Koller K.J. deSauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goedell D.V. Mol. Cell.

GCAA505 was constructed by substituting the GGC codon (codon 1653 in full-length GCAWT), coding for Gly505, for GCC, coding for alanine. GCAA506 was obtained by substituting the serine codon TCC (codon 1656 in full-length GCAWT) for GCC, coding for alanine. The double mutant GCAA505/A506 was obtained by the same mutation in codon 1656 using GCAA505 as a template. Deletion of the GC domain was accomplished by introducing the stop codon TGA in place of TCC (codon 2496), coding for Ser786. Deletion of the TK domain was accomplished by a small modification of the procedure described by Koller et al. (17Koller K.J. deSauvage F.J. Lowe D.G. Goedell D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, two XhoI sites were introduced into M13GCAWT recombinant vector at the positions Leu467 (codon 1536)-Glu468 (codon 1539) and Leu767 (codon 2439)-Thr768 (codon 2442). Two oligonucleotides (5′-AG TTC CTT CTC GAG CTG CAT CTT-3′ and 5′-T GTT AAA TTT GCG CAA CTC GAG GCG GAT CTG CTG GAA T-3′) were used for mutagenesis. Positive mutants were selected by SalI-XhoI-XbaI restriction analysis, and deletion of the entire TK domain was performed by digestion with XhoI and subsequent self-ligation. Successfully deleted recombinants were selected bySalI-XhoI-XbaI digestion. Therefore, the total TK domain deletion comprised 300 amino acids, from Leu469 (codon 1536 of GCAWT) to Thr768 (codon 2442). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. GCAWT and mutant GCA receptors were subcloned into the SalI-XbaI cloning sites of the mammalian expression vector pAXNEO using standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 2 g/liter NaHCO3, 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (pH 7.15). The binding solution consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 3.6 g/liter HEPES, 3.7 g/liter NaCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA (pH 7). The washing solution was the same as the binding solution, except that it did not contain BSA. Wild-type and transfected CHO-K1 cells were propagated and maintained in the culture medium described above and placed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Stable transfections of GCAWT and mutant GCA receptors in CHO cells were accomplished by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, followed by selection with Geneticin according to standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10–20 clones were harvested by cloning cylinders and grown in 75-cm2 flasks until confluence. Equilibrium competition binding experiments were performed in intact cells at 4 °C to obtain the apparent density (Bmax) and apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) of ANP-specific binding sites as previously described (10Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G. Maack T. J. Biol.

Cells plated in 24-well plates to near confluence were incubated for 3–4 h at 4 °C with binding solution containing trace amounts of 125I-ANP-(1–28) in the absence or presence of 0.01 nm to 0.5 μm unlabeled ANP-(1–28). At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with ice-cold washing solution, and membrane-bound125I-ANP-(1–28) was removed by incubation with a hypertonic acid solution (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5m NaCl) for 20 min at room temperature. The radioactivity released into the acid solution was counted in a γ-counter. Specific binding was determined by the difference between total binding and binding of 125I-ANP-(1–28) in the presence of excess ANP-(1–28) (0.5 μm). Two additional wells in each 24-well plate were reserved for cell counting performed automatically in a Coulter cell counter or manually using a hemocytometer. At 4 °C, the apparent dissociation constants (Ki) of ANP in transfected cells were below 1 nm, except in CHOGCAA506 and CHOGCAA505/A506, in which the values for theKi were ∼3 and ∼9 nm, respectively. The Bmax values were used to estimate the density of surface membrane receptors and are reported in the legends of Figs. 4 and 5.Figure 5Effect of point mutations in the kinase-like domain of GCA on basal and ANP-stimulated cGMP levels. ANP (0.1 μm)-stimulated (bars labeled S) and non-stimulated (bars labeled B) cGMP levels were determined in intact cell monolayers of transfected CHO cells plated in six-well plates and grown to near confluence (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results were normalized by the density of surface receptors (see “Experimental Procedures” and the legend of Fig. 4). The densities of cell-surface receptors were as follows: CHOGCAWT, 14,857 ± 1642 receptors/cell; CHOGCAA505, 74,700 ± 5200; CHOGCAA506, 8794 ± 3157; and CHOGCAA505/506, 2826 ± 264. ANP-stimulated cGMP production was slightly but significantly inhibited when Ser506 in the TK domain was substituted by Ala and markedly blunted when both Gly505 and Ser506were substituted by Ala. However, contrary to complete deletion of the kinase-like domain, the effects of point mutations within this domain did not lead to complete unresponsiveness to ANP. Basal activity was unchanged, except in the double mutant, where it was modestly but significantly elevated. *, p < 0.05 versusstimulated CHOGCAWT; +, p < 0.05versus basal cGMP activity in CHOGCAWT.

Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm HEPES and 3.7 g/liter NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) and scraped with a rubber policeman into 40 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The cells were pelleted at 250 ×g for 5 min, resuspended in buffer, and sonicated with a Polytron homogenizer. After centrifugation at 250 × gfor 3 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the final membrane pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer and briefly homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. The fate of specifically bound 125I-ANP-(1–28) in intact cells was determined by chase experiments as previously described (10Nussenzveig D.R. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20952-20958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells stably transfected with GCAWT or mutant GCA receptors were grown to near confluence in six-well plates. Before the experiments, plates were washed with ice-cold washing solution and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with binding solution containing 0.1–0.5 μCi/ml 125I-ANP-(1–28). The wells were washed three times with ice-cold washing solution, and the cells of four wells were incubated with ice-cold binding solution containing 0.1 μm unlabeled ANP-(1–28). The cells in the remaining two wells were incubated with 0.5 μm ANP-(1–28) for nonspecific binding determination. The plates were then immediately transferred to a shaking water bath kept at 4, 22, or 37 °C. Samples of supernatant were collected at several time intervals from 0.5 to 30 min. At the end of this period, cells were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold washing solution, and the radioactivity remaining bound to the surface membrane was determined by further incubation with the hypertonic acid solution as described above. Recovery experiments showed that, in all instances, the sum of 125I-ANP-(1–28) radioactivity released to the medium and that remaining at the cell surface by the end of the experiment was >95% of the total radioactivity. More than 95% of the radioactivity released to the medium was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, and high performance liquid chromatography revealed that this radioactivity comigrated with 125I-ANP-(1–28). The fate of specifically bound 125I-ANP-(1–28) was also determined in membranes obtained from transfected CHOGCAWT and CHOGCACYT− cells. For this purpose, membranes were first diluted with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) to give a final protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. 125I-ANP-(1–28) (0.5–1 μCi/ml) was added to the incubation reaction, and equilibrium binding was attained after incubation at room temperature for 90 min. ANP-(1–28) (1 μm) was then added to the incubation reaction, and the tubes were immediately transferred to a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Aliquots (125 μl) were taken at several time intervals from 0.5 to 30 min and immediately filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter precoated with 1% polyethyleneimine using a vacuum manifold. The filters were then washed three times with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The radioactivity remaining in the filters was counted using a γ-counter. Transfected CHO cells were plated in six-well plates and grown to near confluence. Washing and incubation solutions were the same as the binding solution described above without BSA. Cell monolayers were washed twice and preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of incubation solution to which 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Cell monolayers were washed again, and incubation was initiated by adding 1 ml of incubation solution containing 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with or without 0.1 μm ANP-(1–28). Incubation was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C. At the end of this period, cGMP was extracted by adding 5% trichloroacetic acid to the incubation mixture. Water-saturated diethyl ether was used to remove trichloroacetic acid from the supernatant, and cGMP was determined by the [3H]cGMP radioimmunoassay kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech using the procedure recommended by the vendor. Cells were lysed in 0.2% SDS, and the amount of protein was measured by the Bradford procedure (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Using these assay conditions, >95% of cGMP generated in 5 min of incubation period was present inside the cells. GC activity in crude membranes was assayed as described (24Chang C.-H. Kohse K.P. Chang B. Hirata M. Jiang B. Douglas J.E. Murad F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by addition of 30 μg of membrane protein in a final volume of 0.3 ml of solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mm GTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 7.5 mmcreatine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (250 units/mg of protein). After incubation for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 1.5 msodium acetate (pH 4.7), followed by boiling for 3 min in a water bath. Finally, the reaction was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, and cGMP generation was quantified by radioimmunoassay. To determine the effect of ANP-(1–28) and/or ATP, these substances were added directly to the reaction at concentrations 0.1 μm and 0.5 mm, respectively. All experiments were done in triplicates and repeated at least twice. A nonlinear exponential curve fit was performed to determine the dissociation rate constant (Koff) of ANP from wild-type or mutant GCA receptors. The decay curves of specifically bound125I-ANP-(1–28) from the cell surface or from isolated membranes fitted a single-phase exponential decay with a high degree of reliability (r2 > 0. 95). In several of the experiments, the decay curves fitted equally well a two-phase exponential decay. However, in this case, the major component accounted for >80% of the total dissociation. Thus, for simplicity, we chose to calculate an overall rate of dissociation using a single-phase exponential curve fit. Statistics were performed by analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Fig. 1A depicts the time course of dissociation of specifically bound125I-ANP-(1–28) from transfected CHOGCAWT, CHOGCACYT−, CHOGCATK−, and CHOGCAGC− cells at 37 °C. Fig. 1B shows the corresponding appearance of intact 125I-ANP-(1–28) in the medium. Practically all specifically bound 125I-ANP-(1–28) that dissociated from surface membrane receptors was released in intact form to the medium, demonstrating that there was minimal, if any, receptor-mediated internalization or hydrolysis of ANP. The dissociation of 125I-ANP-(1–28) from CHOGCAWT cells at physiological temperatures was very fast, withKoff = 0.49 ± 0.02 min−1, a value similar to that found for native GCA receptors in cultured glomerular and renomedullary interstitial cells (18Koh G.Y. Nussenzweig D.R. Okolicany J. Price D.A. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11987-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In CHOGCACYT− cells, the rate of dissociation decreased by >20-fold to 0.018 ± 0.001 min−1. Removal of the kinase-like and catalytic guanylyl cyclase domains also decreased receptor-ligand dissociation to the slow rates of 0.064 ± 0.006 and 0.043 ± 0.004 min−1 for CHOGCATK−and CHOGCAGC− cells, respectively. These results show that the cytoplasmic domain of GCA is involved in the mediation of the fast receptor-ligand dissociation at physiological temperatures and that major deletions within the cytoplasmic domain markedly reduce the ability of GCA receptors to physiologically modulate receptor-ligand dissociation. Fig. 2 shows that in isolated membranes prepared from transfected cells, contrary to intact cells, the rate of dissociation of ANP from CHOGCACYT−(Koff = 0.038 ± 0.002 min−1) was not different from that from CHOGCAWT (Koff= 0.035 ± 0.006 min−1). This is due to the major decrease in the rate of dissociation of ANP from GCAWT in membrane preparations compared with intact cells at 37 °C. In isolated membrane preparations, receptor-ligand dissociation was very slow and was not regulated by the cytoplasmic domain. This result suggests that factor(s) present in the intact cell and absent in the isolated membranes are responsible for interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of GCA to effectuate a fast dissociation rate of surface receptor-ligand complexes at 37 °C. Fig. 3 summarizes theKoff values of ANP from wild-type and mutant GCA receptors in intact cells at 37 °C. In addition to the major decrease in ANP dissociation when the cytoplasmic domain of GCA is deleted or when the TK and catalytic GC domains are truncated (see Fig.1), some point mutations in a putative ATP-binding site in Hanks' subdomain I of the TK domain resulted in significant (albeit relatively small) decreases in the receptor-ligand dissociation rate. Although theKoff of ANP in CHOGCAA505 cells (0.50 ± 0.06 min−1) was practically identical to that in CHOGCAWT cells (0.49 ± 0.02 min−1), substitution of Ser506 by Ala and particularly the double substitution of Gly505 and Ser506 by Ala resulted in significant decrease in Koff to 0.36 ± 0.03 and 0.24 ± 0.02 min−1, respectively (p < 0.01 versus CHOGCAWT). In no instance, however, did the Koff value of these point mutants approach the low value observed in the cytoplasmic domain-truncated receptors. To determine whether changes in receptor-ligand interactions were related to receptor activity, we measured basal and ANP-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity or cGMP levels in CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type or mutant GCA receptors.

We isolated variants of HeLa cells adapted to growth in 5 mm butyrate. One of these variants, clone 5.1, constitutively expressed elevated levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 when incubated in regular growth medium and in the presence of butyrate. Despite this elevated level of p21Waf1/Cip1, the cells continue to proliferate, albeit at a slower rate than parental HeLa cells. Western blot analyses showed that other cell cycle regulatory proteins were not up-regulated to compensate for the elevated expression of p21Waf1/Cip1. However, cyclin D1 was down-regulated by butyrate in HeLa cells but not in clone 5.1. We conclude that continued expression of cyclin D1 allowed clone 5.1 to grow in the presence of butyrate and elevated levels of p21Waf1/Cip1."
https://openalex.org/W2011845635,"Upon Northern blotting, Saccharomyces cerevisiae that was treated with diazaborine showed aberrant mRNAs that were extended at the 3′-end and terminated at secondary processing sites.

Specific sequence elements on the pre-mRNA act as signals for the attachment of the processing factors. In a further step, the pre-mRNA generated is polyadenylated, and the downstream fragment is degraded (1Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 247-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mRNA processing signals in higher eukaryotes are well defined, but in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the identification of these signals is complicated because of their high degree of variability and redundancy (2Guo Z. Sherman F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). One of the best-studied examples in yeast is gene CYC1, encoding iso-1-cytochrome c, where the processing signals are well characterized and necessary for proper 3′-end formation (3Russo P. Li W.Z. Hampsey D.M. Zaret K.S. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Russo P. Li W.Z. Guo Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7836-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These signals are the AU-rich efficiency element, an A-rich positioning element, and the poly(A) site. Deletion of the efficiency element prevents utilization at this site, but secondary processing sites located downstream are concomitantly recognized and utilized by the processing complex. A deletion in the efficiency element in thecyc1-512 mutant resulted in a ∼90% decrease inCYC1 mRNA and led to the appearance of a set of eight elongated mRNAs ranging from 850–3500 nucleotides in length (5Das B. Guo Z. Russo P. Chartrand P. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Defects in mRNA 3′-end formation can profoundly alter cell viability, growth, and development. Yeast genes involved in 3′-end formation are essential, which underscores the fundamental nature of this process. After mRNA maturation, which takes place in the nucleus, the processed mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm by a series of steps that are still far from being fully understood. At one stage during transport, the 5′→3′ exonuclease Rat1, an essential enzyme, is required (6Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The precise nature of this enzymatic step is still unclear. The mRNA is not exported in naked form but rather as a ribonucleoprotein particle, which, upon arrival in the cytoplasm, needs to be uncoated and transferred to the translation machinery that attaches it to the initiating ribosomal subunits. During this journey, the ribonucleoprotein particle has to get in contact with proteins of the nuclear pore, like Rat7 (7Gorsch L.C. Dockendorff T.C. Cole C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 939-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and with RNA helicases, which are important for the unwinding of the RNA-protein agglomerate (8Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B.

A quality control mechanism scans the mRNA for the appearance of premature stop codons and thus prevents the synthesis of incomplete and potentially deleterious protein molecules. This nonsense-mediated decay pathway (11Czaplinski K. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gonzalez C.I. Peltz S.W. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) involves as a key component the ATP-dependent RNA helicase Upf1p, which, in combination with other proteins, detects aberrant mRNAs (12He F. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Culbertson M.R. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and renders the mRNA to the exonuclease Xrn1p for immediate 5′→3′ degradation. Xrn1p is homologous to the nuclease Rat1p, but it is nonessential (14Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Before Xrn1p can degrade the mRNA, it has to be decapped (15Hsu C.L. Stevens A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). mRNA degradation can also occur in the 3′→5′ direction. This pathway involves the exosome of which Ski2p, a putative RNA helicase, is a key component (16Jacobs J.S. Anderson A.R. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The steps that a mRNA molecule has to go through from its appearance in the cytosol to its degradation are only incompletely understood. In particular, it is not entirely clear whether aberrant mRNA molecules are able to pass the nuclear pore or what characterizes them as abnormal. We have a long-standing interest in the antibacterial drug diazaborine. In bacteria, diazaborine inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis (17Turnowsky F. Fuchs K. Jeschek C. Högenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6555-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that the drug also inhibits the growth of the yeast S. cerevisiae and that two distinct mechanisms lead to resistance (19Wendler F. Bergler H. Prutej K. Jungwirth H. Zisser G. Kuchler K. Högenauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27091-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One mechanism is connected with allelic forms of the gene DRG1, and the other involves overexpression of drug efflux pumps that are activated by mutated forms of transcription factors or by overexpression of the transcription factor Yap1 (20Jungwirth H.

We have investigated the mode of action of diazaborine in yeast and observed that treatment of yeast cells with subinhibitory concentrations of this inhibitor results in a characteristic change in the length of certain mRNAs. These changes, which we describe in the present communication, are the result of a drug-induced disturbance of the cells' ability to handle aberrant mRNA molecules. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. Cells were grown in rich medium (YPD) or synthetic medium (SD), supplemented with appropriate nutrients for maintenance of plasmids, as described by Sherman et al.(21Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar).

Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strains were grown overnight in YPD medium or, when plasmid-carrying strains were used, in SD medium lacking leucine. The cells were diluted to anA600 of 0.05 and cultured in YPD medium to anA600 of 0.3–0.4. From this cell suspension, aliquots were taken and cultured with and without diazaborine for an additional 30 min. Alternatively, other drugs such as cycloheximide, ketoconazole, or terbinafine were used. Samples of total RNA were prepared from each aliquot as described in the Qiagen RNeasy Handbook. RNA samples (10–20 μg) were denatured and separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1.2 m formaldehyde. The amount of 26 S and 18 S rRNA was used as a control to monitor RNA loading and quantitated on a densitometer. To measure the length of the characteristic RNA bands, RNA molecular weight markers (Roche Diagnostics) were used in some of the gels. The gels were transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) filters and hybridized at 65 °C in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA with 32P-labeled DNA probes for 12–16 h. The filters were washed four times in 40 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 25 min, and the radioactivity was made visible by autoradiography on an x-ray film at −70 °C and quantitated on a laser densitometer. The Qiagen RNase-free DNase I Set was used for DNase I treatment of total RNA as described in the Qiagen RNeasy Handbook. 50–100 μg of prepared RNA was treated with 50 μg of Qiagen protease in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. RNeasy Mini Kits were used to clean up the treated RNA as described in the Qiagen RNeasy Handbook. When we tested the expression of the gene FLR1in Northern blotting experiments by growing yeast in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of diazaborine, a marked decrease in mRNA content was observed. The decrease was accompanied by the appearance of slower-migrating mRNA species during electrophoresis that hybridized with a specific FLR1 probe. To test whether this effect was limited to the FLR1 mRNA, we probed mRNAs of a number of different genes (ERG1, TRX2, GSH1, ACT1, CYH2, CYC1, LEU2, YCF1, and YOR1) in this experimental setup. In all cases, high molecular weight RNA bands were detected. In Fig. 1, we show the appearance of slower-migrating RNAs of the gene FLR1when cells were grown at two drug concentrations. FLR1mRNA was decreased, and one or two bands of RNA with higher molecular weight appeared, depending on the drug concentration used. The main band of FLR1 mRNA was approximately of the same intensity at the subinhibitory diazaborine concentration as the untreated control, whereas the mRNA band decreased significantly at the lethal concentration of the drug. To test whether the growth retardation of yeast cellsper se leads to the observed effects on mRNAs, we extended the experiment using subinhibitory concentrations of the unrelated inhibitors cycloheximide, ketoconazole, and terbinafine. The result is also shown in Fig. 1. In none of these cases could we observe larger mRNA species and a concomitant decrease of the main band. Cycloheximide showed an increase of the mRNA band, which is probably due to the inhibition of mRNA degradation as a result of blocked protein synthesis (23Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with terbinafine and ketoconazole showed no change at all. To exclude the possibility that the high molecular weight RNAs are artifacts resulting from protein-RNA aggregation, DNA-RNA aggregation, or contamination by DNA, we incubated the RNA preparations from diazaborine-treated and untreated cells with protease and DNase I and probed them by Northern blotting with either the FLR1- orCYC1-specific probe (Fig. 2). No changes in the RNA pattern were observed by these treatments, indicating that the observed slow-moving bands are indeed bona fide RNA transcripts. To estimate the approximate length of the slow-migrating mRNAs, we hybridized the RNA preparation from diazaborine-treated and untreated yeast cells with radioactive probes designed to anneal at various regions downstream of the gene FLR1. The locations of the probes are indicated in Fig. 3. The most distant probe, S4, is located 1400 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon of FLR1 and within the neighboring reading frame. Regardless of which probe was used, we always observed a signal at the same position in the Northern blot of RNA from diazaborine-treated yeast. This finding indicates that in the presence of diazaborine, the transcript extends into the next reading frame. The transcript of gene YBR007C starting at its own promoter was also detected when probe S4 was used for hybridization. The influence of diazaborine on the appearance of extra long mRNAs was investigated in detail using the gene CYC1. When the efficiency element is deleted, as in the case of thecyc1-512 mutant, only 10% of normal length CYC1mRNA is formed. Higher molecular weight RNAs appear instead, which arise from alternative downstream 3′-end processing sites (5Das B. Guo Z. Russo P. Chartrand P. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We decided to use this model system to investigate the action of diazaborine in detail. As seen in Fig. 4, the cyc1-512 mutant showed a strong decrease inCYC1 mRNA accompanied by the appearance of the characteristic high molecular weight species (5Das B. Guo Z. Russo P. Chartrand P. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When we treated the wild type strain with diazaborine, we observed a long mRNA identical in size to the band of 1.8 kb1 seen in the untreated cyc1-512 mutant strain. Treatment of thecyc1-512 mutant with diazaborine resulted in an increase in the amount of the high molecular weight band and the appearance of additional signals with even slower electrophoretic mobility. Daset al. (5Das B. Guo Z. Russo P. Chartrand P. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed recently that the nonphysiologically elongated cyc1-512 mRNAs are stabilized in a Δupf1 background. Using this mutant, we observed the described stabilized bands, which occurred at the same positions in the Northern blot as bands from the cyc1-512 mutant treated with diazaborine. In the diazaborine-treated RNA sample, one very long species of 5 kb was present that could not be seen in the Δupf1 mutant. This experiment shows that some of these longer RNA species are formed even in the absence of diazaborine but are undetectable in wild type cells due to their fast degradation. Diazaborine treatment of the Δupf1 mutant gave the same electrophoretic pattern except for the appearance of this additional very slow-migrating band. The experiment with the untreated Δupf1 mutant demonstrated that the aberrant, high molecular weight mRNA species failed to be degraded. To identify the degradation pathway involved, we tested the effect of diazaborine in two mutants defective in the genes coding for Xrn1p and Ski2p. The 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn1p degrades mRNA in the cytoplasm after its release from the translation machinery (14Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 5, the extra mRNA band of CYC1 was already present at a high intensity in the untreated Δxrn1 mutant. When this mutant was incubated with diazaborine, the intensity of the band increased further. The main CYC1 mRNA band was diminished after drug treatment because it was observed in wild type cells. Similar results were obtained with the FLR1 probe. Here, the 5.5-kb band that was generated by diazaborine treatment of wild type cells could be observed in the Δxrn1 mutant even without diazaborine treatment. Again, the band was more prominent in the treated Δxrn1 cells. In the untreated Δxrn1mutant, the amount of mRNA of the correct length of bothCYC1 and FLR1 was drastically increased as compared with that in the wild type. This effect is probably caused by posttranslationally accumulated mRNA that failed to be degraded because of the absence of the exonuclease. Protein Flr1 was previously shown to mediate resistance to diazaborine when overexpressed (20Jungwirth H. Wendler F. Platzer B. Bergler H. Högenauer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4809-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the Δxrn1 mutant has the same sensitivity to diazaborine as the wild type. Hence, the highly abundant mRNA is not translated. The Δski2 mutant, which is defective in a 3′→5′ exonuclease activity, showed no stabilization of the longer mRNA species, indicating that Ski2p is not involved in removal of these nonphysiologically long transcripts (Fig.6).Figure 6Northern blotting of a Δski2 mutant strain. Total RNA was extracted from S. cerevisiae RW2966 (SKI2) and RKY1982 (Δski2) after incubation with (+) or without (−) 75 μg/ml diazaborine for 30 min. Radioactive probes ofCYC1 (A) and FLR1 (B) were used in this experiment, and the main RNA band is indicated at themargin in each case. The amount of 26 S and 18 S rRNA was used with each sample as a control for monitoring RNA loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the export of aberrant RNAs from the nucleus, we tested two mutants defective in RNA transport. A wild type strain, a rat1-1mutant, and a rat7-1 mutant were grown with and without diazaborine at 25 °C. The extracted RNA was analyzed in a Northern blot for FLR1-specific mRNA. In the untreatedrat7-1 cells, a weak band of the aberrant 5.5-kbFLR1-containing RNA was observed (Fig.7). This band was absent in the RNA from the wild type and the rat1-1 mutant. In the samples from the diazaborine-treated cells, the 5.5-kb FLR1-containing RNA was present in each of the strains investigated. We tested diazaborine-resistant strains for the appearance of aberrant RNA molecules in the presence of diazaborine. In previous work, we have isolated different types of resistant strains, one of which detoxifies the cell by activating efflux pumps via overexpression of the transcription factor Yap1p, and another that mediates resistance in an unknown way through an allelic form of the gene DRG1. When aYAP1-overexpressing strain was tested, we still detected aberrant RNAs. This can be seen in Fig.8, where mRNA isolated from yeast grown with subinhibitory concentrations of the drug was hybridized with a FLR1-specific probe. Northern blots with CYC1probes gave essentially the same result (data not shown). In no case did we see aberrant mRNAs when we isolated RNA from a diazaborine-resistant strain with the allele DRG1-1. The cellular function of Drg1p was hitherto unknown, but the results of Fig. 8 demonstrate that DRG1-1 is intrinsically involved in the generation of correct mRNAs in the presence of diazaborine. Treatment of yeast with diazaborine affected both the amount and the correct length of mRNA molecules of various genes in a specific way. The steady-state level of longer transcripts increased with higher drug concentrations, and we could show that these RNAs are extended at the 3′-end and terminate at clearly defined, secondary termination sites. We demonstrated this by using the cyc1-512 mutant, which is a well-characterized system for studying transcript termination in yeast (5Das B. Guo Z. Russo P. Chartrand P. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The main band of 1.8 kb in thecyc1-512 mutant, which results from pre-mRNA cleavage at an alternative termination site, showed the same electrophoretic mobility as the band that arose from diazaborine treatment of wild type cells. In a cyc1-512 Δupf1 double mutant, additional bands were detectable as compared with thecyc1-512 single mutant that again correlated in size with bands detected in the treated cyc1-512 mutant, with the exception of an additional, very high molecular weight band of ∼5 kb in the treated strain that was not detectable in the untreatedcyc1-512 Δupf1 double mutant. Upf1p is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and the main component of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, which recognizes aberrant mRNA. The appearance of additional bands in the cyc1-512Δupf1 double mutant as compared with thecyc1-512 mutant means that these RNA species are also formed in the single mutant but are not detectable because they are efficiently removed by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. The correlation in size of the mRNA species that we detected after diazaborine treatment of the single cyc1-512 mutant and thecyc1-512 Δupf1 mutant demonstrates that these bands also occur in the untreated single mutant but are stabilized in the treated strain. We conclude from this experiment that the 1.8-kbCYC1 band we observed in the diazaborine-treated wild type strain is also formed in a wild type strain in small quantities but is degraded in the untreated strain by the UPF system. We should therefore also be able to detect the same bands that we find in various transcripts in treated wild type strains in an untreated Δxrn1 mutant. We could demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Both the 1.8-kb band from the CYC1 message and the 5.5-kb band from the FLR1 message, which are very characteristic for diazaborine treatment, could be detected in the untreated Δxrn1 mutant. In contrast, these bands were not detected in a Δski2 strain that is deficient for the 3′→5′ exosome, indicating that this activity is not involved in the removal of these aberrant RNAs. Another important conclusion could be drawn from our experiment with the Δupf1 and Δxrn1 mutants. Both enzymes are localized in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of the aberrant RNAs in these mutants therefore indicates that these RNAs can reach the cytoplasm, where they are usually degraded in a Upf1- and Xrn1-dependent way. Because diazaborine treatment produces the same types of aberrant RNAs that arise from defects in theXRN1 or UPF1 genes, it seems that the drug affects the recognition or the elimination of aberrant mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm. Xrn1p is also responsible for normal mRNA decay. Does diazaborine interfere directly with the function of Xrn1? Our Northern blot experiments with the FLR1 andCYC1 probes in the Δxrn1 mutant indicate that this is not the case. Whereas diazaborine treatment of a wild type strain resulted in a reduction of the main mRNA bands, a strong accumulation of the main bands of both mRNAs was observed in the Δxrn1 mutant due to the block in mRNA decay. Because we did not find an accumulation of major FLR1 andCYC1 mRNAs after diazaborine treatment, we conclude that diazaborine has to act at a step earlier than Xrn1p in the degradation pathway and more specifically affects the degradation of aberrant mRNAs. The 5.5-kb FLR1 RNA band, which is very characteristic for both the diazaborine treatment and the Δxrn1 mutant, also appeared in the RNA from a rat7-1 mutant, but not in the isogenic wild type. Rat7p is a component of the nuclear pore and is known to be involved in mRNA export (7Gorsch L.C. Dockendorff T.C. Cole C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 939-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This protein is located at the cytoplasmic side of the pore structure (25Kraemer D.M. Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We propose that Rat7p is involved in checking the quality of mRNA molecules that leave the nucleus and transfers aberrant RNA molecules to the exonuclease Xrn1p for degradation. The high molecular weight RNA species were absent when a diazaborine-resistant mutant that carries a DRG1 allele was treated with the drug. When a strain that became diazaborine resistant due to overexpression of YAP1 was tested, the longer RNA species were still present, albeit at a reduced quantity. From this observation, we conclude that it is not possible to completely neutralize the effect of the drug on the appearance of abnormal mRNAs by removing diazaborine from yeast cells using efflux pumps. Instead, Drg1p appears to be inherently involved in the abolition of the effect of the drug. We found that the protein Drg1 is located exclusively in the cytoplasm. 2G. Zisser, H. Bergler, and G. Högenauer, unpublished results. Hence, the mutant variant of Drg1p has to be active in the cytoplasm and perform its metabolic activity in this cellular location. This suggests that Drg1p is involved in the recognition or the destruction process of aberrant mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm. Because Drg1p is a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family of proteins, which are believed to act as specific chaperones (26Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesize that Drg1p acts in the process of unfolding the mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex or in the recognition of aberrant mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm and that this reaction is inhibited by diazaborine. The diazaborine-resistant variant of Drg1p catalyzes this reaction undisturbed by the inhibitor. Why do the intensities of the main CYC1 and FLR1mRNA bands decrease as a result of diazaborine treatment? At the moment, we cannot answer this question. This decrease of mRNA could be caused by some sort of signal transduction into the nucleus that tells the cell that something is wrong with the handling of aberrant mRNAs. Another possibility is that the inhibition of mRNA unfolding and recognition in the cytoplasm might be accompanied by the failure of a component of the mRNA-ribonucleoprotein to return to the nucleus, thereby depleting the nuclear reservoir of this component. This could affect the rate of pre-mRNA synthesis or its stability or transport to the cytoplasm. We are indebted to C. N. Cole, A. W. Johnson, F. Sherman, and U. Wintersberger for the generous supply of mutant yeast strains, E. Sigl for construction of the diazaborine-resistant yeast strain, G. Zisser for expert technical assistance, and G. M. Koraimann for reading the manuscript. We thank the Novartis Forschungsinstitut (Vienna, Austria) for the generous gift of diazaborine."
https://openalex.org/W1980071604,"The association of G1cyclins and Cdc28/cyclin-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the cell cycle entry (Start) in budding yeast. Activation of Start is presumed to be triggered by a post-transcriptional increase in Cln3 during early G1. Cells arrested by mating pheromone show a loss of cyclin-dependent protein kinase activity caused by transcriptional shutoff of cyclins and/or inhibition by Far1. We report that overexpression of eIF4E (Cdc33), a rate-limiting translation initiation factor, causes an increase in CLN3 mRNA translation, which results in increased expression of CLN2and in slow growth and decreased α-factor response. This phenotype was abrogated in a Δcln3 or Δcln2background. We isolated the transcription factor MBP1 as a multicopy suppressor of the growth and α-factor response defects. Furthermore, elevated MBP1, a transcriptional regulator of cyclins, altered the transcriptional start site in CLN3 mRNA, shifting it 45 nucleotides upstream of the normal. This lengthened 5′-untranslated region likely reduces translation efficiency and down-regulatesCLN3 protein synthesis, thereby correcting for the excess translation promoted by elevated Cdc33. In addition, theCLN2 mRNA level returned to normal. We propose that regulation of translation initiation by Cdc33 plays a pivotal role in the activation of Start and cell cycle progression in budding yeast."

The mechanism of protein transport through the Golgi has been seen as controversial in recent years. During the characterization ofN-glycosylation-defective mutants (ngd)previously isolated by this laboratory, it was found thatngd20 is allelic to sec20. SEC20 was reported to be required for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, but its precise function remains to be determined. We show now that SEC20 is also required for N- andO-glycosylation in the Golgi but not in the ER, in a cargo-specific manner, and that the glycosylation defect does not correlate with the secretory defect. By pulse-chase labeling experiments in combination with mannose linkage-specific antibodies, invertase and carboxypeptidase were found to be efficiently secreted to their final compartment, even upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature, while glycosylation in the Golgi was severely impaired. Using microsomal membranes isolated from ngd20, we found that mannosyl transfer from GDP-Man to various mannose-oligosaccharides, indicative for Golgi mannosylation, was strongly diminished. Analysis of the carbohydrate component of chitinase, an exclusively O-mannosylated protein, or of the bulk mannoprotein indicates that O-mannosylation is also reduced.

Morphological, biochemical, and genetic techniques have defined functionally distinct polarized subcompartments within this complex, each of which contains a set of resident proteins (1Farquhar M.G.

The fundamental mechanism of protein transport through the Golgi apparatus has been seen as controversial in recent years. Two models have been proposed. According to the stable compartment model, different Golgi proteins are anchored in distinct compartments, and secretory cargo is transported through the complex in anterograde vesicles. In view of the cisternal maturation concept, thecis-Golgi compartment is formed de novo by fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles, and the secretory cargo is carried forward by cisternal maturation, while retrograde vesicles recycle resident Golgi proteins. Each Golgi protein is concentrated in that part of the stack at which retrograde transport of this particular protein balances cisternal progression (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E.

This so-calledouter chain greatly varies in size depending on the protein. Whereas glycoproteins of the internal compartments have only a few mannose residues added, many of the proteins of the cell wall have attached a large, heterogeneous “mannan” structure up to 200 mannoses. To further our understanding of N-glycosylation in yeast, we screened for temperature-sensitiveN-glycosylation-defective mutants (ngd) by using a tritium suicide selection procedure (12Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck T. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Huffaker T.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3203-3210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the biochemical and genetic characterization of ngd20, it was found to be allelic to the secretory mutant sec20. The SEC20gene was reported to encode a membrane glycoprotein required for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (25Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Later it was found that Sec20p forms a complex with the cytosolic Tip20p (26Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2831-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Cosson P. Schröder-Köhne S. Sweet D.S. Démolliére C. Hennecke S. Frigerio G. Letourneur F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 92-97Google Scholar), and its primary function was assumed to be in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER rather than in the forward transport step (28Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the complex acts in the ER to aid the uncoating, docking, or fusion of retrograde vesicles. However, its precise role remains to be determined. We show now thatNGD20/SEC20 is also required for GolgiN- and O-glycosylation in a cargo-specific manner and that the glycosylation defect does not correlate with the secretion phenotype. The following yeast strains were used: X2180–1A (MATαaSUC2 mal mel), SS330 (MATa ade2–101 ura3–52 his3ΔD200 tyr1), DBY746 (his3-ΔD1 leu2–3 leu2–112 ura3–52 trp1–289), ISY1 (MATαa ura3 leu2 trp1 ngd20–1), ISY2 (MATαa ura3 leu2 trp1 ngd20 pOH), ISY3 (MATa ade2–101 ura3–52 his3ΔD200 tyr1), ISY4 (MATαa ura3 leu2 trp1 ΔDpep4 ΔDprb1 ngd20 pOH), ISY5 (ura3 leu2 trp1 ΔDpep4 ΔDprb1), TH2–10D (MATαa mnn2 mnn1). Cells were grown in standard yeast media, either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% dextrose) or YNBD drop out media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, plus complete supplement mixture), or YNBD minimal medium, supplemented as necessary (29Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Plasmid pOH (30Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was provided by M. Gerard Waters; plasmids pC α→I and pC α←I (31Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were obtained from Todd R. Graham. Plasmids were transformed into yeast using standard techniques. The mutant originates from our N-glycosylation-defective mutant collection isolated by [3H]mannose suicide selection (12Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck T. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The original ngd20 was backcrossed twice into DBY746 to givengd20–1. A genomic library, containing partiallySau3A-digested yeast chromosomal DNA ligated into vector YEp352 (32Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), was transformed into ngd20–1. Transformants were selected on YNBD minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids, 20 mg/ml Trp, and 30 mg/ml Leu first at 29 °C for 7 h to allow recovery and then shifted to 36 °C. Six transformants were obtained that grew at 36 °C. Plasmids were recovered, retransformed into the mutant, and tested for complementing the growth defect and restoration of normal glycosylation of invertase and carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). From the six plasmids only one complemented both selection criteria. The plasmid was named pNGD20. The insert was sequenced and found to contain the SEC20 gene as the only complete open reading frame. To verify the mutation inngd20–1, genomic DNA was isolated, and the open reading frame was amplified by Expand High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned, and three individual clones were sequenced. Yeast cells from a log culture grown on selective YNBD drop out medium at 25 °C were diluted and transferred for about five doubling periods to YEPD to reach early logarithmic phase. Cells were collected at 1,200 × g for 3 min, washed once, and resuspended at 2 A 578/ml in YNBD supplemented with amino acids. After 30–45 min of adaptation at 25 or 35 °C as indicated, 75 µCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-Mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and cells were labeled for 10–30 min as indicated. Chase was initiated by adding a 10× chase solution (50 mmmethionine, 10 mm cysteine, 4% yeast extract, 20% glucose) to a 1× final concentration. In the case of invertase, cells were derepressed for 30–45 min in yeast minimal medium with 0.1% glucose prior to labeling. Labeling was terminated with 10 mm NaN3, and the [35S] label that was not incorporated was removed by washing cells once with 10 mm NaN3. Cells were resuspended in 300 µl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EtSH, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine) and broken with glass beads (0.45 µm) for 10 min on a vibrax shaker at 4 °C. After the lysate was collected, glass beads were washed once with 300 µl of buffer, and the extracts were combined. The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with 1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C. SDS was then reduced to <0.2% by addition of TNET (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), the appropriate antiserum was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. For precipitation of the antigen-Ig G complexes, 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose equilibrated in TNET buffer was incubated with the solubilized extract by rolling end over end for 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 × g, washed four times with 1 ml of TNET buffer and once with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, then resuspended in 50 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Antigens to be reimmunoprecipitated with a secondary antibody were dissociated from the first antibody by boiling for 5 min in 100 µl of 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For endoglycosidase H (endoH) digestion immunoprecipitated samples were treated twice with 15 µl of 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.5% SDS and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Then 120 µl of 10 mm sodium citrate buffer containing 0.5% octylglucoside was added and boiled for another 3 min. The combined supernatants were incubated with 25 milliunits of endoH at 37 °C. After 4 h an additional 25 milliunits were added and incubated overnight. Control samples were similarly prepared without endoH. Polyclonal antisera directed against unglycosylated cytoplasmic invertase and CPY were from laboratory stocks. Antisera specific to α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannose were prepared by immunizing rabbits with heat-killed yeast cells (strains X2180 and mnn1–3 mnn2–1, respectively). Antisera specific to α1,3-linked mannose were purified by absorption of the antiserum to mnn1 cells; α1,6-specific antiserum was obtained by absorption to X2180 cells. 2Lun Ballou, personal communication. Antiserum against deglycosylated chitinase was a gift from W. Tanner, University Regensburg). Anti-HA tag antiserum was purchased from Babco (Berkeley, CA). For subcellular fractionation labeled cells (10A 578 equivalents) were converted to spheroplasts by incubation at 25 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of zymolyase buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1.4m sorbitol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaN3, 0.265 mg zymolase 100T. Spheroplasts were washed and lysed in 150 µl of hypoosmotic lysis buffer (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine). The crude lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min to remove unlysed spheroplasts. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to generate the P13 pellet (ER fraction). The S13 supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min to generate the high speed pellet (P100) and the supernatant S100 fraction. Processing and immunoprecipitation of P13, P100, and S100 after boiling in 1% SDS for 5 min were carried out as described above. In experiments to distinguish intracellular (I) and extracellular (E) secreted material, labeled cells were converted to spheroplasts and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min to obtain a pellet (I) and a supernatant (E) fraction. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography. Quantification of radioactivity was performed with a Packard phosphorimaging device. Cells were grown in YEP with 2% sucrose as carbon source. 1.5 × 108 cells were collected, washed in YEP plus 0.5% sucrose, resuspended in 10 ml of the same medium, and labeled for 2 h with 200 µCi of [2−3H]mannose at 25 and 34 °C. Cells were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and broken with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g at 4 °C and washed once with the same buffer. O-Glycan chains were released with 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH overnight at 30 °C. The reaction was neutralized with HCl, and oligosaccharides were separated on a Bio-Gel P2 column (0.9 × 104 cm) equilibrated in 50 mmpyridine acetate, pH 5.2. Fractions of 33 drops were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. Chitinase was analyzed by Western blotting to nitrocellulose membranes using the semi-dry blotting technique and visualized by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were broken with glass beads as described above. A cell wall pellet was obtained from the lysate by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. SDS sample buffer was added, incubated for 10 min at 95 °C, and centrifuged. From the supernatant the equivalent of 1–3 A 578were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and decorated with anti-chitinase antiserum. Incubation mixtures contained 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mmMnCl2, GDP-[U-14C]mannose (0.1 µCi; specific activity, 303 mCi/mmol), 2 mm exogenous acceptor as indicated, and 0.2 mg of membrane protein in a final volume of 0.07 ml. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C and terminated with 0.1 ml of methanol. The precipitated protein pellet was extracted with 0.2 ml of H2O. The extracts were combined, and GDP-mannose was removed by passing the solution through Dowex AG 4-X4 resin. The neutral products were eluted with water, lyophilized, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates developed twice with the solvent acetone:butanol:water (70:15:15, v/v/v). Radioactivity was monitored and quantified with a TLC radioanalyzer (Berthold). Among the ngd mutant collection previously isolated (12Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck T. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), ngd20 showed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype (Fig. 1) and a strong defect in glycosylation (see below). Compared with wild-type cells,ngd2 had a reduced growth at 30 °C and a complete block at 37 °C; addition of sorbitol improved growth at all temperatures. Yeast genomic clones, which complemented the temperature sensitivity ofngd20 at 36 °C, were isolated by transformation with a plasmid-based genomic library. From six colonies growing at the restrictive temperature one plasmid was identified, which also complemented the glycosylation defect. Sequence information from the 4-kilobase insert revealed that it contained SEC20flanked by only incomplete sequences of ITR3 (myo-inositol transporter) and open reading frame YDR 499 (function unknown). Therefore, we assumed that ngd20 is allelic tosec20. To verify the ngd20 mutation, we isolated the corresponding gene from the mutant by polymerase chain reaction amplification using proofreading Taq polymerase. The product was cloned, and from three individual clones the sequence was determined. Two nucleotide changes were found, compared with the published wild-type SEC20 sequence (25Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At position 646 the GGA triplet codon was changed to AGA, causing a Gly216 to Arg substitution. The second base change at position 441 was in the third position of the triplet codon (GAG to GAA) and does not cause an amino acid change. Thus the mutation in ngd20 is the same as that present in sec20–2 and sec20–3 mutant alleles but differs from sec20–1 in which Leu234 is changed to Ser. It was surprising to have clonedSEC20 as the complementing gene, because the glycosylation defect in ngd20 occurred already at the permissive growth temperature, at which no secretion block or growth defect is observed (see below). Protein glycosylation defects in sec20 have not been studied so far. We therefore examined in detail the glycosylation pattern in relation to secretion. Two well characterized secretory glycoproteins, invertase and CPY, were analyzed. Invertase, a periplasmic enzyme, contains on average 9–10 N-linked glycan chains (34Reddy V.A. Johnson R.S. Biemann K. Williams R.S. Ziegler F.D. Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lehle L. Cohen R.E. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12209-12218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core glycosylated ER form migrates as a relatively distinct band at 97 kDa. By the time invertase is secreted to the cell wall, it runs on SDS gels as a 100–150-kDa smear due to extensive and heterogeneous elongation of some of the core chains in the Golgi apparatus (34Reddy V.A.

CPY is synthesized initially as a proenzyme, which is first modified with four core oligosaccharides in the ER, generating the p1 form (67 kDa), and next in the Golgi complex, where the core chains are elongated, generating the p2 form (69 kDa). After delivery to the vacuole, the pro-region is cleaved to yield the mature protein (m-CPY, 61 kDa) (15Franzusoff A. Schekman R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 37Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Moreover, to address the functionality of different Golgi compartments in ngd20, we analyzed specific properties of this compartment previously defined. Och1p, the initial α1,6-mannosyltransferase, was used as a marker for the intermediate/cis-compartment, whereas addition of elongating α1,6- and terminating α1,3-mannose moieties defining the medial- and trans-compartment was monitored with antibodies specific for α1,6- and α1,3-linked mannose. Analysis of Kex2p activity was included to probe thetrans Golgi network (14Brigance W.T. Barlow C. Graham T.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Franzusoff A. Redding K. Crosby J. Fuller R.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Finally we tested the ability of microsomal membranes to transfer mannose from GDP-mannose to different mannose acceptors indicative for Golgi mannosyltransferases. Yeast cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, invertase inngd20 at the permissive temperature of 25 °C is already severely underglygosylated compared with the wild type but still migrated as a diffuse band (lanes 1 and 4). By using antibodies specific for α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannose, 90 and 36%, respectively, of the label could be recovered in a second immunoprecipitation, similar to wild-type invertase (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and6). This indicates that in principle all Golgi compartments are functional at 25 °C, but the overall glycosylation activity is reduced and leads to shorter glycan chains. The slight increase in yield observed with the α1,6-mannose antiserum is probably due to a better access of the antigenic epitope on shorter chains. Labeling at 35 °C resulted in an invertase form that migrated as the core glycosylated ER form. As expected, it is poorly precipitated with the α1,3- and α1,6-mannose antiserum (Fig. 2, lanes 8and 9). Similar precipitation values were also obtained for core invertase immunoprecipitated from och1Δ orsec18Δ cells at 36 °C (data not shown). Examination of the glycosylation and maturation of CPY is depicted in Fig. 3 A. Labeling ofngd20 cells for 30 min showed that in the mutant the ER form (p1-CPY) was the dominant species even at the permissive growth temperature (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–6). This indicates that processing to the mature, vacuolar form was retarded compared with wild-type yeast (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–3), in agreement with a sec phenotype. In addition, the mature form in ngd20 was smaller in size (Fig.3 A, lanes 7 and 8) and ran slightly faster than CPY immunoprecipitated from wild-type cells. Because the size of the p1 form was identical in both strains, we reasoned that ER glycosylation was normal, but subsequent Golgi glycosylation was defective. This could be substantiated further by pulse-chase experiments analyzing the glycosylation state with α1,6- and α1,3-mannose antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Whereas 100% of m-CPY from wild-type cells could be precipitated with the α1,3-antiserum, in the mutant this amounted to only 33% at 25 °C and 16% at 35 °C, respectively (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6 and 3). The results of Fig. 3, A and Bindicate that processing of CPY to its mature form, and hence transport to the vacuole, occurred both at 25 °C (58%) and with reduced activity at 36 °C (30%). We therefore decided to extend the secretion analysis to invertase, which is secreted to the cell wall. Cells were pulse-labeled at 35 °C, chased at either 25 or 35 °C, converted to spheroplasts, and separated into I and E fractions, from which invertase was immunoprecipitated (Fig.4). We found that at both the permissive and restrictive temperature invertase was secreted. Unexpectedly, at a 25 °C chase the glycosylation defect was not restored, and invertase had the size of the ER form. Even at 35 °C invertase was efficiently (32%) secreted. Reimmunoprecipitation of invertase with the α1,3-mannose linkage-recognizing antiserum (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 8) indicated that only about 20% of the secreted fraction at 25 °C and 16% at 35 °C was modified with α1,3-mannose residues. It has previously been shown that the cis-Golgi resident mannosyltransferase Och1p moves to later Golgi compartments as far as the trans Golgi network, after which it is recycled back to the cis-compartment using a retrograde transport system (30Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We asked whether this early Golgi function is affected in ngd20 too. To examine this question a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Och1p construct was used. The HA tag was found not to disturb the steady state distribution of the protein, and the protein was found to have a half-life of ∼60 min (30Harris S.L. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 15 min at 25 °C and chased at the same temperature, as indicated. As can be seen (Fig.5 A), Och1p-HA was degraded only slightly faster in ngd20 than in wild-type cells. To address the subcellular localization of Och1p-HA, a spheroplast lysate was examined by differential centrifugation. It has been reported that the majority of ER membranes are mainly recovered in a low speed 13,000 × g pellet (P13), whereas the bulk of the Golgi membranes fractionates into a 100,000 × g pellet (P100). The 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) is composed of the cytoplasmic fraction and of osmotically sensitive soluble vacuolar content (38Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 39Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). When wild-type cells were labeled at 25 °C and chased at 25 °C, Och1p-HA (Fig. 5 B) fractionated into both P13 and P100, in agreement with previous results (39Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the case of ngd20 about 12% of the pulse label was recovered in the S100 supernatant that was degraded during the chase (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9 and 12). It has been suggested that Och1p degradation in wild-type cells"
