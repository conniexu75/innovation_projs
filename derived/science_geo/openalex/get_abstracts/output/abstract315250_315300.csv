https://openalex.org/W2066840476,"The development of a typical New England salt marsh, and the growth of the sand spit which shelters it, during the past 4000 years has been reconstructed from soundings and borings of the peat. The results have been interpreted with the aid of observations on the structure of the marsh and estimates of the rate of its vertical accretion based on carbon-14 determinations."
https://openalex.org/W1966116391,Radiocarbon dating of charcoal on podzols along a transect reaching 280 kilometers north of the present tree line from Ennadai Lake indicates that former forests were burnt about 3500 years ago and again about 900 years ago. These forests probably were associated with periods of relatively mild climate.
https://openalex.org/W2017393676,A hitherto undescribed form of boron can be prepared by subjecting ordinary forms of boron to pressures exceeding about 100 kilobars and temperatures between about 1500° to 2000°C. The new form has a density of about 2.52 g/cm3 and yields a characteristic DeBye-Scherrer pattern. No large crystals have been prepared.
https://openalex.org/W2036544921,"The dislocation structures of dendritic ice crystals have been directly observed by x-ray diffraction topography. Growth occurs without the intervention of dislocations and very low dislocation dencities may initially prevail. Straining expands dislocations having 11[unknown]20 direction Burgers vectors from sources at grown-in inclusions. Slip of these dislocations in the basal plane (0001) and on pyramidal planes, probably (1 101), with frequent occurrence of primatic punching, is observed. Dislocation reactions of the type (a(0)/ 3) [11 20] + (a(0)/ 3) [1 210] = (a(0)/ 3) [2 110] and a strong preference for pure screw orientation are characteristic. These dislocations generally account for the known anisotropy of plastic flow in ice."
https://openalex.org/W2085350055,"In our report “Late Proterozoic and Paleozoic tides, retreat of the moon, and rotation of the Earth” ([5 July, p. 100][1]; correction, [6 Sept., p. 1325][2]), we examined sedimentary rock records that provided an indication of ancient tidal periods, when the moon was closer to the Earth and the length of a day was shorter.

A comment by George E. Williams of the University of Adelaide, Australia, led us to reexamine our data from the Big Cottonwood Canyon formation (BCC) ([1][3]), which consist of three drill cores. We initially rejected core 2 because of its short length and chose core 3 because of what appeared to be less noise than core 1. Reexamination of the cores disclosed that the primary period of core 1 is larger than that for core 3, increasing the estimate of the sidereal period of the moon 900 million years ago by 2 days. Because both cores are samples from a common formation, this suggests that core 3 may be corrupted by loss of laminae. Substituting the core 1 data increased the estimate of the orbital period for the moon (relative to modern days) at BCC age. Core 1 parameter values were calculated (Table [1][4]); this table also contains the correction of an error in the Elatina calculation of orbital parameters, which appeared in our report ([1][3]).

View this table:

Table 1. 
Corrected tidalite-derived lunar parameters using BCC core 1 data. Columns 4, 5, and 6 are based on column 3 (MLE).



With the use of the whole span of time from BCC to Modern, the mean retreat rate of 3.25 centimeters per year that we calculated earlier ([1][3]) is thus reduced to about 2.1 centimeters per year [with the use of Yoder's value for the present semimajor axis (2)]. But this new value rules out a constant retreat rate, because the Apollo value of 3.82 centimeters per year requires a significant late increase.

We thank Williams for his comment.

https://openalex.org/W1988421883,"Of course the consequence of all this may be the broadening out of a scientific career into one more closely integrated with society in general. This is natural enough, and surely after careful consideration most would agree that this result is desirable. My question today directly concerns the necessity for maintaining the strength and integrity of science in the face of varied opportunities, responsibilities, and distractions: How should this strength and integrity be safeguarded? If the involvement of scientists in social affairs brings with it questionable or dangerous consequences to society, then society will take steps to formulate regulations for their prevention, with possible grave effect upon science. Similarly, in science itself, if the course of science and the behavior of scientists appear to scientists themselves to be damaging to its strength and progress, then a normal reaction on their part would be the formulation of rules and regulations to prevent such abuses."

The implication would be that the deuterium: hydrogen ratio exceeds that on Earth, presumably because of escape of the lighter gases from Mars, with accompanying gravitational fractionation of the hydrogen isotopes."
https://openalex.org/W2025035391,"ABSTRACT Analcime has been determined to be a prominent and characteristic mineral in the Popo Agie a member of the Chugwater formation. It is responsible for the distinctive lithology and physical properties which set out the Popo Agie from other western Mesozoic red beds. The analcime-containing beds are up to 60 feet in thickness and are wide-spread in western Wyoming. Only one other sedimentary occurrence of comparably large quantity of analcime has been reported, parts of the Green River formation. The analcime in the Popo Agie is believed to have originated from the interaction of hydrous aluminum silicate clay minerals with sodium-rich waters of a large interior marsh-lake. It probably represents an aluminum silicate mineral stable under the special saline environment, analogous to certain clay minerals which are stable under soil-forming or marine environments. The analcime-bearing strata constitute a stratigraphic marker within a red bed sequence which, because of insufficient fossil zones or physical datum beds, has been perplexing in stratigraphic studies. It may aid in future stratigraphic work. The large quantity of analcime available invites the attention of industrial mineralogists. Included in its zeolitic properties is the capacity to react with acid and release silica gel and recoverable aluminum compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2071795140,"Harold M. Agnew (Editorial, [13 Sept., p. 1475][1]) has proposed that the United States buy annually from Russia the supply of tritium expected to be needed for U.S. nuclear weapons in about 10 to 12 years and argues that this approach would be substantially cheaper than either the accelerator approach to producing tritium or its production in commercial-type light-water power reactors in the United States.

I agree and, as a result of discussions with responsible Russian officials, believe that one can satisfy U.S. need for tritium in this way at about one-tenth the cost of domestic production.

Furthermore, by carrying one production design through to detailed planning and obtaining requisite permits, one answers possible concerns about a sudden cutoff of the supply of Russian tritium, in view of the buffer provided by the 12.3-year half-life of existing tritium stocks. I have studied tritium production options for the Department of Energy, and these are my personal conclusions.

Gustave K. Kohn (Letters, [25 Oct., p. 481][2]) gives no indication of the cost of tritium production by low-voltage glow discharge, if indeed tritium is produced by such an approach. The world price of tritium is some $2 per curie, and Kohn tells us that 5 kilowatts for “hundreds of hours” produces “10's of nanocuries.” If we assume the duration is 400 hours and that the “tens” are 30, then we see that 2000 kilowatt-hours ($100 at $0.05 per kilowatt-hour) produces 30 nanocuries, for a cost of $3 billion per curie.

Although the reactor approach and the accelerator may be 10 times more costly than buying tritium from Russia, a factor of a billion is out of sight.
