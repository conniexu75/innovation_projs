https://openalex.org/W2784686510,"Free-space volumetric displays, or displays that create luminous image points in space, are the technology that most closely resembles the three-dimensional displays of popular fiction. Such displays are capable of producing images in 'thin air' that are visible from almost any direction and are not subject to clipping. Clipping restricts the utility of all three-dimensional displays that modulate light at a two-dimensional surface with an edge boundary; these include holographic displays, nanophotonic arrays, plasmonic displays, lenticular or lenslet displays and all technologies in which the light scattering surface and the image point are physically separate. Here we present a free-space volumetric display based on photophoretic optical trapping that produces full-colour graphics in free space with ten-micrometre image points using persistence of vision. This display works by first isolating a cellulose particle in a photophoretic trap created by spherical and astigmatic aberrations. The trap and particle are then scanned through a display volume while being illuminated with red, green and blue light. The result is a three-dimensional image in free space with a large colour gamut, fine detail and low apparent speckle. This platform, named the Optical Trap Display, is capable of producing image geometries that are currently unobtainable with holographic and light-field technologies, such as long-throw projections, tall sandtables and 'wrap-around' displays."
https://openalex.org/W2793133729,"Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have a well-established tumor-homing capacity, highlighting potential as tumor-targeted delivery vehicles. MSCs secrete extracellular vesicle (EV)-encapsulated microRNAs, which play a role in intercellular communication. The aim of this study was to characterize a potential tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-379, and engineer MSCs to secrete EVs enriched with miR-379 for in vivo therapy of breast cancer. miR-379 expression was significantly reduced in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumor tissue from the same patients. A significant reduction in the rate of tumor formation and growth in vivo was observed in T47D breast cancer cells stably expressing miR-379. In more aggressive HER2-amplified HCC-1954 cells, HCC-379 and HCC-NTC tumor growth rate in vivo was similar, but increased tumor necrosis was observed in HCC-379 tumors. In response to elevated miR-379, COX-2 mRNA and protein was also significantly reduced in vitro and in vivo. MSCs were successfully engineered to secrete EVs enriched with miR-379, with the majority found to be of the appropriate size and morphology of exosomal EVs. Administration of MSC-379 or MSC-NTC cells, or EVs derived from either cell population, resulted in no adverse effects in vivo. While MSC-379 cells did not impact tumor growth, systemic administration of cell-free EVs enriched with miR-379 was demonstrated to have a therapeutic effect. The data presented support miR-379 as a potent tumor suppressor in breast cancer, mediated in part through regulation of COX-2. Exploiting the tumor-homing capacity of MSCs while engineering the cells to secrete EVs enriched with miR-379 holds exciting potential as an innovative therapy for metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2794063791,"The production of cytokines in response to DNA-damage events may be an important host defense response to help prevent the escape of pre-cancerous cells. The innate immune pathways involved in these events are known to be regulated by cellular molecules such as stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which controls type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to the presence of microbial DNA or cytosolic DNA that has escaped from the nucleus. STING signaling has been shown to be defective in a variety of cancers, such as colon cancer and melanoma, actions that may enable damaged cells to escape the immunosurveillance system. Here, we report through examination of databases that STING signaling may be commonly suppressed in a greater variety of tumors due to loss-of-function mutation or epigenetic silencing of the STING/cGAS promoter regions. In comparison, RNA activated innate immune pathways controlled by RIG-I/MDA5 were significantly less affected. Examination of reported missense STING variants confirmed that many exhibited a loss-of-function phenotype and could not activate cytokine production following exposure to cytosolic DNA or DNA-damage events. Our data imply that the STING signaling pathway may be recurrently suppressed by a number of mechanisms in a considerable variety of malignant disease and be a requirement for cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2746443169,"Periodic driving can be used to coherently control the properties of a many-body state and to realize new phases which are not accessible in static systems. For example, exposing materials to intense laser pulses enables to provoke metal-insulator transitions, control the magnetic order and induce transient superconducting behaviour well above the static transition temperature. However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often difficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body dynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been performed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, theoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and new theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations. Here, we perform an experimental quantum simulation in a periodically modulated hexagonal lattice and show that anti-ferromagnetic correlations in a fermionic many-body system can be reduced or enhanced or even switched to ferromagnetic correlations. We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the description of the many-body system by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a renormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing the results to measurements in an equivalent static lattice. For near-resonant driving, the enhancement and sign reversal of correlations is explained by a microscopic model, in which the particle tunnelling and magnetic exchange energies can be controlled independently. In combination with the observed sufficiently long lifetime of correlations, Floquet engineering thus constitutes an alternative route to experimentally investigate unconventional pairing in strongly correlated systems."
https://openalex.org/W2883443622,"It is well documented that hypoxia activates the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) axis to promote angiogenesis in breast cancer. However, it is unclear how this axis is negatively regulated. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-153 directly inhibits expression of HIF1α by binding to the 3'UTR of HIF1A mRNA, as well as suppresses tube formation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and breast cancer angiogenesis by decreasing the secretion of VEGFA. Importantly, expression of miR-153 was induced by hypoxia-stimulated ER stress, which activates IRE1α and its downstream transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). X-box binding protein 1 directly binds to the promoter of the miR-153 host gene PTPRN and activates transcription. These results indicate that hypoxia induces miR-153 to fine tune the HIF1α/VEGFA axis in breast cancer angiogenesis and miR-153 could be used for breast cancer anti-angiogenesis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2792403564,"The N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) mouse model is an attractive model system of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) as it recapitulates the histology of human tumors in a background with intact immune system. However, it was unknown whether this carcinogen-induced model also mimicked human MIBC at the molecular and mutational level. In our study, we analyzed gene expression and mutational landscape of the BBN model by next-generation sequencing followed by a bioinformatic comparison to human MIBC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other repositories. BBN tumors showed overexpression of markers of basal cancer subtype, and had a high mutation burden with frequent Trp53 (80%), Kmt2d (70%), and Kmt2c (90%) mutations by exome sequencing, similar to human MIBC. Many variants corresponded to human cancer hotspot mutations, supporting their role as driver mutations. We extracted two novel mutational signatures from the BBN mouse genomes. The integrated analysis of mutation frequencies and signatures highlighted the contribution of aberrations to chromatin regulators and genetic instability in the BBN tumors. Together, our study revealed several similarities between human MIBC and the BBN mouse model, providing a strong rationale for its use in molecular and drug discovery studies."
https://openalex.org/W2949847103,"The vaginal microbiome plays an influential role in several disease states in reproductive age women, including bacterial vaginosis (BV). While demographic characteristics are associated with differences in vaginal microbiome community structure, little is known about the influence of sexual and hygiene habits. Furthermore, associations between the vaginal microbiome and risk symptoms of bacterial vaginosis have not been fully elucidated. Using Bayesian network (BN) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence results, demographic and extensive questionnaire data, we describe both novel and previously documented associations between habits of women and their vaginal microbiome. The BN analysis approach shows promise in uncovering complex associations between disparate data types. Our findings based on this approach support published associations between specific microbiome members (e.g., Eggerthella, Gardnerella, Dialister, Sneathia and Ruminococcaceae), the Nugent score (a BV diagnostic) and vaginal pH (a risk symptom of BV). Additionally, we found that several microbiome members were directly connected to other risk symptoms of BV (such as vaginal discharge, odor, itch, irritation, and yeast infection) including L. jensenii, Corynebacteria, and Proteobacteria. No direct connections were found between the Nugent Score and risk symptoms of BV other than pH, indicating that the Nugent Score may not be the most useful criteria for assessment of clinical BV. We also found that demographics (i.e., age, ethnicity, previous pregnancy) were associated with the presence/absence of specific vaginal microbes. The resulting BN revealed several as-yet undocumented associations between birth control usage, menstrual hygiene practices and specific microbiome members. Many of these complex relationships were not identified using common analytical methods, i.e., ordination and PERMANOVA. While these associations require confirmatory follow-up study, our findings strongly suggest that future studies of the vaginal microbiome and vaginal pathologies should include detailed surveys of participants’ sanitary, sexual and birth control habits, as these can act as confounders in the relationship between the microbiome and disease. Although the BN approach is powerful in revealing complex associations within multidimensional datasets, the need in some cases to discretize the data for use in BN analysis can result in loss of information. Future research is required to alleviate such limitations in constructing BN networks. Large sample sizes are also required in order to allow for the incorporation of a large number of variables (nodes) into the BN, particularly when studying associations between metadata and the microbiome. We believe that this approach is of great value, complementing other methods, to further our understanding of complex associations characteristic of microbiome research."
https://openalex.org/W2784641519,"Multimorbidity has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes although as yet, there has been little research on its association with loneliness. This study examined the association between physical multimorbidity (≥ 2 physical diseases) and loneliness in the general population and its potential mediators. Data came from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 (N = 7403, aged ≥16 years). Information was obtained on 20 doctor diagnosed physical conditions that were present in the previous year. An item from the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ) was used to obtain information on loneliness. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. An increasing number of physical diseases was associated with higher odds for loneliness. Compared to no physical diseases, the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval: CI) for loneliness increased from 1.34 (1.13-1.59) to 2.82 (2.11-3.78) between one and ≥5 physical diseases. This association was particularly strong in the youngest age group (i.e. 16-44 years). The loneliness-physical multimorbidity association was significantly mediated by stressful life events (% mediated 11.1%-30.5%), anxiety (30.2%), and depression (15.4%). Physical multimorbidity is associated with increased odds for loneliness. Prospective research is now needed to further elucidate this association and the factors that underlie it."
https://openalex.org/W2953036362,"Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in women owing to metastasis and the development of resistance to established therapies. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the breast tumor microenvironment and can both inhibit and support cancer progression. Thus, gaining a better understanding of how macrophages support cancer could lead to the development of more effective therapies. In this study, we find that breast cancer-associated macrophages express high levels of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGFs) and are the main source of IGFs within both primary and metastatic tumors. In total, 75% of breast cancer patients show activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling and this correlates with increased macrophage infiltration and advanced tumor stage. In patients with invasive breast cancer, activation of Insulin/IGF-1 receptors increased to 87%. Blocking IGF in combination with paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat breast cancer, showed a significant reduction in tumor cell proliferation and lung metastasis in pre-clinical breast cancer models compared to paclitaxel monotherapy. Our findings provide the rationale for further developing the combination of paclitaxel with IGF blockers for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, and Insulin/IGF1R activation and IGF+ stroma cells as potential biomarker candidates for further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2800972408,"The signaling events involved in the onset of ovarian cancer from the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) are crucial for early detection and treatment of the disease, but they remain poorly defined. Conditional homozygous knockout of PTEN mediated by PAX8-cre recombinase was sufficient to drive endometrioid and serous borderline ovarian carcinoma, providing the first model of FTE-derived borderline tumors. In addition, heterozygous PTEN deletion in the FTE resulted in hyperplasia, providing a model to study early events of human ovarian pathogenesis. To uncover the mechanism underlying the invasion of cancerous oviductal cells to the ovary, PTEN-deficient murine oviductal cells were developed and tagged with green fluorescent protein. Loss of PTEN increased cell migration, invasion, and upregulated WNT4, a key regulator of Müllerian duct development during embryogenesis. Further investigation revealed that WNT4 was required for increased migration and colonization of the ovary by PTEN-deficient oviductal cells in a β-catenin independent manner. Human tumor microarrays and ovarian cancer cells lines confirmed WNT4 expression in cancer and its role in migration. Together, these findings provide a novel model to study the mechanism of fallopian tube tumor initiation and invasion to the ovary mediated by loss of PTEN, which may help to define early events of human ovarian carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2784851765,"Crassocephalum crepidioides, Conyza canadensis, and Ageratum conyzoides are alien annuals naturalized in China, which produce a large number of viable seeds every year. They widely grow in Xishuangbanna, becoming troublesome weeds that compete with crops for water and nutrients. As seed germination is among the most important life-stages which contribute to plant distribution and invasiveness, its adaptation to temperature and water stress were investigated in these three species. Results showed that: (1) These three species have wide temperature ranges to allow seed germination, i.e., high germination and seedling percentages were achieved between 15°C and 30°C, but germination was seriously inhibited at 35°C; only A. conyzoides demonstrated relative preference for warmer temperatures with approximately 25% germination and seedling percentage at 35°C; (2) light was a vital germination prerequisite for C. crepidioides and A. conyzoides, whereas most C. canadensis seeds germinated in full darkness; (3) Although all three species have good adaptation to bare ground habitat characterized by high temperatures and water stress, including their tolerance to soil surface temperatures of 70°C in air-dried seeds, A. conyzoides seeds exhibited higher tolerance to both continuous and daily periodic high-temperature treatment at 40°C, and to water restriction (e.g., ca. 65% seeds germinated to -0.8 MPa created by NaCl), which is consistent with their field behavior in Xishuangbanna. This study suggests that seed high-temperature tolerance contributes to the weed attributes of these three species, and that adaptation to local micro-habitats is a critical determinant for invasiveness of an alien plant."

https://openalex.org/W2791053970,"Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of host mobility is a key factor to prevent and control animal and human diseases. This is utterly important in low-income countries, where animal disease epidemics have strong socio-economic impacts. In this article we analyzed a livestock mobility database, whose data have been collected by the Centre National d’Elevage et de Recherches Vétérinaires (CNERV) Mauritania, to describe its patterns and temporal evolution. Data were collected through phone and face-to-face interviews in almost all the regions in Mauritania over a period of roughly two weeks during June 2015. The analysis has shown the existence of two mobility patterns throughout the year: the first related to routine movements from January to August; the second strictly connected to the religious festivity of Tabaski that in 2014 occurred at the beginning of October. These mobility patterns are different in terms of animals involved (fewer cattle and dromedaries are traded around Tabaski), the means of transportation (the volume of animals moved by truck raises around Tabaski) and destinations (most of the animals are traded nationally around Tabaski). Due to the differences between these two periods, public health officers, researchers and other stakeholders should take account of the time of the year when implementing vaccination campaigns or creating surveillance networks."
https://openalex.org/W2784430997,"Gastric cancer remains a malignancy with poor survival outcome. We herein report that GSE1, a proline-rich protein, possesses a role in the progression of human gastric cancer. The expression of GSE1 was observed to be much higher in human gastric cancer tissues compared with normal gastric tissues, and GSE1 expression correlated positively with lymph node metastasis, histological grade, depth of invasion, and clinical stage in gastric cancer patients. Moreover, GSE1 expression was also associated with decreased post-operative relapse-free survival and overall survival in the cohort. The forced expression of GSE1 in gastric cancer cell lines resulted in increased cell proliferation, increased colony formation, enhanced cell migration, and invasion. Furthermore, forced expression of GSE1 also increased tumor size and enhanced lung metastasis in xenograft models. The depletion of endogenous GSE1 with shRNAs decreased the oncogenicity and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo In addition, GSE1 was determined to be a direct target of miR-200b and miR-200c. Furthermore, GSE1 positively regulated the downstream gene SLC7A5 (also known as LAT-1), which was scanned and verified from mRNA sequencing. GSE1 therefore possesses an oncogenic role in human gastric cancer, and targeted therapeutic approaches to inhibit GSE1 function in gastric cancer warrant further consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2785224980,"Excessively short and long sleep durations are associated with type 2 diabetes, but there is limited information about the association between sleep quality and diabetes. Accordingly, the present study was performed to investigate this relationship.The subjects were 3249 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 20 years or older. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A higher global PSQI score indicates worse sleep quality, and a global PSQI score >5 differentiates poor sleepers from good sleepers.The mean global PSQI score was 5.94 ± 3.33, and 47.6% of the patients had a score of 6 or higher. Regarding the components of the PSQI, the score was highest for sleep duration, followed by subjective sleep quality and then sleep latency in decreasing order. When the patients were assigned to HbA1c quartiles (≤ 6.5%, 6.6-7.0%, 7.1-7.8%, and ≥ 7.9%), the top quartile had a significantly higher global PSQI score than the other quartiles. The top HbA1c quartile had a sleep duration of only 6.23 ± 1.42 hours, which was significantly shorter than in the other quartiles. Also, sleep latency was 25.3 ± 31.8 minutes in the top quartile, which was significantly longer (by approximately 20 minutes) than in the other quartiles. When analysis was performed with adjustment for age, gender, BMI, smoking, and other confounders, the global PSQI score was still significantly higher and sleep duration was shorter in the top HbA1c quartile (HbA1c ≥ 7.9%).Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were found to have poor subjective sleep quality independently of potential confounders, especially those with inadequate glycemic control. Impairment of sleep quality was associated with both increased sleep latency and a shorter duration of sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2784964219,"Emerging drug-resistance and drug-associated toxicities are two major factors limiting successful cancer therapy. Combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs have been used in the clinic to improve patient outcome. However, cancer cells can acquire resistance to drugs, alone or in combination. Resistant tumors can also exhibit cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in sub-optimal treatment and/or treatment failure. Therefore, developing novel oncology drugs that induce no or little acquired resistance and with a favorable safety profile is essential. We show here that combining COTI-2, a novel clinical stage agent, with multiple chemotherapeutic and targeted agents enhances the activity of these drugs in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, no overt toxicity was observed in the combination treatment groups in vivo. Furthermore, unlike the tested chemotherapeutic drugs, cancer cells did not develop resistance to COTI-2. Finally, some chemo-resistant tumor cell lines only showed mild cross-resistance to COTI-2 while most remained sensitive to it."
https://openalex.org/W2791564799,"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood and histologically resembles developing skeletal muscle. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive subtype with a higher rate of metastasis and poorer prognosis. The majority of ARMS tumors (80%) harbor a PAX3-FOXO1 or less commonly a PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene. The presence of either the PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 fusion gene foretells a poorer prognosis resulting in clinical re-classification as either fusion-positive (FP-RMS) or fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS). The PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion genes result in the production of a rogue transcription factors that drive FP-RMS pathogenesis and block myogenic differentiation. Despite knowing the molecular driver of FP-RMS, targeted therapies have yet to make an impact for patients, highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the molecular consequences of PAX3-FOXO1 and its target genes including microRNAs. Here we show FP-RMS patient-derived xenografts and cell lines display a distinct microRNA expression pattern. We utilized both loss- and gain-of function approaches in human cell lines with knockdown of PAX3-FOXO1 in FP-RMS cell lines and expression of PAX3-FOXO1 in human myoblasts and identified microRNAs both positively and negatively regulated by the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. We demonstrate PAX3-FOXO1 represses miR-221/222 that functions as a tumor suppressing microRNA through the negative regulation of CCND2, CDK6, and ERBB3. In contrast, miR-486-5p is transcriptionally activated by PAX3-FOXO1 and promotes FP-RMS proliferation, invasion, and clonogenic growth. Inhibition of miR-486-5p in FP-RMS xenografts decreased tumor growth, illustrating a proof of principle for future therapeutic intervention. Therefore, PAX3-FOXO1 regulates key microRNAs that may represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in FP-RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2789243384,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and have been shown to participate in almost every cellular process. Several miRNAs have recently been implicated in glucose metabolism, but the roles of miRNAs in insulin-resistant conditions, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, are largely unknown. Herein, we focused on miR-222, the expression of which was increased in the livers of high fat/high sucrose diet-fed mice injected with gold thioglucose (G+HFHSD). Overexpression of miR-222 in primary mouse hepatocytes attenuated Akt phosphorylation induced by insulin, indicating that miR-222 negatively regulates insulin signaling. As per in silico analysis, miR-222 potentially binds to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the IRS-1 gene, a key insulin signaling molecule. In fact, IRS-1 protein expression was decreased in the livers of G+HFHSD-fed mice. We further confirmed a direct interaction between miR-222 and the 3' UTR of IRS-1 via luciferase assays. Our findings suggest that up-regulation of miR-222 followed by reduction in IRS-1 expression may be a viable mechanism of insulin resistance in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2787207808,"Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) interacts with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors (TFs) to initiate transcriptional networks and regulate downstream genes which enable the cancer cell to evade therapy and metastasise. Here we took a top-down discovery approach to map out the SRC-1 transcriptional network in endocrine resistant breast cancer. First, rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME) was employed to uncover new SRC-1 TF partners. Next, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was undertaken to investigate SRC-1 TF target genes. Molecular and patient-derived xenograft studies confirmed STAT1 as a new SRC-1 TF partner, important in the regulation of a cadre of four SRC-1 transcription targets, NFIA, SMAD2, E2F7 and ASCL1. Extended network analysis identified a downstream 79 gene network, the clinical relevance of which was investigated in RNAseq studies from matched primary and local-recurrence tumours from endocrine resistant patients. We propose that SRC-1 can partner with STAT1 independently of the estrogen receptor to initiate a transcriptional cascade and control regulation of key endocrine resistant genes."
https://openalex.org/W2790014796,"Background The present study investigated the annual prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) among children aged <7 years in Taiwan and the association between socioeconomic status and CP prevalence. Methods Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the 2002−2008 period were used in this population-based study. Severe and total CP were defined according to catastrophic illness certificate and medical claim records, respectively. The annual CP prevalence was calculated as the number of children with CP among all children aged <7 years. Results From 2002 to 2008, the annual prevalence of total and severe CP ranged from 1.9 to 2.8 and from 1.1 to 1.4 per 1000 children, respectively. Boys were 30% more likely to have CP than girls [adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) ranged from 1.3 (1.2−1.4) to 1.4 (1.2−1.5)]. Low family income was associated with a higher CP prevalence [adjusted RR (95% CI) ranged from 5.1 (4.2−6.2) to 6.4 (5.4−7.6)]. The prevalence of CP in rural area was higher than that in urban or suburban areas. The mortality rate of severe CP ranged from 12.2−22.7 per 1000 children within the 7 years study period. Conclusions The prevalence of CP in Taiwan is similar to that in Western countries. A higher prevalence of CP is associated with male sex, low income, and rural residential location. Our findings provide insights into CP epidemiology among the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2786718625,"Within the first year of implementation, 43% of women who tested HIV positive at their first antenatal care visit were no longer retained and being followed in the free prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV program offered by the Kenyan Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières in the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi. This study aimed to explore barriers to enrolling and remaining engaged in PMTCT services throughout the pregnancy and postpartum periods. Qualitative data from 31 focus group discussions and 35 in-depth interviews across six stakeholder groups that included women, men, and PMTCT service providers were analyzed. Using an inductive exploratory approach, four researchers coded the data and identified key themes. Five themes emerged from the data that may influence attrition from PMTCT service in this setting: 1) HIV in the context of Kibera, 2) knowledge of HIV status, 3) knowledge of PMTCT, 4) disclosure of HIV status, and 5) male partner support for PMTCT services. A new HIV diagnosis during pregnancy immediately triggered an ongoing risk assessment of perceived hazards in the home, community, and clinic environments that could occur as a result of female participation in PMTCT services. Male partners were a major influence in this risk assessment, but were generally unaware of PMTCT services. To preserve relationships with male partners, meet community expectations of womanhood, and maintain confidentiality while following recommendations of healthcare providers, women had to continuously weigh the risks and benefits of PMTCT services and interventions. Community-based HIV testing and PMTCT education, male involvement in antenatal care, and counseling customized to assist each woman in her own unique risk assessment, may improve uptake of and retention in care and optimize the HIV prevention benefit of PMTCT interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2784970533,"Understanding trends in the diverse resources provided by large rivers will help balance tradeoffs among stakeholders and inform strategies to mitigate the effects of landscape scale stressors such as climate change and invasive species. Absent a cohesive coordinated effort to assess trends in important large river resources, a logical starting point is to assess our ability to draw inferences from existing efforts. In this paper, we use a common analytical framework to analyze data from five disparate fish monitoring programs to better understand the nature of spatial and temporal trends in large river fish assemblages. We evaluated data from programs that monitor fishes in the Colorado, Columbia, Illinois, Mississippi, and Tallapoosa rivers using non-metric dimensional scaling ordinations and associated tests to evaluate trends in fish assemblage structure and native fish biodiversity. Our results indicate that fish assemblages exhibited significant spatial and temporal trends in all five of the rivers. We also document native species diversity trends that were variable within and between rivers and generally more evident in rivers with higher species richness and programs of longer duration. We discuss shared and basin-specific landscape level stressors. Having a basic understanding of the nature and extent of trends in fish assemblages is a necessary first step towards understanding factors affecting biodiversity and fisheries in large rivers."
https://openalex.org/W2790399930,"This study aimed to identify the similarities and differences among half-marathon runners in relation to their performance level. Forty-eight male runners were classified into 4 groups according to their performance level in a half-marathon (min): Group 1 (n = 11, < 70 min), Group 2 (n = 13, < 80 min), Group 3 (n = 13, < 90 min), Group 4 (n = 11, < 105 min). In two separate sessions, training-related, anthropometric, physiological, foot strike pattern and spatio-temporal variables were recorded. Significant differences (p<0.05) between groups (ES = 0.55-3.16) and correlations with performance were obtained (r = 0.34-0.92) in training-related (experience and running distance per week), anthropometric (mass, body mass index and sum of 6 skinfolds), physiological (VO2max, RCT and running economy), foot strike pattern and spatio-temporal variables (contact time, step rate and length). At standardized submaximal speeds (11, 13 and 15 km·h-1), no significant differences between groups were observed in step rate and length, neither in contact time when foot strike pattern was taken into account. In conclusion, apart from training-related, anthropometric and physiological variables, foot strike pattern and step length were the only biomechanical variables sensitive to half-marathon performance, which are essential to achieve high running speeds. However, when foot strike pattern and running speeds were controlled (submaximal test), the spatio-temporal variables were similar. This indicates that foot strike pattern and running speed are responsible for spatio-temporal differences among runners of different performance level."
https://openalex.org/W2784501009,"In tropical montane cloud forests, climate change can cause upslope shifts in the distribution ranges of species, leading to reductions in distributional range. Endemic species with small ranges are particularly vulnerable to such decreases in range size, as the population size may be reduced significantly. To ensure the survival of cloud forest species in the long term, it is crucial to quantify potential future shifts in their distribution ranges and the related changes in habitat availability in order to assure the long-term effectiveness of conservation measures. In this study, we assessed the influence of climate change on the availability of forested habitat for the endemic El Oro parakeet. We investigated the future range shift by modelling the climatic niche of the El Oro parakeets and projecting it to four different climate change scenarios. Depending on the intensity of climate change, the El Oro parakeets shift their range between 500 and 1700 m uphill by the year 2100. On average, the shift is accompanied by a reduction in range size to 15% and a reduction in forested habitat to only 10% of the original extent. Additionally, the connectivity between populations in different areas is decreasing in higher altitudes. To prevent a population decline due to habitat loss following an upslope range shift, it will be necessary to restore habitat across a large elevational span in order to allow for movement of El Oro parakeets into higher altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2784756215,"Thioredoxins (Trxs) are antioxidant proteins that are conserved among all species. These proteins have been extensively studied and perform reducing reactions on a broad range of substrates. Here, we identified Caulobacter crescentus Trx1 (CCNA_03653; CcTrx1) as an oxidoreductase that is involved in the cell cycle progression of this model bacterium and is required to sustain life. Intriguingly, the abundance of CcTrx1 varies throughout the C. crescentus cell cycle: although the expression of CcTrx1 is induced in stalked cells, right before DNA replication initiation, CcTrx1 is actively degraded by the ClpXP protease in predivisional cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that regulation of the abundance of CcTrx1 is crucial for cell growth and survival as modulating CcTrx1 levels leads to cell death. Finally, we also report a comprehensive biochemical and structural characterization of this unique and essential Trx. The requirement to precisely control the abundance of CcTrx1 for cell survival underlines the importance of redox control for optimal cell cycle progression in C. crescentus. Thioredoxins (Trxs) are antioxidant proteins that are conserved among all species. These proteins have been extensively studied and perform reducing reactions on a broad range of substrates. Here, we identified Caulobacter crescentus Trx1 (CCNA_03653; CcTrx1) as an oxidoreductase that is involved in the cell cycle progression of this model bacterium and is required to sustain life.

They receive electrons from NADPH through the flavoprotein-thioredoxin reductase and catalyze the reduction of oxidized cysteine residues in substrate proteins (1Collet J.F. Messens J.

As such, they are implicated in a variety of processes, ranging from oxidative stress defense to signal transduction. These soluble proteins all share a similar structure, a Trx fold consisting of five β-strands surrounded by four α-helices. They also display a strictly conserved WCGPC catalytic active-site motif and contain a cis-proline residue (1Collet J.F. Messens J.

To date, many bacterial Trxs have been characterized, and most share the same function as EcTrx1. Here, we investigated Caulobacter crescentus Trx1 (CCNA_03653; CcTrx1), a Trx protein with potentially two intriguing features. First, whereas most previously identified bacterial Trxs are not essential because of the presence of redundant reducing pathways, the gene encoding CcTrx1 was identified as being essential in a large-scale transposon analysis (5Christen B. Abeliuk E. Collier J.M. Kalogeraki V.S. Passarelli B. Coller J.A. Fero M.J. McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. The essential genome of a bacterium.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 (21878915): 52810.1038/msb.2011.58Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Second, a high-throughput gene-expression profiling experiment suggested that the transcription of cctrx1 was cell cycle–regulated (6Hottes A.K. Shapiro L. McAdams H.H. DnaA coordinates replication initiation and cell cycle transcription in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58 (16313620): 1340-135310.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04912.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, these two observations led us to postulate that CcTrx1 could play a unique role in C. crescentus. The non-pathogenic α-proteobacterium C. crescentus is a favorite model organism to study cell cycle and division because of its asymmetric cell cycle and the clear separation between its G1, S, and G2/M phases (Fig. 1). Each cell cycle gives rise to two morphologically and functionally different daughter cells: a swarmer cell (in G1 phase) and a stalked cell (in S phase) (for a review, see Ref. 7Curtis P.D. Brun Y.V. Getting in the loop: regulation of development in Caulobacter crescentus.Microbio.l Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74 (20197497): 13-4110.1128/MMBR.00040-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The swarmer cell is motile and unable to initiate DNA replication. It has to differentiate into a sessile stalked cell (G1 to S transition) before it is able to enter into a new replicative cycle (7Curtis P.D. Brun Y.V. Getting in the loop: regulation of development in Caulobacter crescentus.Microbio.l Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74 (20197497): 13-4110.1128/MMBR.00040-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Conversely, the stalked cell initiates a new cell cycle shortly after cell division. In C. crescentus, this complex program is controlled by a handful of “master regulators,” which themselves regulate the expression of more than 200 genes (7Curtis P.D. Brun Y.V. Getting in the loop: regulation of development in Caulobacter crescentus.Microbio.l Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74 (20197497): 13-4110.1128/MMBR.00040-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, using a redox-sensitive fluorescent probe, Narayanan et al. (8Narayanan S. Janakiraman B. Kumar L. Radhakrishnan S.K. A cell cycle-controlled redox switch regulates the topoisomerase IV activity.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (26063575): 1175-118710.1101/gad.257030.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the intracellular redox state of C. crescentus oscillated during the cell cycle. Indeed, the cytoplasm goes from reducing in the non-replicative G1 cells to more oxidizing during the G1 to S transition. Then, at mid-S phase, it gradually turns back to a more reduced state (Fig. 1). Moreover, the authors discovered that the regulatory protein NstA becomes activated by disulfide bond formation during the G1 to S transition and showed that this activation directly depends on the redox state of the cells (8Narayanan S. Janakiraman B. Kumar L. Radhakrishnan S.K. A cell cycle-controlled redox switch regulates the topoisomerase IV activity.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (26063575): 1175-118710.1101/gad.257030.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These fluctuations are thought to act as a global switch that controls the cell cycle progression by fine-tuning the activity of regulatory proteins. Because the cell cycle is redox-regulated and Trxs are central players of the redox homeostasis network, we hypothesized that the activity of CcTrx1 was connected to the cell cycle progression in this bacterium. In this study, we demonstrated that CcTrx1 displays the structural and biochemical properties of a classical reductase with a redox potential of −275 mV. Interestingly, we showed that CcTrx1 is essential and that its abundance is tightly controlled, two features that are uncommon among bacterial Trxs. Expression levels of CcTrx1 are not only controlled transcriptionally but also post-translationally; the protein is actively degraded by the ClpXP protease in predivisional cells. Thus, CcTrx1 accumulates in early S phase when the cytoplasm of C. crescentus is more oxidizing and replication occurs. Modulating the levels of CcTrx1 strongly interfered with cell growth and survival, thus confirming the physiological importance of this regulation. Altogether, our results shed light on the unusual activity of a classical Trx and uncover another layer of the complex redox regulation of the cell cycle in C. crescentus. CcTrx1 harbors the WCGPC catalytic motif and the conserved cis-proline found in all Trxs (Fig. 2A). To gain insight into the function of this protein, we investigated its redox properties. We first probed its oxidoreductase activity by testing its ability to catalyze the reduction of insulin by dithiothreitol (DTT) (9Holmgren A. Thioredoxin catalyzes the reduction of insulin disulfides by dithiothreitol and dihydrolipoamide.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254 (385588): 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon reduction, the A and B chains of insulin dissociate, and the B chain aggregates. This can be monitored by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm. The increase of the solution turbidity that is observed in the presence of CcTrx1 confirms its oxidoreductase activity (Fig. 2B). We then measured the redox potential (E′0) of CcTrx1, a critical factor that determines the ability of a protein to either reduce or oxidize its substrates. By incubating CcTrx1 in buffers containing different ratios of oxidized and reduced DTT, we calculated a redox potential of about −275 mV (Fig. 2C), a value that is similar to the redox potential of EcTrx1 (−270 mV (10Krause G. Holmgren A. Substitution of the conserved tryptophan 31 in Escherichia coli thioredoxin by site-directed mutagenesis and structure-function analysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1999401): 4056-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). We next wondered whether CcTrx1 could be recycled by the thioredoxin reductase expressed by C. crescentus (CCNA_02964; CcTrxR). To address this question, we measured the Km of CcTrxR for CcTrx1 using oxidized CcTrx1 as a substrate in the presence of NADPH and obtained a Km of 1.71 μm, indicating that CcTrx1 is an excellent substrate for CcTrxR (Fig. 2D). Thus, CcTrx1 exhibits the classical features of a Trx in vitro. To deepen our characterization of CcTrx1, we solved its crystal structure and compared it with that of EcTrx1. All crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table 1. CcTrx1 shows a classical Trx fold, a single domain with a core formed of five β strands surrounded by four α-helices (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the structure of CcTrx1 superimposes with the structure of EcTrx1 (Protein Data Bank code 2TRX; 49% sequence identity) with a root mean square deviation of 0.617 Å for 96 atoms (Fig. 3A). The asymmetric unit contains three copies of CcTrx1. In one chain, CcTrx1 is present in the reduced form, whereas in the other two chains the electron density indicates the presence of a mixture of reduced thiols (75%) and a CXXC disulfide (25%).Table 1X-ray data collection, processing, and refinement statisticsData collection and processingBeamlineProxima 2Wavelength (Å)0.980Space groupP65Unit cella (Å)85.1b (Å)85.1c (Å)105.0α = β (°)90γ (°)120Resolution limits (Å)aData in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.42.86–2.80 (2.97–2.80)Total number of reflections60,342 (9,632)Number of unique reflections10,793 (1,732)Completeness (%)99.7 (99.2)Refinement statisticsRmeas (%)16.6 (112.4)〈I/σ(I)〉11.55 (1.80)RcrystbRcryst = Σ‖Fobs| − |Fcalc‖/Σ|Fobs| where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

Open table in a new tab As the structural fold of CcTrx1 was identical to that of EcTrx1 with an identical WCGPC rheostat active-site motif (11Chivers P.T. Prehoda K.E. Raines R.T. The CXXC motif: a rheostat in the active site.Biochemistry. 1997; 36 (9099998): 4061-406610.1021/bi9628580Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), we decided to compare the electrostatic surface potential of CcTrx1 with that of EcTrx1. We found that CcTrx1 has a more pronounced positive charge compared with the more neutral surface potential of EcTrx1 (Fig. 3C). For comparison, we also used an E. coli protein with a glutaredoxin (Grx)-like structure but with Trx-like activity and that is responsible for the reduction of ribonucleotide reductase, EcNrdH (12Jordan A. Aslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. Characterization of Escherichia coli NrdH. A glutaredoxin-like protein with a thioredoxin-like activity profile.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (9218434): 18044-1805010.1074/jbc.272.29.18044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). EcNrdH has an even more extreme positive contact surface area compared with CcTrx1 (see “Discussion”). In vivo, Trxs are implicated in many different processes, mainly by maintaining their substrates in a reduced and active state under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Despite their critical function, most studied bacterial Trxs are not essential. This can be explained by the fact that most bacteria express redundant oxidoreductases with overlapping substrate specificity. In bacteria, there are two major reducing systems, the Trx and Grx pathways. In the Grx pathway, electrons flow from NADPH to glutathione via glutathione oxidoreductase. Reduced glutathione then provides electrons to Grx proteins, which in turn reduce their substrates (13Lu J. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin antioxidant system.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 66 (23899494): 75-8710.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.036Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Although both pathways do not completely overlap, one can usually compensate for the absence of the other. Unexpectedly, cctrx1 was annotated as being essential by a large-scale transposon study despite the presence of the Grx pathway in C. crescentus (5Christen B. Abeliuk E. Collier J.M. Kalogeraki V.S. Passarelli B. Coller J.A. Fero M.J. McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. The essential genome of a bacterium.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 (21878915): 52810.1038/msb.2011.58Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To confirm this intriguing observation, we attempted to delete the cctrx1 gene using a two-step recombination method classically used to produce deletion mutants in C. crescentus. In this method, a plasmid encoding the upstream and downstream homology regions of cctrx1 as well as a kanamycin resistance cassette was transformed into WT cells (Fig. S1). Kanamycin selection led to the isolation of mutants that proceeded to the first recombination step and integrated the plasmid into their chromosome (Fig. S1). Because this plasmid also encodes a sacB gene, counterselection on sucrose led to the selection of mutants that proceeded to the second recombination step, thereby losing the plasmid (Fig. S1). For non-essential genes, the second recombination produces 50% deletion mutant clones and 50% WT clones (Fig. S1). In the case of cctrx1, all the clones recovered were WT, suggesting that this gene was indeed essential. Accordingly, we managed to delete the endogenous cctrx1 (57% deletion clones) when an additional copy of cctrx1 was ectopically integrated on the chromosome. Thus, we concluded that CcTrx1 is essential, indicating that the role of this protein is so specific that it cannot be fulfilled by the other reducing proteins expressed by C. crescentus. As mentioned before, numerous proteins cooperate in the tight control of the cell cycle of C. crescentus. To be active during their proper time window, these proteins usually exhibit a fluctuating expression profile during the cycle. Intriguingly, a global transcription analysis (6Hottes A.K. Shapiro L. McAdams H.H. DnaA coordinates replication initiation and cell cycle transcription in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58 (16313620): 1340-135310.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04912.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that the transcription of cctrx1 was induced in the S phase. To verify whether this induction led to an increase in protein levels, we measured CcTrx1 levels at different time points of the cell cycle after synchrony (14Ely B. Genetics of Caulobacter crescentus.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204 (1658564): 372-38410.1016/0076-6879(91)04019-KCrossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixed culture of C. crescentus was applied to a Ludox density gradient, which allows the separation of swarmer cells (higher density) from stalked and predivisional cells (lower density). These swarmer cells were collected and resuspended in fresh medium, allowing them to differentiate and divide simultaneously (14Ely B. Genetics of Caulobacter crescentus.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204 (1658564): 372-38410.1016/0076-6879(91)04019-KCrossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Every 20 min, a sample was collected, and CcTrx1 levels were assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4, A and B). MreB, which is expressed constitutively during the cell cycle, was used as a loading control, and CtrA, a protein involved in DNA replication inhibition and that is absent in stalked cells, served as a synchrony quality control (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, this experiment clearly shows an increase in the abundance of CcTrx1 in early S phase (Fig. 4, A and B). While assessing the levels of CcTrx1 during the cell cycle (Fig. 4, A and B), we not only noticed an increase in CcTrx1 levels in early S phase but also a severe decrease in predivisional cells. As Trxs are known to be extremely stable, we wondered what could cause such a decrease. We hypothesized that CcTrx1 could be regulated at the post-translational level through cell cycle–dependent proteolysis. The careful analysis of the CcTrx1 sequence (Fig. 2A) highlighted two alanines present at its C terminus, a motif often recognized by the ClpXP protease (15Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proteomic discovery of cellular substrates of the ClpXP protease reveals five classes of ClpX-recognition signals.Mol.

The ClpXP machinery is an essential protein complex consisting of two different proteins, ClpX, an AAA+ ATPase, and ClpP, a peptidase. ClpX is responsible for the recognition, unfolding, and translocation of its substrates to ClpP (16Alexopoulos J.A. Guarné A. Ortega J. ClpP: a structurally dynamic protease regulated by AAA+ proteins.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 179 (22595189): 202-21010.1016/j.jsb.2012.05.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ClpXP protease is responsible for the cell cycle–dependent degradation (17Jenal U. The role of proteolysis in the Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle and development.Res.

To test whether the C-terminal AA motif triggers the degradation of CcTrx1 by ClpXP, we assessed the cell-cycle expression profile of a CcTrx1 mutant exhibiting two aspartate residues instead of these alanines (Fig. 5, A and B). This version of CcTrx1 (CcTrx1DD) is no longer degraded in predivisional cells and accumulates in cells, confirming that the AA motif triggers protein degradation. Moreover, this accumulation masks the slight increase in CcTrx1 expression observed in a WT strain in early S phase. Next, we tested the implication of the essential ClpXP machinery in this degradation using depletion strains. Depletion of ClpX or ClpP clearly showed an accumulation of CcTrx1 compared with the WT strain (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, a recent study showed that deleting a toxin–antitoxin system (the SocAB system) that requires ClpXP for toxin degradation alleviates the essentiality of the protease (27Markovski M. Wickner S. Preventing bacterial suicide: a novel toxin-antitoxin strategy.Mol. Cell. 2013; 52 (24332174): 611-61210.1016/j.molcel.2013.11.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, to corroborate our previous observations, we compared the levels of CcTrx1 in ΔsocAB, ΔsocABΔclpX, and ΔsocABΔclpP mutants. Once again, the clear increase in CcTrx1 level in the clpX or clpP deletion strain confirmed that the ClpXP machinery is responsible for the degradation of CcTrx1 in predivisional cells (Fig. 5E). Altogether, our results reveal that a complex regulatory mechanism, involving transcriptional control and protein degradation, confines high CcTrx1 levels to the early S phase of the cell cycle. Trx proteins play beneficial roles for cells, and deleterious effects due to their presence have never been reported. However, the active degradation of CcTrx1 by ClpXP suggests that accumulation of this protein could be toxic in C. crescentus. Therefore, we constructed an overexpressing strain (Δcctrx1, pBX-cctrx1) to test the hypothesis that accumulating CcTrx1 is damaging to cells. Accordingly, cells overexpressing CcTrx1 (Fig. 6A) do not grow under normal conditions (Fig. 6B). Using 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), an alkylating reagent that binds free thiols, thereby increasing the molecular weight of reduced proteins, we verified that overexpression of CcTrx1 had no impact on the oxidation state of this protein in vivo (Fig. S2). Regardless of its expression level, CcTrx1 was found to be mostly reduced. In this study, we report the characterization of CcTrx1, a bacterial oxidoreductase that is essential for the growth and survival of C. crescentus. We show that the expression of CcTrx1, a protein that exhibits all the characteristics of classical Trxs in vitro, is tightly regulated and that this regulation is important for cell growth. The expression of CcTrx1 is induced in early S phase concomitantly with the initiation of DNA replication and the expression of the two subunits of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (6Hottes A.K.

To remain active, RNR needs to be recycled by a reducing protein (2Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. Enzymatic synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. IV.

In E. coli, redundant proteins with Trx folds are capable of reducing RNR, thereby ensuring its constant activity (29Sengupta R. Holmgren A.

In contrast to fast-growing bacteria such as E. coli, C. crescentus constrains the energy-consuming process of DNA replication to occur only once per cell cycle during a well defined time window (Fig. 1). Previous large-scale studies showed that, in C. crescentus, RNR was expressed in early S phase (28Hottes A.K. Meewan M. Yang D. Arana N. Romero P. McAdams H.H. Stephens C. Transcriptional profiling of Caulobacter crescentus during growth on complex and minimal media.J.

This expression pattern is similar to that of CcTrx1, confining the expression of both proteins in early S phase and suggesting a functional connection. Furthermore, as the electrostatics of Trxs are determinant for substrate specificity (30Berndt C. Schwenn J.-D. Lillig C.H.

This protein has a Grx-like structure but functions as a Trx and is the functional hydrogen donor of EcNrdEF, an RNR present in the cytoplasm of E. coli (31Stehr M. Schneider G"

The main aim is to assess whether people buried in the mass graves were rural immigrants, or if they were more likely to be the victims of plague (or another epidemic) who lived in Riga and its suburbs. The data produced (from dental disease assessments and isotope analyses) were compared within, as well as between, the contexts. Most differences emerged when comparing the prevalence rates of dental diseases and other oral health indicators in males and females between the contexts, while isotope analysis revealed more individual, rather than context-specific, differences. The data suggested that the populations buried in the mass graves were different from those buried in the general cemetery, and support the theory that rural immigrants were buried in both mass graves. Significant differences were observed in some aspects of the data between the mass graves, however, possibly indicating that the people buried in them do not represent the same community."

Recent investigations have revealed that OxyRs of some other bacteria can regulate gene expression through both repression and activation or repression only; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated in γ-proteobacteriumShewanella oneidensis regulation of OxyR on expression of major catalase gene katB in a dual-control manner through interaction with a single site in the promoter region. Under non-stress conditions, katB expression was repressed by reduced OxyR (OxyRred), whereas when oxidized, OxyR (OxyRoxi) outcompeted OxyRred for the site because of substantially enhanced affinity, resulting in a graded response to oxidative stress, from repression to derepression to activation. The OxyR-binding motif is characterized as a combination of the E. coli motif (tetranucleotides spaced by heptanucleotide) and palindromic structure. We provided evidence to suggest that the S. oneidensis OxyR regulon is significantly contracted compared with those reported, probably containing only five members that are exclusively involved in oxygen reactive species scavenging and iron sequestering.

https://openalex.org/W2784912149,"We investigated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in community-dwelling diabetics. We analyzed data from 22,134 people with diabetes aged ≥19 years at the time of the nationwide 2015 Korean Community Health Survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between SES and screening for DR and DN both before and after adjustment for health behaviors, comorbidities, and educational level. Of all diabetic subjects, 33.9% and 38.1% underwent DR and DN screening, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, the extent of the DR and DN screening trended significantly lower as the educational level fell. Monthly household income was positively associated with DR screening, but a lower odds ratio (OR) for DN screening was evident only when the lowest and highest income groups were compared. Compared with managers/professionals, agricultural/forestry/fishery workers (OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.96) and mechanical/manual laborers (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.97) had lower ORs for DN screening. Residents in rural (compared with urban) areas and widows/widowers (compared with members of couples) were significantly less likely to undergo screening for DR and DN. Similar findings were obtained when the analysis was limited to those who had been educated about diabetes. In conclusion, socioeconomic inequalities were evident in terms of screening for DR and DN in community-dwelling Korean diabetics, regardless of whether they had reported receiving diabetes education. Tailored public health policies (and societal attention) are required to aid the socioeconomically disadvantaged."

Utilizing a Sox1-GFP ESC reporter cell line, we identified the lncRNA lncR492 as lineage-specific inhibitor of neuroectodermal differentiation.

Thus, lncRNAs modulate the fate decision of pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2792662781,"Hypermethylated-in-Cancer 1 (Hic1) is a tumor suppressor gene frequently inactivated by epigenetic silencing and loss-of-heterozygosity in a broad range of cancers. Loss of HIC1, a sequence-specific zinc finger transcriptional repressor, results in deregulation of genes that promote a malignant phenotype in a lineage-specific manner. In particular, upregulation of the HIC1 target gene SIRT1, a histone deacetylase, can promote tumor growth by inactivating TP53. An alternate line of evidence suggests that HIC1 can promote the repair of DNA double strand breaks through an interaction with MTA1, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Using a conditional knockout mouse model of tumor initiation, we now show that inactivation of Hic1 results in cell cycle arrest, premature senescence, chromosomal instability and spontaneous transformation in vitro. This phenocopies the effects of deleting Brca1, a component of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These effects did not appear to be mediated by deregulation of Hic1 target gene expression or loss of Tp53 function, and rather support a role for Hic1 in maintaining genome integrity during sustained replicative stress. Loss of Hic1 function also cooperated with activation of oncogenic KRas in the adult airway epithelium of mice, resulting in the formation of highly pleomorphic adenocarcinomas with a micropapillary phenotype in vivo. These results suggest that loss of Hic1 expression in the early stages of tumor formation may contribute to malignant transformation through the acquisition of chromosomal instability."
https://openalex.org/W2784834361,"The reproductive season is energetically costly as revealed by elevated glucocorticoid concentrations, constrained immune functions and an increased risk of infections. Social allies and affiliative interactions may buffer physiological stress responses and thereby alleviate associated effects. In the present study, we investigated the seasonal differences of immune reactive corticosterone metabolite concentrations, endoparasite burden (nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts) and affiliative interactions in northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita), a critically endangered bird. In total, 43 individually marked focal animals from a free-ranging colony were investigated. The analyses included a description of initiated and received affiliative interactions, pair bond status as well as seasonal patterns of hormone and endoparasite levels. During the reproductive season, droppings contained parasite eggs more often and corticosterone metabolite levels were higher as compared to the period after reproduction. The excretion rate of endoparasite products was lower in paired individuals than in unpaired ones, but paired animals exhibited higher corticosterone metabolite concentrations than unpaired individuals. Furthermore, paired individuals initiated affiliative behaviour more frequently than unpaired ones. This suggests that the reproductive season influences the excretion patterns of endoparasite products and corticosterone metabolites and that affiliative interactions between pair partners may positively affect endoparasite burden during periods of elevated glucocorticoid levels. Being embedded in a pair bond may have a positive impact on individual immune system and parasite resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2784884331,"Earlier studies have shown the implication of growth factor receptor activation in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hyperproliferation of aortic VSMC as well as in hyperproliferation of VSMC from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We previously showed that NPR-C specific agonist C-ANP4-23 attenuates the hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR through the inhibition of MAP kinase, Giα protein signaling and overexpression of cell cycle proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate if C-ANP4-23- mediated attenuation of hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR also involves growth factor receptor activation and upstream signaling molecules. For this study, C-ANP 4-23 (10 nmole/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into 2 week-old prehypertensive SHR and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats twice per week for 6 weeks. The blood pressure in SHR was significantly attenuated by C-ANP4-23 treatment. In addition, C-ANP4-23 treatment also attenuated the hyperproliferation of VSMC from SHR as well as the enhanced phosphorylation of EGF-R, PDGF-R, IGF-R and c-Src. Furthermore, the enhanced levels of superoxide anion, NADPH oxidase activity, and enhanced expression of Nox4,Nox1,Nox2 and P47phox in SHR compared to WKY rats was also significantly attenuated by C-ANP4-23 treatment. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of O2-, inhibitors of growth factor receptors and of c-Src, all inhibited the overexpression of cell cycle proteins cyclin D1 and cdk4 in VSMC from SHR. These results suggest that in vivo treatment of SHR with C-ANP4-23 inhibits the enhanced oxidative stress, c-Src and EGF-R, PDGF-R, IGF-R activation which through the inhibition of overexpression of cell cycle proteins result in the attenuation of hyperproliferation of VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W2784742353,"Introduction Studies, predominantly from the US, suggest that positive parenting, social support, academic achievement, and ethnic identity may buffer the impact of racism on health behaviours, including smoking, but little is known about how such effects might operate for ethnically diverse young people in the United Kingdom. We use the Determinants of young Adult Social well-being and Health (DASH), the largest UK longitudinal study of ethnically diverse young people, to address the following questions: a) Is racism associated with smoking? b) Does the relationship between racism and smoking vary by gender and by ethnicity? (c) Do religious involvement, parenting style and relationship with parents modify any observed relationship? and d) What are the qualitative experiences of racism and how might family or religion buffer the impact? Methods The cohort was recruited from 51 London schools. 6643 were seen at 11-13y and 4785 seen again at 14-16y. 665 participated in pilot follow-up at 21-23y, 42 in qualitative interviews. Self-report questionnaires included lifestyles, socio-economic and psychosocial factors. Mixed-effect models examined the associations between racism and smoking. Results Smoking prevalence increased from adolescence to age 21-23y, although ethnic minorities remained less likely to smoke. Racism was an independent longitudinal correlate of ever smoking throughout adolescence (odds ratio 1.77, 95% Confidence Interval 1.45–2.17) and from early adolescence to early 20s (1.90, 95% CI 1.25–2.90). Smoking initiation in late adolescence was associated with cumulative exposure to racism (1.77, 95% CI 1.23–2.54). Parent-child relationships and place of worship attendance were independent longitudinal correlates that were protective of smoking. Qualitative narratives explored how parenting, religion and cultural identity buffered the adverse impact of racism. Conclusions Racism was associated with smoking behaviour from early adolescence to early adulthood, regardless of gender, ethnicity or socio-economic circumstances adding to evidence of the need to consider racism as an important social determinant of health across the life course."
https://openalex.org/W2785908870,"The cellulosome is a remarkably intricate multienzyme nanomachine produced by anaerobic bacteria to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides. Cellulosome assembly is mediated through binding of enzyme-borne dockerin modules to cohesin modules of the primary scaffoldin subunit. The anaerobic bacterium Acetivibrio cellulolyticus produces a highly intricate cellulosome comprising an adaptor scaffoldin, ScaB, whose cohesins interact with the dockerin of the primary scaffoldin (ScaA) that integrates the cellulosomal enzymes. The ScaB dockerin selectively binds to cohesin modules in ScaC that anchors the cellulosome onto the cell surface. Correct cellulosome assembly requires distinct specificities displayed by structurally related type-I cohesin–dockerin pairs that mediate ScaC–ScaB and ScaA–enzyme assemblies. To explore the mechanism by which these two critical protein interactions display their required specificities, we determined the crystal structure of the dockerin of a cellulosomal enzyme in complex with a ScaA cohesin. The data revealed that the enzyme-borne dockerin binds to the ScaA cohesin in two orientations, indicating two identical cohesin-binding sites. Combined mutagenesis experiments served to identify amino acid residues that modulate type-I cohesin–dockerin specificity in A. cellulolyticus. Rational design was used to test the hypothesis that the ligand-binding surfaces of ScaA- and ScaB-associated dockerins mediate cohesin recognition, independent of the structural scaffold. Novel specificities could thus be engineered into one, but not both, of the ligand-binding sites of ScaB, whereas attempts at manipulating the specificity of the enzyme-associated dockerin were unsuccessful. These data indicate that dockerin specificity requires critical interplay between the ligand-binding surface and the structural scaffold of these modules."

This study examined associations between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes (inadequate dentition (<21 teeth) and poor self-rated oral health) among Australian adults. Variations in the association between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes according to area-level mean income were also assessed. Finally, household-income gradients in oral health outcomes according to area-level income inequality were compared.For the analyses, data on Australian dentate adults (n = 5,165 nested in 435 Local Government Areas (LGAs)) was obtained from the National Dental Telephone Interview Survey-2013. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models with random intercept and fixed slopes were fitted to test associations between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes, examine variations in associations according to area-level mean income, and examine variations in household-income gradients in outcomes according to area-level income inequality. Covariates included age, sex, LGA-level mean weekly household income, geographic remoteness and household income.LGA-level income inequality was not associated with poor self-rated oral health and inversely associated with inadequate dentition (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.87) after adjusting for covariates. Inverse association between income inequality and inadequate dentition at the individual level was limited to LGAs within the highest tertile of mean weekly household income. Household income gradients in both outcomes showed poorer oral health at lower levels of household income. The household income gradients for inadequate dentition varied according to the LGA-level income inequality.Findings suggest that income inequality at the LGA-level in Australia is not positively associated with poorer oral health outcomes. Inverse association between income inequality and inadequate dentition is likely due to the contextual differences between Australia and other high-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2793478791,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have pathogenic roles in the development of a variety of leukemias. Here we identify miRNAs that have important roles in the development of B lymphomas resulting from the expression of the chimeric BCR-FGFR1 kinase. The miR-17/92 cluster was particularly implicated and forced expression resulted in increased cell proliferation, while inhibiting its function using miRNA sponges reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis. Cells treated with the potent BGJ389 FGFR1 inhibitor led to miR-17/92 downregulation, suggesting regulation by FGFR1. Transient luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR detection of endogenous miR-17/92 expression in stable transduced cell lines demonstrated that BCR-FGFR1 can regulate miR-17/92 expression. This positive association of miR-17/92 with BCR-FGFR1 was also confirmed in primary mouse SCLL tissues and primary human CLL samples. miR-17/92 promotes cell proliferation and survival by targeting CDKN1A and PTEN in B-lymphoma cell lines and primary tumors. An inverse correlation in expression levels was seen between miR-17/92 and both CDKN1A and PTEN in two cohorts of CLL patients. Finally, in vivo engraftment studies demonstrated that manipulation of miR-17/92 was sufficient to affect BCR-FGFR1-driven leukemogenesis. Overall, our results define miR-17/92 as a downstream effector of FGFR1 in BCR-FGFR1-driven B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia."

Although PPARβ/δ in fibroblasts was shown to modulate oxidative stress in the wound microenvironment, there has been no evidence of a similar effect in the tumor stroma. Here, we present evidence of oxidative stress modulation by intestinal stromal PPARβ/δ, using a FSPCre-Pparb/d−/− mouse model and validated it with immortalized cell lines. The FSPCre-Pparb/d−/− mice developed fewer intestinal polyps and survived longer when compared with Pparb/dfl/fl mice. The pre-treatment of FSPCre-Pparb/d−/− and Pparb/dfl/fl with antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine prior DSS-induced tumorigenesis resulted in lower tumor load. Gene expression analyses implicated an altered oxidative stress processes. Indeed, the FSPCre-Pparb/d−/− intestinal tumors have reduced oxidative stress than Pparb/dfl/fl tumors. Similarly, the colorectal cancer cells and human colon epithelial cells also experienced lower oxidative stress when co-cultured with fibroblasts depleted of PPARβ/δ expression. Therefore, our results establish a role for fibroblast PPARβ/δ in epithelial–mesenchymal communication for ROS homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2785126202,"Background The extent and circumstances under which empiric tuberculosis (TB) treatment (treatment without microbiological confirmation at treatment initiation) is administered in primary health care settings in South Africa are not well described. Methods We used data from a pragmatic evaluation of Xpert MTB/RIF in which persons undergoing TB investigations by PHC nurses were followed for six months. Following Xpert or smear-microscopy at enrolment, investigations for tuberculosis were undertaken at the discretion of health care workers. We identified persons whose TB treatment was initiated empirically (no microbiological confirmation at time of treatment initiation at a primary health care facility) and describe pathways to treatment initiation. Results Of 4665 evaluable participants, 541 persons were initiated on treatment of whom 167 (31%) had negative sputum tests at enrolment. Amongst these 167, the median number of participant visits to health care providers prior to treatment initiation was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2–4). Chest radiography, sputum culture or hospital referral was done in 106/167 (63%). Reasons for TB treatment start were: 1) empiric (n = 82, 49%); 2) a positive laboratory test (n = 49, 29%); 3) referral and treatment start at a higher level of care (n = 28, 17%); and 4) indeterminable (n = 8, 5%). Empiric treatment accounted for 15% (82/541) of all TB treatment initiations and 1.7% (82/4665) of all persons undergoing TB investigations. Chest radiography findings compatible with TB (63/82 [77%]) were the basis for treatment initiation amongst the majority of empirically treated participants. Microbiological confirmation of TB was subsequently obtained for 11/82 (13%) empirically-treated participants. Median time to empiric treatment start was 3.9 weeks (IQR 1.4–11 weeks) after enrolment. Conclusion Uncommon prescription of empiric TB treatment with reliance on chest radiography in a nurse-managed programme underscores the need for highly sensitive TB diagnostics suitable for point-of-care, and strong health systems to support TB diagnosis in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2792790465,"Given that novice drivers tend to be young, and teenagers and young adult drivers are involved in the greatest number of accidents, it is important that we understand what factors impact the driving skills of this population of drivers. The primary aim of the present study was to understand the impact of gender, organized athletics, and video gaming on driving skills of novice drivers under real-world driving conditions. Novice driving students having less than five hours driving experience previous to a normal driving lesson were evaluated on their self-confidence (self-reported) prior to the lesson and driving skill evaluated by their instructor during the course of the lesson. Information was collected about gender, age, whether or not the students were involved in organized athletics, and the extent of their video game playing. There was no impact of gender or extent of video game playing on driving skills. Females were significantly less self-confident with driving than males, but this did not translate to gender differences in driving skills. Being involved in organized athletics—either currently or in the past—significantly enhanced driving skills in both females and males. Finally, novice drivers’ age was negatively correlated with driving skills. That is, younger novice drivers (especially males) had better driving skills than older novice drivers. This is counter to popular belief that young drivers lack technical driving skills because they have less experience behind the wheel. Based on the results of the current study, we hypothesize that the relatively high accident rate of younger drivers (especially male drivers) is most likely due to inattention to safety considerations rather than lack of technical driving ability."

Objective To quantitatively evaluate fluid retention in the calf in female students over their menstrual cycle using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine the relationship of MRI changes and athletic performance. Design The menstrual cycle was divided into 5 phases: menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, early luteal, and late luteal with sampling done in either morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) sessions. At each phase, MRI of the calf (7:00–8:00, 14:00–16:00), body composition and hormones (7:00–8:00), and athletic performance (14:00–16:00) were evaluated. Participants 13 adult healthy Japanese female students with eumenorrhea. Results Estradiol levels decreased significantly in the menstrual phase and the follicular phase compared to the early luteal phase (P = 0.001, P = 0.024 respectively). Menstrual phase estradiol levels were significantly lower compared to the ovulatory phase (P = 0.015), and the late luteal phase (P = 0.003). Progesterone levels decreased significantly in the menstrual phase and the follicular phase compared to the ovulatory phase (P = 0.012, P = 0.009 respectively), the early luteal phase (both P = 0.007), and the late luteal phase (P = 0.028, P = 0.029 respectively), and it along with a significant decrease in the ovulatory phase compared to the early luteal phase (P = 0.010). AM T2 signals were significantly lower in the menstrual phase compared to the ovulatory phase (P = 0.043) but not other phases. PM T2 signals increased significantly in the menstrual phase compared to the follicular phase (P = 0.003), ovulatory phase (P = 0.009), and the late luteal phase (P = 0.032), and the difference between the AM and PM values increased significantly in the menstrual phase compared to the other 4 phases (P<0.01). A negative correlation between fluid retention and agility was observed. Conclusion In female students fluid retention during the menstrual phase could be a factor that influences athletic agility."
https://openalex.org/W2784925939,"Introduction Human serum albumin (HSA) is a monomeric multi-domain protein that possesses an extraordinary binding capacity. It plays an important role in storing and transporting endogenous substances, metabolites, and drugs throughout the human circulatory system. Clinically, HSA is used to treat a variety of diseases such as hypovolemia, shock, burns, hemorrhage, and trauma in critically ill patients. Pharmaceutical-grade HSA contains the stabilizers sodium caprylate and N-acetyltryptophanate to protect the protein from oxidative stress and to stabilize it for heat treatment which is applied for virus inactivation. Material and methods The aim of this study was to determine if the two stabilizers can be depleted by adsorbent techniques. Several, adsorbents, some of them are in clinical use, were tested in batch and in a dynamic setup for their ability to remove the stabilizers. Furthermore, the removal of the stabilizers was tested using a pediatric high flux dialyzer. Results The outcome of this study shows that activated charcoal based adsorbents are more effective in removal of N-acetylthryptophanate, whereas polystyrene based adsorbents are better for the removal of caprylate from HSA solutions. An adsorbent cartridge which contains a mix of activated charcoal and polystyrene based material could be used to remove both stabilizers effectively. After 4 hours treatment with a high flux dialyzer, N-acetyltryptophanate was totally removed whereas 20% of caprylate remained in the HSA solution."
https://openalex.org/W2791221949,"In this article, we introduce a novel flow chart-based screening tool for the categorization of contact lens-induced dryness (CLIDE) and its impact on daily visual activities: the Berkeley Dry Eye Flow Chart (DEFC).One hundred thirty (130) experienced soft contact lens wearers discontinued lens wear for 24 hrs, passed a baseline screening and eye health examination, completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) then were dispensed fresh pairs of their habitual lenses. After 6 hrs of wear, subjects were administered a battery of symptom questionnaires, and underwent non-invasive tear breakup time (NITBUT) measurement, grading of distortion in reflected topographer mires, grading of lens surface wettability, and a fluorescein examination of the ocular surface. Subjects returned after at least 48 hrs and repeated all assessments after 6 hrs of wear of a second fresh pair of habitual lenses.The repeatability of the DEFC between visits was within 1%, and Limits of Agreement and Coefficient of Repeatability were comparable to those of the other CLIDE assessments. Higher DEFC score was significantly related to shorter pre-lens NITBUT, higher OSDI score, and higher Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ratings of average and end-of-day severity and frequency of dryness (all p < 0.001). For CLIDE as diagnosed based on DEFC score, the highest sensitivities and specificities were achieved by the OSDI and VAS ratings; pre-lens NITBUT exhibited good sensitivity but poor specificity. The optimum pre-lens NITBUT diagnostic threshold was found to be ≤ 2.0 sec for debilitating CLIDE, and the OSDI threshold was ≥ 11.4.The DEFC provides a means of quickly categorizing CLIDE patients based on severity and frequency of symptoms, and on the degree to which symptoms impact daily life. The DEFC has several potential advantages as a CLIDE screening and monitoring tool, has good repeatability, and is significantly related to commonly employed clinical assessments for CLIDE."

https://openalex.org/W2789255046,"Welding quality control is an important parameter for safe operation of oil and gas pipes, especially for high-strength steel pipes. Size control of welding defect is a bottleneck problem for current pipe construction. As a key part of construction procedure for butt-welding of pipes, pore defects in girth weld is difficult to ignore. A three-dimensional non-linear finite element numerical model is established to study applicability of size control indices based on groove shape and softening phenomenon of material in heat-affected zone of practical pipe girth weld. Taking design criteria of pipe as the basis, basic tensile, extremely tensile and extremely compressive loading conditions are determined for pipe stress analysis, and failure criteria based on flow stress is employed to perform stress analysis for pipe girth weld with pore defect. Results show that pipe girth welding stresses of pores at various radial locations are similar. Whereas, stress for pores of different sharpness varied significantly. Besides, tolerance capability of API 5L X90 grade pipe to pore defect of girth weld is lower than that of API 5L X80 grade pipe, and size control index of 3 mm related to pore defect in current standards is applicable to API 5L X80 and X90 grade girth welded pipes with radially non-sharp pore defects."
https://openalex.org/W2784459127,"Energy grids are facing a relatively new paradigm consisting in the formation of local distributed energy sources and loads that can operate in parallel independently from the main power grid (usually called microgrids). One of the main challenges in microgrid-like networks management is that of self-adapting to the production and demands in a decentralized coordinated way. Here, we propose a stylized model that allows to analytically predict the coordination of the elements in the network, depending on the network topology. Surprisingly, almost global coordination is attained when users interact locally, with a small neighborhood, instead of the obvious but more costly all-to-all coordination. We compute analytically the optimal value of coordinated users in random homogeneous networks. The methodology proposed opens a new way of confronting the analysis of energy demand-side management in networked systems."
