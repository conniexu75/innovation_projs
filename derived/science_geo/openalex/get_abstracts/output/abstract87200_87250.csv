https://openalex.org/W2013404388,"A new type of gel electrophoresis separates DNA molecules up to 2000 kb with resolutions exceeding the logarithmic molecular weight dependence of conventional electrophoresis. The technique uses 1.5% agarose, 10 to 20 micrograms of DNA per well, and low ionic strength buffers. It employs alternately pulsed, perpendicularly oriented electrical fields, at least one of which is inhomogeneous. The duration of the applied electrical pulses is varied from 1 sec to 90 sec to achieve optimal separations for DNAs with sizes from 30 to 2000 kb. This pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis fractionates intact S. cerevisiae chromosomal DNA, producing a molecular karyotype that greatly facilitates the assignment of genes to yeast chromosomes. Each yeast chromosome consists of a single piece of DNA; the chromosome sizes are consistent with the genetic linkage map. We also describe a general method for preparing spheroplasts, and cell lysates, without significant chromosomal DNA breakage."
https://openalex.org/W1531938298,"Chemotactic factor-enriched butanol extracts from Escherichia coli culture filtrates were fractionated and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The yield from individual fractions of biological activity (lysosomal enzyme secretion) and antigenic activity (competition with [3H]fMet-Leu-Phe for binding to rabbit anti-fMet-Leu-Phe) revealed an average 50% recovery of original material. Five peaks of biological activity were separated as demonstrated by enzyme-releasing activity. Three of these peaks coincided exactly with peaks of antigenic activity, suggesting that at least 3 and as many as 5 distinct formyl-methionyl peptides had been separated. The majority of recovered activity appeared in peak 3 and represented 70% of the total biological and antigenic activities recovered. The five peak fractions were subsequently analyzed by dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DCP/GC-MS) to determine amino acid sequences. After digestion, the formyl-Met peptide was demonstrated in only one of the five peak fractions (peak 3). Furthermore, both the GC retention times and mass spectra indicated that peak 3 contained formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. The DCP/GC and MS data were confirmed with tests made on authentic fMet-Leu-Phe. Butanol extracts from E. coli filtrates to which were added synthetic fMet-Leu-Phe resulted in increased biological and antigenic activity in the precise high pressure liquid chromatography fractions of peak 3 where the fMet-Leu-Phe produced by E. coli was found. Finally, the analysis of recovered biological and antigenic activities indicated that the formyl peptides were found in nanomolar concentrations in culture filtrates. These results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal formyl peptides produced by E. coli, of which formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine appears to be the major component, are the peptide mediators responsible for leukocyte chemotactic activity in the bacterial culture extracts."
https://openalex.org/W2012306261,"The effectiveness of adriamycin in the treatment of ovarian cancer and other human tumors has been limited by the development of drug resistance. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocking agent, completely reversed adriamycin resistance in human ovarian cancer cells with moderate (three- to sixfold) degrees of resistance and partially reversed resistance in highly (150-fold) resistant cells. The potentiating effect of verapamil was due to inhibition of adriamycin efflux in the resistant cells. These results have led to a clinical trial of adriamycin and verapamil in refractory ovarian cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2023910328,"AppppA , ApppGpp , AppppG , ApppG , and ApppA rapidly accumulate to high levels in Salmonella typhimurium following exposure to a variety of oxidizing agents, but not to a variety of other stresses. Among the agents inducing these adenylylated nucleotides are 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, diamide, hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, N-ethyl maleimide, iodoacetamide, cadmium chloride, and a variety of quinones. Some of these oxidizing agents cause preferential synthesis of specific adenylylated nucleotides, e.g., N-ethyl maleimide induces ApppA and menadione induces ApppGpp . Our data, as well as other evidence in the literature, strongly suggest that oxidation stress is coupled to adenylylated nucleotide synthesis by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Although adenylylated nucleotides are made by tRNA synthetases in vitro, their synthesis in vivo is not a simple consequence of inhibition of synthetase activity. Compounds that inhibit normal charging by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases do not result in the synthesis of adenylylated nucleotides, nor do mutations in tRNA synthetase structural genes or tRNA structural, modifying, or processing genes. We propose that the family of adenylylated nucleotides are alarmones signaling the onset of oxidation stress, and that particular ones may be alarmones for specific oxidative stresses, e.g., ApppGpp for oxidative damage to amino acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2044680119,"Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and are translated on free cytoplasmic ribosomes as larger precursors containing amino-terminal ""leader"" sequences, which are removed after the precursors are taken up by mitochondria. We have deduced the complete primary structure of the precursor of a human mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), from the nucleotide sequence of cloned complementary DNA. The amino-terminal leader peptide of OTC is 32 amino acids in length and contains four arginines but no acidic residues. Cleavage of the leader peptide from the ""mature"" protein occurs between glutamine and asparagine residues. The sequence of mature human OTC resembles that of the subunits of both OTC and aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli. The biological activity of the cloned OTC complementary DNA was tested by joining it with SV40 (an animal virus) regulatory elements and transfecting cultured HeLa cells, which do not normally express OTC. Both the precursor and mature forms of the OTC subunit were identified; in stable transformants, enzymatic activity was also detected."
https://openalex.org/W1605327673,"A unique and heretofore undescribed glycoprotein with unusual properties has been purified and characterized from the culture medium of endothelial cells. This protein is synthesized constitutively by bovine, porcine, and human endothelial cells, by vascular smooth muscle cells, and by fibroblasts from dermis and ligament. It is also a biosynthetic product of some murine malignant and/or transformed cell lines but was not uniformly observed in cells derived from human neoplasms. The glycoprotein exhibited an apparent molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of approximately 39,000 before reduction, and of approximately 43,000 (43K protein) in the presence of dithiothreitol. Amino acid analysis revealed high levels of potentially acidic residues (Asx + Glx = 303 residues/1000) and of cysteine (35 residues/1000). Limited proteolysis indicated that both disulfide bonds and mannosylated sites were distributed throughout the protein chain. Neither phosphate nor sulfate was incorporated into the 43K protein during biosynthetic labeling of endothelial cells. In addition, the 43K protein did not bind to heparin, thrombin, gelatin, or fibronectin and displayed no affinity for [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. In contrast, the 43K protein demonstrated a high affinity binding to bovine serum albumin which was dissociable only by sodium dodecyl sulfate. A complete lack of identity with several prominent serum and platelet proteins and with other mesenchymal cell products was shown by one- and two-dimensional peptide mapping, affinity chromatography, and immunological studies. Immunofluorescence staining of endothelial cells showed a granular distribution for the 43K protein that was typical of a secreted protein. The function of this apparently novel glycoprotein is presently not known. Its synthesis by normal mesenchymal cells and by malignant or transformed cells of both ectodermal and endodermal origin suggests a general role in cell function that is independent of transformation."

The purified enzyme also excises thymine glycol and cleaves DNA at apurinic sites, and appears to be identical with E. coli DNA endonuclease III. The enzyme catalyzes the release of several different forms of oxidized thymine, including urea, methyltartronylurea and 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin. The molecular weight of the native protein is 25,000, and the same value is obtained for the denatured homogeneous protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1999147380,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a putative novel neuropeptide predicted on the basis of alternative RNA processing events of primary transcripts of the calcitonin gene1. Distinct mRNAs encoding either calcitonin or CGRP are generated from the calcitonin gene RNA transcript in what appears to be a tissue-specific manner1,2. The predicted peptide has now been detected immunocytochemically in discrete regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems2 and potent in vivo actions have been reported for centrally and peripherally administered synthetic CGRP3. However, so far there is no evidence that CGRP is secreted or released by intact cells. The present experiments investigated the possible secretion of CGRP in vitro using primary dispersed cell cultures of the adult rat trigeminal ganglion, which previously has been found to contain large amounts of CGRP mRNA (ref. 2). We report here that immunoreactive CGRP is spontaneously released by cultured trigeminal ganglion cells and that secretion is stimulated by incubation in high potassium medium in a calcium-dependent fashion. Chromatographie characterization of the secreted CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) isolated only one molecular form which appears to be similar or identical to the predicted rat CGRP (1–37)."
https://openalex.org/W1494794695,"A procedure was developed for the immunoprecipitation of glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of the insulin receptor and its precursors without prior purification using lectins. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were labeled with [35S]methionine after which 35S-labeled receptor polypeptides were specifically immunoprecipitated and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first 35S-polypeptide detected was a 190-kDa glycosylated proreceptor which was rapidly (t1/2 approximately equal to 15 min) processed to a 210-kDa intermediate. The latter precursor was more slowly (t1/2 approximately equal to 2 h) proteolytically processed to 125-kDa (alpha') and 83-kDa (beta') precursors of the mature alpha- and beta-receptor subunits. Immediately prior to insertion into the plasma membrane, i.e. about 3 h after translation, the alpha'- and beta'-precursor polypeptides were converted to the mature 135-kDa alpha- and 95-kDa beta-receptor subunits. The characteristics of the oligosaccharide moieties of the receptor precursors and products were investigated. The 210-kDa precursor and its two products, the 125-kDa alpha'- and 83-kDa beta'-species, and the mature alpha- and beta-receptor subunits bind tightly to wheat germ lectin, whereas the 190-kDa proreceptor species is not bound. Upon incubation with endoglycosidase H, both the 210- and 190-kDa species are converted to a 180-kDa species. The 125-kDa alpha'- and 83-kDa beta'-species are also cleaved by endoglycosidase H, being reduced in size to 97 and 79 kDa, respectively. Based on their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and insensitivity to neuraminidase, the oligosaccharide chains of the receptor precursors (190, 210, 125, and 83 kDa) do not contain terminal sialic acid (or other capping sugars). However, near the time of insertion into the plasma membrane, capping of the alpha'- and beta'-species by sialic acid occurs, giving rise to the mature 135-kDa alpha- and 95-kDa beta-receptor subunits, which are partially endoglycosidase H-resistant and neuraminidase-sensitive. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes are treated with tunicamycin, a 180-kDa proreceptor aglycopolypeptide is synthesized which is incapable of undergoing further processing and proteolytic cleavage to the alpha- and beta (or alpha'- and beta'-)-subunits. The 180-kDa species, which appears to be the aglyco-form of hte 190-kDa proreceptor generated by endoglycosidase H, is resistant to trypsin in the intact cell and apparently has not reached the cell surface. Thus, the oligosaccharide moieties of the insulin receptor precursor are crucial for proper processing, intracellular translocation, and formation of functionally competent insulin re"

https://openalex.org/W1484450422,"The molecular architecture of the rapidly metabolized 32-kilodalton chloroplast protein was investigated. Modified proteolytic techniques were applied to construct a cleavage map for this photosynthetic membrane component. The portion which anchors the protein to the membrane was shown to be rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues, while the surface-exposed portion was richer in polar residues. The amino to carboxy polarity of the map was established by comparing oligopeptide radiolabeling data with the polypeptide sequence decoded from the gene. This showed that the anchor domain contains the NH2 terminus, and the exposed domain the COOH terminus. The 32-kilodalton protein was previously demonstrated to derive from a 33.5-kilodalton precursor. We now show that the precursor molecule has a COOH-terminal oligopeptide extension. A model relating precursor cleavage to membrane integration is presented. COOH-terminal processing is proposed to ensure a correct sequence of events for assembly of the 32-kilodalton protein into the photosynthetic membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2052307202,"A method developed for quantifying respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during voluntary cardiorespiratory synchronization relies on computer-assisted rhythmometric cosinor analysis of instantaneous heart rate data. The RSA was present in all subjects tested, even those at advanced ages. The amplitude of the RSA falls approximately 10 percent per decade. An individual with a transplanted heart and one with severe diabetic neuropathy each had resting RSA values that were normal for their ages. The shape and amplitude of the RSA during voluntary cardiorespiratory synchronization may reflect the suppleness of the heart and its response to rhythmically changing intrathoracic pressure and the subsequent ebb-and-flow of venous return. Our technology allows objective quantitative assessment of the biologic age of the heart and also the effect of any drug, disease, or behavior that affects the RSA."
https://openalex.org/W1506948612,"We have discovered an enzyme in the cytosol of Escherichia coli that generates lipid A disaccharides from monosaccharide precursors by the following route: 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P + UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN---- 2,3-diacyl-GlcN (beta, 1----6) 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P + UDP. Previous studies from our laboratory have documented the presence in vivo of the precursors 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P) (lipid X of E. coli) and UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine (UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN) (Bulawa, C.E., and Raetz, C.R.H.J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4846-4851). Both substrates are novel glucosamine-derived phospholipids, acylated with beta-hydroxymyristoyl moieties, and they accumulate in E. coli mutants defective in the pgsB gene. Synthetic ADP-, GDP-, and CDP-2,3-diacylglucosamines are inefficient substrates compared to the naturally occurring UDP derivative. The free-acid form of the tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate product (C68H129N2O20P) that is generated in vitro has Mr = 1325.74 as judged by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 M HCl for 30 min at 100 degrees C) liberates greater than 95% of the phosphate moiety as Pi. Detailed analysis by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of a phosphate residue at position 1 of the disaccharide, an alpha-anomeric configuration at the reducing end, and a beta, 1----6 linkage between the two glucosamines. Importantly the disaccharide 1-phosphate synthase is missing in extracts of E. coli strains harboring the pgsB1 mutation, consistent with the massive accumulation of 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P and UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN in vivo. The enzymatic reaction reported here represents a major biosynthetic route for the formation of lipid A disaccharides in E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. An in vitro system for the biosynthesis of lipid A disaccharides has not been described previously."
https://openalex.org/W1533618396,"Insulin receptors from rat brain were studied for receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity. In solubilized, lectin-purified receptor preparations, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of the beta subunit of its receptor as well as of exogenous substrates. Phosphoamino acid analysis of casein phosphorylated by these preparations revealed that 32P incorporation occurred predominantly on tyrosine residues. Receptor and casein phosphorylations were specific for insulin and analogues that also bind to the insulin receptor. The insulin dose response for phosphorylation of brain receptor resembled that reported for the purified insulin receptor from human placenta (Kasuga, M., Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y., Blithe, D.L., and Kahn, C.R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 2137-2141), suggesting similar insulin sensitivity and coupling of the brain receptor kinase. Four polyclonal antisera to the insulin receptor were able to bind and immunoprecipitate the brain receptor; however, only two antisera activated the receptor-associated kinase. Thus, the brain insulin receptor, like the well studied non-neural receptor, is coupled to tyrosine kinase activity, making regulation of cellular events by insulin in neural tissue possible."
https://openalex.org/W57695771,"Using chemical and enzymatic structure-specific probes adapted to rapid gel sequencing techniques, we have analyzed the solution conformations of precursors to two yeast tRNAs which contain an intervening sequence, pre-tRNAPhe and pre-tRNATyr. Interpretation of the data was greatly facilitated by performing direct mature/precursor tRNA comparisons. In addition, the effects of tertiary interactions on probe specificity could be evaluated from the results obtained with mature tRNAPhe, whose crystal structure is known. We find: 1) the folding of the precursor CCA terminus, acceptor stem, T psi C stem, variable loop, anticodon stem, and D stem identical with that of the equivalent regions in the cognate, mature tRNA. 2) The T psi C loop and D loop appear to vary slightly in tertiary structure between mature and precursor species. 3) The precursors contain a helix involving the anticodon triplet and a complementary sequence in the intron. 4) The stability of this helix is much greater for pre-tRNAPhe than for pre-tRNATyr. 5) The splice sites for both precursors are located in single-stranded loops. These results bear out predictions based on genetic analyses and are consistent with the view that recognition of universally conserved features of tRNA structure allows all tRNA precursors containing intervening sequences to be processed by a single splicing apparatus."

B16-F10 melanoma cells and reticulum cell sarcoma cells demonstrated an organ specificity in their binding in vitro that reflected the organ specificity of their metastatic distribution 25 days after intravenous injection. These results provide evidence for specific binding of tumor cells to the tissues that they selectively colonize in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1524696858,"Abstract The neutral oligosaccharides from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn1 mnn9, mnn2 mnn9, and mnn9 mutant mannoproteins, and from mnn1 and wild type carboxypeptidase Y, have been characterized. The major oligosaccharide from the mnn1 mnn9 mutant, Man10GlcNAc, has the structure (formula; see text) whereas the largest oligosaccharide from the mnn9 mutant, Man13GlcNAc, has the structure (formula; see text) the differences being due to the mnn1 mutation. The smaller mnn9 homologs had lesser amounts of terminal alpha 1----3-linked mannose and may be precursors of the mature oligosaccharide. The mnn2 mutation had no effect on the mnn9 oligosaccharide structures. Carboxypeptidase Y and mnn9 oligosaccharides were identical, which suggests that the mnn9 mutation eliminates the differences in carbohydrate structure that distinguish intra- from extracellular mannoproteins. One mnn1 mnn9 oligosaccharide, Man11GlcNAc, retained the terminal alpha 1----2-linked mannose of the lipid-linked core precursor, which suggests that processing to give the larger oligosaccharides can occur without removal of this unit. A smaller mnn1 mnn9 oligosaccharide, Man9GlcNAc, was a mixture of isomers that must, in part, have arisen by action of an alpha 1----2-mannosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1580340943,"Human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was shown to be an amphipathic protein in which proteases could cleave the hydrophobic domain from the enzymatically active hydrophilic domain. Papain and Pronase cleaved these domains with greatest efficiency, as measured by the disaggregation of purified acetylcholinesterase to disulfide-linked dimers (G2) on sucrose density gradients in the absence of detergent. Nonspecific proteolytic degradation was reduced both by the inclusion of edrophonium chloride, which protected acetylcholinesterase from inactivation, and by covalent attachment of papain to Sepharose CL-4B. In contrast to nondigested control acetylcholinesterase, the papain-disaggregated enzyme did not bind detergent according to hydrodynamic criteria and could not be reconstituted into liposomes. Thus, we conclude that the hydrophobic domain removed by papain digestion is in fact the membrane-binding domain in situ. This domain appeared largely inaccessible to proteases in intact erythrocytes, however, as less than 10% of the enzyme activity was solubilized by protease digestion. The hydrophobic domain removed by papain appeared very small, as nondigested control and disaggregated enzyme were identical in molecular weight and amino acid composition within experimental error. The fully reduced 75-kDa catalytic subunits of nondigested control enzyme appeared about 2 kDa larger than the corresponding subunits of disaggregated enzyme on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, an indication that the hydrophobic domain was cleaved from the COOH or NH2 terminus of the catalytic subunit primary structure. Studies in which the NH-terminal amino acid was labeled by reductive methylation suggested that the hydrophobic domain is at the COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1591717496,"We have examined the structural requirements at the NH2-terminal region of the lipoprotein for its assembly in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli by constructing a hybrid protein consisting of an NH2-terminal portion of the prolipoprotein, consisting of the signal peptide and 9 amino acid residues of lipoprotein, and the entire beta-lactamase sequence. The results from this study indicate that the hybrid protein is modified with glyceride, processed in a globomycin-sensitive step, and localized in the outer membrane. The translocation of the hybrid protein across the cytoplasmic membrane occurs post-translationally and is inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Our results, therefore, indicate that the signal peptide and 9 amino acid residues of prolipoprotein are sufficient for its modification, processing, and localization in the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1570291627,"This paper further characterizes the estrogen-binding protein we have described in the cytosol of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [3H]Estradiol was used as the radioprobe, and specific binding of cytosol fractions was measured by chromatography on Sephadex minicolumns. Other 3H-steroids did not exhibit specific binding. [3H]Estradiol binding was destroyed by treatment with trypsin, but not RNase, DNase, or phospholipase; N-ethylmaleimide substantially decreased the binding. The yeast did not metabolize estradiol added to the medium, and extraction and chromatography of the bound moiety showed it to be unmetabolized estradiol. Scatchard analysis of cytosol from both a and alpha mating types as well as the a/alpha diploid cell revealed similar binding properties: an apparent dissociation constant or Kd(25 degrees) for [3H]estradiol of 1.6-1.8 nM and a maximal binding capacity or Nmax of approximately 2000-2800 fmol/mg of cytosol protein. Gel exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and high performance liquid chromatography suggested a Stokes radius of approximately 30 A. Sucrose gradient centrifugation showed a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5 S, and the complex did not exhibit ionic dependent aggregation. The estrogen binder in S. cerevisiae differed in its steroidal specificities from classical mammalian estrogen receptors in rat uterus. 17 beta-Estradiol was the best competitor, 17 alpha-estradiol had about 5% the activity, and diethylstilbestrol exhibited negligible binding affinity as did tamoxifen, nafoxidine, and the zearalenones. In summary, a high affinity, stereospecific, steroid-selective binding protein has been demonstrated in the cytosol of the simple yeast S. cerevisiae. We speculate that this molecule may represent a primitive hormone receptor system, possibly for an estrogen-like message molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2164622776,"Human articular cartilage contains very low levels of metalloprotease activity; the activity in 1 g of cartilage is approximately equivalent to the activity of 1 pg of trypsin. Development of a sensitive assay, based on the digestion of radioactive proteoglycan, has made it possible to study protease activity in 1-2-g specimens of cartilage. Cartilage was extracted with Tris buffer in the coId and with Tris buffer containing 10 mM CaCh at 60 C. The extracts were passed through Sepharose 6B; two major and two minor metalloprotease activities were detected. A neutral metalloprotease activity, pH optimum 7.4, was found as a latent form of M, = 56,000. It could be activated with aminophenylmercuric acetate or trypsin with a resultant decrease of M, to 40,000. An acid metalloprotease, optimum 5.3, also occurred as a latent form of M, = 50,000. Activation converted this to M, = 35,000. Removal of calcium ions by dialysis reduced the activity of the neutral enzyme by 8045% and of the acid enzyme by 100%. Both activities were restored by 10 mM Ca. Both enzymes were completely inhibited by 1 mM o-phenanthroline in the presence of excess calcium. This inhibition was overcome by l mM Zn2+ and, to a lesser extent, by Co2+. These proteases may be important in the metabolism of the cartilage matrix and in its destruction in osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1582404136,"Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) will substitute for ATP in the formation of an initiation complex between the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli and primed DNA. The initiation complex formed in the presence of ATP gamma S between the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and single-stranded DNA-binding protein-encoated primed M13 Gori DNA is stabile and isolable by gel filtration at room temperature. Upon addition of the four required deoxynucleoside triphosphates, this complex is rapidly converted to the duplex replicative form without dissociation of the polymerase. Initiation complexes formed in the presence of either ATP gamma S or ATP are indistinguishable by their resistance to antibody directed against the beta subunit of the holoenzyme and by their ability to elongate without further activation. A 2-fold difference was observed, however, in both the extent of initiation complex formation and in the dissociation of initiation complexes once formed. This difference is discussed in the light of previous proposals regarding a dimeric polymerase capable of replicating both strands at a replication fork concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W1607220690,"We previously reported that the cell fusion that occurs during muscle development, when mononucleated myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, requires endogenous metalloendoprotease activity at the time of fusion. We report here that myoblasts contain both soluble and membrane-associated metalloendoproteases, and that these proteases have different inhibitor specificities. Several inhibitors, previously shown to block myoblast fusion, inhibit only soluble and not membrane-associated metalloendoprotease activity in myoblasts. Another metalloendoprotease inhibitor, phosphoramidon, which had no effect on fusion, inhibits only the membrane-associated metalloendoprotease. These observations implicate a soluble metalloendoprotease in myoblast fusion. Two soluble metalloendoproteases can be demonstrated by column chromatofocusing, with pI values at pH 5.9 and 4.8. The soluble metalloendoprotease eluted at pH 5.9 is not inhibited by an inhibitor which blocks fusion, while the soluble metalloendoprotease eluted at pH 4.8 is inhibited. Of the three metalloendoprotease activities identified in myoblasts, the metalloendoprotease required in myoblast fusion appears to be the soluble metalloendoprotease with a pI of 4.8."
https://openalex.org/W1894396731,"Escherichia coli mutants defective in the pgsB gene are phosphatidylglycerol-deficient in certain genetic settings and accumulate novel, glucosamine-derived phospholipids (Nishijima, M., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7837-7844). The simplest of these compounds is 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P) X of E. coli), in which beta-hydroxymyristoyl moieties are the sole fatty acid substituents (Takayama, K., Qureshi, N., Mascagni, P., Nashed, M. A., Anderson, L., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7379-7385). We now report a sensitive radiochemical method for detection of 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P in wild type E. coli and demonstrate that there are about 4000 molecules/cell (0.02% of the total CHCl3-soluble phosphorus). In mutants bearing the pgsB1 lesion, the levels are 100- to 300-fold higher. In addition, we have discovered a novel liponucleotide, UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN, that also accumulates in conjunction with the pgsb1 mutation. This material represents 0.005% of the wild type phospholipid and accumulates 50- to 100-fold in the mutant. The identification of UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN in E. coli is based on: 1) migration of a minor 32P-labeled lipid from wild type and mutant cells with a UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlCn standard during two-dimensional thin layer chromatography; 2) susceptibility of this 32P-labeled material to cleavage by a liponucleotide-specific pyrophosphatase; and 3) chromatographic identification of [32P]UMP and [32P]2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P (lipid X) as the sole products of the enzymatic degradation. As shown in the accompanying article, this novel nucleotide is crucial for biosynthesis of lipid A disaccharides in extracts of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1586157515,"More than 40 protein species including RNA polymerase were found to be phosphorylated in Escherichia coli on analyses of 32P-labeled cell lysates by single and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The protein species and the level of phosphorylation varied depending on the cell growth phase. With [gamma-32P]ATP as a substrate, cell lysates phosphorylated endogenous proteins in vitro which were predominantly phosphorylated in vivo. Both serine and threonine were the major phosphate acceptors in whole cell lysates. Starting from a partially purified RNA polymerase preparation with the protein phosphorylation activity and using an E. coli protein with an apparent Mr = 90K (K represents X 1000) as the substrate, we purified a protein kinase with a native Mr approximately 120K to apparent homogeneity. The protein kinase is either a heterodimer of 61K and 66K polypeptides or a homodimer of one of these polypeptides. We also isolated a 100K protein with self-phosphorylation activity."

Globomycin inhibited this enzyme activity in vitro with a half-maximal inhibiting concentration of 0.76 nM. Nonionic detergent, such as Nikkol or Triton X-100, was required for the in vitro activity. The optimum pH and reaction temperature of prolipoprotein signal peptidase were pH 7.9 and 37-45 “C, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1662028436,"Tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides accounting for approximately 85% of the amino acid sequence of the alpha-subunit of mouse 7 S nerve growth factor have been isolated and extensively sequenced. The partial structure revealed a high degree of identity with the gamma-subunit (greater than 80%), which is an arginine esteropeptidase of the serine protease family. However, the alpha-subunit does not cleave synthetic arginine ester or peptide substrates nor is it labeled by diisopropylfluorophosphate. The lack of catalytic activity may result from a Gly----His substitution near the active site serine or from the blocked NH2 terminus."

https://openalex.org/W1510524381,"A hybrid superoxide dismutase containing functional Mn and Fe has been isolated from Escherichia coli. Streptomycin, which binds tightly to both the Mn- and the Fe-containing superoxide dismutases, had the expected effect on the electrophoretic and chromatographic behavior of the hybrid. Treatment of the hybrid with H2O2, which selectively inactivates the Fe-containing enzyme, resulted in partial inactivation accompanied by a resegregation of subunits, with the formation of active Mn-enzyme and inactive Fe-enzyme. A similar resegregation of subunits was observed when the hybrid was exposed to 2.5 M guanidinium chloride. Hybrids containing Mn or Fe could be generated in vitro by mixing the Mn-enzyme with the Fe-enzyme, removing metals with 8-hydroxyquinoline in the presence of 2.5 M guanidinium chloride, and then dialyzing against Mn(II) or Fe(II) salts. Ten per cent of the activity of the Fe-superoxide dismutases is resistant to H2O2, which correlates with its content of Mn. Since the activity remaining after exhaustive treatment with H2O2 exhibited the electrophoretic mobility of the Fe-enzyme, we concluded that some of the active sites of the Fe-enzyme were actually occupied by Mn. It should be noted, however, that for purposes of metal reconstitution experiments, a definite specificity was demonstrated. The Mn-enzyme was reconstituted with Mn(II), whereas the Fe-enzyme activity was recovered using only Fe(II). We propose that the Fe-superoxide dismutase may be heterogeneous and that 10% of its activity is actually due to a Mn-containing variant with the same electrophoretic mobility. Only the apohybrid enzyme regained enzymatic activity using both Mn(II) and Fe(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1486693351,"Methods have been developed for the addition of different metal ion species to the three distinct pairs of metal sites (A, B, and C) found in the dimer of apoalkaline phosphatase. This allows the preparation of hybrid alkaline phosphatases in which A and B sites of each monomer contain two different species of metal ion or the A and B sites of one monomer contain the same species of metal ion, while the adjacent monomer contains a second species. The following hybrids have been characterized in detail: (Zn(II)ACd(II)B)2 alkaline phosphatase, (Zn(II)AMg(II)B)2 alkaline phosphatase, (Cd(II)AZn(II)B)2 alkaline phosphatase, and (Zn(II)AZn(II]B)(Cd(II)ACd(II)B) alkaline phosphatase. 31P and, where appropriate, 113Cd NMR have been used to monitor the behavior of the covalent (E-P) and noncovalent (E X P) phosphointermediates and of the A and B metal ions. From the pH dependencies of the E-P in equilibrium E X P in equilibrium E + Pi equilibria, it is clear that A site metal is the dominant influence in dephosphorylation of E-P and may have a coordinated water molecule, which ionizes to ZnOH- at a low pH providing the nucleophile for dephosphorylation. A site metal also serves to coordinate phosphate in the E X P complex. B site metal has a much smaller effect on dephosphorylation rates, although it does dramatically alter the Pi dissociation rate, which is the rate-limiting step for the native enzyme at alkaline pH, and is probably important in neutralizing the charge on the phosphoseryl residue, thus potentiating the nucleophilic attack of the OH- bound at A site. Phosphate dissociation is slowed markedly by replacement of B site zinc by cadmium. There is clear evidence for long range effects of subunit-subunit interactions, since metal ion and phosphate binding at one active center alters the environments of A and B site metal ions and phosphoserine at the other active site."
https://openalex.org/W1553827660,"A Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNALeu3 gene has been dissected to identify sequences essential for recognition by the yeast RNA polymerase III transcription apparatus. Three putative promoter regions have been identified, one each in the 3'- and 5'-halves of the tRNA coding sequence, the A- and B-blocks, respectively, and one in the 5'-flanking region. DNA fragments derived from the intact gene and bearing the 5'-flanking region, the 5'-flanking region plus the A-block, the A- and B-blocks without the 5'-flanking region, the 5'-flanking region with the B-block, and the B-block only have been subcloned. Plasmids carrying these fragments were used as templates in a homologous in vitro transcription assay to determine the contributions of the various sequences to the template activity of the gene. No template-dependent transcription was seen when fragments with only the 5'-flanking region or B-block were tested. A very weak template-dependent transcript was observed from clones bearing the A- and B-block regions. Transcription of the fragment bearing the 5'-flanking sequence and A-block was considerably more efficient but reduced relative to the intact gene. The clone including the 5'-flanking region and 3'-half of the gene is transcribed by the yeast extract with an efficiency approaching that of the intact gene. Partial deletions were constructed in which the highly conserved 5'-flanking pentadecanucleotide sequence was replaced by vector DNA. Replacement of the sequence between positions -12 and -2 (relative to the tRNA coding sequence) decreased transcription efficiency 10-fold even though the A- and B-blocks were left intact. We conclude that this 5'-flanking region, in conjunction with either the A- or B-block sequence is sufficient to constitute a promoter for the yeast RNA polymerase III transcription apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2074802488,"An endotoxin produced by Escherichia coli caused a decrease in prolactin concentrations in the plasma of sows when given at low dosages 2 days postpartum. Five to tenfold increases occurred in the plasma cortisol concentrations. Piglet growth, used as an indicator of milk secretion by the sows, was significantly depressed after the endotoxin administration. Some cases of lactation failure in the periparturient sow may thus be due to endotoxins suppressing prolactin concentrations. This appears to be the first report of a bacterial endotoxin having an effect on prolactin in any species."
https://openalex.org/W1720611492,"Highly sensitive, luminescent assays have been developed to measure enzyme activities involved in the metabolism of a major class of insect pheromones which includes fatty aldehydes, alcohols, and their acetate esters. These assays have been applied to measure the in vitro biosynthesis and degradation of the sex pheromone (trans:cis-11-tetradecenal, 96:4) of the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. Three activities were detected on analyses of extracts of the female moths: (a) an esterase that hydrolyzes both the cis and trans isomers of 11-tetradecenyl acetate, (b) an oxidase that converts fatty alcohols to aldehydes in the presence of O2, and (c) an NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase. The coupled luminescent response of bacterial luciferase to long chain aldehydes was used to measure rates of reaction as low as 0.1 pmol/min since only low amounts of material can be analyzed. Specific activities of these enzymes were higher in the pheromone producing gland than in other parts of the moth, implicating these enzymes, and the oxidase in particular, in the pathway of pheromone biosynthesis. The pathway was supported in vivo by demonstrating that topical application of 3H-labeled tetradecanyl acetate onto the insect gland resulted in the formation of [3H]tetradecanol and [3H]tetradecanoic acid, thus providing evidence that all three enzymes were functional in the living insects."
https://openalex.org/W1583487430,"Initiator tRNA from yeast (tRNAMeti) was quantitatively misaminoacylated with L-isoleucine using isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli. Surprisingly the misaminoacylated Ile-tRNAMeti neither participates in nor inhibits the initiation of globin synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, whereas Met-tRNAMeti readily initiates protein synthesis in the same system. The incompetent behavior of Ile-tRNAMeti may be related to the observation that in vitro it does not form a stable complex with eucaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and GTP, under conditions which lead to a stable eIF-2 X GTP X Met-tRNAMeti ternary complex. This indicates that eIF-2 can discriminate between the side chains of the aminoacyl adducts of the tRNAMeti during ternary complex formation, the first essential step in initiation of eucaryotic protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1640894323,"A plasmid-encoded dihydrofolate reductase that originated in a clinical isolate of Salmonella typhimurium (phage type 179) moderately resistant to trimethoprim has been isolated and characterized. The dihydrofolate reductase (called type III) was purified to homogeneity using a combination of gel filtration, hydrophobic chromatography, and methotrexate affinity chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions indicated that the enzyme is a 16,900 molecular weight monomeric protein. Kinetic analyses showed that trimethoprim is a relatively tight binding inhibitor (Ki = 19 nM) competitive with dihydrofolate. The enzyme is also extremely sensitive to methotrexate inhibition (Ki = 9 pM) and has a high affinity for dihydrofolate (Km = 0.4 microM). The sequence of the first 20 NH2-terminal residues of the protein shows 50% homology with the trimethoprim-sensitive chromosomal Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase and suggests that the two enzymes may be closely related. This is the first example of a plasmid encoding for a monomeric dihydrofolate reductase only moderately resistant to trimethoprim, and a resistance mechanism, dependent in part on the high dihydrofolate affinity of the type III enzyme, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1661028126,"Antibodies raised against the 180-kDa subunit of cauliflower RNA polymerase II bind selectively to the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II purified from a variety of plant species. The selective binding of this antibody to the largest RNA polymerase II subunit has allowed us to probe for the size of this subunit in crude cell extracts, in fractions containing partially purified RNA polymerase II, and in isolated nuclei. Fractions containing RNA polymerase II were subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and blots were probed with antibody. Immunoglobulin complexes were revealed with 125I-Protein A. Published purification procedures result in rapid conversion of a 220-kDa subunit to a 180-kDa polypeptide, but purification at high pH (pH 9.0) retards this proteolysis. RNA polymerase II associated with isolated nuclei is largely protected from proteolytic degradation, and a 240-kDa polypeptide as well as a 220-kDa polypeptide can be detected. These results suggest that the 180-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase II arises artificially during cell lysis and enzyme purification, and that even the 220-kDa polypeptide may be a degradation product of a 240-kDa polypeptide in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1535261905,"Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase) has been purified in 100-mg quantities from a plasmid-containing, enzyme-overproducing strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The specific activity of the homogeneous enzyme is 2.5-fold above that previously reported. The molecular weight and partial specific volume of OTCase were determined by sedimentation equilibrium in solutions containing H2O and D2O. Data from two rotor speeds were simultaneously fit using nonlinear least squares analysis with multiple independent variables giving a molecular weight of 110,000 +/- 2,200 and a partial specific volume of 0.732 +/- 0.006 ml g-1. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of OTCase gives a specific absorbance at 280 nm of 0.36. This low value is consistent with a small number of aromatic residues. Amino acid analysis, fluorescence, and multicomponent analysis yield 1 tryptophan, 4 tyrosine, and 24 phenylalanine/polypeptide chain. From an analysis of the circular dichroic spectrum, it was determined that OTCase contained 22% alpha-helix, 43% beta-sheet, 8% beta-turn, and 27% random structure. The fluorescence of the single tryptophan/polypeptide chain has an emission maximum at 320 nm, indicating a hydrophobic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1545011243,"Abstract Well formed, tetragonal prisms of succinyl-CoA synthetase from Escherichia coli have been crystallized at room temperature from ammonium sulfate and mixtures of sodium and potassium phosphates. A systematic survey of the conditions for crystallization of the enzyme has been carried out. This has shown the addition of a small amount of an organic solvent (acetone, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, tert-butyl alcohol, or tertamyl alcohol) to the phosphate media and of CoA to the sulfate media to be beneficial in producing large, single crystals suitable for analysis by x-ray diffraction methods. Preliminary examination of precession photographs reveals that the crystals from phosphate media have a unit cell of symmetry P4222 with dimensions a = b = 94 A and c = 248 A. Evidence suggests that there may be only half of the (alpha beta)2 tetramer/asymmetric unit in these crystals. The crystals from ammonium sulfate media have unit cell dimensions of a = b = 99 A and c = 399 A, a space group of P4122 (P4322), and one tetramer/asymmetric unit. They diffract to a resolution of 3.4 A. Both crystal types have large solvent contents of about 65% of the unit cell volumes. A parameter called index is introduced to facilitate comparison of crystals grown under a variety of conditions with respect to their quality of x-ray diffraction."
https://openalex.org/W1557979437,"The major high molecular weight microtubule-associated polypeptides from hog brain (MAP-1 and MAP-2) were compared by one- and two-dimensional peptide mapping under varied conditions and by immunological techniques. Partial digestion of MAP-1 and MAP-2 with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and analysis in one dimension gave rise to very similar peptide maps independent of whether 125I-, 3H-, or 32P-labeled proteins were used. One-dimensional cleavage patterns of significant similarity were also obtained by partial digestion of MAP-1 and MAP-2 using trypsin or chymotrypsin. Furthermore, a pronounced similarity, although clear nonidentity, of MAP-1 and MAP-2 was also revealed after exhaustive digestion of 125I-labeled proteins with S. aureus V8 protease or trypsin followed by analysis of peptides in two dimensions. For immunological comparison, antisera were used that had been raised in rabbits using electrophoretically purified MAP-1 and MAP-2 components as immunogens. As determined by immunoprecipitation, the antiserum raised to MAP-1 was equally reactive with MAP-1 and MAP-2 components, whereas the antiserum to MAP-2 reacted primarily with MAP-2. Indicating the presence of common as well as unique antigenic determinants on MAP-1 and MAP-2, these results, therefore, were in agreement with the peptide mapping data. Implications of these results for biosynthetic mechanisms as well as differential distribution and functions of MAPs in cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510894030,"Intraperitoneal administration of leupeptin to rats induced a hemoglobin-hydrolyzing protease which was most active at pH 3.5 and was insensitive to pepstatin in various tissues such as the liver, kidney, and muscle, as observed previously in adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture (Tanaka, K., Ikegaki, N., and Ichihara, A. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 91, 102-107). The induced acidic protease was purified about 600-fold in 30% yield from rat liver by conventional chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme appeared homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and was a monomeric protein of Mr = 20,000. The enzyme appeared to be a glycoprotein because its induction was blocked by the addition of tunicamycin to cultures of hepatocytes and because the induced protease was absorbed on concanavalin A-Sepharose and eluted with methylglucoside. It seemed to be present in lysosomes and was fairly stable at various pH values and temperatures. It showed endopeptidase activity on various protein substrates, but scarcely hydrolyzed N-substituted derivatives of arginine. It did not hydrolyze esters, showed no aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase activity, and did not inactivate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or aldolase. The enzyme appeared to be a thiol protease, since it was strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl-reactive compounds and N-( [N-(1-3-trans-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine and was not inhibited by reagents specific for carboxyl-, serine-, or metalloproteases. This induced protease could be separated from cathepsins B, D, and H by chromatography. The enzyme was similar to cathepsin L in chromatographic behavior, Mr and pI, but differed from the latter in stability and in its inability to inactivate some enzymes. These results suggest that it differs from any known proteases found previously in rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1516117773,"Abstract The interaction of rabbit skeletal muscle adenylate deaminase with myosin fragments (heavy meromyosin and subfragment-2) has been studied by analytical centrifugation, gel chromatography, and stopped flow light scattering. Formation of the complex is highly cooperative with respect to addition of two molecules of adenylate deaminase/molecule of myosin fragment to form a ternary complex. Ternary complex formation is also highly pH-dependent with less complex formed at higher pH values, and the pH dependence is steeper with heavy meromyosin than with subfragment-2. At pH 6.5, the dissociation constant for the heavy meromyosin-deaminase complex is approximately 1.2 X 10(-15) M2. Over the pH range 6.5-7.0, rate constants for the formation and dissociation of both the ternary and binary complexes of adenylate deaminase with heavy meromyosin have been determined. From analysis of the time course of stopped flow light scattering, the association steps are found to be extremely rapid, while the rate constant for dissociation of the first molecule of adenylate deaminase from the ternary complex is quite slow. This rate constant increases as the pH increased, but is sufficiently low that the interacting system does not equilibrate on the time scale of mass transport experiments (sedimentation velocity and gel chromatography), and thus displays apparent slow behavior. The kinetic regulatory properties of adenylate deaminase are influenced by heavy meromyosin and subfragment-2, particularly with respect to inhibition by GTP. The association and dissociation of adenylate deaminase and myosin fragments and the resultant changes in kinetic properties of the adenylate deaminase can markedly alter the time course of the enzymatic reaction. The time scale over which this interaction is modulated by changes in pH may have significance in the metabolism of exercising muscle."

We have isolated a unique globomycin-resistant mutant, strain 6-23, which synthesizes a structurally altered, albeit modified and processed, lipoprotein. DNA sequence analysis of the mutant lpp allele and determination of the amino acid composition of the mutant lipoprotein revealed a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for arginine at the 68th amino acid residue of prolipoprotein. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the kinetics of lipoprotein maturation was affected by this alteration in the structure of lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1511209077,"The L-arabinose-binding protein of Escherichia coli is a periplasmic component of the bacterial L-arabinose transport system. The three-dimensional structure of the molecule has been determined by x-ray diffraction and shown to have two globular domains and a connecting hinge. Theoretical study of the flexibility of the hinge using computer simulation showed that the hinge is quite permissive in that only moderate increases in the internal energy are required for opening the cleft where the L-arabinose-binding site is located. In this study, the structural changes that accompany the hinge bending are analyzed. The results show that bending-induced stresses are accommodated by coupled action of covalent and noncovalent forces within the protein molecule. Strains in internal coordinates (bond lengths, bond angles, and torsional angles) are distributed throughout the hinge region after structural relaxation. The pattern of structural changes within a hinge strand upon bending and relaxation depends in large degree on its geometric relationship with the bending axis (e.g. distance and orientation) and the atomic packing of its immediate environment. The distributed structural changes result in a characteristic zigzag pattern for the directional change at each residue in the hinge strands."
https://openalex.org/W1538274461,"Ribosomes from Escherichia coli were programmed by being allowed to bind a molecule of tRNAMetf or fMet-tRNAMetf and the hexanucleotide messenger AUGN1N2N3. The interaction of the ternary complex [EF-Tu X GTP X Phe-tRNAPhe] with the A site (containing the codon N1N2N3) was then studied by measuring the extent of (i) the binding of Phe-tRNAPhe to the ribosome, (ii) the hydrolysis of GTP, and (iii) the formation of the dipeptide fMet-Phe. By variation of N1,N2, and N3, a defined degree and position of mismatch could be obtained; the correct A-site codon UUU was compared with the incorrect codons CUU, UCU, GUU, and UUG. Each single-point alteration led to catalytic hydrolysis of GTP and to a strong reduction in the amounts of Phe-tRNAPhe binding and of dipeptide formation. The observations were explicable qualitatively by a hypothesis according to which the behavior of the bound aa-tRNA, after hydrolysis of GTP and before peptidyl transfer, is determined principally by the energy of binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site. This binding in turn was found to depend upon both the nature and the position of the mismatch. The results further suggest a steric interplay between the 3' (acceptor) end of the A-site tRNA and the second and third positions of the anticodon, so that a mismatch at one of these positions can impair directly the interaction between the aminoacylated 3' end and the ribosome and can thus reduce the rate of peptide bond formation and contribute to the overall fidelity of the elongation cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1500017756,"A novel autophosphorylating protein kinase, autophosphorylating protein kinase 500, independent of cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, calcium, and calmodulin was purified from rat adrenocortical carcinoma 494 by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by the chromatographic steps of DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration, cyclic AMP-epoxy Sepharose, and phosphocellulose. Sometimes two additional chromatographic purification steps of chromatofocusing and gel filtration were necessary for complete purification. The enzyme was homogeneous as evidenced by one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sucrose density sedimentation studies indicated that Mr of the enzyme was 490,000, while ultracentrifugal analysis demonstrated a value of 481,400 (+/-7%). The protein was composed of two identical subunits each with Mr = 250,000. The enzyme molecule was slightly asymmetric with frictional and sedimentation coefficients of 1.28 and 18.20, respectively, and a Stokes radius of 66 A. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis revealed a single peak with pI 4.6, indicating acidity of the protein. The enzyme self phosphorylated one or more of its serine residues. The reaction utilized the terminal phosphate of ATP; GTP was inactive. Divalent cations (5 mM Mn2+ or 10 mM Mg2+) were essential for optimum activity. Autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 did not phosphorylate the commonly used exogenous substrates such as histones, casein, phosvitin, or protamine. Analysis of autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 with rabbit anti-autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 IgG by immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immune electrophoresis demonstrated single arcs of precipitation, confirming the biochemical demonstration of enzyme purification and homogeneity. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed an intracytoplasmic localization of the enzyme in cultured and freshly isolated adrenocortical carcinoma 494 cells. Both cell types revealed an intensity of perinuclear enzyme fluorescence, but an absence of the enzyme in the nuclei or nucleoli. The anti-autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 IgG blocked the self-catalyzed phosphorylation of autophosphorylating protein kinase 500, providing immunological support of the biochemical results that autophosphorylation is an intrinsic characteristic of the enzyme. When autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 was incubated with membrane-bound ribosomes, it phosphorylated a Mr = 31,000 protein. This phosphorylation was blocked by the anti-autophosphorylating protein kinase 500 IgG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The reaction rate is dependent upon the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate and NADH, as well as the functional integrity of the alpha-lipoyl groups associated with the enzyme. The Km value for S-succinyl-CoA is 9.3 X 10(-5) M, and the maximum velocity is 0.02 mumol X min-1 X mg of protein-1 at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. This hydrolysis can be rationalized on the basis that succinyl thiamin pyrophosphate is generated under reductive succinylation conditions. Occasional diversion of succinyl thiamin pyrophosphate to hydrolysis produces succinate."
https://openalex.org/W1591631381,"Differential scanning calorimetry has been employed to monitor structural alterations induced in the dimeric enzyme alkaline phosphatase on binding of Cd(II) (to the metal-free apoenzyme) and phosphate (Pi) (to the Cd(II) enzyme). Cd(II) addition to the apoenzyme at pH 6.5 results in an increased transition temperature, suggesting a stabilizing effect of the bound metal ion. Two distinct structural forms of the protein are detected as discrete calorimetric transitions (Tm = 69-84 degrees C; 87-94 degrees C, respectively). Distribution of the enzyme between these forms is found to depend on the exogenous Cd(II) concentration and the protocol of Cd(II) addition. These results indicate that conversion between the conformational forms is a slow process which appears to require specific levels of metal ion site occupancy. These studies, in which the exogenous Cd(II) concentration was varied from 10(-5) M to 10(-3) M suggest a structural basis for previously observed hysteretic phenomena observed on Cd(II) binding to the enzyme. Even at a minimum stoichiometry of Cd(II) (2 eq/mol of dimer) a single equivalent of Pi is sufficient to accelerate assumption of a stabilized form of the protein (Tm = 90 degrees C). This is followed by a slow structural change paralleling the time course of formation of the functional 2 Cd(II) phosphoryl enzyme which displays two calorimetric transitions (Tm = 65 degrees C, 88 degrees C). The low temperature transition does not appear if Pi is initially present at millimolar concentrations and is abolished on addition of Pi at concentrations in excess of 0.1 mM. These observations suggest the presence of a second, distinct Pi binding site on the 2 Cd(II) phosphoryl enzyme. This is supported by the changes observed in the 31P NMR chemical shift of Pi added to comparable enzyme samples. These data, including assessment of the effect of the presence of Mg(II), are discussed in terms of the mechanism of metal ion association to the enzyme and rearrangement of bound metal ions induced by Pi binding."
