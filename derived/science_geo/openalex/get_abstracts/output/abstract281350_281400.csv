https://openalex.org/W2003801481,"The spermatophore transferred by the male decorated cricket Gryllodes supplicans to the female during copulation includes a large gelatinous portion (spermatophylax), which the female removes and feeds on immediately after mating. Females usually removed and ate the smaller sperm-containing portion (ampulla) within 1 to 7 minutes after fully consuming or losing the spermatophylax. Complete sperm transfer requires that the ampulla remain attached for a minimum of 50 minutes; this corresponds to the average time at which females actually removed ampullae, 52.0 +/- 2.2 minutes after mating. These results indicate that nuptial feeding of the female cricket functions to deter females from removing the sperm ampulla before sperm transfer is complete."

Recently the combination of sophisticated laser techniques and supersonic free jet expansions has offered new insight into the structure and reactivity of such intermediates. Because of their extremely reactive nature the intermediates are produced in situ in the expansion. The free jet expansion provides cooling of the intermediates to very low temperatures, so that even complex organic free radicals and molecular ions can be identified and characterized. Radical-radical reactions and ionic cluster formation likewise proceed in the expansion and can be monitored by laser spectroscopy."

The alloy is not embrittled by the bismuth because the bismuth-rich constituent does not penetrate the grain boundaries of the matrix phase. The use of bismuth facilitates the duplex casting process by which the tumi was made and forms an alloy of unusual color."

https://openalex.org/W2028755945,"Since the formation of COMSAT 20 years ago, the number of international telephone circuits made through satellites has grown 400 times and the cost of a telephone call has decreased by 12,000 percent. Worldwide communications linking 109 nations are achieved with 14 satellites in earth-synchronous orbit. Advances in microwave technology have expanded the transmission bandwidth per satellite from 50 to more than 3000 megahertz. Improvements in solar cell, battery, stationkeeping, and microwave amplification technology have increased satellite lifetime from 1.5 years to 10. The sixth generation of INTELSAT satellites, now being manufactured, will be introduced into the system in 1986, and each satellite will carry more than 40,000 telephone channels plus two television programs. The next generation of satellites, now under design for expanded capacity, will be needed by the middle 1990's to meet the traffic demand. These satellites are likely to add new frequencies (20 and 30 gigahertz), onboard signal processing and switching, and more bandwidth-efficient modulation, to achieve larger communication capacity at each orbital location."
