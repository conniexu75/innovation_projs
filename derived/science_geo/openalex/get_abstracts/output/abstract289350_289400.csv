Although a wealth of new information on the dynamics of the earth has been discovered, the inner core offers the greatest surprise: it appears to be anisotropic with the axis of symmetry aligned with the axis of rotation."

Useful traits such as resistance to disease, insects, and stress have been transferred to crop varieties from noncultivated plants. Recombinant DNA methods greatly extend (even outside the plant kingdom) the sources from which genetic information can be obtained for crop improvement. Gene transfer systems based on recombinant DNA are available for several crop species and are under development for others. The concerted use of traditional and more recent methods for plant genetic manipulation will contribute to crop improvement."

https://openalex.org/W2084485728,"La2CuO4-y ceramics containing a few percent of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ ions have been prepared. Resistivity and susceptibility measurements exhibit superconductive onsets (as in earlier Ba2+-containing samples). The onset temperature La2CuO4-y with Sr2+ is higher and its superconductivity-induced diamagnetism larger than that found with Ba2+ and Ca2+. This is proof that the electronic change resulting from alkaline earthdoping, rather than the size effect, is responsible for superconductivity. The ionic radius of Sr2+ is close to that of La3+ for which it presumably substitutes."

https://openalex.org/W2055892018,"A study of vertebrae of extinct giant marine lizards showed the presence of avascular necrosis in two of the three most common genera of these mosasaurs, Platecarpus and Tylosaurus. This bone disease was invariably present (involving 5 to 66% of vertebrae) in these genera, but absent in a third genus Clidastes. Differential occurrence of avascular necrosis may be related to decompression syndrome, suggesting different habitat and diving habits of the respective genera."

https://openalex.org/W2129162711,"The phonon density of states of the geophysically important mineral forsterite has been calculated with a rigid-ion model, which gives good agreement with an experimental measurement by inelastic neutron scattering. The density of states has been used to calculate the specific heat as a function of temperature, the results of which are in excellent agreement with calorimetrically measured values. The rigid-ion model takes account of the interatomic interactions and normal modes of vibration on a detailed microscopic basis, and is therefore more realistic than the Debye and other empirical models used previously."
https://openalex.org/W2085890019,"Surveys of chairpersons and faculty members of engineering departments of U.S. universities were conducted in the fall of 1985 to examine the relation between the high proportion of foreign graduate students and the operation and quality of engineering education in the United States. Information was obtained on admissions criteria and policies, financial aid, and the performance of U.S. and foreign students as teaching and research assistants. Overall, the survey respondents believed that foreign students are an asset and that, without them, training and research would suffer. Language and communications were the problems most frequently mentioned as adversely affecting the performance of foreign students."

https://openalex.org/W2073356059,"During a survey of the Velence Mountains in Hungary the authors developed a direct approximating method for use in determining the radioactive content of rocks by means of a Geiger-Mueller counter. The calibration method used is outlined and the calibration obtained can be expressed by the following approximate numerical formula: c = 2.4 . 10/sup -5/ J/LD, where c is the concentration in g-Th-equivalents/g of rock; J, the counting rate (in min); L the length; and D the diameter (in cm) of the brass cathode of the counter tube. Similarly the concentration in g-U-equivalents/g of rock can be expressed by the approximate numerical formula: c = 1.4 . 10/sup -5/ J/LD. The use of the following roughly approximating simple rule may be suggested for uranium explorers when extended territories must be surveyed within a short time: if a G-M counter of any commercial dimensions, shielded by 2 mm of lead, is placed against the rock wall and the observed counting rate (minus cosmic radiation) is x times the rate of cosmic radiation for the same counter, then the average U concentration in the rock is x times 25 g U/metric ton (1,000 kg) of rock."

https://openalex.org/W4230051796,"In Mark Crawford's article ""Genentech sues FDA on growth hormone"" (News & Comment, 20 Mar., p. 1454), antibody response that occurs in some patients using Protropin was incorrectly portrayed as the result of the product's 192nd amino acid-a methionyl. While the methionyl may be involved in the antibody responses of a limited number of Protropin users, there is evidence that antibody formation is a result of a number of factors. In particular, the precise details of the manufacturing process appear to be the major factor in determining the antigenicity of growth hormone preparations."
