https://openalex.org/W2166717297,"Mutation-induced recessive alleles (mlo) of the barley Mlo locus confer a leaf lesion phenotype and broad spectrum resistance to the fungal pathogen, Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei. The gene has been isolated using a positional cloning approach. Analysis of 11 mutagen-induced mlo alleles revealed mutations leading in each case to alterations of the deduced Mlo wild-type amino acid sequence. Susceptible intragenic recombinants, isolated from mlo heteroallelic crosses, show restored Mlo wild-type sequences. The deduced 60 kDa protein is predicted to be membrane-anchored by at least six membrane-spanning helices. The findings are compatible with a dual negative control function of the Mlo protein in leaf cell death and in the onset of pathogen defense; absence of Mlo primes the responsiveness for the onset of multiple defense functions."

https://openalex.org/W2001828972,"The chromosomes of lower eukaryotes have short telomeric 3' extensions. Using a primer-extension/nick-translation technique and nondenaturing hybridization, we find long 3' G-rich tails at human chromosome ends in mortal primary fibroblasts, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and leukocytes, as well as in immortalized fibroblasts. For all cells tested, >80% of the telomeres have long G-rich overhangs, averaging 130-210 bases in length, in disagreement with the conventional model for incomplete lagging-strand replication, which predicts overhangs on 50% of the chromosome ends. The observed G tails must exist during most of the cell cycle and probably result from degradation of both chromosome ends. The average lengths of the G tails are quantitatively consistent with the observed rates of human chromosome shortening."

The 3′UTR of lin-28 contains a conserved element that is complementary to the 22 nt regulatory RNA product of lin-4 and that resembles seven such elements in the 3′UTR of the heterochronic gene lin-14. Both lin-4 activity and the lin-4-complementary element (LCE) are necessary for stage-specific regulation of lin-28. Deleting the LCE produces a dominant gain-of-function allele that causes a retarded phenotype, indicating that lin-28 activity is a switch that controls choices of stage-specific fates."

https://openalex.org/W2047386729,"Arabidopsis Isd1 mutants are hyperresponsive to cell death initiators and fail to limit the extent of cell death. Superoxide is a necessary and sufficient signal for cell death propagation. Thus, LSD1 monitors a superoxide-dependent signal and negatively regulates a plant cell death pathway. We isolated LSD1 via its map position. The predicted LSD1 protein contains three zinc finger domains, defined by CxxCxRxxLMYxxGASxVxCxxC. These domains are present in three additional Arabidopsis genes, suggesting that LSD1 defines a zinc finger protein subclass. LSD1 is constitutively expressed, consistent with the mutant phenotype. Alternate splicing gives rise to a low abundance mRNA encoding an extra five amino-terminal amino acids. We propose that LSD1 regulates transcription, via either repression of a prodeath pathway or activation of an antideath pathway, in response to signals emanating from cells undergoing pathogen-induced hypersensitive cell death."

https://openalex.org/W1970424369,"The Ras proto-oncogene is a central component of mitogenic signal-transduction pathways, and is essential for cells both to leave a quiescent state (G0) and to pass through the G1/S transition of the cell cycle1–6. The mechanism by which Ras signalling regulates cell-cycle progression is unclear, however. Here we report that the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb), a regulator of G1 exit7, functionally links Ras to passage through the G1 phase. Inactivation of Ras in cycling cells caused a decline in cyclin D1 protein levels, accumulation of the hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive form of Rb, and G1 arrest. When Rb was disrupted either genetically or biochemically, cells failed to arrest in G1 following Ras inactivation. In contrast, inactivation of Ras in quiescent cells prevented growth-factor induction of both immediate-early gene transcription and exit from G0 in an Rb-independent manner. These data suggest that Rb is an essential G1-specific mediator that links Ras-dependent mitogenic signalling to cell-cycle regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2112908406,"To investigate chromosome segregation in B. subtilis, we introduced tandem copies of the lactose operon operator into the chromosome near the replication origin or terminus. We then visualized the position of the operator cassettes with green fluorescent protein fused to the Lac1 repressor. In sporulating bacteria, which undergo asymmetric cell division, origins localized near each pole of the cell whereas termini were restricted to the middle. In growing cells, which undergo binary fission, origins were observed at various positions but preferentially toward the poles early in the cell cycle. In contrast, termini showed little preference for the poles. These results indicate the existence of a mitotic-like apparatus that is responsible for moving the origin regions of newly formed chromosomes toward opposite ends of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2079683161,"T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) on mature T cells react with peptide antigens presented by self-MHC proteins and also frequently cross-react with foreign MHC proteins. The fundamental question whether MHC reactivity is inherent in the germline TCR sequences or is imposed by thymic selection was addressed here by inducing nonselective maturation of immature thymocytes in the absence of MHC molecules. MHC reactivity in the preselection repertoire is very high, but no higher than in the normal repertoire. Cross-reactivity of clones with multiple MHC molecules occurred to a similar extent in the preselection and MHC-selected repertoires. The results establish the MHC reactivity of the germline TCR repertoire, indicate the minimum fraction of immature thymocytes that must undergo negative selection, and suggest that some TCR-MHC contacts may be conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1983937258,"In the bacterium C. crescentus, the cellular homologs of plasmid partitioning proteins, ParA and ParB, localize to both poles of the predivisional cell following the completion of DNA replication. ParB binds to DNA sequences adjacent to the origin of replication suggesting that this region of the genome is tethered to the poles of the cell at a specific time in the cell cycle. Increasing the cellular levels of ParA and ParB disrupts polar localization and results in defects in both cell division and chromosome partitioning. These results suggest that ParA and ParB are involved in partitioning newly replicated chromosomes to the poles of the predivisional cell and may function as components of a bacterial mitotic apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2061643883,"HeT-A elements are non–long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons found in head-to-tail arrays on Drosophila chromosome ends, where they form telomeres. We report that HeT-A promoter activity is located in the 3′ end of the element, unlike the 5′ location seen for other non-LTR retrotransposons. In HeT-A arrays the 3′ sequence of one element directs transcription of its downstream neighbor. Because the upstream promoter has the same sequence as the 3′ end of the transcribed element, the HeT-A promoter is effectively equivalent to a 5′ LTR in both structure and function. Retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons have their promoters and transcription initiation sites in their 5′ LTRs. Thus HeT-A appears to have the structure of an evolutionary intermediate between non-LTR and LTR retrotransposons."

https://openalex.org/W2018924496,"The human La antigen is an RNA-binding protein that facilitates transcriptional termination and reinitiation by RNA polymerase III. Native La protein fractionates into transcriptionally active and inactive forms that are unphosphorylated and phosphorylated at serine 366, respectively, as determined by enzymatic and mass spectrometric analyses. Serine 366 comprises a casein kinase II phosphorylation site that resides within a conserved region in the La proteins from several species. RNA synthesis from isolated transcription complexes is inhibited by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of La serine 366 and is reversible by dephosphorylation. This work demonstrates a novel mechanism of transcriptional control at the level of recycling of stable transcription complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2079763953,"Nucleocapsid p7 (NCp7) proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contain two zinc binding domains of the sequence Cys-(X)2-Cys-(X)4-His-(X)4-Cys (CCHC)1,2. The spacing pattern and metal-chelating residues (3 Cys, 1 His) of these nucleocapsid CCHC zinc fingers are highly conserved among retroviruses1,3,4. These CCHC domains are required during both the early5,6 and late7,8 phases of retroviral replication, making them attractive targets for antiviral agents. Toward that end, we have identified a number of antiviral chemotypes that electrophilically attack the sulfur atoms of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues of the domains9–14. Such nucleocapsid inhibitors were directly virucidal by preventing the initiation of reverse transcription15 and blocked formation of infectious virus from cells through modification of CCHC domains within Gag precursors16. Herein we report that azodicarbonamide (ADA) represents a new compound that inhibits HIV-1 and a broad range of retroviruses by targeting the the nucleocapsid CCHC domains. Vandevelde et al. 17 also recently disclosed that ADA inhibits HIV-1 infection via an unidentified mechanism and that ADA was introduced into Phase I/II clinical trials in Europe for advanced AIDS. These studies distinguish ADA as the first known nucleocapsid inhibitor to progress to human trials and provide a lead compound for drug optimization."
