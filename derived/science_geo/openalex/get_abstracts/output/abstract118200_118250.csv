https://openalex.org/W2023396505,"Prostate cancer can be detected using assays for blood-borne prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is the clinically most useful diagnostic marker of malignant disease. This paper characterizes the 5′-flanking prostate-specific enhancer which controls expression of the human PSA gene This enhancer, located between −5824 and −3738, is androgen-responsive and requires a promoter for activity. Inductions of 12-100-fold activity occur at 1 nM concentrations of the testosterone analog R1881. The enhancer demonstrated tissue specificity as judged by transfections of several human cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays comparing nuclear extracts from breast cancer cells MCF-7, and prostate cancer cells LNCaP, showed three regions of prostate-specific binding. These three regions are −4168 to −4797 (region I), −4710 to 4479 (region II), and −4168 to −3801 (region III). Region III contained a putative androgen response element at −4136 that markedly affected activity if mutated. These data suggest that prostate-specific gene expression may involve interaction of prostate-specific proteins or protein complexes with the enhancer in addition to binding of the androgen receptor to androgen response elements."
https://openalex.org/W1983091538,"Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is expressed in alveolar Type II epithelial cells of the lung. In order to determine the mechanism(s) that regulate gene transcription, we have analyzed the activation of the murine SP-C promoter in mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE cells) and in HeLa cells after co-transfection with a vector expressing rat thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). TTF-1 transactivated SP-C-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs containing −13 kilobase pairs to −320 base pairs (bp) of the 5′ flanking region of the SP-C gene. Essential cis-acting elements were functionally localized to between −320 and −180 bp from the start of transcription by transfection analysis. Five DNase-protected regions, indicating multiple protein-DNA interactions within the −320 bp TTF-1-responsive region of the SP-C gene, were identified by DNase footprint analysis. A 40-bp segment of SP-C DNA from −197 to −158 linked to a heterologous promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct activated expression after co-transfection with CMV-TTF-1 in HeLa and MLE cells. The −197 to −158 segment contained two consensus TTF-1 sites, which were specifically identified as TTF-1 binding sites by gel retardation and antibody supershift with MLE cell nuclear extracts and purified TTF-1 homeodomain protein. Site-specific mutagenesis of either of the TTF-1 binding sites completely blocked activation by TTF-1, indicating both sites are required for TTF stimulation of SP-C transcription."

Several antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, identified by monoclonal antibodies, have been cloned and are being exploited in the development of improved vaccines and diagnostic reagents. We have expressed and purified the 16-kDa antigen, an immunodominant antigen with serodiagnostic value, which has been previously cloned and shown to share low sequence homology with the α-crystallin-related small heat shock protein family. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering demonstrate the formation of a specific oligomer, 149 ± 8 kDa, consisting of approximately nine monomers. In 4 M urea, a smaller oligomer of 47 ± 6 kDa (or trimer) is produced. Analysis by electron cryomicroscopy reveals a triangular shaped oligomeric structure arising from the presence of three subparticles or globules. Taken together, the data suggest an antigen complex structure of a trimer of trimers. This antigen, independent of ATP addition, effectively suppresses the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase at 40°C, indicating that it can function as a molecular chaperone in vitro. A complex between the antigen and heat-denatured citrate synthase can be detected and isolated using high performance liquid chromatography. We propose to rename the 16-kDa antigen Hsp16.3 to be consistent with other members of the small heat shock protein family.

We analyzed this dual incision reaction at a single 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG)-cisplatin cross-link in a closed circular duplex DNA substrate. Incisions were formed in the DNA with human cell extracts in which DNA repair synthesis was inhibited. The nicks were mapped by restriction fragment end labeling and primer extension analysis. Principal sites of cleavage were identified at the 9th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion and at the 16th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the lesion. The predominant product was found to be a 26-mer platinated oligonucleotide by hybridization to a 32P-labeled complementary DNA probe. Oligonucleotides were formed at the same rate as the 3′ cleavage, suggesting that both incisions are made in a near-synchronous manner. There was, however, a low frequency of 5′ incisions in the absence of 3′ cleavage. The dual incision reaction was reconstituted using the purified mammalian proteins XPA, RPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and a fraction containing ERCC1-XPF and IF7.

https://openalex.org/W1559650040,"Lysyl oxidase is secreted from fibrogenic cells as a 50-kDa proenzyme that is proteolytically processed to the mature enzyme in the extracellular space. To characterize the secreted proteinase activity, a truncated, recombinant form of lysyl oxidase was prepared as a proteinase substrate containing the sequence of the propeptide cleavage region. The processing proteinase activity secreted by cultured fibrogenic cells resists inhibitors of serine or aspartyl proteinases as well as tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) but is completely inhibited by metal ion chelators. Known metalloproteinases were tested for their activity toward this substrate. Carboxyl-terminal procollagen proteinase (C-proteinase), MMP-2, and conditioned fibrogenic cell culture medium cleave the lysyl oxidase substrate to the size of the mature enzyme. The NH2-terminal sequence generated by arterial smooth muscle conditioned medium and the C-proteinase but not by MMP-2, i.e. Asp-Asp-Pro-Tyr, was identical to that previously identified in mature lysyl oxidase isolated from connective tissue. The C-proteinase activity against the model substrate was inhibited by a synthetic oligopeptide mimic of the cleavage sequence (Ac-Met-Val-Gly-Asp-Asp-Pro-Tyr-Asn-amide), whereas this peptide also inhibited the generation of lysyl oxidase activity in the medium of fetal rat lung fibroblasts in culture.

INTRODUCTIONLysyl oxidase (protein-lysine 6-oxidase, EC 1.4.3.13) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase that oxidatively deaminates the ϵ-amino group of specific peptidyl lysine and hydroxylysine residues of collagen and of lysine in elastin. The resultant peptidyl aldehydes can spontaneously condense with other vicinal peptidyl aldehydes or with unreacted ϵ-amino groups to form inter- and intramolecular cross-linkages stabilizing the fibrous forms of these connective tissue structural proteins(1.Kagan H.M. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 321-389Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that the inhibition of lysyl oxidase action toward collagen molecules results in the accumulation and ultimate proteolytic degradation of soluble collagen monomers, thus preventing the formation of insoluble collagen fibers(2.Vater C.A. Harris Jr., E.D. Siegel R.C. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The participation of this enzyme is critical, therefore, to the development and repair of structurally sound connective tissues as in the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems of the body.Recent studies of the pathway by which lysyl oxidase is produced in arterial smooth muscle cells revealed that the protein is translated as a 46-kDa preproenzyme. Following signal peptide cleavage, the proenzyme undergoes N-glycosylation apparently within the propeptide region, and the resulting 50-kDa proenzyme is then secreted into the extracellular space. The secreted proenzyme is then proteolytically converted to the functional catalyst derived from the COOH-terminal sequence of the proprotein(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the mature, functional catalyst, as isolated from various connective tissues, ranges from 28 to 32 kDa(1.Kagan H.M. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 321-389Google Scholar). The involvement of a proenzyme processing protease in the biosynthetic pathway of lysyl oxidase is of particular interest, because this may represent a previously unexpected extracellular mechanism for the regulation of the production of this cross-linking enzyme. In turn, such a protease could profoundly influence the rate and/or extent of connective tissue fiber formation. The nature of this proteolytic activity is explored in the present study.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and ImmunoprecipitationNeonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells were isolated from 2-3-day-old rat pups as described(4.Oakes B.W.

These arterial smooth muscle cells and lung fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM 1The abbreviations used are: DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRFL6rat fetal lung fibroblastsSMCneonatal rat smooth muscle cellsS4 cellsRS485 cells stably transfected with the lysyl oxidase expression vectorMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseMMP-1interstitial collagenaseMMP-3stromelysinMMP-992-kDa gelatinaseMMP-272-kDa gelatinaseC-proteinasecarboxyl-terminal procollagen proteinasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideFPfusion proteinTIMP-2tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2PAGEpolyacrylamyde gel electrophoresisHS peptideHS-CH2-CH(CH2-CH (CH3))2-CO-Phe-Ala-HH2. containing 3.7 g/l NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Smooth muscle cell cultures were used exclusively in first passage after 10-11 days of incubation, whereas RFL6 fibroblasts were used at confluency after 3-4 days of culture in passages 9-12. Smooth muscle cell cultures to be harvested for assay of lysyl oxidase activity or proteinase activity were cultured for 12 h.The precursor of lysyl oxidase was biosynthetically produced by RS485 cells, as described previously(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were derived from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by stable transfection with the Ha-ras oncogene(6.Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The resulting RS485 cell line was then stably cotransfected with the lysyl oxidase expression vector pSV40poly(A)COD and pSV2neo to yield the S4 cell line that secretes the 50-kDa lysyl oxidase precursor but does not process it to the mature enzyme(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in DMEM containing 4 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids. The S4 cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in the same medium lacking [35S]methionine and fetal bovine serum. The conditioned medium containing the 50-kDa glycosylated prolysyl oxidase was then used as a substrate for assay of prolysyl oxidase processing protease activity of conditioned smooth muscle cell medium. Following incubation of the S4 medium containing the 35S-labeled substrate with the conditioned medium as the source of proteinase activity, the reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-lysyl oxidase, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and autoradiography, as described(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolysyl oxidase was also biosynthetically labeled and prepared from RFL6 cells by these pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation procedures described for the S4 cells. Unlike the S4 cells, which secrete but do not process prolysyl oxidase, the RFL6 cells both secrete and proteolytically process the 50-kDa precursor to the 30-kDa mature enzyme. These cells accumulate readily assayed levels of lysyl oxidase activity in the medium to a greater extent than the smooth muscle cell cultures, thus facilitating the assessment of proenzyme activation. The RFL6 cells were used to assess the effect of a proteinase inhibitor on proenzyme processing during enzyme biosynthesis.Expression, Purification, Activation, and Assay of MetalloproteinasesMMP-2 and TIMP-2 were expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus mammalian cell expression system(8.Fridman R.

The cloning of human MMP-2 or TIMP-2 cDNAs into pTF7EMC-1, preparation of recombinant vaccinia viruses containing either MMP-2 or TIMP-2 cDNAs, and purification of recombinant proteins were performed as described(8.Fridman R.

Specific activity of the MMP-2 used here (kcat, 500 min-1) was assayed spectrophotometrically in a continuous assay with a synthetic thiopeptolide substrate (acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-S-Leu-Leu-Gly-OC2H5, where S-Leu is L-α-mercaptoisocaproic acid; (11.Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal.

ProMMPs were activated by incubation with 1 mM 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate following which excess 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate was removed by gel-filtration. Activities of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-1 were assayed according to Knight et al.(17.Knight C. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) with a coumarin-labeled synthetic peptide substrate: (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3-[2,4-dinitrophenyl]-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)-AlaArg-NH2. The specific activities were: 172, 2560, and 1000 pmol of substrate hydrolyzed μg-1 min-1 for MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-1, respectively.Procollagen C-ProteinaseProcollagen C-proteinase was a generous gift of Dr. Darwin Prockop. The enzyme (specific activity, 45,000 units mg-1) was purified from the conditioned medium of chick embryo tendon organ culture as described(18.Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall purification in the 6-step procedure was 30,000-fold, whereas the silver-stained pattern of the SDS-PAGE analysis showed one apparently pure major band of 102,000 kDa(18.Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of the enzyme that cleaves 1 μg of type I procollagen in 1 h in a reaction mixture containing 12 μg ml-1 of the type I procollagen substrate. The purified enzyme preparation catalyzed the specific cleavage of COOH-terminal propeptides from type I procollagen with no evidence of nonspecific degradation of either the COOH-terminal propeptides or the pNa-chains of type I procollagen. It is important to note that no procollagen N-proteinase activity was detected(18.Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Partial Purification of MMP-2 from Conditioned SMC MediumA 72-kDa gelatinase secreted by the cultured aorta smooth muscle cells was partially purified according to a method described earlier with modifications(19.Chen J.-M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Medium (100 ml) was collected from neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cell cultures that had been incubated for 18 h in serum-free DMEM and was precipitated at 4°C with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The suspension was sedimented at 4°C at 20,000 × g for 40 min, and the pellet was dissolved in 40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5 buffer and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35 overnight. The dialyzed solution was applied to a gelatin-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated with the same buffer. Unbound protein was completely eluted with the equilibrating buffer, and the column was then eluted with 7.5% Me2SO in this buffer. The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5.Assay of Lysyl Oxidase ActivityAliquots of conditioned medium of RFL-6 cells were assayed for lysyl oxidase activity against a tritium-labeled recombinant human tropoelastin substrate prepared and labeled with [4,5-3H]-L-lysine (100 Ci/mmol), as described(20.Bedell-Hogan D. Trackman P. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J. Kagan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10345-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays containing 420,000 dpm of tritiated substrate and conditioned medium (600 μl) were brought to a final volume of 800 μl with 50 mM sodium borate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.2, in the presence or the absence of 50 μM β-aminopropionitrile and were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Enzyme activities were expressed as β-aminopropionitrile-inhibitable cpm [3H]H2O formed per 2 h per 106 cells.Western Blot AnalysesProtein samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to Hybond-ECL (Amersham Corp.) nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was treated with 5% skim milk as the blocking reagent in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBS-T; Amersham Corp.) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit anti-lysyl oxidase in 0.5% blocking reagent in TBS-T for 1 h. After washes in TBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit second antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Corp.) followed by exposure to NEF-496 autoradiography film (DuPont NEN).NH2-terminal SequencingNH2-terminal sequences were obtained on protein bands that were isolated from SDS gel electrophoretograms and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane-bound samples were analyzed on an ABI 476A protein sequencing system utilizing Edman chemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine DNA/Protein Core Facility.Construction of the Fusion PlasmidThe full-length rat lysyl oxidase cDNA cloned as a SalI fragment in a Bluescript plasmid, pBSCOD, as described previously (21.Kagan H.M. Reddy V.B. Panchenko M. Narasimhan N. Boak A.M. Gacheru S.N. Thomas K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) has a BglI site after the signal peptide sequence and a BssHII site within a sequence coding for residues Arg134 and Arg135. pBSCOD was digested with a mixture of XhoI and BssHII, and the resulting 4067- and 500-base pair fragments were gel purified. Two additional BssHII sites flanking the lysyl oxidase cDNA in pBSCOD proved to be resistant to BssHII digestion. The 500-base pair fragment was cut with BglI and ligated to the 4067-base pair fragment combined with a mixture of the 8-mer (AGTCTAGA) and the 15-mer (CGCGTCTAGACTGCG) to fill in the BglI and BssHII sites to create an XbaI site. The ligation mixture was then cut with BssHII and transformed into DH5α competent E. coli cells. DNA was isolated from the resulting colonies and screened by double digestion with XbaI and SalI enzymes. The XbaI-SalI fragment was cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) containing cDNA encoding the maltose-binding protein whose terminal sequence contains a factor Xa cleavage site. The resulting plasmid, pMALc-232, was cloned in the DH5α host cells. The cells were grown in LB medium (Sigma) containing 2 g liter-1 glucose and 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin at room temperature to a A600nm of 0.4. The cells were then induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (0.3 mM), incubated overnight, and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4, quick frozen at −70°C, thawed, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was passed through an amylose-linked Sepharose affinity column and eluted with a maltose-containing buffer. The eluates were concentrated and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels.The expected 76-kDa fusion protein (based on the molecular masses of the 43-kDa maltose-binding protein, 0.7 kDa derived from the intervening residues encoded by the cDNA sequence linking the two proteins, and the truncated 32-kDa recombinant lysyl oxidase protein) was identified (band FP, Fig. 1). Close inspection of this band indicated that it represented two closely spaced bands at 76 ± 1 kDa, possibly reflecting the tendency of products expressed in this E. coli system to undergo some degree of proteolysis (New England BioLabs manual). A second band appearing at 65 kDa appeared to be a nonspecific, cross-reacting protein because preincubation of the polyclonal antibody with pure bovine aorta lysyl oxidase did not reduce its appearance in Western blots. In contrast to the fusion protein at 76 ± 1 kDa, this cross-reacting band was not affected by any of the protease treatments used in this study, and its presence did not influence the conclusions of this study. Moreover, attempts at purifying the antibody fraction from the polyclonal rabbit serum did not eliminate the reactivity with this band. The 76-kDa fusion protein preparation was cleaved by factor Xa to produce a 43- and a 33-kDa protein, indicating that the factor Xa Arg-Ile cleavage site within the intervening sequence of the fusion protein is accessible to this protease (not shown).Incubation of the affinity purified fusion protein (Fig. 1, lane 1) with conditioned smooth muscle cell medium resulted in the proteolytic conversion of the 76-kDa fusion protein into 30- and 46-kDa fragments (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). This reaction can be assayed with this substrate simply by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands resolved by SDS-PAGE without the need for isotopic labeling of the precursor, because of the relative purity and greater quantities of the protease substrate (not shown). The 46-kDa fragment reacted with a polyclonal antibody specific for the maltose-binding protein (MBP, lane 3) (New England Biolabs) but did not react with polyclonal anti-lysyl oxidase as observed by Western blotting (lane 2). The 30-kDa band reacted with anti-lysyl oxidase but not with the anti-maltose-binding serum (LO, lane 2).Peptide InhibitorsThe thiol-based peptide inhibitor of the MMP family, HS-CH2-CH(CH2-CH(CH3)2)-CO-Phe-Ala-NH2, and its S-acetylated derivative were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). The acetyl-Met-Val-Gly-Asp-Asp-Pro-Tyr-Asn-amide peptide supplied by QCB, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA) was synthesized by solid phase peptide chemistry and purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography. The NH2- and COOH-terminal residues of this peptide were derivatized by acetylation and amidation, respectively, by QCB, Inc.RESULTSProcessing Activity in Conditioned Smooth Muscle Cell MediumAs previously demonstrated, the S4 cell line secretes the 50-kDa precursor form of lysyl oxidase but does not process it to the smaller, mature enzyme. Consistent with the latent nature of the proenzyme, lysyl oxidase activity is not detectable in the conditioned S4 cell medium(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these cells were used to obtain an isotopically labeled form of the proenzyme for the assay of the proenzyme processing protease activity secreted into the medium by cultured neonatal aortic smooth muscle cells. S4 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine; the conditioned medium was decanted and incubated with the conditioned medium obtained from neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells cultured for 18 h in serum-free DMEM. Following 3 h of incubation at 37°C, the reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antilysyl oxidase. As shown (Fig. 2, lane 1), the 35S-labeled 50-kDa band corresponds to the precursor species of lysyl oxidase(3.Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation with the native, cell-free conditioned medium of the SMC cultures results in the conversion of the 50-kDa species to a product migrating as a 30-kDa species, consistent with the mature enzyme (lane 2). Preincubation of the antibody with excess lysyl oxidase purified from bovine aorta prevents the appearance of both the 30- and 50-kDa species in the immunoprecipitates of the reaction mixtures, indicating their immunological identity with lysyl oxidase (not shown). Prior heat inactivation (100°C for 10 min) of the conditioned SMC medium prevents the conversion of the 50-kDa species to the 30-kDa species (lane 3). The presence of PMSF (lane 4) or aprotinin (lane 5), inhibitors of serine proteases, does not inhibit this conversion. In contrast, the presence of 1 mM EDTA in the incubation mixture prevents the cleavage (lane 6).Figure 2:Effect of smooth muscle cell protease activity against prolysyl oxidase substrate of S4 cells. Conditioned medium (3 ml) of S-4 cells labeled in culture with [35S]methionine was incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 3 ml of nonlabeled medium conditioned by SMC. The reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated by anti-lysyl oxidase and resolved by SDS-PAGE (see “Materials and Methods”). S4 substrate incubated with: control (nonconditioned SMC medium, lane 1); conditioned SMC medium (lane 2); heat-denatured (100°C, 5 min) conditioned SMC medium (lane 3); conditioned SMC medium in the presence of 0.2 mM PMSF (lane 4), 2 μg/ml of aprotinin (lane 6), or 5 mM EDTA (lane 6). LO, lysyl oxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the course of these studies, it became apparent that the availability of larger quantities of a more conveniently prepared substrate for the assay of the SMC protease was desirable. For that purpose, a recombinant 76-kDa protein was expressed in E. coli consisting of maltose-binding protein fused to that portion of the lysyl oxidase proenzyme suspected to contain the proprotein proteolytic processing sites contiguous with the remaining COOH-terminal sequence representing the mature portion of lysyl oxidase (Fig. 1; also see Fig. 8 and “Discussion”). The presence of the maltose-binding domain within this fusion protein permitted the facile purification of this product from the bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 3, the cleavage of the fusion protein by SMC medium was not prevented by inhibitors of serine (PMSF and aprotinin), thiol (leupeptin), or acid proteases (pepstatin) but was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, and prior heat inactivation of the SMC medium, consistent with the results presented in Fig. 2. It is important to note that Western blot analysis of the conditioned smooth muscle cell medium alone did not reveal the presence of lysyl oxidase protein bands, consistent with our repeated observations that lysyl oxidase produced by these cells in culture associates predominantly with the insoluble cell layer/matrix fraction. The results presented at Figure 2:, Figure 3: indicate that full-length or truncated recombinant precursor forms of lysyl oxidase prepared in mammalian or bacterial cells, respectively, can be cleaved to the same apparent size by the SMC-conditioned medium and that the conversion of the proprotein to the mature enzyme species is catalyzed by a heat-labile secreted metalloproteinase.Figure 8:Predicted amino acid sequences of preprolysyl oxidase of different species.

Cholesterol absorption results were similar between the control and cholesterol esterase-null mice regardless of whether the animals were fed a low fat diet or a high fat/high cholesterol diet. The rate of [3H]cholesterol appearance in the serum of the gene-targeted mice paralleled that observed in control animals. In contrast to these results, when experiments were performed with [3H]cholesteryl oleate instead of [3H]cholesterol, a higher amount of the 3H radiolabel was found excreted in feces and dramatically less of the radiolabel was detected in the serum of the cholesterol esterase-null mice in comparison with that detected in control animals. Serum cholesterol levels were not significantly different between control and cholesterol esterase-null mice fed either control or an atherogenic diet.

Here, we report isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) from Arabidopsis using biotinylated calmodulin as a probe. Calcium-dependent binding of the cDNA-encoded protein to calmodulin is confirmed by 35S-labeled calmodulin. Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA indicates that it codes for a protein of 1261 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the KCBP has a domain of about 340 amino acids in the COOH terminus that shows significant sequence similarity with the motor domain of kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins and contains ATP and microtubule binding sites typical of these proteins. Outside the motor domain, the KCBP has no sequence similarity with any of the known kinesins, but contains a globular domain in the NH2 terminus and a putative coiled-coil region in the middle. By analyzing the calmodulin binding activity of truncated proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, the calmodulin binding region is mapped to a stretch of about 50 amino acid residues in the COOH terminus region of the protein. Using a synthetic peptide, the calmodulin binding domain is further narrowed down to a 23-amino acid stretch. The synthetic peptide binds to calmodulin with high affinity in a calcium-dependent manner as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assay of calmodulin-peptide complex.

https://openalex.org/W1966434597,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are covalently modified by lipids. Myristoylation of G-protein α subunits and prenylation of γ subunits are stable modifications. In contrast, palmitoylation of α subunits is dynamic and thus has the potential for regulating protein function. Indeed, receptor activation of G<sub>s</sub> increases palmitate turnover on the α subunit, presumably by stimulating deacylation. The enzymes that catalyze reversible palmitoylation of G-protein α subunits have not been characterized. Here we report the identification of a palmitoyl-CoA:protein <i>S</i>-palmitoyltransferase activity that acylates G-protein α subunits <i>in vitro</i>. Palmitoyltransferase activity is membrane-associated and requires detergent for solubilization. The preferred G-protein substrate for the enzyme activity is the α subunit in the context of the heterotrimer. Both myristoylated and nonmyristoylated G-protein α subunits are recognized as substrates. The palmitoyltransferase activity demonstrates a modest preference for palmitoyl-CoA over other fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Palmitoyltransferase activity is high in plasma membrane and present at low or undetectable levels in Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria of rat liver. The subcellular localization of this enzyme activity is consistent with a role for regulated cycles of acylation and deacylation accompanying activation of G-protein signal transduction pathways."

Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography of tryptic digests of 32P-labeled recombinant cPLA2 showed four major peaks of radiolabeled phosphopeptides. The phosphorylated residues were identified as Ser-437, Ser-454, Ser-505, and Ser-727 using mass spectrometry and automated Edman sequencing. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus expressing cPLA2 exhibited a time-dependent release of arachidonic acid in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 or the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, which was not observed in Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus. Stimulation of Sf9 cells with A23187 and okadaic acid also increased the level of phosphorylation of cPLA2. Okadaic acid, but not A23187, induced a gel shift of cPLA2 and increased the level of phosphorylation of Ser-727 by 4.5-fold, whereas the level of phosphorylation of the other sites increased by 60% or less in response to both agonists. To determine whether the same sites on cPLA2 were phosphorylated in mammalian cells, human monocytes were studied.

Comparison of two-dimensional peptide maps of tryptic digests of 32P-labeled recombinant cPLA2 and human monocyte cPLA2 demonstrated that the same peptides on cPLA2 were phosphorylated in mammalian cells as in insect cells. These results show that the Sf9-baculovirus expression system is useful for investigation of the phosphorylation sites on cPLA2.

In stimulated macrophages, platelets, fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, phosphorylation of cPLA2 occurs exclusively on serine residues(1.Lin L.-L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Evidence for a role for MAP kinase in cPLA2 phosphorylation and activation has been provided in transfection studies showing that agonist-stimulated arachidonic acid release is diminished in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing cPLA2 that has been mutated at Ser-505 compared with arachidonic acid release that is seen in cells overexpressing the wild-type enzyme(21.Lin L.-L.

Although a role for MAP kinase phosphorylation of cPLA2 is implicated, analysis of two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of 32P-labeled cPLA2 from stimulated macrophages suggests that this enzyme is phosphorylated on multiple sites and that several of these sites show increased phosphorylation after cell stimulation(13.Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Identification of the phosphorylation sites on cPLA2 is important for understanding its mechanisms of regulation. To identify the phosphorylation sites, we have taken advantage of the baculovirus expression system in which we have previously demonstrated that cPLA2 is expressed as a phosphoprotein and from which large amounts of cPLA2 can be obtained(24.de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been observed that the sites that are phosphorylated on proteins expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and mammalian cells are often the same(25.MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Kozma S.C. McGlynn E. Siegmann M. Reinhard C. Ferrari S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7134-7138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report has demonstrated that cPLA2 is phosphorylated on Ser-505 when expressed in insect cells(27.Abdullah K. Cromlish W.A. Payette P. Laliberté F. Huang Z. Street I. Kennedy B.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing cPLA2 can be induced to release arachidonic acid in response to the agonists calcium ionophore A23187 and the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid and that this functional response in okadaic acid-treated cells correlates with increased phosphorylation of a novel site on cPLA2. Evidence is also presented demonstrating that the sites phosphorylated on cPLA2 in infected Sf9 cells also occur on cPLA2 in human monocytes. Grace's supplemented phosphate-free medium and RPMI 1640 phosphate-free medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. RPMI 1640 medium and calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). Sequencing grade, modified trypsin was from Promega. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid (8,500-9,000 Ci/mmol) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (100 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. LPS was from List Biological Labs (Campbell, CA). Okadaic acid and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were from LC Services Co. (Woburn, MA). Zymosan, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, and A23187 were from Sigma. Human serum albumin (HSA) was obtained from Intergen Co. (Purchase, NY). Prior to use as a stimulus the zymosan was suspended in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and boiled for 10 min, followed by centrifugation. After resuspension in PBS, the boiling procedure was repeated two more times. For preparation of opsonized zymosan, the zymosan was incubated with a 1:1 dilution of human serum in 0.9% saline solution for 30 min at 37°C and washed once with PBS before final resuspension in PBS. Sf9 cells were grown and infected with either wild-type Autographa californica multiply enveloped nuclear polyhedrosis virus (wild-type virus) or recombinant A. californica multiply enveloped nuclear polyhedrosis virus expressing cPLA2 (recombinant virus) as described previously(24.de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell manipulations were performed at 65-70 h postinfection unless otherwise indicated. Human mononuclear cells were purified from healthy donors on plasma/Percoll gradients(28.Leslie C.C. Detty D.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mononuclear cells were washed in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and then plated at 5 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After 1 h adherent cells were vigorously rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove nonadherent lymphocytes, and then 1 ml of RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.29 mg/ml glutamine was added. Approximately 15% of the cells initially seeded adhered to the culture dish as determined by the number of nuclei/well using a Coulter counter. Sf9 cells plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plates in 1.0 ml of Grace's supplemented medium containing 10% FBS were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) for 18 h. The cells were rinsed three times with Grace's supplemented medium containing 0.1% HSA to remove unincorporated arachidonic acid and then stimulated in Grace's supplemented medium containing 0.1% HSA with okadaic acid (1 μM) or A23187 (0.5 μg/ml). After stimulation, the medium was removed and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min. The cells were scraped into 1 ml of calcium- and magnesium-free PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The amount of radioactivity in the cells and media was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Human monocytes were allowed to adhere for 4 h and then labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (0.25 μCi/ml) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.29 mg/ml glutamine. After 16 h the cells were rinsed three times with RPMI 1640 containing 0.25% HSA. Cells were stimulated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 0.25% HSA with PMA (500 nM), A23187 (0.5 μg/ml), okadaic acid (1 μM), opsonized zymosan (60 particles/cell) or LPS (1 μg/ml). After stimulation, the medium was removed and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min. The cells were scraped into 1 ml of calcium- and magnesium-free PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The amount of radioactivity in the cells and media was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. At 20 h postinfection, Sf9 cells plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/25 cm2 flask were labeled for 48 h with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.5 mCi/ml) in 2.5 ml of Grace's supplemented, phosphate-free medium containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. The labeling medium was removed, and Grace's supplemented phosphate-free medium containing 0.1% HSA was added. For stimulation, okadaic acid (1 μM) or A23187 (0.5 μg/ml) dissolved in Me2SO was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 27°C. Controls were incubated with Me2SO alone. After stimulation, the medium was removed from the cells and replaced with lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 3 μMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was precleared with preimmune serum-coated protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and 32P-labeled cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated from the Sf9 cell lysates, as described below. For 32P labeling the mononuclear cells were plated at 70 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, as above, allowed to adhere for 4 h, and then the monolayer was washed three times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640. The cells were labeled overnight with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (1 mCi/dish) in 5 ml of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.29 mg/ml glutamine. Stimulants were added to the labeling medium for 2 h. The cells were rinsed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and scraped into lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged, and the 32P-labeled cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated from the monocyte cell lysates, as described below. To 30 μg of cPLA2 in 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 140 μM ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), pH 8.0, was added 60 ng of recombinant MAP kinase (obtained as a generous gift from Prof. E. Krebs, University of Washington), and the mixture was incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature. Radiolabeled cPLA2 was submitted to electrophoresis on a Laemmli gel, and the protein was eluted from the gel and digested with trypsin as described below. The digest was submitted to HPLC (218TP52 column) as described below, and fractions containing cpm in the peak 4 region (see Fig. 4) were pooled. Most of the solvent was removed in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments), and half of the sample was submitted to two-dimensional peptide mapping. The remaining half was concentrated to dryness in a Speed-Vac, and the residue was oxidized with 30 μl of performic acid reagent, diluted with 50 μl of water, and lyophilized as described (29.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The oxidized peptide was dissolved in 5 μl of glacial acetic acid, and the sample was submitted to two-dimensional peptide mapping. Sf9 and monocyte cell lysates were incubated with polyclonal antiserum(11683) generated as described previously against recombinant cPLA2 at either a 1:7.5 or a 1:500 dilution, respectively, for 16 h at 4°C(24.de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and the mixture tumbled for 2 h at 4°C. The cPLA2 was recovered by centrifugation at 4°C. The beads were washed five times in lysis buffer and then boiled in 2 × Laemmli buffer containing 40 mM dithiothreitol(30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The eluted cPLA2 was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was dried, and the cPLA2 band was visualized by autoradiography. 32P-Labeled cPLA2 was excised from dehydrated SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and two to three gel pieces were homogenized in 1.2 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.08% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (elution buffer). The samples were boiled for 5 min and then tumbled for 16 h at room temperature. Gel pieces were separated from eluant by centrifugation, another 300 μl of elution buffer was added to the gel pellet, and the sample was rocked 2 h at room temperature. The second eluant was collected by centrifugation, combined with the first, and the volume per tube was reduced in a Speed-Vac to 200 μl. The amount of cPLA2 recovered from Sf9 cell lysates was estimated by comparison with known amounts of purified recombinant cPLA2 (determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm) on Coomassie-stained, SDS-polyacrylamide gels(24.de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlabeled recombinant cPLA2 (5 μg) was added to monocyte samples as carrier protein. The cPLA2 was precipitated from elution buffer by the addition of 30 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were incubated on ice for 2 h, the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 min at 4°C, washed two times with ice-cold acetone by centrifugation as above, and the residual acetone was removed with a stream of N2. Based on Cerenkov counting, the yield of precipitated cPLA2 was greater than 90%. The precipitate was resuspended in 200 μl of freshly made 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8-8.2, and trypsin was added at a trypsin:cPLA2 ratio of 1:10 by weight. The samples were incubated for 3 h at 37°C and then stored at −20°C. The amount of trypsin in the stock solution was assayed each time it was used. A tube containing 20 μg of lyophilized trypsin, as supplied by Promega, was hydrated with 100 μl of Promega trypsin dilution buffer. One ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.6, was placed in a cuvette, and 4.8 μl of benzoyl-arginine ethyl ester solution (100 mM) was added. The cuvette was placed in the thermostatted holder of the spectrophotometer, and the absorbance at 253 nm was recorded at 29°C until the base line was flat. Three μl of trypsin solution was added to the assay, and the absorbance at 253 nm was monitored for several minutes. The typical response from this 0.6-μg portion of trypsin was 0.036 absorbance/min, and this specific activity was used to determine the amount of trypsin in other stock solutions. Trypsin stock solutions were stored at −20°C, and working solutions were kept at 4°C for no more than a few hours. Cerenkov counting revealed that greater than 90% of the cpm became solubilized following proteolysis. Ammonium bicarbonate buffer was removed from the tryptic digests by the addition of 500 μl of water, and then the sample was dried in a Speed-Vac. Water was added again, and the process was repeated two more times. The sample was then resuspended in glacial acetic acid or buffer 1, pH 1.9 (acetic acid, 88% formic acid, H2O) (78:25:897, v/v/v). The sample was subjected to thin layer electrophoresis on 20 × 20-cm Kodak cellulose thin layer chromatography plates. Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed at 1,400 V for 20 min in ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.9 (10 g of ammonium carbonate/liter), using a Hunter Thin Layer Peptide Mapping System (CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA). The plate was air dried at room temperature overnight and then subjected to ascending chromatography in isobutyric acid:pyridine:acetic acid:butanol:H2O (65:5:3:2:29, v/v/v/v). The plate was then air dried and subjected to autoradiography. A tryptic digest of immunoprecipitated cPLA2 was digested in 100 μl of 6N HCl for 1 h at 110°C. The HCl was removed in a Speed-Vac, and the pellet was redissolved in buffer 1, pH 1.9. A mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (5 μg of each) was added. The samples were analyzed by ascending chromatography on Merck 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer chromatography plates with butanol:acetic acid:ethanol:H2O (1:1:1:1, v/v/v/v)(18.Kramer R.M.

Phosphoamino acids were visualized by spraying the plates with a solution of 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone (w/v), and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were identified by autoradiography. Trypsin-digested, 32P-labeled cPLA2 was injected onto an HPLC column (Vydac 218TP52 or 218HS52, 0.21 × 25 cm), and the column was developed at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with 100% solvent A (0.06% CF3COOH in water (Milli-Q, Millipore)) for 15 min, to 30% solvent B (0.06% CF3COOH in CH3CN (Baker HPLC grade)) over 60 min, to 60% solvent B over 30 min, to 100% solvent B over 10 min, and finally holding at 100% solvent B. Peptides were detected by monitoring the absorbance at 210 nm. Fractions were collected into silanized polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (VWR 20172-935) and were stored at −20°C prior to further analysis. These tubes were also used for all manipulations of the HPLC fractions, and Cerenkov counting was used at all stages of the analyses to gauge the solubility of the tryptic phosphopeptides. Trypsinized, radiolabeled cPLA2 from unstimulated Sf9 cells (30 μg, 142,000 cpm) was injected onto the HPLC column (218TP52), and fractions containing radioactivity in the peak 1 region (see Fig. 4) were pooled. The solution was concentrated to 30 μl in a Speed-Vac concentrator, 400 μl of water was added, and this process was repeated twice; the final volume was adjusted to 100 μl. Three μl of the sample was injected onto the micro-LC/MS. Some of this sample (10 μl) was esterified with ethanol as follows. The sample was concentrated to dryness in a Speed-Vac, and 20 μl of HCl/ethanol was added. After 2 h at room temperature, 10 μl of 0.5% acetic acid was added, and 5 μl of sample was injected onto the LC/MS. The esterification reagent was prepared by adding 160 μl of acetyl chloride dropwise to 1 ml of ethanol with stirring, and after 5 min at room temperature the reagent was used. Purified water (Milli-Q) was used in all subsequent manipulations of the HPLC fractions. Trypsinized, radiolabeled cPLA2 from okadaic acid-treated Sf9 cells (690 μg, 116,000 cpm) was injected in two portions onto the HPLC column (218TP52), and fractions containing radioactivity in the peak 3 region (see Fig. 4) from both runs were pooled. Solvent was removed in a Speed-Vac. To the residue was added 60 μl of glacial acetic acid, the tube was gently shaken, and 0.5 ml of water was added. The mixture was immediately injected onto the 218HS52 column. Virtually all of the cpm eluted in a single peak at 80.5 min. The cpm-containing fractions were pooled, and solvent was removed in the Speed-Vac. To the residue was added 2 μl of glacial acetic acid followed by 18 μl of water, and 2 μl was injected onto the micro-LC/MS. A portion (1-2 μl) was also analyzed by positive ion MALDI-TOF using the instrument described previously (31.Currie G.J. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sample was deposited on the sample slide and mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid reagent (5 mg/ml in acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (1:2)). Trypsinized, radiolabeled cPLA2 from okadaic acid-treated Sf9 cells (900 μg, 240,000 cpm) was injected in three portions onto the HPLC column (218HS52), and fractions containing radioactivity in the peak 2 region (see Fig. 4) from two of the runs were pooled. Peak 2 fractions from the third HPLC run were stored at −20°C and were not used further. Solvent was removed from the two tubes of pooled fractions in a Speed-Vac, and to each tube was added 20 μl of glacial acetic acid. After gentle mixing, each sample was spotted onto a separate c"
https://openalex.org/W1489600631,"Expression of the L-selectin adhesion molecule can be rapidly down-modulated by regulated proteolysis at a membrane-proximal site. The L-selectin secretase has remained undefined, and the secretase activity is resistant to a broad panel of common protease inhibitors. We have developed an L-selectin-alkaline phosphatase reporter, consisting of the ectodomain of human placental alkaline phosphatase fused to the membrane-proximal cleavage, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of L-selectin, to aid in the screening for L-selectin secretase inhibitors. A hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, KD-IX-73-4, inhibited release of the L-selectin-alkaline phosphatase reporter in a dose-dependent manner. The hydroxamic acid-based peptide was also found to inhibit wild type L-selectin down-regulation from the surfaces of phorbol myristate acetate-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. Analysis of the proteolytic cleavage fragments of L-selectin confirmed that KD-IX-73-4 inhibited L-selectin proteolysis. Lymphocyte L-selectin was not down-regulated when co-cultured with formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-stimulated neutrophils, suggesting that the putative secretase acts in cis with the membrane-bound L-selectin. These results suggest that the L-selectin secretase activity may involve a cell surface, zinc-dependent metalloprotease, although L-selectin shedding is not affected by EDTA and may be related to the recently described activity involved in processing of membrane-bound TNF-α."
https://openalex.org/W1600171386,"To begin to study the molecular bases that determine the selective interaction of the β-subunits of voltage-gated K+ channels with α-subunits observed in situ, we have expressed these polypeptides in transfected mammalian cells. Analysis of the specificity of α/β-subunit interaction indicates that both the Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 β-subunits display robust and selective interaction with the five members of the Shaker-related (Kv1) α-subunit subfamily tested. The interaction of these β-subunits with Kv1 α-subunits does not require the β-subunit N-terminal domains. Thus, the previously observed failure of N-terminal mutants of Kvβ1 to modulate inactivation kinetics of Kv1 family members is not simply due to a lack of subunit interaction. Interaction of these β-subunits with members of two other subfamilies (Shab- and Shaw-related) could not be detected. Somewhat surprisingly, a member of the Shal-related subfamily was found to interact with β-subunits; however, this interaction had biochemical characteristics distinct from the β-subunit interaction with Kv1 family members. In all cases, Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 exhibited indistinguishable α-subunit selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2006406271,"Transcription of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene is regulated by intracellular cholesterol concentration, hormones, and growth factors. We studied the mechanisms by which insulin and estradiol stimulate promoter activity of the LDL receptor gene. Hormonal effects were analyzed in HepG2 cells after transient transfection with promotor reporter gene constructs. Successive 5′ deletions of the LDL receptor promoter fragment from −537 to +88 revealed the sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1) between −65 and −56 as an insulin- and estradiol-sensitive cis-element. If the SRE-1 is point mutated at position −59 (C to G), which abolishes the binding of the SRE binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2), no insulin or estradiol stimulatory effect on reporter gene expression was observed, indicating a role of SRE binding proteins in this regulatory mechanism. The concentration of the 125-kDa membrane-integrated SREBP-1 precursor protein in LDL repressed HepG2 cells is not altered by hormone treatment. Concentrations of SREBP-1 mRNA and precursor protein are reduced significantly by high and stable expression of an SREBP-1 antisense cDNA fragment in HepG2 cells (SREBP1(-) cells). Transfection of SREBP1(-) cells with promoter construct phLDL4 (−105 to +88) reduces induction of reporter gene activity by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I to 35 and 17%, respectively, compared with HepG2 cells. The stimulatory effect of estradiol remains unchanged, and the inductions by pravastatin are enlarged. We conclude that different regulatory effects converge at SRE-1, but that SREBP-1 is selectively involved in the signal transduction pathway of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I leading to LDL receptor gene activation.

Concentrations of SREBP-1 mRNA and precursor protein are reduced significantly by high and stable expression of an SREBP-1 antisense cDNA fragment in HepG2 cells (SREBP1(-) cells). Transfection of SREBP1(-) cells with promoter construct phLDL4 (−105 to +88) reduces induction of reporter gene activity by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I to 35 and 17%, respectively, compared with HepG2 cells. The stimulatory effect of estradiol remains unchanged, and the inductions by pravastatin are enlarged. We conclude that different regulatory effects converge at SRE-1, but that SREBP-1 is selectively involved in the signal transduction pathway of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I leading to LDL receptor gene activation."

In the present study, we found that protein-tyrosine kinase activity of fetal lung cells increased after a short period of strain, which was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of ~110-130 kDa. Several components of this complex were identified as pp60srcsubstrates. Strain increased pp60src activity in the cytoskeletal fraction, which coincided with a shift in subcellular distribution of pp60src from the Triton-soluble to the cytoskeletal fraction. Strain-induced pp60src translocation did not appear to be mediated via the focal adhesion kinase-paxillin pathway. In contrast, strain increased the association between pp60src and the actin filament-associated protein of 110 kDa. Preincubation of cells with herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished strain-induced phospholipase C-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its coimmunoprecipitation with pp60src. It also inhibited strain-induced DNA synthesis. These results suggest that activation of pp60src is an upstream event of the phospholipase C-γ-protein kinase C pathway that may represent an important mechanism by which mechanical perturbations are converted to biological reactions in fetal lung cells.

Our previous work demonstrating that IRP1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C supported the hypothesis that factors in addition to iron modulate IRP function. We have investigated changes in activity and expression of both IRP1 and IRP2 during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. In contrast to IRP1, IRP2 was highly phosphorylated in untreated cells. PMA stimulated phosphorylation of IRP1 and IRP2 by at least 2-3-fold without affecting incorporation of [35S]methionine into the proteins. IRP1 and IRP2 isolated from PMA-treated cells displayed different phosphopeptides. Phosphorylation of IRPs was associated with a 2-fold increase in high affinity RNA binding activity without altering KD, and this was accompanied by a 50% increase in transferrin receptor mRNA abundance. PMA acted on a latent pool of binding activity that is present in a nonaconitase oxidized form and is largely composed of a stable but inactive species of IRP2. Desferal and hemin modulated iron-responsive element binding activity in HL-60 cells without affecting the phosphorylation state of IRP1.

https://openalex.org/W2013741570,"Although several genes are considered markers for vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation, few have been rigorously tested for SMC specificity in mammals, particularly during development where considerable overlap exists between different muscle gene programs. Here we describe the temporospatial expression pattern of the SMC calponin gene (formerly h1 or basic calponin) during mouse embryogenesis and in adult mouse tissues and cell lines. Whereas SMC calponin mRNA expression is restricted exclusively to SMCs in adult tissues, during early embryogenesis, SMC calponin transcripts are expressed throughout the developing cardiac tube as well as in differentiating SMCs. Transcription of the SMC calponin gene initiates at two closely juxtaposed sites in the absence of a consensus TATAA or initiator element. Transient transfection assays in cultured SMC demonstrated that high level SMC calponin promoter activity required no more than 549 nucleotides of 5′ sequence. In contrast to the strict cell type-specificity of SMC calponin mRNA expression, the SMC calponin promoter showed activity in several cell lines that do not express the endogenous SMC calponin gene. These results demonstrate that SMC calponin responds to cardiac and smooth muscle gene regulatory programs and suggest that the cardiac and smooth muscle cell lineages may share a common gene regulatory program early in embryogenesis, which diverges as the heart matures. The finding that the isolated SMC calponin promoter is active in a wider range of cells than the endogenous SMC calponin gene also suggests that long-range repression or higher order regulatory mechanism(s) are involved in cell-specific regulation of SMC calponin expression.

In contrast to skeletal and cardiac muscle, which are derived from distinct populations of mesodermal precursor cells, SMCs arise throughout the embryo from diverse precursor cell types. The mechanisms that specify the SMC phenotype and the embryonic origins of the many different types of SMCs remain unclear. There have been relatively few studies that have examined the temporospatial patterns of expression of SMC-specific genes during embryogenesis. However, the few SMC genes that have been examined have been found to exhibit different expression patterns. Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC), for example, is expressed only in the SMC lineage, appearing initially in the dorsal aorta at 10.5 days postcoitum(10.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In contrast, smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin) is expressed in the cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cell lineages during embryogenesis and in the adult (11.Ruzicka D.L. Schwartz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12.Lecain E. Alliot F. Laine M.C. Calas B. Pessac B. J. Neurosci.

SM22α is also expressed in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells in the embryo before becoming restricted to SMCs late in embryogenesis(14.Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1995; 78: 188-195Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15.Li, L., Miano, J. M., Mercer, B., Olson, E. N. (1995) J. Cell Biol. in pressGoogle Scholar). Dissection of the cis-acting regulatory elements associated with these and other SMC genes will be an important step toward understanding the similarities and differences in the myogenic regulatory programs in the three major muscle cell types. One approach to identify SMC-specific regulatory factors is to analyze promoters of genes that are unique to SMC lineages. The best studied SMC promoter is that of SM α-actin(16.Blank R.S.

Defining SMC-specific transcription factors that activate the SM α-actin promoter, however, is complicated by its expression in multiple cell types during embryogenesis and in the adult(11.Ruzicka D.L. Schwartz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12.Lecain E. Alliot F. Laine M.C. Calas B. Pessac B. J. Neurosci.

In addition to SM α-actin, other SMC gene promoters have been cloned and partially characterized including elastin(18.Kahari V.M. Fazio M.J. Chen Y.Q. Bashir M.M. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SMMHC(19.Katoh Y. Loukianov E. Kopras E. Zilberman A. Periasamy M. J. Biol.

As yet, no cis elements have been shown to confer SMC-specific expression of these promoters. Calponin is a thin filament-associated protein that apparently functions as a negative regulatory element for SMC contraction(21.Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but may also have more broad cellular activities independent of contractility(22.Takahashi K. Takagi M. Ohgami K. Nakai M. Kojima A. Nadal-Ginard B. Shibata N. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-174Google Scholar). Three distinct mammalian calponin genes have been described based on their expression and nucleotide sequence differences (23.Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V.

Whereas much effort has been directed toward understanding the function of different calponin proteins, relatively little is known about their specificity of mRNA expression. Based on studies conducted with antisera and cDNA probes, calponin was shown to predominate in SMCs(23.Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerchkhove J. Small J.V.

Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29.Takeuchi K. Takahashi K. Abe M. Nishida W. Hiwada K. Nabeya T. Maruyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 103: 311-316Google Scholar). These studies, however, could not adequately distinguish between the three calponin genes. A similar problem was recently approached with respect to SMMHC mRNA expression using stringent assays for the unambiguous assignment of this marker to only SMC lineages(10.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the temporospatial expression pattern of the basic or h1 calponin (hereafter referred as SMC calponin) during mouse embryogenesis and in adult mouse tissues. Our results demonstrate that SMC calponin is strictly specific for adult SMCs, but that during embryogenesis it is expressed throughout the early cardiac tube. While the SMC calponin gene is expressed exclusively in SMC lineages and embryonic heart, its promoter, which lacks core sequence elements typical of other muscle genes, displays activity in cell lines that do not express the endogenous transcript. These results reveal similarities between the cardiac and smooth muscle gene regulatory programs during early embryogenesis and suggest that complex mechanisms govern the cell type-specific expression of SMC calponin. The culture conditions for many of the cell lines analyzed here have been described previously(10.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Primary rat aortic SMCs (RASMC) were obtained by a modified explant protocol(30.Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat aortae were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, carefully stripped of adherent periaortic fat and endothelium, and subjected to a 20-min digestion in 1% collagenase, 0.25% type II elastase, and 1% soybean trypsin inhibitor as described(31.Miano J.M. Tota R.R. Vlasic N. Stemerman M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Vessels were then rinsed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and aseptically cut into small rings. The rings were placed under sterile coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine for 5-7 days. The cells were routinely split 1:5 and maintained in the same medium. The identity of our RASMC cultures was verified by virtue of their mRNA expression of SMC calponin (below) as well as SMMHC, SM22α, and SM α-actin. 2J. M. Miano and E. N. Olson, unpublished observations. Rat L6 skeletal myoblasts and A7r5 rat aortic SMC were maintained in the same medium as primary RASMC.

The sequence of the primers containing the underlined restriction sites were as follows: (a) mouse 5′ forward primer, 5′-gatacgaattcagagggtgcagacggaggctc-3′; (b) mouse 3′ reverse primer, 5′-gatacaagctttcaatccactctctcagctcc-3′; (c) rat 5′ forward primer, 5′-gatacgaattcatgtcttccgcacactttaac-3′; (d) rat 3′ reverse primer, 5′-gatacaagctttgaccttcttcacagatcccg-3′. The length of each calponin probe was, respectively, for mouse and rat calponin, 195 nt and 200 nt. These clones were ligated into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of the Bluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA), sequenced on both strands with Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH), and utilized for RNase protection, in situ hybridization, or genomic screening as described below. Tissue and cell culture RNA were harvested by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol method(33.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA samples from PC12 and HepG2 cells were kindly provided by Keith Ligon. All SMC calponin clones were linearized with NotI and in vitro transcribed using T7 polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham). Approximately 15 μg of total RNA was hybridized to each radiolabeled riboprobe according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion RPA II). In some experiments, a 157-nt 3′-untranslated region riboprobe corresponding to the murine SM α-actin cDNA (34.Min B. Strauch A.R. Foster D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or an 18 S riboprobe (Ambion) was co-hybridized with the SMC calponin riboprobe. Protected fragments were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and visualized following autoradiographic exposure (Kodak X-Omat AR; Rochester, NY). A monoclonal antibody to SMC calponin (clone hCP; Product No. C-2687) was purchased from Sigma and used to test for the presence of SMC calponin protein in a number of cell types. Briefly, cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in extraction buffer(35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), sheared 10 times through a 22-gauge needle, and boiled for 10 min. After spinning 10 min in a microcentrifuge, equivalent volumes of supernatant were loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify protein integrity and equal loading. In a separate gel, resolved proteins were electroblotted to a nylon membrane (Zeta Probe; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and blocked in buffered 5% non-fat milk (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then incubated with the monoclonal calponin antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 in buffered 1% non-fat milk and rocked for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed in buffered 1% nonfat milk and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in buffered 1% nonfat milk, the SMC calponin was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (RPN 2108; Amersham) followed by exposure to hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). Adult heart, skeletal muscle, small intestine, and uterus as well as staged mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraplast. Sections (8-10 μ) were mounted onto triple washed silane-coated glass slides (HCS Inc., Glen Head, NY) and processed for in situ hybridization as described previously(10.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Adjacent sections of 9.5- and 13.5-day embryos were hybridized with either a riboprobe corresponding to mouse SMMHC (10.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) or mouse SMC calponin (see above). Slides were dipped in emulsion (Kodak NBT-2; Rochester, NY) and exposed for 9 days at 4°C before developing. Developed slides were subjected to darkfield microscopy for analysis and photography (Nikon SMZ-U Zoom 1:10). The XL 1-Blue MRA(P2) strain of bacteria (Stratagene) was used to generate ~4 × 104 recombinants/plate of the SV129 mouse genomic library (Stratagene). About 500,000 recombinants (~1.5 genomic equivalents) were lifted in duplicate onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), denatured, and neutralized as described (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and then prehybridized for at least 6 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42°C. The 195-nt mouse SMC calponin probe described above was random prime-labeled (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and added to the prehybridization mixture for an additional 16 h. Filters were washed at high stringency (final wash 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C) to select for the SMC calponin gene. A total of 16 positive clones were detected after primary screening. Two clones of ~18 (CALP-5) and 14 kilobase pairs (CALP-8) were plaque purified by multiple rounds of screening using freshly labeled probe. Restriction digest analysis of these clones revealed they were independent but overlapping (see Fig. 4). Genomic Southern blotting of the CALP-5 and CALP-8 clones with DNA derived from the liver of an SV129 mouse verified the authenticity of both clones.2 The CALP-5 clone was cut with SacI and all fragments subcloned into Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene) for further restriction mapping and sequencing. These analyses coupled with PCR indicated that the CALP-5 clone harbored all of the SMC calponin coding sequence. Therefore, this clone was sequenced in its entirety on both strands with an ABI 373A automated DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA). The sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession number U28932). Three independent assays were performed to map the SMC calponin transcription initiation sites. First, two negative strand-specific primers were synthesized for primer extension of total RNA from uterus, stomach, or liver. One primer was synthesized 5′ of the first intron (5′-cagacaagccgtaggcaggacc-3′) and the other 3′ of the first intron (5′-cgctgatggtcgtatttctgggccag-3′). These primers were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and annealed (300 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tricine, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mM EDTA) to 25 μg of total RNA from the above mouse tissues at 65°C for 10 min as described(36.Cooper T.A. Cardone M.H. Ordahl C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8553-8565Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following annealing, the samples were transferred to a 48°C bath and extension was carried out for 1 h with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Bethesda Research Laboratories) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped by adding 60 μl of dH2O, 70 μl of 5 M NH4OAc, and 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and precipitated in 500 μl of ethanol. Dried samples were resuspended in 10 μl of Sequenase stop solution (U. S. Biochemical), denatured at 75°C, and resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. A sequencing ladder using a calponin cDNA clone with the same primer as that used to anneal the RNA was loaded adjacently to the primer extension reactions for fine mapping of the start sites. RNase protection analysis and 5′ RACE were used in conjunction with primer extension for mapping the start sites. For RNase protection, total RNA was hybridized to one of two independent riboprobes (see Fig. 5A) and the protected fragments resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel. Sequencing reactions of a calponin cDNA were carried out using primers to the 3′ most end of each riboprobe. Total RNA from uterus or liver was also subjected to 5′ RACE according to the manufacturer's instructions (BRL). A final nested PCR was performed using the 5′ anchor primer provided in the kit (BRL) and a 3′ SMC calponin-specific primer, 5′-cagacaagccgtaggcaggacc-3′. A total of 10 RACE products were sequenced, two of which are presented in Fig. 5D. All promoter constructs were derived from a 2301-nt PCR fragment of the 5′ end of genomic clone CALP-5. BamHI sites were engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends of this fragment for cloning into Bluescript. The 2301-nt BamHI fragment, which included 60 nt of untranslated exon one sequence and 2251 nt of 5′ promoter sequence, was then cloned into the BglII site of pGL3 basic luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate −2251 CALPLuc. A BamHI/HindIII digest of the 2301-nt PCR product generated a 549-nt deletion construct that was filled in and blunt cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3 basic to generate −549 CALPLuc. A BamHI/NcoI digest of the 2301-nt PCR product generated a 1342-nt deletion that was filled in and blunt cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3 basic to generate −1342 CALPLuc. The −3000 CALPLuc promoter construct was generated by ligating a 2.4-kilobase pair HindIII promoter fragment adjacent to the −549 CALPLuc deletion construct. Finally, the −115 CALPLuc deletion construct was generated by PCR using BamHI sites at both ends for cloning into the BglII site of pGL3 basic. All promoter constructs were sequenced to confirm their proper orientation in the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector as well as to verify the absence of any errors introduced by Taq polymerase. The promoterless pGL3 basic vector and the pGL3 control vector containing the SV40 promoter/enhancer were used as controls to normalize each promoter construct's activity. All transfections were done using a calcium phosphate precipitation method(37.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Cells (A7r5, L6 myoblasts, C2C12, 10T1/2, and F9 teratocarcinoma) were grown in 100-mm dishes (Falcon) according to the supplier's specifications (American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) and transfected at 50% confluence with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. Primary RASMC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and used between passage 15 and 30. Although the cell lines grow at different rates, every effort was made to transfect approximately equivalent cell numbers between lines. In some experiments, a plasmid carrying the β-galactosidase gene was cotransfected to correct for varying transfection efficiencies between cell lines. Transfections were typically carried out for 12-16 h followed by 48 h of recovery and growth. Cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, spun down, and resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Cell lysates were then briefly sonicated, spun down and stored at −80°C before use. Neither mild sonication nor multiple freeze thawing influenced luciferase activity.2 Total protein was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity was assayed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). A Turner Model 20 luminometer was used to measure the light reactivity of firefly luciferase. The relative light units were then normalized to total protein and expressed as a percent of the normalized luciferase activity obtained with the pGL3 control vector, which contains the SV40 promoter/enhancer (Promega). The data reflect the means (±S.E.) of at least four independent experiments done in duplicate. RNase protection assays were performed to accurately assess the specificity of SMC calponin mRNA expression in adult mouse tissues and a variety of cell lines. Consistent with previous reports (21.Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24.Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), SMC calponin transcripts were restricted to adult mouse tissues with a SMC component (Fig. 1A). Upon overexposure, however, transcripts were detected in most tissues due to the presence of blood vessels (see below). In cultured cells, SMC calponin was expressed in proliferating BC3H1 cells, which have been reported to exhibit properties of smooth and skeletal muscle, and only weakly in the differentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line, which also has the potential to differentiate into smooth muscle (38.Blank R.S. Swartz E.A. Thompson M.M. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, SMC calponin mRNA expression was extinguished in differentiated BC3H1 cells (Fig. 1B). No other mouse lines examined expressed SMC calponin mRNA including 3T3, 10T1/2, C2, F9, and embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1B). These findings contrast with the expression of SM α-actin, which was expressed in most cell lines analyzed (Fig. 1B). No SMC calponin transcripts were detected in the rat L6 skeletal myoblast line, PC12 cells, or the HepG2 liver cell line (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, a prominent signal was observed in the A7r5 fetal rat aortic SMC line as well as primary RASMC (Fig. 1C). These latter cells also expressed SMC calponin protein as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Importantly, SMC calponin mRNA was expressed at high levels in rat SMC irrespective of passage number or growth state (Fig. 1C). Together, these results show SMC calponin to be a highly restricted marker for SMC lineages. They also demonstrate the utility of both the A7r5 fetal rat aortic SMC line and multiply passaged primary RASMC for analyzing SMC calponin promoter activity (see below). Several adult mouse tissues were analyzed by in situ hybridizatio"
https://openalex.org/W1969600218,"Yeast alpha-glucosidase is a member of a sequence-related family of alpha-glycosidases (Family 13) that includes important digestive alpha-amylases and alpha-glucosidases. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of alpha-linked oligosaccharides by a two-step mechanism involving a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate can be trapped by use of 5-fluoro-alpha-D-glucosyl fluoride or 5-fluoro-beta-L-idosyl fluoride, members of a new class of mechanism-based glycosidase inactivators. Both of these trapped 5-fluoro glycosyl enzyme intermediates are catalytically competent, turning over when freed of excess inactivator and releasing free enzyme. Two glycosylated peptides in proteolytic digests of these trapped glycosyl enzyme intermediates were identified by use of neutral loss scans on an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Further tandem mass spectrometric analysis in daughter ion scan mode allowed identification of Asp-214 as the catalytic nucleophile in yeast alpha-glucosidase, and this identification was confirmed by aminolysis of the labeled peptide and high resolution mass spectrometry. This residue is one of three active site carboxylates that are completely conserved in this family, thus confirming the role of Asp-214 and the equivalent residues in other family members as the catalytic nucleophile. The other two conserved carboxylates are likely involved in acid/base catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2067241536,"The highly related actin isoforms are thought to have different functions. We recently demonstrated a polarized distribution of actin isoforms in gastric parietal cells and association of gastric ezrin with the cytoplasmic β-actin isoform (Yao, X., Chaponnier, C., Gabbiani, G., and Forte, J. G.(1995) Mol. Biol. Cell. 6, 541-557). Here we used ultrastructural immunocytochemistry to verify that β-actin is located within canalicular microvilli and the apical cortex of parietal cells, similar to the localization reported for ezrin. Furthermore, we tested whether ezrin binds preferentially to cytoplasmic β-actin compared with the skeletal muscle α-actin isoform. Purified cytoplasmic β-actin (from erythrocytes) and skeletal α-actin were assembled with gastric ezrin. Co-sedimentation experiments showed that gastric ezrin selectively co-pelleted with the β-actin isoform and only very poorly with α-actin. Binding of erythrocytic β-actin to ezrin is saturable with a molar ratio of ~1:10 (ezrin:actin) and a dissociation constant ~4.6 × 10-8M. In addition, ezrin promoted pyrene-labeled actin assembly, with predominant effects on filament elongation and a distinct preference for β-actin compared with α-actin. Given these isoform-selective associations, we speculate that actin isoforms might segregate into different functional domains and exert specificity by interacting with isoform-orientated binding proteins. The highly related actin isoforms are thought to have different functions. We recently demonstrated a polarized distribution of actin isoforms in gastric parietal cells and association of gastric ezrin with the cytoplasmic β-actin isoform (Yao, X., Chaponnier, C., Gabbiani, G., and Forte, J.

Given these isoform-selective associations, we speculate that actin isoforms might segregate into different functional domains and exert specificity by interacting with isoform-orientated binding proteins. Although actin is a highly conserved protein, several distinct tissue-specific isoforms exist. The actin isoforms are encoded by separate genes and differ by less than 10% in amino acid sequence (1.Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 783-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and are generally believed to exert different functions. For example, profilin has different affinities for each of the cytoplasmic actin isoforms, β-actin and γ-actin, and for sarcomeric actin(2.Larsson H. Lindberg U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3.Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 100-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We showed recently that there is a polarized distribution of cytoplasmic β- and γ-actin isoforms in gastric parietal cells(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), consistent with some difference in functional activity and/or preferential interaction with localized actin-binding proteins. The β-actin isoform is concentrated near the apical membrane of all gastric epithelial cells, including the apical secretory canalicular membrane of parietal cells, while the γ-actin isoform is primarily distributed toward the basolateral surface, with minor deposition in the region of the secretory canaliculi of parietal cells. Ezrin is an actin-binding protein of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of cytoskeleton-membrane linker proteins(5.Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Sato N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to the apical canalicular membrane of parietal cells(6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hanzel D. Reggio H. Bretscher A. Forte J.G. Mangeat P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because of its cytolocalization and stimulation-dependent phosphorylation, an implied role for ezrin has been suggested in the apical surface membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell activation via the protein kinase A pathway(6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1070-G1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ezrin has also been associated with surface membrane remodeling of A431 cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor(9.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), although activation in this case was via protein tyrosine kinase. Our previous studies showed that the F-actin which co-localized with ezrin in parietal cells was primarily comprised of the β-actin isoform, and that the β-actin isoform was preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with ezrin from extracts of gastric membranes(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, Shuster and Herman (10.Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that ezrin, contained within lysates of retinal pericytes, bound to immobilized matrices of cytoplasmic β-actin, but not to the skeletal α-actin isoform. These authors further demonstrated a co-localization of antibodies against the β-actin isoform and ezrin in leading lamellae of motile cells. Thus a body of evidence suggests interaction of ezrin with the actin cytoskeleton may be specific for the β-actin isoform, but much controversy remains regarding the nature of the interaction and whether it is direct or via intermediary proteins. The purpose of the present experiments was to test if gastric ezrin exerts isoform-specific association with cytoplasmic β-actin in relatively simple reconstituted systems. Accordingly, we separately assembled skeletal α-actin and cytoplasmic β-actin in the presence of gastric ezrin and subjected them to centrifugation. Gastric ezrin selectively co-sedimented with cytoplasmic β-actin compared with skeletal α-actin, which is consistent with an earlier observation that showed a weak interaction between skeletal α-actin and intestinal ezrin(11.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and supports the notion of isoform specificity. Further characterization of ezrin-actin interaction by using erythrocytic β-actin revealed that gastric ezrin binds to actin in a saturable manner with a molar ratio of about 1:10 (ezrin:actin) and a dissociation constant (Kd) ~4.6 × 10-8M for the ezrin-actin binding relationship. An acetone powder was prepared from rabbit muscle using the method of Pardee and Spudich (12.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Typically, we obtained 20 mg of pure skeletal actin from 1 g of acetone powder. Cytoplasmic β-actin was purified from bovine red blood cells as described by Puszkin et al.(13.Puszkin S.J. Maimon J. Puszkin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 513: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine red blood cells (RBC) 1The abbreviations used are: RBCred blood cellsDTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. were osmotically hemolyzed, and an acetone powder was made from the harvested RBC ghosts. The resulting acetone powder was then extracted twice using 15 ml buffer A (5 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.02% sodium azide)/mg of acetone powder for 3 h at 4°C. After clarification at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, the extract was fractionated over a DE52 anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with buffer A, and developed with a linear gradient of 50 mM to 1 M NaCl. β-Actin eluted from the column between 0.15 and 0.25 M NaCl, identified by dot-blot. These fractions were pooled, concentrated to 4 ml, and applied to a 2 × 40-cm Sephadex G-150 column equilibrated with buffer A. The peak actin fractions were then pooled in buffer A containing 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl at room temperature in order to polymerize native actin. After pelleting filamentous actin at 100,000 × g, F-actin was depolymerized in buffer A and rechromatographed on G-150 Sephadex prior to storage at −80°C. The yield of β-actin was relatively poor, thus we switched from human to bovine RBC for more voluminous starting material; typically, we obtained about 4 mg of pure β-actin from 4 liters of whole bovine blood. SDS-gel electrophoresis demonstrated that each actin isoform was greater than 98% pure, both at the level of actin isoforms (two-dimensional electrophoresis) and with respect to other contaminating proteins. red blood cells dithiothreitol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Gastric ezrin was purified from rabbit gastric mucosal homogenates using a procedure described by Bretscher (14.Bretscher A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with modification. Gastric ezrin was extracted with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM E64, 1 mM benzamide, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, with stirring on ice for 60 min to maximize the extraction of ezrin, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was brought to 40% (NH4)2SO4 and the precipitate removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was precipitated with 75% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitates were solubilized in 10 mM imidazole, pH 6.7, 1 mM DTT and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. After clarification at 30,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to a hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and developed with a 40-ml linear gradient of 100-800 mM potassium phosphate. Fractions containing ezrin were identified by dot-immunoblot and pooled for dialysis for 3 h against 10 mM bis-Tris-propane (BTP buffer), pH 6.7, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. The material was then centrifuged and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column and developed with 40-ml linear gradient from 20 mM to 1 M NaCl in BTP buffer. Fractions rich in ezrin were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM MES, pH 6.7 (MES buffer), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and applied to an S-Sepharose column and again developed with a 40-ml linear 20 mM to 1 M NaCl gradient in MES buffer. Homogeneous ezrin eluted at ~650 mM NaCl. The ezrin-enriched fractions were desalted in microconcentration tubes (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored in MES buffer at 0-4°C until use. Densitometric analysis of the sample run on 9% SDS-acrylamide gel demonstrated that ezrin was greater than 95% pure with respect to other contaminating proteins and degradation products of ezrin. Gastric glands were isolated from rabbit stomach as described previously(15.Yao X. Thibodeau A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C36-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated glands were either maintained in a resting (nonsecreting) state by treatment with 10-4M cimetidine, or they were maximally stimulated to secrete acid by treatment with 10-4M histamine plus 5 × 10-5M isobutylmethylxanthine. For fixation, the glands were harvested by a brief centrifugation, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and infiltrated according to a standard protocol described by Berryman et al. (16.Berryman M. Franck Z. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using LR-gold (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Thin sections of the LR-gold-embedded glands were picked up on Formvar-coated nickel grids. Grids were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20 + 1% bovine serum albumin + 0.1% cold water fish gelatin + 0.02% NaN3 for 10 min and then incubated with affinity-purified anti-β-actin antibody for 1 h and washed with four successive washes (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20) of 5 min each. Antibody against the cytoplasmic β-actin isoform was a gift from Dr. Christine Chaponnier, with characteristics as described by Yao et al.(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Grids were then incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 5-nm colloidal gold. Grids were rinsed in wash buffer (3 × 5 min), phosphate-buffered saline (2 × 5 min), H2O (2 × 5 min) and then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 90 s. In the case of low power images, immunostained grids were incubated with a silver enhancement kit for approximately 4 min (Ted Pella, Inc.) followed by the uranyl acetate staining. A number of controls were routinely performed for immunolabeling: omission of the primary antibody and incubation with preimmune serum. Stored actin samples were thawed and centrifuged at 312,000 × g (90,000 rpm, TLA 100 rotor; Beckman Instruments) for 40 min to remove any polymerized or aggregated actin. Aliquots of monomeric actin isoforms were incubated for 2 h at 23, with or without ezrin or myosin S1 fragment, in polymerizing buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, and 0.2 mM DTT) to promote polymerization. The filaments were then sedimented by centrifugation at 312,000 × g for 40 min. Myosin S1 subfragment, a generous gift from Roger Cooke (University of California, San Francisco), was used as a positive control in co-sedimentation experiments. For visualization and quantitation of actin and its binding proteins, pellets and supernatants were solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis. Some gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried between sheets of cellulose for visualization and quantitative scanning. Other were transblotted to nitrocellulose and probed with ezrin antibodies. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared by modifying the method of Kouyama and Mihashi(17.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of polymerized actin was pelleted and homogenized in buffer P (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ATP), 5.6 mg of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added with agitation, and the solution was incubated at 4°C in the dark overnight. The labeled actin was dialyzed against three changes of buffer A for 24 h in order to depolymerize the F-actin. Any resulting F-actin and/or precipitated N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Aliquots of pyrene-labeled G-actin were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. For assembly experiments, actin was used at a concentration of 5 μM. Because some polymerization of actin occurs during the freezing of samples, thawed actin was spun at 312,000 × g for 40 min before initiating assembly. Polymerization was initiated at the following final conditions: 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 0.2 mM DTT. Fluorescence was monitored continuously: excitation wavelength = 355 nm; emission wavelength = 407 nm. Purified yeast cofilin was used as a control according to Moon et al.(18.Moon A.L. Jamney P.A. Louie K.A. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed a polarized distribution of ezrin in the apical and canalicular plasma membranes of gastric parietal cells (6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that ezrin was spatially co-distributed with F-actin filaments, primarily composed of the β-actin isoform(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present experiments we sought to more closely define the location of the β-actin isoform within gastric glandular cells using immunogold labeling at the level of the electron microscope. A micrograph from resting, or nonsecreting, gastric glands is shown in Fig. 1. Parietal cells, which are readily apparent by the numerous large mitochondria, are most heavily labeled of all glandular cells. Enhanced gold particles are primarily deposited along the apical surfaces of all glandular epithelial cells (parietal cells, mucous neck cells, and chief cells) and along the canalicular surfaces within parietal cells. The secretory canaliculi are invaginations of the apical surface membrane coursing throughout the parietal cell; at the level of magnification shown in Fig. 1, the collapsed canaliculi are easily visualized by the dense trail of enhanced gold particles. Gold particles are also clearly seen along the basolateral region of parietal cells, with a somewhat lower density than along the canaliculi. With the exception of discrete staining along their apical borders, there was virtually no gold staining within chief cells or at their basolateral surfaces. For stimulated gastric glands (Fig. 2), enhanced immunogold staining of β-actin can readily be seen along the dilated canaliculi of parietal cells and the apical surfaces of neighboring epithelial cells. Mitochondria within the stimulated parietal cells appeared to be highly concentrated in the cytoplasm, due to the fusion of tubulovesicles with the apical canalicular membrane. At the higher resolution shown in Fig. 3, specific gold particle labeling of β-actin can clearly be localized to apical microvilli and the region of the terminal web just beneath the apical canalicular surface of parietal cells. Very few gold particles extend deep into parietal cell cytoplasm, although lateral folds and basal membranes show distinct gold labeling.Figure 2:β-Actin is primarily localized to apical canalicular surfaces of secreting parietal cells. Gastric glands stimulated with histamine plus isobutylmethylxanthine were prepared and immunostained as described in Fig. 1. Enhanced gold particles are clearly seen along the dilated intracellular canaliculi (IC) of parietal cells and near the apical surfaces (Ap) of neighboring chief cells (CC). There is somewhat less deposition of gold particles at basolateral surfaces (Bl) of parietal cells and virtually no basolateral staining of chief cells. In these stimulated parietal cells, the mitochondria are highly concentrated in the cytoplasm due to the fusion of tubulovesicles to the canalicular membrane, and the canalicular spaces are extended and readily seen. The bar marker is 2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Magnified view shows that β-actin is heavily localized to apical and canalicular microvilli of parietal cells. Secreting gastric glands were processed as described in Fig. 1. Thin sections were stained with anti-β-actin antibody followed by colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 nm); no silver enhancement was applied. The gold particles are primarily distributed to the apical microvilli (mv) and to the cortical region (cor) subadjacent to the apical membrane. Some gold particles are also seen near lateral membrane folds (lat).

Two major peaks of ezrin were eluted from the S-Sepharose, one in the range of 450-550 mM NaCl with several ezrin breakdown products in the 40-55 kDa range (identified by blot) and a second peak eluting at 625-675 mM NaCl containing a single 80-kDa ezrin peak and some low molecular weight peptides migrating near the dye front. This second highly purified ezrin preparation was used in our tests of ezrin-actin interaction. To determine whether gastric ezrin stably binds to actin filaments in an isoform-specific manner, we assayed the ability of ezrin to co-sediment with skeletal muscle α-actin and RBC cytoplasmic β-actin. Gastric ezrin was incubated with the respective actin isoforms under polymerizing conditions for 2 h, and the filaments were pelleted by centrifugation at 312,000 × g for 40 min. Actin filaments longer than 10 subunits in length will sediment under these conditions(19.Attri A.K. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6815-6824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue-stained gel in Fig. 5A shows that gastric ezrin did not appear in the pellet when incubated without actin and pelleted very poorly when incubated with α-actin. However, ezrin obviously appeared in the pellet when β-actin was polymerized (Fig. 5B). The S1 tryptic fragment of myosin II, a known actin-binding protein that decorates actin filaments side-wise, was used as a control. The myosin subfragment sedimented with either the skeletal α-actin or the RBC β-actin without isoform specificity and with an apparent molar ratio of 1:1 (myosin/actin). It is also apparent that neither gastric ezrin nor the myosin subfragment affected the amount of either α- or β-actin that sedimented. To probe the stoichiometry of ezrin-actin association, we carried out separate sets of co-sedimentation experiments: one case in which the ezrin concentration was held constant while varying the β-actin concentration; in the other case the β-actin concentration was fixed while ezrin concentration was varied. Coomassie Blue-stained gels representing these respective experiments are shown in Fig. 6, A and B. As actin was increased more ezrin was removed from the supernatant; when the molar ratio of actin:ezrin was 20:1, or greater, virtually no ezrin remained in the supernatant (Fig. 6A). When β-actin was held constant at 5 μM, the proportion of ezrin that sedimented with the β-actin pellet deceased as ezrin concentration was increased, consistent with a saturation isotherm for ezrin binding (Fig. 6B). At low concentration virtually all ezrin is removed to the β-actin pellet; as the ratio of actin:ezrin falls below 10:1, ezrin content in the supernatant increases. These data also support the idea that ezrin binds to actin polymers. Densitometric data for bound and total ezrin are shown in Fig. 7 for four separate co-sedimentation experiments where ezrin was varied between 0.05 and 2.0 μM and F-actin was polymerized at a constant 5 μM β-actin concentration. Linear transformation of the data, plotting ezrin bound/ezrin free against ezrin bound (Scatchard plot), provided a Kd for ezrin binding to β-actin of ~4.6 × 10-8M. The calculated stoichiometric molar ratio of 0.084 (ezrin/actin) suggested that about 1 ezrin was bound per 10 actin molecules.Figure 7:Summary of ezrin binding with β-actin. Ezrin was varied over the range shown while β-actin concentration was constant at 5 μM. Ezrin band densities were measured in the supernatants and pellet, and the ezrin bound was calculated as the fractional amount of ezrin in the pellet. Data are the mean ± S.E. from four separate experiments, two derived from Coomassie Blue-stained protein and two from Western blots probed for ezrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate the quality of our purified actin isoforms from bovine RBCs and rabbit skeletal muscle, the time course of polymerization for pyrene-labeled actin was monitored, as described by Cooper et al.(20.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Pyrene fluorescence increases when a pyrene-labeled actin subunit is incorporated into a polymerizing filament. Both skeletal α-actin and cytoplasmic β-actin isoforms readily polymerized when KCl and MgCl2 were included as demonstrated by the respective standard curves in Fig. 8, A and B. To validate the properties of our pyrene-labeled actin, we tested the influence of yeast cofilin on pyrene-labeled actin(18.Moon A.L. Jamney P.A. Louie K.A. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Yeast cofilin increased the rate of assembly of both skeletal α-actin and cytoplasmic β-actin isoforms. The effects of cofilin were most prominent in the late stages of polymerization, after the lag phase (nucleation phase), consistent with the report of Moon et al.(18.Moon A.L. Jamney P.A. Louie K.A. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When gastric ezrin was included with the pyrene-labeled skeletal α-actin, the curve shifted slightly to the left in the late stage of polymerization, but not in the initial nucleation stage, suggesting that ezrin might bind to the actin filaments or possibly promote the assembly (Fig. 8A). An increased molar ratio of ezrin/actin further shifted the curve to the left. The addition of ezrin also promoted the assembly of pyrene-labeled β-actin, with effects that were more pronounced than for skeletal α-actin (Fig. 8B). Ezrin reduced the time for assembly to achieve a steady state in a concentration-dependent manner, e.g. at a molar ratio of 1:10 (ezrin:actin) the time to achieve steady state decreased from ~60 to ~30 min. The profile of ezrin on RBC β-actin assembly is somewhat like that of cofilin, that is, ezrin does not seem to modulate the lag associated with the nucleation phase while it promotes the filament elongation phase as evidenced by increased rate of assembly after the initial lag phase. Thus the pyrene-labeled actin assembly assay indicated that ezrin might directly interact with actin isoforms, with a distinct preference for RBC β-actin compared with skeletal α-actin. Two different actin isoforms have been identified within parietal cells, cytoplasmic β-actin and cytoplasmic γ-actin, which are polarized to the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition these studies demonstrated a preferential interaction between ezrin and the β-actin isoform extracted from native parietal cells. In the present studies, we extended our earlier finding by using immunoelectron microscopy to localize β-actin to the apical microvilli and in vitro reconstitution of ezrin-β-actin interaction using purified gastric ezrin and erythrocytic β-actin. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we localized β-actin to the canalicular surface and apical microvilli where gastric ezrin is enriched(6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the dramatic elongation of apical microvilli and dilation of the canalicular lumina of parietal cells during acid secretion, the immunogold labeling of β-actin did not reveal obvious stimulation-mediated redistribution of β-actin. In fact, a recent report on the state of actin in resting and stimulated gastric glands using the DNase I assay did not reveal any significant change in either filamentous or monomeric actin pool(21.Ogihara S. Ramilo M. Yao X. Ly B. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 371aCrossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that stimulation-mediated elongation of microvilli could be due mainly to an invagination of plasma membrane resulting from the fusion of tubulovesicular membrane. It is possible that the stability and integrity of microfilaments are required for providing a structural support for the dynamic extension of apical plasma membrane and growth of microvilli. The three-dimensional structure of cytoplasmic β-actin was recently solved in complex with profilin(22.Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although its primary sequence is generally similar to skeletal α-actin, cytoplasmic β-actin displays several structural differences. These include: the N-terminal conformation of β-actin bearing a turn rather than the helical structure in skeletal α-actin, distinct rotational differences within subdomains of the isoforms, and differences in side chain orientation at residues 38-52. Physiological interpretation of these structural differences is still under debate(23.Rozycki M.D. Myslik J.C. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but functional distinctions for the interaction of actin isoforms with actin binding proteins have been reported. Larsson and Lindberg (2.Larsson H. Lindberg U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 953: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that cytoplasmic β-actin and γ-actin have higher affinity to bind profilin (Kd ~10-8M) than that of sarcomeric actin (Kd ~4 × 10-6M) and that profilin interaction with the non-muscle isoforms was regulated by Mg2+. Rozycki et al.(3.Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 100-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that profilin preferentially binds to cytoplasmic β-actin compared with γ-actin. The increased ratio of β- to γ-actin isoforms during the course of co-purifying ezrin and actin by immunoprecipitation hinted that β-actin filaments might preferentially bind to ezrin(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Bretscher observed (11.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) that ezrin co-sedimented with filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin in vitro only at low ionic strength. Our studies with the comparison of two different actin isoforms clearly show that gastric ezrin preferentially binds to cytoplasmic β-actin while ezrin binds poorly to the skeletal α-actin. A recent series of studies has provided further information concerning the structural and functional relevance of closely related ERM protein family members. Martin et al.(24.Martin M. Andreoli C. Sahuquet A. Montcourrier P. Algrain M. Mangeat P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that the N-terminal domain of ezrin inhibits the functional activity of cell surface protrusion exerted by the C-terminal domain. These authors further mapped the inhibitory domain to the first 115 N-terminal residues. A similar interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains was also observed by Henry et al.(25.Henry M.D. Agosti C.G. Solomon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1007-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in their study of the functional relevance of radixin. Gary and Bretscher (26.Gary R. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10846-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27.Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) carried out a meticulous characterization of homotypic and heterotypic interaction among the ERM protein family members, specifically ezrin and moesin. They established conditions under which there is heterotypic interaction between the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-296) and C-terminal domain (amino acids 479-585) to form dimers and possibly oligomers. These terminal “interactive domains” were clearly demonstrated in an extensive set of test probings using fusion protein constructs of the respective N- and C-terminal interactive domains. However, for the full-length fusion protein, or for isolated native ezrin, they interpreted their results to suggest that the monomer exists in a form in which the C-terminal interactive domain is masked by a folding that also partially obscures the N-terminal interactive domain. When full-length ezrin was denatured the C-terminal interactive domain became accessible, but the N-terminal domain was inactivated by denaturation. Because the actin binding domain of ezrin is near the C terminus(28.Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and the apparent masking of the C-terminal interactive domain in the full-length monomer, Gary and Bretscher offered these data as a basis to explain the lack of ezrin association with α-actin filaments in vitro(11.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is possible that modification (e.g. phosphorylation) and accessory proteins might perturb this masking process and expose the F-actin binding site in the C-terminal domain. In fact, purified ezrin from gastric mucosa contains multiple spots as resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis, which suggests that native gastric ezrin might contain a pool of phosphoezrin and/or multiple isoforms. Since there are three consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A in ezrin (Ser65, Thr213, and Thr332), and protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation has been implicated in hormone-stimulated acid secretion(8.Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1070-G1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the phosphorylation might alter the intramolecular masking effect and expose the C-terminal domain for actin binding. In fact, phosphorylation of ezrin by epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase triggered the dimerization, although the functional activity of this dimer is unknown at present(27.Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ezrin isoforms might form functional oligomers that might exert F-actin-binding action. Shuster and Herman (10.Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) recently reported that ezrin preferentially binds to an affinity column made of filamentous erythrocytic β-actin, but not to a skeletal α-actin. Because these authors were unable to reconstitute erythrocytic β-actin-ezrin interaction in vitro, they concluded that their observed interaction was indirect, and suggested that a 73-kDa polypeptide served to link the interaction between ezrin and filaments of β-actin isoform, although other candidates were also possible. Data presented here would argue against a requirement for the 73-kDa component, since there was no such peptide present in our reaction mixtures. On the other hand, it is not possible to rule out the participation of a low molecular weight component in the ezrin-β-actin filament interaction. There are some apparent contradictions concerning the nature of ezrin-actin interaction. Based on the displacement of ezrin from actin filaments by cytochalasin D, Shuster and Herman (10.Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) proposed that ezrin binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments. Using a blot overlay assay, Pestonjamasp et al.(29.Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) found that immobilized ezrin bound to actin filaments and the binding was minimized by myosin S1 subfragment but not by gelsolin or capping protein, suggesting that binding occurs at the filament sides and not at barbed ends. Moreover, the parallel localizations of ezrin and F-actin at the light and EM levels (6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G1082-G1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hanzel D. Reggio H. Bretscher A. Forte J.G. Mangeat P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) are consistent with side binding. Our studies of ezrin on pyrene-labeled actin assembly in vitro also favors the idea that ezrin interacts with actin filaments along the side since ezrin dose-dependently promotes actin assembly, which is typically seen for a side-binding polypeptide, myosin S1 fragment(30.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Recently, Turunen et al.(28.Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) revealed that the region 558-578 in ezrin, moesin, and radixin shows high sequence homology with the actin binding site of CapZ β-subunit(31.Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that both radixin and CapZ β-subunit bind to the barbed ends of actin filaments(31.Hug C. Miller T.M. Torres M.A. Casella J.F. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32.Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Sato N. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the homologous region which exerts actin binding for ezrin is also responsible for the end-binding in the case of CapZ and radixin. Recent studies showed that EF1α, a transcription factor, has typical barbed end capping activity in addition to the known actin filament side-binding property(33.Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that ezrin might interact with the ends of actin filaments at present. In summary, our immunoelectron microscopic data show cytoplasmic β-actin is indeed located to the apical microvilli and terminal web of parietal cells, in a pattern identical to what has been reported for ezrin(4.Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6.Hanzel D.K. Urushidani T. Usinger W.R. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Am. J.

We have verified that gastric ezrin is preferentially associated with cytoplasmic β-actin filaments in vitro, compared with skeletal α-actin, and that gastric ezrin binds to β-actin filaments in a saturable manner. Finally, based on the pyrene-labeled actin assembly data, we speculate that ezrin might modulate the elongation phase of the actin assembly. Because of the isopreferential associations demonstrated in this study and morphological separations seen in several systems(34.Hill M.A. Gunning P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35.Hoock T.C. Newcomb P.M. Herman I.M. J.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 445-455PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that actin isoforms might segregate into different functional domains and exert their specificities by interacting with isoform-orientated actin-binding proteins. We thank Dr. Christine Chaponnier for providing antibody against cytoplasmic β-actin, Dr. Ann Moon for purified yeast cofilin, and Dr. Roger Cooke for S1 subfragment. We extend special thanks to Dr. Kent McDonald for his valuable assistance with electron microscopy and for his critical reading of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2170319511,"The antagonist SR 141716A has a high specificity for the central CB1 cannabinoid receptor and negligeable affinity for the peripheral CB2 receptor, making it an excellent tool for probing receptor structure-activity relationships. From binding experiments with mutated CB1 and with chimeric CB1/CB2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of CB1 implicated in the recognition of SR 141716A. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. The e2 domain thus plays some role in CP 55,940 binding but none in SR 141716A recognition, binding of the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining transmembrane helices. The antagonist SR 141716A has a high specificity for the central CB1 cannabinoid receptor and negligeable affinity for the peripheral CB2 receptor, making it an excellent tool for probing receptor structure-activity relationships. From binding experiments with mutated CB1 and with chimeric CB1/CB2 receptors we have begun to identify the domains of CB1 implicated in the recognition of SR 141716A. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with SR 141716A and with CP 55,940, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of CB1 proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of SR 141716A. The CB1 and CB2 second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on SR 141716A binding in the CB1 variant but that eliminated CP 55,940 binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved cysteine residues in e2 of CB2 by serine also eliminated CP 55,940 binding, but replacement of those in CB1 resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. The e2 domain thus plays some role in CP 55,940 binding but none in SR 141716A recognition, binding of the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining transmembrane helices."

https://openalex.org/W2099696075,"Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates cAMP accumulation in the heart via a process involving Gsα and the EGF receptor (EGFR) protein tyrosine kinase activity (Nair, B. G., Parikh, B., Milligan, G., and Patel, T. B.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21317-21322; Nair, B. G., and Patel, T. B.(1993) Biochem. Pharmacol. 46, 1239-1245). Therefore, studies were performed to investigate the hypothesis that the EGFR protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Gsα and activates this protein. Employing purified EGFR and Gsα, we have demonstrated that the EGFR kinase phosphorylates Gsα in a time-dependent manner with a stoichiometry of 2 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of Gsα. As determined by phosphoamino acid analysis, the phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGFR kinase was exclusively on tyrosine residues. Interestingly, GDP and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) inhibited the phosphorylation of Gsα without altering EGFR autophosphorylation. However, G protein βγ subunits protected against GDP- and GTPγS-mediated inhibition of phosphorylation of GSα. In functional studies, phospho-Gsα demonstrated a greater GTPase activity and also a greater capacity to bind GTPγS as compared to the nonphosphorylated Gsα. Moreover, the phospho-Gsα augmented adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 cyc- cell membranes to a greater extent than its nonphosphorylated counterpart. Therefore, we conclude that phosphorylation of Gsα on tyrosine residues by the EGFR kinase activates this G protein and increases its ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates cAMP accumulation in the heart via a process involving Gsα and the EGF receptor (EGFR) protein tyrosine kinase activity (Nair, B.

Wahl M.I. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1990; 95I: 69-171Crossref Google Scholar) for review). These pleiotropic actions of EGF are mediated via the activation of several second messenger systems. For instance, following binding of EGF to its receptors, the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is increased, resulting in autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor as well as of other cellular proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). The autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor serves to recruit proteins containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains such as phospholipase Cγ(3.Hernandez-Sotomayer S.M.T. Carpenter G. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar), the subsequent phosphorylation of which increases phosphatidylinositol metabolism, and the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol(3.Hernandez-Sotomayer S.M.T. Carpenter G. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, recruitment of the SH2-containing proteins such as Grb2 and other adaptor proteins to the phosphotyrosine-containing domains on the EGF receptor also leads to the activation of serine/threonine phosphorylation cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade(4.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). In addition, EGF has also been documented to modulate the cAMP second messenger system. Studies from our laboratory have shown that EGF increases contractility, beating rate, and cAMP accumulation in the heart (5.Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by stimulating adenylyl cyclase via a process involving Gsα(6.Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Biochem.

Moreover, the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is important for EGF-mediated stimulation of cardiac adenylyl cyclase(8.Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One implication of this latter finding is that one, or more, of the signaling elements involved in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by the activated EGF receptor is(are) phosphorylated. Therefore, we have proposed the hypothesis that EGF phosphorylates Gsα and activates this G protein to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. This hypothesis incorporates the requirement for Gsα and the EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the two components which our previous studies have determined to be required for EGF-elicited stimulation of the effector, adenylyl cyclase(7.Nair B.G.

The studies of Hausdorff et al.(12.Hausdorff W.P Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that in vitro, pp60c-srcphosphorylates Gsα and that in reconstitution experiments with the β-adrenergic receptor, β-adrenoreceptor agonists such as isoproterenol augment GTPγS binding to phosphorylated Gsα to a greater extent than to nonphosphorylated Gsα. The tyrosine kinase pp60c-srcphosphorylates Gsα on tyrosine residues 37 and 377 (13.Moyers J.S. Linder M.E. Shannon J.D. Parsons S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with a stoichiometry between 0.4 and 0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of Gsα(12.Hausdorff W.P Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To date, phosphorylation of Gsα by tyrosine kinases other than pp60c-src, and in particular receptor protein tyrosine kinases, has not been reported. Therefore, to address our aforementioned hypothesis we have investigated whether or not the EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Gsα and modulates its activity. Our data demonstrate that the activated EGF receptor (EGFR) stoichiometrically phosphorylates Gsα and activates this protein as monitored by its ability to bind GTPγS and activate adenylyl cyclase. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGF receptor with a concomitant increase in activity of this protein. The BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmid pQE-60, containing cDNA encoding the 45-kDa form of bovine Gsα, was obtained from Alfred Gilman (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Expression of Gsα was induced with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and the protein was purified essentially as described by Graziano et al.(14.Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 192-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bovine brain βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins were purified to homogeneity as described by Mumby et al.(15.Mumby S. Pang I.-H. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2020-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Neer et al.(16.Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric Gs was reconstituted by mixing active Gsα and βγ subunits (active Gsα: βγ ratio = 1:1) and incubating for 30 min at 4°C; amount of active Gsα was determined from maximal GTPγ35S binding (described below). EGFR was purified from A431 cells as described previously(17.Hubler L. Levanthal P.S. Bertics P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Monomeric Gsα (500 ng, equivalent to 110 pmol) or Gsα:βγ heterotrimer (1:1) were phosphorylated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgSO4, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μM ATP and 100 nM EGF. Sodium vanadate (50 μM), GDP or GTPγS (3-10 μM), and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi; 6000 Ci/mmol) were added where indicated. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 0.21 pmol (33 ng) of purified EGFR and continued at 25°C for 60 min. Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gels) and visualized by autoradiography. Wherever necessary, phosphorylated proteins were excised from the gels and quantitated by scintillation counting. Following phosphorylation of Gsα and SDS-PAGE as described above, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Following autoradiography to locate the phosphoproteins on the PVDF membrane, the portions of the PVDF containing the proteins of interest were excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis exactly as described by Martensen(18.Martensen T. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, PVDF was rinsed with 2 × 1.0 ml water and hydrolyzed for 60 min at 110°C in 6 N HCl, followed by evaporation to dryness in a vacuum desiccator (Speedvac, Savant). Hydrolyzate was washed with 1.0 ml of H2O and 1.0 ml of 0.1 N formic acid (HCOOH) prior to application on to a column of Dowex AG 50W-X2 (H+), 100-200 mesh (Bio-Rad) in 0.2 ml of 0.1 N HCOOH. Phosphoamino acids were eluted with 2 × 0.2 ml of 0.1 N HCOOH and 1 × 0.6 ml of 0.1 N HCOOH and separated by thin layer electrophoresis on cellulose acetate-coated plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in pyridine/glacial acetic acid/H2O (10:100:1890), pH 3.5 at 750 V for 90 min. Phosphoamino acids were located by autoradiography and identified by comigration with phosphoamino acid standards visualized with ninhydrin. After incubation with and without EGFR or ATP, Gsα was separated from EGFR by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Membrane was blocked in 10% newborn calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Zymed Inc.; 1:1,000 dilution). After washing, the membranes were exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad; 1:20,000 dilution). The Western blot was developed with the Amersham Corp. ECL system. GTPase activity was measured as described by Brandt et al.(19.Brandt D.R. Assano T. Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4357-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and modified by Okamoto et al.(20.Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 68: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ng of Gsα (monomeric or heterotrimeric) were phosphorylated in the presence of 3 μM GDP. GTPase activity was then monitored in medium containing the following at final concentration: 25 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 110 μM EDTA, 200 μM MgSO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 nM [γ-32P]GTP (total volume, 1 ml). Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at various times and transferred to tubes containing ice-cold 5% (w/v) Norit A in 50 mM NaH2PO4. Following centrifugation, the 32P content of the supernatants was measured by scintillation counting. GTPγ35S binding was measured by the method of Northup et al.(21.Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Sun et al.(22.Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Essentially, heterotrimeric Gs (500 ng of Gsα) were phosphorylated in the presence of 10 μM GDP as described above. GTPγ35S binding was initiated by addition of 0.98 ml of a buffer containing the following at final concentration: 50 μM Hepes, pH 8.0, 120 μM MgSO4, 100 μM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 nM GTPγ35S. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were withdrawn at various times and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ice-cold 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, and 25 mM MgSO4 to terminate the binding reaction. Bound and unbound GTPγ35S were separated by rapid filtration through BA85 nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μM; Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of excess (100 μM) unlabeled GTPγS, and maximal binding was measured in the presence of 1 μM GTPγ35S and 25 mM MgSO4. The ability of heterotrimeric nonphosphorylated Gs and phospho-Gs to activate adenylyl cyclase activity in mouse lymphoma S49 cyc- cell membranes was measured as described by Sun et al.(22.Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, heterotrimeric Gs was phosphorylated in the presence of 10 μM GDP; nonphosphorylated Gs was similarly treated in the absence of EGFR. Both forms of Gs were then preincubated for 60 min at 25°C, with GTPγS (100 nM) in the GTPγS binding buffer described above except that the Mg2+ concentration was 500 μM. The phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Gs (1.1 pmol) were then reconstituted with 10 μg of S49 cyc- membrane protein for 5 min at 0°C. Adenylyl cyclase reactions were performed in quadruplicate as described by Sun et al.(22.Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Previous data from this laboratory have demonstrated that EGF stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity in cardiac membranes via activation of Gsα(6.Nair B.G. Rashed H.M. Patel T.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7.Nair B.G. Parikh B. Milligan G. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21317-21322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the EGFR protein tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for this effect(8.Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to determine whether or not the EGFR protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Gsα and to evaluate the functional significance of such a phosphorylation, experiments were performed with the purified EGFR and pure Gsα. Initially, the ability of the EGFR kinase to phosphorylate Gsα as a function of time and the dependence of this phosphorylation on the presence of EGFR and ATP were determined. As illustrated by the data in Fig. 1, the purified EGF receptor increased phosphorylation of Gsα in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A); maximal phosphorylation of the Gsα was obtained 60 min after initiation of the phosphorylation reaction at 25°C. Moreover, as demonstrated by the data in Fig. 1B, the phosphorylation of Gsα was dependent upon the presence of the EGFR and ATP. In studies similar to those depicted in Fig. 1, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of Gsα by EGFR was determined to be 1.73 ± 0.3 (n = 4) mol of Pi incorporated/mol of Gsα. As a control, the stoichiometry of autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor was monitored in parallel and found to be 4.5 ± 0.5 (n = 5) sites phosphorylated per mol of the EGFR. While the latter data confirm the published stoichiometry of the EGFR autophosphorylation(23.Margolis B.J. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honegger A.M. Howk R. Givol D. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10667-10671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the former results indicate that there are two sites on the Gsα that are phosphorylated by the EGFR. To determine whether the phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGF receptor was on tyrosine residues or involved phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues also, two approaches were pursued. First, Gsα was phosphorylated by the EGFR in the presence of unlabeled ATP, and following separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE and transfer onto nitrocellulose, Western analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were performed. The data depicted in Fig. 2A demonstrate that both the EGFR and Gsαare phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and phosphorylation of Gsα is dependent on the presence of ATP and EGFR (see also Fig. 1B). In additional experiments, phosphoamino acid analyses of 32P-labeled Gsα and autophosphorylated EGFR (positive control) demonstrated that the phosphorylation of both the EGFR and Gsα was exclusively on tyrosine residues (Fig. 2B). In the studies involving pp60c-src-mediated phosphorylation of Gsα, the GDP-bound form of Gsα was reported to be a better substrate for the kinase (12.Hausdorff W.P Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of GDP on phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGFR kinase. In these experiments, Gsα was phosphorylated by the EGFR kinase in the presence of different GDP concentrations. Following separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, the protein bands corresponding to EGFR and Gsα were excised from the gels and counted for 32P content. The data in Fig. 3A demonstrate that, while the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor was not altered by GDP, phosphorylation of Gsα was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner such that, at GDP concentrations in excess of 3 μM, the phosphorylation of Gsα was decreased by 50%. Similarly, GTPγS also inhibited by 50% the phosphorylation of Gsα without altering the autophosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 3A). Thus, in the presence of guanine nucleotides, the stoichiometry of Gsα phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase was decreased from 2 mol Psα/mol of Gsα to 1 mol of Psα/mol of Gsα (0.7 ± 0.3 mol of Psα/mol Gsα (n = 3)). Interestingly, in the absence of GDP or GTPγS, the addition of G protein βγ subunits did not alter the phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGFR kinase (Fig. 3B, cf. lanes 1 and 3). However, in the presence of GDP (10 μM), βγ subunits protected against the GDP-mediated inhibition of phosphorylation of Gsα (Fig. 3B, cf. lanes 2 and 4), and therefore, the stoichiometry of Gsα phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase in the presence of GDP and βγ subunits was 2 mol of Pi/mol of Gsα. Similar protection against inhibition of phosphorylation of Gsα by GTPγS was also seen in the presence of βγ subunits (not shown). Notably, the βγ subunits were not phosphorylated by the EGFR kinase (Fig. 3B). The finding that GDP inhibited phosphorylation of Gsα (Fig. 3A) is in stark contrast to the effects of this nucleotide on phosphorylation of Gsα by pp60c-src(12.Hausdorff W.P Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but similar to the effects of GDP on phosphorylation of the small molecular weight G protein by EGFR reported by Hart et al.(24.Hart M.J. Polakis P.G. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5990-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite effects of GDP on phosphorylation of Gsα by EGFR and pp60c-src suggest that the sites on Gsα phosphorylated by these two protein tyrosine kinases may be different. To determine the specificity of phosphorylation of Gsα by EGFR kinase, we also investigated the ability of the EGFR kinase to phosphorylate Giα2. As compared with phosphorylation of Gsα, the EGFR kinase phosphorylated Giα2 with a very low stoichiometry (0.4 pmol Pi/mole of Giα2) (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the report of Hart et al.(24.Hart M.J. Polakis P.G. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5990-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that EGFR kinase phosphorylated Giα and Goα with a very low stoichiometry. Hence, it would appear that the EGFR kinase selectively phosphorylates Gsα. In vivo, under basal conditions, prior to activation of the EGFR, the Gsα would be predominantly in the GDP bound heterotrimeric form. Therefore, to study the functional consequences of Gsα phosphorylation, this situation was recreated in in vitro studies by phosphorylating the Gsα by the EGFR kinase as a heterotrimer (i.e. presence of βγ and GDP) a condition under which Gsα is phosphorylated on two sites (see Fig. 3B). The data in Fig. 4A demonstrate that the GTPase activity of the phospho-Gsα was 2-fold greater than that of its nonphosphorylated counterpart; in these experiments, controls with βγ subunits plus EGFR alone were found to have negligible activity (not shown). This increase in GTPase activity of the phosphorylated Gsα also suggests that the EGFR kinase phosphorylates Gsα on tyrosine residues which may be different to those phosphorylated by the pp60c-src(13.Moyers J.S.

J. 1995; 305: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) since phosphorylation of Gsα by the latter kinase does not alter its GTPase activity(12.Hausdorff W.P Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Linder M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5720-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) . As a second approach to assess functional significance, experiments were also performed to determine if phosphorylation of Gsα by EGFR kinase altered the ability of the protein to bind GTPγS. As demonstrated by the data in Fig. 4B, phospho-Gsα bound GTPγS at a greater rate and to a larger extent as compared to the nonphosphorylated Gsα; GTPγS binding to βγ subunits plus EGFR (control) was negligible (not shown). These data (Fig. 4, A and B) strongly suggested that phosphorylation of Gsα in its heterotrimeric form (i.e. in presence of GDP and βγ subunits) markedly activated this G protein. Therefore, to determine whether or not the phosphorylated Gsα was indeed more effective as an activator of adenylyl cyclase, experiments were performed employing S49 cyc- cell membranes which do not contain any endogenous Gsα(25.Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3333-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . The data from these experiments demonstrated that upon reconstitution of equal amounts of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Gsα with cyc- membranes, the adenylyl cyclase activity was 2-fold greater in the presence of the phospho-Gsα than its non-phosphorylated counterpart (Fig. 4C). In controls performed with βγ subunits with the EGFR (control), adenylyl cyclase activity was very low and comparable to the activity in the absence of any additions (cf. Fig. 4C and (22.Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) ). Since GDP and GTPγS inhibit phosphorylation of Gsα similarly (Fig. 3), and because the structures of GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Gα subunits are different; see e.g. with transducin α subunit (Gtα) (26.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and Giα(27.Coleman D.E. Lee E. Mixon M.B. Linder M.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. J.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), our data (Fig. 3A) would suggest that the tyrosine residue(s) whose phosphorylation is(are) altered by the guanine nucleotides is(are) not located in the regions of the molecule that change conformation upon exchange of GDP for GTP. Indeed the crystal structure data of the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Gtα and Giα(26.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 27.Coleman D.E. Lee E. Mixon M.B. Linder M.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. J. Mol.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) indicate that the GTP-bound form of Gα subunits are different from the GDP-bound form in essentially three regions (switch I, switch II, and switch III) none of which contains tyrosine residues(26.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, on Gsα, tyrosine residues (Tyr-176 and −239) are located proximal to switch I and switch III regions and it is plausible that phosphorylation of one or both of these residues by the EGF receptor increases the rate of GTPγS binding that is observed (Fig. 4B). Likewise since tyrosine residues (Tyr-325, −344, and −346) are also located in the proximity of adenylyl cyclase interacting regions on Gsα (see e.g.(26.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar)), it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of one of these residues increases the interaction of Gsα with adenylyl cyclase, thereby augmenting activity as observed in Fig. 4C. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the heterotrimeric form of Gs by the EGF receptor was not altered by either GDP (Fig. 3B) or GTPγS (not shown) suggesting that the tyrosine residues on Gsα that are phoshorylated reside in region(s) whose conformation is stabilized by the βγ subunits. Additional studies which will identify the sites on Gsα that are phosphorylated by the EGF receptor will provide more mechanistic information in the light of the crystal structure of Gtα and Giα. Presently, from the data presented in Fig. 3, we can conclude that guanine nucleotide binding (either GDP or GTP) inhibits the phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGF receptor and that βγ subunits protect against such inhibition of phosphorylation. Several laboratories have reported the phosphorylation of α subunits of G proteins by different kinases as a potential regulatory event in signal transduction. However, functional significance of the phosphorylation has been demonstrated in only a few of the studies. Thus it is clear that phosphorylation of Giα2 by protein kinase C decreases the activity of this G protein(9.Pyne N.J. Murphy G.J. Milligan G. Houslay M.D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10.Bushfield M. Pyne N.J. Houslay M.D. Eur. J.

On the other hand, the functional consequence of phosphorylation of Gzα by protein kinase C (29.Lounsbury K.M. Casey P. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. Similarly, although the α subunits of transducin(30.Zick Y. Sagi-Eisenberg Pines M. Gierschik P. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9294-9297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), Go, and Gi(31.Krupinski J. Rajaram R. Lakonishok M. Benovic J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12333-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the functional consequences of these phosphorylations remain unknown. It should be noted that Gsα is not phosphorylated to any significant extent by either protein kinase C (29.Lounsbury K.M. Casey P. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22051-22056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase(31.Krupinski J. Rajaram R. Lakonishok M. Benovic J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12333-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, our findings for the first time, demonstrate the phosphorylation of Gsα by a receptor protein tyrosine kinase and provide information concerning the alteration in Gsα function due to these phosphorylations. Most importantly, the data presented here provide a tenable mechanism for EGF-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Notably, however, this may not be the only mechanism involved in EGF-elicited stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity but may represent one of two different, but not mutually exclusive, manners by which EGF may augment adenylyl cyclase activity. Hence, recently we have shown that a juxtamembrane 13-amino acid sequence in the EGFR can activate Gs and thereby stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (22.Sun H. Seyer J.M. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2229-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that upon binding to its receptors, EGF stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptors which results in a change in the conformation of the cytosolic domain of the EGF receptor from a compact to an extended form (32.Cadena D.L. Chan C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby, allows the juxtamembrane region to interact with and stimulate Gs. However, in addition to this mode of activation of Gs, simultaneous phosphorylation of Gsα by the EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase could, in a mutually reinforcing manner, amplify the signal from EGFR to Gs and ultimately to adenylyl cyclase, since the phospho-Gsα is a better activator of this effector (Fig. 4C). This latter possibility, i.e. amplification of signaling by combinatorial effects of phosphorylation and interaction of the cytosolic, juxtamembrane, region of the EGF receptor with Gs and its implications on adenylyl cyclase activity remains to be experimentally tested. In conclusion, we have presented experimental evidence to demonstrate that EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate Gsα on tyrosine residues and stimulate the functional activity of this G protein. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a receptor protein tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate and activate Gs. Moreover, these data provide mechanistic insights into EGF-elicited stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Presently, the identity of the tyrosine residues on Gsα that are phosphorylated by EGFR kinase remain to be elucidated. However, stoichiometry analyses indicate that at least 2 tyrosine residues are phosphorylated. Whether or not the phosphorylation of one of these 2 tyrosine residues alters the GTPase and GTPγS binding activities preferentially or phosphorylation of both tyrosines is required to observe the functional changes is not known. These questions and the possibility that there may be a hierarchy in the phosphorylation of the two tyrosines on Gsα by the EGFR kinase forms the subject of our future investigations.

Gilman (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) for providing us with the BL21-DE3 strain of E. coli transformed to express recombinant Gsα (45 kDa).

Once αⅡbβ3 has bound adhesive ligand in a platelet aggregate, the detergent-insoluble αⅡbβ3 redistributes (along with the detergent-insoluble membrane skeleton proteins and a variety of signaling molecules) to a fraction that contains cytoplasmic actin filaments. Concomitantly, certain signaling molecules are activated. The present study shows that, in intact platelets, αⅡbβ3 forms clusters when occupied by ligand and is selectively moved into the open canalicular system; αⅡbβ3 that has not bound ligand remains diffusely distributed at the periphery of the cell. When cytoplasmic actin filaments are depolymerized by cytochalasins, the ability of αⅡbβ3 to bind ligand is decreased, and the movement of ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 is prevented. Together with the previous findings, these results suggest that (i) membrane skeleton-associated αⅡbβ3 is selectively induced to bind ligand in activated platelets, (ii) ligand-induced transmembrane signaling causes an altered association of membrane skeleton-associated αⅡbβ3 with the cytoplasmic component of the cytoskeleton, (iii) ligand-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations stabilize the interaction between ligand and integrin, and (iv) ligand-occupancy triggers cytoskeletal reorganizations that result in selective movements of occupied ligand.

Integrins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that bind adhesive molecules and play important roles in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions(1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3054) Google Scholar). Several integrins are unable to bind their ligand unless the cells are activated(2.Hemler M.E. Elices M.J.

Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When platelets are activated, unidentified intracellular events act on αⅡbβ3 to induce binding of fibrinogen to the extracellular domain of the receptor; by cross-linking αⅡbβ3 molecules on adjacent platelets, fibrinogen is thought to mediate the formation of platelet aggregates. Although binding of the adhesive ligand is initially reversible, it becomes irreversible after several minutes(8.Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9.Peerschke E.I.B. Semin. Hematol. 1985; 22: 241-259PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of adhesive ligand to αⅡbβ3 in a platelet aggregate induces a number of intracellular events, including phosphorylation of specific proteins on tyrosine residues(10.Ferrell Jr., J.E.

How αⅡbβ3 is induced to bind adhesive ligand, how binding is rendered irreversible, or how binding of adhesive ligand to the extracellular domain of αⅡbβ3 activates intracellular signaling molecules are all unanswered questions. The cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of platelets is coated by a membrane skeleton that associates with the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane glycoproteins and with underlying cytoplasmic actin filaments(18.Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19.Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.J. J.

When platelets are lysed with Triton X-100, the cytoplasmic actin filaments can be sedimented by low speed centrifugation. The membrane skeleton separates from the cytoplasmic filaments; the fragments of membrane skeleton and associated membrane glycoproteins require higher g forces to be sedimented(19.Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that some αⅡbβ3 sedimented with fragments of the membrane skeleton from lysates of unstimulated platelets(21.Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction that contained the cytoplasmic component of the cytoskeleton. We suggested that the membrane skeleton may play a role in regulating the activation of αⅡbβ3, that binding of ligand to membrane skeleton-associated αⅡbβ3 causes the integrin-skeleton complexes to undergo an altered association with cytoplasmic actin forming “focal contact-like” structures, and that these focal contact-like structures may in turn play an important role in positioning signaling molecules and in regulating the ability of such molecules to mediate integrin-induced signaling events(21.Fox J.E.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was based on the co-sedimentation of the integrin with detergent-insoluble fractions. In the present study, we provide evidence that membrane skeleton-associated αⅡbβ3 binds ligand and is incorporated into complexes with cytoplasmic actin filaments in intact cells, that the formation of these integrin-cytoskeletal complexes results in stabilization of integrin-ligand interactions and a selective movement of ligand-occupied integrin into the surface-connected open canalicular system. PAC-1 and A5G8 are both monoclonal antibodies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) 1The abbreviations used are: IgimmunoglobulinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. M class that recognize epitopes on αⅡbβ3. PAC-1 is similar to fibrinogen in that it binds only to activated platelets(4.Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Fenton II of the New York Department of Health, Albany, NY) or ADP (Sigma). Unless otherwise stated, activation was induced without stirring. In some experiments, platelets were preincubated with cytochalasins (Sigma), which were added in a final concentration of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Control incubations also contained Me2SO. Platelet aggregation and secretion of ATP were assessed in a lumiaggregometer (Chrono-Log Corporation, Havertown, PA) (25.Fox J.E.B. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9520-9526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al.(26.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44587) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with 125I-labeled anti-IgG (Dupont NEN). Monoclonal antibody PAC-1 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (24.Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated with platelets in the presence of an agonist. At intervals, platelets were diluted into suspension buffer, and the amount of bound PAC-1 was determined by flow cytometry (24.Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Becton Dickinson FACS 440 cytometer, San Jose, CA). For analysis of the reversible and irreversible components of PAC-1 binding, 45-μl aliquots were added to 50 μl of buffer or to the same buffer containing 100 mM EDTA; after 10 min, samples were diluted 3-fold, and the amount of bound PAC-1 was determined. Platelets were activated in the presence of monoclonal antibody PAC-1 or A5G8. Incubations were terminated by addition of 9 volumes of a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 150 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and platelets were allowed to settle onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides(19.Fox J.E.B.

Fixed platelets were permeabilized by addition of a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Carnation milk, 150 mM ammonium acetate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, then washed three times in a buffer that contained a 1:50 dilution of sheep serum (Sigma). Specimens were then incubated with biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgM (Amersham Corp.) for 3 h, washed five times, incubated with Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (Amersham) for 30-60 min, washed another five times, and mounted. In dual-label experiments, platelets that had been activated in the presence of PAC-1, A5G8, or fibrinogen (a kind gift of Dr. Leslie Parise of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) were fixed and permeabilized with Triton X-100. Platelets that had been activated in the presence of PAC-1 or A5G8 were incubated for approximately 16 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against talin, or αⅡbβ3; those that had been incubated with fibrinogen were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against fibrinogen and a monoclonal antibody against αⅡbβ3 (that binds to a site other than that occupied by fibrinogen). Specimens were washed five times, incubated with biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgM to label the monoclonal antibody, washed five times, and incubated with FITC-labeled streptavidin to detect monoclonal antibody and with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG to detect polyclonal antibodies. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Universal microscope or with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope (both equipped with dual fluorescence dichroic filters) and photographed. Platelets were activated with thrombin in the presence of PAC-1. After 15 min, suspensions were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged. The pellets were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, embedded in LR White resin, and 60-90-nm thick sections collected on carbon-Formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were incubated for 4 h with goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM conjugated to 5-nm diameter gold colloid (Janssen Life Sciences Products, Beerse, Belgium). The colloidal gold was silver-enhanced (27.Danscher G. Norgaard J.O.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed in a Philips 301 transmission electron microscope. Platelets were lysed by the addition of a Triton X-100 containing buffer and anti-glycoprotein Ibα (13 μg/ml) and Protein A coupled to 15-nm diameter gold colloid (200 μl) (Janssen) were added(19.Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated at 37°C for 60 min and then fixed in glutaraldehyde. Specimens were processed for electron microscopy and photographed in a JEM 100 CX II microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) (19.Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on studies in detergent-lysed platelets, we have previously suggested that αⅡbβ3 can associate with a submembranous component of the cytoskeleton and that binding of adhesive ligand to αⅡbβ3 leads to altered association of the integrin and membrane skeleton proteins with cytoplasmic actin filaments. If this model is correct, then αⅡbβ3 that had bound its adhesive ligand would be expected to show a different distribution within intact platelets from that of αⅡbβ3 that had not bound ligand. Further, any ligand-induced change in distribution that occurred as a consequence of association of the integrin with cytoplasmic actin would be prevented by disrupting the network of cytoplasmic actin filaments. To determine whether ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 had a different distribution from unoccupied integrin, platelets were incubated with the fibrinogen-mimetic monoclonal antibody, PAC-1. At intervals following thrombin addition, platelets were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and incubated with a polyclonal αⅡbβ3 antibody that bound to both ligand-occupied and -unoccupied αⅡbβ3. The distribution of PAC-1 -occupied and total αⅡbβ3 was visualized by dual-label confocal microscopy. As reported previously(4.Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), virtually no PAC-1 bound to unstimulated, discoid platelets (Fig. 1A) even though αⅡbβ3 was over all of the surface of the platelets (Fig. 1B). As the platelets were activated with thrombin, PAC-1 binding occurred. At early times after platelet activation (e.g. 60 s), PAC-1-occupied αⅡbβ3 was clustered in a few discrete areas (Fig. 1C). However, αⅡbβ3 antibodies revealed that the rest of the αⅡbβ3 was still present over all of the surface of the activated platelet (Fig. 1D). At later times after platelet activation, clusters of PAC-1-occupied αⅡbβ3 became concentrated toward the center of the platelet (Fig. 1E). Polyclonal antibodies revealed that αⅡbβ3 that had not bound PAC-1 was still present in a relatively uniform distribution at the periphery of these platelets (Fig. 1F). The diameters of two representative platelet profiles (1 and 2) in Fig. 1, E and F, have been marked by pairs of arrows. When comparing, profiles 1 + 2 (PAC-1 distribution) in Fig. 1E with profiles 1 + 2 (αⅡbβ3 distribution) in Fig. 1F, it is obvious that the PAC-1 labeling pattern has a much smaller diameter than the αⅡbβ3 labeling pattern in each case, small enough, in fact, to fit within the peripheral αⅡbβ3 labeling pattern. The platelets shown in Fig. 1 had been activated with thrombin at a platelet concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/ml. A similar distribution of PAC-1-occupied αⅡbβ3 was detected on platelets that were activated at a concentration of 1 × 108 platelets/ml (data not shown). Another monoclonal antibody of the IgM class, A5G8, binds to a site on αⅡbβ3 other than that to which adhesive ligand binds; it recognized αⅡbβ3 on both unstimulated and activated platelets and showed a distribution similar to that detected with the polyclonal αⅡbβ3 antibody (data not shown). Thus, the clustering and centralization of PAC-1-occupied αⅡbβ3 presumably results from occupancy of the ligand binding site rather than from the binding of an IgM. Further evidence for this came from experiments in which platelets were incubated with the natural ligand for αⅡbβ3, fibrinogen. As with PAC-1, fibrinogen had a patchy distribution in activated platelets (Fig. 2A). The simultaneous use of an αⅡbβ3 antibody to reveal the outline of the platelet in a dual label experiment (Fig. 2B) showed that, like PAC-1, fibrinogen (shown in Fig. 2A) was concentrated toward the center of activated platelets. To determine whether the clustering and centralization of αⅡbβ3 was induced by cytoplasmic actin filaments, platelets were preincubated with cytochalasins. Cytochalasins inhibit the burst of actin polymerization that occurs when platelets are activated(28.Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29.Casella J.F. Flanagan M.D. Lin S. Nature. 1981; 293: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thin section electron microscopy (Fig. 3) revealed that concentrations of cytochalasins higher than those needed to inhibit actin polymerization also disrupted the preexisting network of cytoplasmic actin filaments. Fig. 3A shows an untreated platelet with intact cytoplasmic actin filaments. Fig. 3B shows that the membrane skeleton remained intact after cytochalasin treatment but that the cytoplasmic actin network was disrupted. In addition, biochemical experiments revealed that, while the amount of actin sedimenting from detergent lysates at low g forces (i.e. networks of cytoplasmic actin) was markedly reduced in cytochalasin-treated cells, the amount of membrane skeleton proteins and αⅡbβ3 that sedimented at high g forces (i.e. in the membrane skeleton fraction) was not detectably altered (data not shown). To determine the effect of disruption of the network of cytoplasmic actin filaments on the ligand-induced redistribution of αⅡbβ3, cytochalasin-treated platelets were incubated with thrombin in the presence of PAC-1, and the distribution of PAC-1 was determined. Ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 still appeared to be present in clusters in the cytochalasin-treated cells (Fig. 4A). However, in contrast to the non-cytochalasin-treated cells (as seen in Figure 1:, Figure 2:), the clusters of ligand-occupied integrin did not move inward but remained at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the same field as seen in Fig. 4A, but now the platelet periphery is delineated by immunolabeled total αⅡbβ3. These results suggest that in non-cytochalasin-treated platelets, ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 associates with cytoplasmic actin and that this association leads to the inwards movement of the occupied integrin. The images shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2: were obtained when platelets were permeabilized with Triton X-100 prior to the addition of the secondary antibodies. Although the intensity of the fluorescence was often weaker, the same clustering and centralization of ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 was detected when the permeabilization step was omitted (Fig. 5) (control experiments using antibodies to actin-binding protein, a protein known to be present only on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, confirmed that the platelets were not permeabilized inadvertently in these experiments) (data not shown). These results suggested that the membranes of the surface-connected open canalicular system were the most likely location of the centralized receptor since the immunolabeling antibody could have gained access via the open channels. To determine if this was the case, thin-section electron microscopy of platelets that had been activated in the presence of PAC-1 and subsequently fixed, sectioned, and incubated with anti-mouse antibodies coupled to 5 nm of colloidal gold was performed. Because the PAC-1 was added prior to sectioning the amount of label in any one section was small. However, some PAC-1 was detected on the surface of the cell (where it would initially bind); any nonperipheral PAC-1 was present in the open canalicular system (Fig. 6, Panels A and B, arrows). When 125 gold particles were counted (representing staining of 127 platelets), 21 were present on the surface of the platelets, 93 in the open canalicular system, and 11 in intracellular areas. In platelets that had not been activated, a total of 13 gold particles were counted in 130 platelets; 3 particles on the surface, 3 in the open canalicular system, and 7 in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These data suggest that the cytoplasmic labeling represents background levels. The finding that ligand-occupied αⅡbβ3 is present primarily in the open canalicular system, is consistent with the observation by others that fibrinogen is localized in the open canalicular system of activated platelets(30.Suzuki H. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Packham M.A. Tanoue K. Yamazaki H. Mustard J.F. Blood. 1988; 71: 1310-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the cytoplasmic actin filaments play a role in regulating the binding of ligand to αⅡbβ3, platelets were incubated with cytochalasin under conditions in which the network of cytoplasmic actin filaments was disrupted and the subsequent ADP-induced binding of PAC-1 to platelets visualized by immunofluorescence (Fig. 7). The images in Panels A, B, and C were generated using similar exposures so that the relative amounts of PAC-1 binding to the platelets in cytochalasin-treated (Panel C) and -untreated cells (Panel B) could be visualized. Comparison of these images revealed that cytochalasin decreased the binding of PAC-1 to ADP-activated platelets. Similar results were obtained when platelets were activated with thrombin (data not shown). The binding of PAC-1 was quantitated by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 8, cytochalasin inhibited the binding of PAC-1 to thrombin-activated platelets in a dose-dependent manner. Cytochalasin also inhibited binding of the natural ligand, fibrinogen, as shown by an inhibition of the thrombin-induced aggregation of a stirred platelet suspension (Fig. 9, top panel). This was a specific inhibitory effect, as shown by the lack of an inhibitory effect on the secretion of ATP (Fig. 9, bottom panel). The concentrations of cytochalasins required to inhibit aggregation (Fig. 9) were comparable to those required to inhibit PAC-1 binding (Fig. 8). The binding of ligand to αⅡbβ3 initially occurs in a reversible manner (it can be reversed by addition of EDTA), but with time it becomes irreversible(8.Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9.Peerschke E.I.B. Semin. Hematol. 1985; 22: 241-259PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the cytoplasmic actin filaments are involved in regulating the reversible or irreversible component of binding, platelets were preincubated in the presence or absence of cytochalasins and activated with thrombin in the presence of PAC-1; after either 5 or 45 min, one aliquot was diluted into buffer while another was diluted into buffer containing EDTA. The irreversible component of binding was defined as the PAC-1 that remained bound to the platelets following dilution in EDTA, while the reversible binding was the difference between that which remained bound in EDTA and that which remained bound in buffer alone. As shown in Fig. 10, cytochalasin E inhibited the reversible binding of PAC-1 by approximately 50%. However, it almost completely inhibited the irreversible binding of PAC-1 to activated platelets. The transmembrane signaling that occurs across integrins is of critical importance in a variety of events such as inflammation, embryonic development, arterial thrombosis, and hemostasis. The mechanisms involved in the two-way signaling across integrins are not well understood. In a previous study(21.Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we provided evidence that the integrin αⅡbβ3 cosedimented with membrane skeleton proteins (e.g. spectrin, talin, and vinculin) from unstimulated platelets, that signaling molecules were associated with the membrane skeleton, and that binding of ligand to αⅡbβ3 caused the membrane skeleton together with associated integrin and signaling molecules to redistribute to the low-speed detergent insoluble fraction. We suggested that αⅡbβ3 was associated with the membrane skeleton, that binding of ligand to αⅡbβ3 caused the membrane skeleton and associated integrin to become incorporated into complexes containing cytoplasmic actin filaments, and that the cytoskeleton might play a role in regulating the two-way signaling across αⅡbβ3. The evidence for these suggestions came entirely from co-sedimentation of proteins in detergent lysates. The goal of the present study was to determine whether αⅡbβ3 and the membrane skeleton become associated with cytoplasmic actin filaments in intact platelets and to determine the consequence of integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations in intact cells. The studies suggest that membrane-skeleton associated αⅡbβ3 binds ligand, clusters, and associates with cytoplasmic actin filaments. The resulting integrin-cytoskeletal complexes allow αⅡbβ3 that has bound ligand to be"

https://openalex.org/W2052995223,"DNA topoisomerases have been proposed as the proteins involved in the formation of the DNA-protein cross-links detected after ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation of cellular DNA. This possibility has been investigated by studying the effects of UV-induced DNA damage on human DNA topoisomerase I action. UV lesions impaired the enzyme's ability to relax negatively supercoiled DNA. Decreased relaxation activity correlated with the stimulation of cleavable complexes. Accumulation of cleavable complexes resulted from blockage of the rejoining step of the cleavage-religation reaction. Mapping of cleavage sites on the pAT153 genome indicated UV-induced cleavage at discrete positions corresponding to sites stimulated also by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, except for one. Subsequent analysis at nucleotide level within the sequence encompassing the UV-specific cleavage site revealed the precise positions of sites stimulated by camptothecin with respect to those specific for UV irradiation. Interestingly, one of the UV-stimulated cleavage sites was formed within a sequence that did not contain dimerized pyrimidines, suggesting transmission of the distortion, caused by photodamage to DNA, into the neighboring sequences. These results support the proposal that DNA structural alterations induced by UV lesions can be sufficient stimulus to induce cross-linking of topoisomerase I to cellular DNA."

INTRODUCTIONThe in vivo activities of several lysosomal hydrolases require the presence of small (~80 amino acids) heat stable activator proteins or saposins(1.Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Furst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

Saposin C was first described by Ho and O'Brien (4.Ho M.W. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2810-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) in 1971 as a soluble factor that stimulated the activity of acid β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.45, N-acyl-sphingosyl-β-D-glucoside:glucohydrolase). This saposin and three other highly homologous saposins, A, B and D, are derived from the same precursor, prosaposin, by proteolytic processing(5.Nakano T. Sandhoff K. Stumper J. Christomanou H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6.O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N. Wenger D.A. Esch F. Fluharty A.L.

Kao R.-T. Jones C. Morse H. Law M. Wenger D.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar). Saposins A, B, C, and D are encoded in the same reading frame of a primary transcript (see Fig. 1A)(5.Nakano T. Sandhoff K. Stumper J. Christomanou H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6.O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N. Wenger D.A. Esch F. Fluharty A.L.

In addition to their highly similar sequences (~50% amino acid identity), each saposin has six strictly conserved cysteines (see Fig. 1B). For each saposin the primary amino acid sequences have been determined chemically and predicted from the cDNA(5.Nakano T. Sandhoff K. Stumper J. Christomanou H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem.

Dagan O. Horowitz M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the disulfide structures of saposins B and C have been solved (10.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9953-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and those for saposins A and D are likely identical.Saposin B functions as a physiological solubilizer of the glycosphingolipid substrates for arylsulfatase A (sulfatide, in vivo), α-galactosidase A (globotriaosylceramide, in vitro), and β-galactosidase (GM1-ganglioside, in vitro)(2.Furst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The affinities of these substrates for saposin B apparently forms the basis for its differential metabolic effects, and a general model has been proposed for its mechanism of action(2.Furst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The physiologic functions of saposins A and D are not defined, although in vitro and ex vivo studies show that saposin D enhances ceramidase activity(11.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Although saposin C is structurally similar to saposin B, the saposin C mechanism of action is different and less completely defined. Saposin C binds to and may transfer gangliosides between artificial membranes (12.Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but it does not bind glucosylceramide, the acid β-glucosidase substrate(13.Berent S.L. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 664: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Saposin C binds directly to acid β-glucosidase (13.Berent S.L. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 664: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and may alter the structure of negatively charged phospholipid, particularly phosphatidylserine, interfaces(10.Vaccaro A.M.

Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter may interfere with a binding site on the enzyme for phosphatidylserine, leading to diminished activation(13.Berent S.L. Radin N.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, recombinant (15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chemically synthesized (16.Weiler S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Barranger J.A. Tomich J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 756-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) peptides were used to regionally localize the activation and binding components of saposin C to its carboxyl-terminal 50%.During the conduct of these studies, prosaposin was shown to have glycosphingolipid binding and transport properties (12.Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and neurotrophic effects in vitro(17.O'Brien J.S. Carson G.S.

The neurite outgrowth properties of prosaposin appear to regionally localize to the NH2-terminal 50% of saposin C(18.O'Brien J.S. Carson G.S. Seo H.-C. Hiraiwa M. Weiler S. Tomich J.M. Barranger J.A.

Consequently, the biological roles of prosaposin may be multidimensional and include plasma membrane-mediated signal transduction events as well as essential intracellular glucosylceramide catabolic regulation. In this communication recombinant and chemically synthesized saposin Cs are used to explore the functional segregation of its neurotrophic and activation properties. A variety of chimeric and mutagenized saposin Cs were created to characterize residues critical to its neurotrophic effects and its interaction with acid β-glucosidase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following were from commercial sources: 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and Ceredase(™) (Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA); phosphatidylserine (Avanti, Alabaster, AL); Sequenase(™) and Sequenase kit (U.

Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH); restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); oligonucleotide synthesis and PhastSystem reagents (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); pET 21-a(+) DNA vector, Escherichia coli host strain [BL21 (DE3)] and His•Bind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI); Magic(™) polymerase chain reaction prep kits and Magic(™) Minipreps kit (Promega, Madison, WI); C4-reverse phase Delta-pak 300A, 5 μm, 3.9×150-mm HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographES-MSelectrospray-mass spectrometry. column (Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA); ciliary neurotrophic factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); Dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma); synthesized saposin peptides (N22-A31, Q48-G55, and T53-L62; >98% purity), human angiotensin I, II, and III, and bradykinin (Penisula Laboratories, Inc., Belmont, CA). Cell line Neuro2A was from Dr. Richard Ackeson (Cincinnati, OH), and NS20Y was from Dr. Marshall Nirenberg (National Institutes of Health). Organic solvents were HPLC grade, and other chemicals were reagent grade or better. The full-length mouse prosaposin cDNA was cloned from a λZap library (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) and fully characterized by sequence analysis. It was identical to those previously reported(9.Reiner O. Dagan O. Horowitz M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 225-235PubMed Google Scholar).Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Saposins and Saposin FragmentsOligonucleotides were synthesized with a Gene Assembler 4 (Pharmacia) and used without purification. The normal and mutant saposins and fragments are shown in Fig. 2(A and B). The mature NH2-terminal amino acid from the natural saposin C or B will be designated 1 for numbering purposes to identify the inclusive amino acids in a fragment (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). For the chimeric saposins the amino acid numbers will correspond to those in the original saposin, e.g. in the saposin containing the NH2-terminal 50% of saposin B, residues 1-41, and the carboxyl-terminal 50% of saposin C, residues 42-80, the saposin B or C amino acids will be those from the cognate saposin; i.e. saposin B(1-41)C(42-80). The DNAs for the chimeric saposins composed of human saposins B and C or human and mouse saposin C were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction. The constructs were cloned into BamHI-HindIII or BamHI-EcoRI sites of pET 21-a(+). Single or multiple point mutations were introduced into saposin C by polymerase chain reaction in the presence of a mutagenic oligonucleotide and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII or BamHI-BsiWI sites of pET 21-a(+). The fidelity of all saposin constructs was verified by sequence analyses. Those saposin C constructs expressed by pET 21-a(+) contained the nonsaposin [pET 21-a(+)] amino acids MASMTGGQQMGRGS (NH2-terminal) and KLAAALEHHHHHH (carboxyl-terminal). For saposin B the sequence was the same on the NH2 terminus and was KENSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH on the carboxyl end. These have been shown not to alter saposin function(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequencing showed the absence of the initiating Met as expected because the immediate downstream amino acid is an alanine. In E. coli the presence of this Ala signals the cleavage of the preceding Met(19.Hirel P.-H. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mature saposin C NH2-terminal amino acid (see Fig. 1B) is designated 1. The nomenclature used is as in the following example: saposin C(1-41)B(42-80) means that the chimeric saposin contains residues 1-41 from saposin C and residues 42-80 from saposin B. MC refers to the mouse saposin C. The AC50 value refers to the concentration of saposin required to achieve 50% of maximal acid β-glucosidase activation. The competition column refers to the ability of saposins that do not activate acid β-glucosidase to decrease the activity of the enzyme in the presence of 100 nM wild-type saposin C (15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A minus sign means that no effect was observed up to 500 nM. The blanks indicate those saposin Cs that activated the enzyme and were not tested as competitors. A depicts saposins that maintain the complete sequence length of saposin C that were chimeric (rows 3-8) or point-mutated (rows 9-16). B shows fragments that were synthesized recombinantly (rows 1-5) or chemically (rows 6-8). Red. Sap. C refers to the reduced and carboxymethylated saposin C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of the saposins in E. coli followed transformation into BL21(DE3) cells that contain a isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside inducible T7-polymerase gene(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformations, incubations, inductions with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, cell harvest, and isolation of pure proteins were as described previously(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Natural saposin C was purified from Gaucher disease spleen as described(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).HPLC (C4 column) purification of the saposins was in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient (0-40% in 5 min and then 40-75% in 35 min) and were monitored by UV detection at 225 nm. The major peaks were collected and dried by rotatory evaporation and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid analysis by Edman degradation and/or mass determination by electrospray-mass spectrometry (ES-MS) (PE Sciex API-III, PE Sciex, Thornhill, Canada). A delivery solvent of a methanol/water (1:1, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid was used for flow injection experiments at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Dried proteins were reduced by dissolving with 6 M guanidine HCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. (0.2 ml) with dithiothreitol (1 M, 5 μl) for 3 h at 37°C. The proteins were reisolated by HPLC as above. The expected molecular weights were calculated (DNAsis, Hitachi Software Engineering, San Bruno, CA) from the predicted amino acid sequence of the fully reduced normal or mutant saposin including the flanking vector derived NH2-terminal amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal His-tag (see above).Estimation of Enzyme ActivityAcid β-glucosidase activities in the presence of phosphatidylserine and saposins were estimated by quantitating the fluorescent intensity of liberated 4-methylumbelliferone from the fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Osiecki-Newman K. Fabbro D. Legler G. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 915: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The usual reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 2 nM acid β-glucosidase, phosphatidylserine (0.4 μg/ml), 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (4 mM), 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.7, and the indicated amounts of saposin(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC50 is used to indicate the activator concentration required to achieve 50% of maximal activity. Reactions were for 15-30 min (37°C) and were terminated by the addition of 2.35 ml of 0.1 M ethylene diamine. Protein concentrations were estimated using bovine serum albumin as a standard(22.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.J. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Neurite Outgrowth AssaysNeuro2A and NS20Y cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C. Neuro2A or NS20Y cells (4 × 104) during exponential growth phase were distributed in 35-mm polystyrene dishes and incubated for 24 h at which time the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum with or without added saposin peptides. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The number of cells bearing neurites were counted in several randomly chosen fields (200×). Neurites were identified by the presence of growth cones. Cells bearing neurites longer than 1.0× the cell diameter were scored as positive. Positive controls included ciliary neurotrophic factor (2.2 nM) for NS20Y cells and dibutyryl-cAMP for Neuro2A cells(23.Uemura K.-I. Sugiyama E. Taketomi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the mean and standard error from over 200 cells in each of at least three independent experiments. t tests were performed using Statview (Abacus Concepts Inc, Berkeley, CA).RESULTSFunctional Segregation Neurotrophic and Acid β-Glucosidase Activation Effects of Saposin CNatural splenic and recombinant saposin Cs at equimolar concentrations (~1-6 nM) similarly promoted neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A (Fig. 3A) (p > 0.64) and NS20Y cells (Fig. 3B) (p > 0.5). The neurite outgrowth was much greater with NS20Y cells. Recombinant saposin C(1-41) (Fig. 3B) had similar effects, whereas saposin C(42-80) had no major effect (p > 0.2). In Neuro2A cells saposin C(42-80) reproducibly inhibited neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3A) (p < 0.01). Neurite outgrowth effects of saposin C(1-41) and saposin C(1-41)B(42-80) were similar in NS20Y cells (Fig. 3B). Saposin B(1-41)C(42-80) has no major effect on neurite outgrowth (p = 0.9). Chemically synthesized saposin C(22-31) has about 50-70% of the neurite effect of the saposin C(1-41) (Fig. 3B) and about 30% greater effects at 43 nM compared with 8.6 nM (p = 0.015). These amounts were 1-6 times more than those used for saposin C or saposin C(1-41). Saposin C(48-55) or C(53-63) at ~40 nM had little effect compared with saposin C(22-31) (p < 0.008).Figure 3:Neurite outgrowth effects of saposin C derivatives on Neuro2A (A) and NS20Y (B) cells. 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP (A) and 2.2 nM ciliary neurotrophic factor (B, CNTF) were used as controls for the positive effects in Neuro2A and NS20Y, respectively. The mean and standard errors are based on results from three separate experiments, each with over 200 cells counted. The absence of error bars means that the error was too small to display. The concentrations and saposin derivatives are shown below. n-Saposin C and r-saposin C refer to the natural and the recombinant saposin Cs, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In comparison, the acid β-glucosidase activation effect was mediated by the carboxyl-terminal 50% of saposin C (Fig. 2 and 4). The chimeric saposin B(1-41)C(42-80) had ~70% of the activation effect of wild-type saposin C. Saposin C(1-41)B(42-80) was not active (Fig. 4A). Saposin C(1-41), C(1-58) and saposin C(42-80) were inactive (Fig. 2). These above results show that the neurotrophic and acid β-glucosidase activation properties of saposin C are segregate to the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal 50% of the molecule, respectively. Also, a linear peptide of residues 22-31 is sufficient for neurotrophic effects, but higher order structures in the carboxyl-terminal 50% are needed for acid β-glucosidase activation effects.Figure 4:Activation profiles for acid B-glucosidase by chimeric (A), point-substituted (B), or cysteine-mutated (C) saposin Cs. All assays were conducted in the presence of 2 nM acid B-glucosidase, 0.4 g/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.7. Enzyme was preincubated with phosphatidylserine and saposin C before substrate was added to start the reaction. The fold change refers to the ratio of final to initial activity. The concentration of the saposin was based on the concentration of the homogeneous protein and the determined or calculated molecular weight. In A, saposin C (), saposin B(1-41)C(42-80) (), saposin C(1-41)MC(42-80) (褂), and saposin C(1-41)B(42-80) (■) are shown. In B, saposin C (), saposin C Q48W (), Q48R (), Q48N (褂), Q48I (♦), and Q48A/E49A (■) are shown. In C, the typical effects of cysteine mutated sapsosin Cs are shown. The results are shown for wild-type saposin C (), C72G (♦), C47S (■), C78R (褂), and C78S ().View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of Acid β-Glucosidase Activation by Saposin C Using MutagenesisThe chimeric saposins and point-mutated saposin Cs are shown in Fig. 2. Saposin B was selected as the “backbone” for the chimeric saposins because it does not interact with acid β-glucosidase(15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saposins B and C have the same cysteine placement and disulfide bond structure(10.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Maras B. Siciliano R. Zappacosta F. Amoresano A. Pucci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9953-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting the potential for highly similar folding and disulfide structure in the wild-type and chimeric saposins. HPLC analyses of Ni2+ column purified wild-type and mutant saposins revealed several forms of the recombinant proteins with different retention times (data not shown). ES-MS analyses showed these were oxidized and reduced forms of mono- and dimeric saposins (Table 1). Some of saposin C(1-41) and C(42-80) were dimers linked by inter chain disulfide bonds. Partially oxidized saposin C from the carboxyl-terminal 70% was present in small amounts when wild-type saposin C cDNA was expressed. The NH2-terminal sequence of this peptide was MIDNK, whereas that from the same region of saposin C was TKLIDNK. Presumably, this was due to aberrant initiation in this region. By ES-MS the largest amounts of saposins were monomeric, fully oxidized forms with the expected three disulfide bonds(10.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Maras B. Siciliano R. Zappacosta F. Amoresano A. Pucci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9953-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); these were used for activation studies.Tabled 1Neither saposin B(1-52)C(53-80) nor saposin C(1-52)B(53-80) enhanced acid β-glucosidase activity (Fig. 2A). Saposin C(1-52)B(53-80) or C(1-41)B(42-80) up to 140 nM also did not inhibit wild-type saposin C/acid β-glucosidase interaction (Fig. 2A). Saposin C(1-61)B(59-80) activated acid β-glucosidase to the same level as the wild-type saposin C, but the AC50 was nearly 10-fold increased, i.e. residues 53-61 are important for the binding to but not activation of acid β-glucosidase. Residues 47-50 are strictly conserved in several species (Fig. 1B), but the carboxyl-terminal 50% of the mouse and human saposin Cs differ at 19/39 residues. In the region of residues 48-61, 12 of 14 amino acids are identical or highly similar. Using the cross-species saposin C, HC(1-41)MC(42-80), the AC50 was about 3-4-fold increased (~70 nMversus 15 nM wild-type) and nearly full activation (70-80%) could be achieved. These results provide additional localization to amino acids 47-61 for essential residues for binding to and activation of acid β-glucosidase by saposin C.Chemically synthesized saposins C(22-31), C(48-55), and C(53-63) did not interact with acid β-glucosidase (Fig. 2B). Saposin C(22-31) was used as an internal control because the NH2-terminal is not important for interaction with acid β-glucosidase. Other controls for nonspecific effects included human angiotensin I, II, and III and bradykinin. Reduced and carboxymethylated wild-type saposin C (15.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B) also did not interact with acid β-glucosidase. These findings showed that there is a requirement for higher order structure of saposin C for interaction with acid β-glucosidase.The importance of the highly conserved Gln48 and Glu49 residues (Fig. 1B) was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the expressed mutant saposins that were available in sufficient amounts provided single sharp peaks on HPLC and were in the fully oxidized forms (Table 1). The singly mutated (Q48N) or the doubly mutated Q48A/E49A saposin Cs did not activate the enzyme nor did they compete with wild-type saposin C (Fig. 2). The next series of point substituted saposin Cs were created from the predicted secondary structure (using the Robson algorithm) surrounding the Gln48-Glu49 sequence. As shown in Fig. 5A, wild-type saposin C is predicted to have a major turn near Gln48-Glu49 involving residues 52-55 (Fig. 5). By comparison, neither saposin B nor saposin C Q48N or Q48A/E49A have this turn (Fig. 5B). We assumed that this predicted turn was important for saposin C-acid β-glucosidase interaction. We modeled all possible substitutions at Gln48 and only the highly nonconservative substitutions, Trp, Arg, and Ile were predicted to preserve the turn (Fig. 5C). Similar studies for amino acid substitutions at residues 47-55 showed that Gln48 was the least tolerant of change for preservation of the turn; i.e. 10-15 different substitutions were tolerated at residues other than Gln48. On this basis, saposin Cs Gln48 → Trp, Gln48 → Arg, and Gln48 → Ile were expressed and evaluated. At equimolar amounts these saposins achieved about 70% of the wild-type saposin C stimulation of the enzyme (Fig. 4B). The AC50 values were 2.5-fold (Gln → Trp and Gln → Ile) to 4-fold (Gln→R) increased. These results were similar to those with the saposins B(1-41)C(42-80) and HC(1-41)MC(42-80), both of which retain the predicted turn. These results indicate that the maintenance of the predicted turn is critical to the functional interaction of saposin C and acid β-glucosidase but that other minor secondary structural changes and/or the specific residues within the Gln48-Glu49 region alter the affinity of saposin C for the enzyme and ability to enhance acid β-glucosidase activity.Figure 5:Schematic of the predicted effects on secondary structure for wild-type (A) or mutant (B and C) saposin Cs. The Robson algorithm was used. The boundaries of a predicted helix, sheet, turn, or coil are indicated by the amino acid residue number for ease of orientation. The am"

We have used recombinant versions of human SCF and human Kit extracellular domain (sKit) to study SCF-Kit interactions. By size exclusion chromatography, plus various physical chemical methods including light scattering, sedimentation equilibrium, and titration calorimetry, we demonstrate the formation of complexes containing a dimer of SCF (unglycosylated SCF1-165) plus two molecules of sKit. The concentrations of SCF and sKit in these studies were in the range of 0.35-16.2 μM. The data are analyzed and discussed in the context of several possible models for complex formation. In particular, the sedimentation data are not consistent with a model involving cooperative binding. The Kd estimate for SCF-sKit interaction, obtained by sedimentation equilibrium, is about 17 nM at 25°C. With glycosylated SCF1-165, the Kd is considerably higher.

Kit is a member of the type III tyrosine kinase type receptor family, which also includes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, and FLK2(21.Ullrich A.

It should be noted that platelet-derived growth factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor are both covalently associated dimers (24.Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Wasteson A. Biochem.

The human Kit cDNA encodes a signal sequence (amino acids 1-23) followed by extracellular domain (amino acids 24-520; five Ig-like domains), hydrophobic transmembrane region (amino acids 521-543), and cytoplasmic domain (residues 544-976; split kinase domains)(29.Yarden Y. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). The major expression product at the cell surface is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 145,000(29.Yarden Y. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In comparison, the calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide without signal sequence and without glycosylation is 109,740. As with other tyrosine kinase type receptor families, members of the type III family undergo obligatory dimerization and transphosphorylation as the initial event in ligand-induced signal transduction(21.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Subsequent signaling events initiated by SCF/Kit have been extensively studied in various cell types (see introduction to (30.Wypych J. Bennett L.G. Schwartz M.G. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Broudy V. Bartley T.D. Parker V.P. Langley K.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 66-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Varying somewhat with the system studied, Kd values reported for SCF-Kit interaction have generally been in the range of 0.5-65 nM, although additional higher affinity (16-310 pM) sites of SCF binding have been described for some cell types(31.Lev S.

Most of these affinity determinations have been arrived at using recombinant Escherichia coli-derived soluble SCF (nonglycosylated). The affinity of CHO cell-derived soluble SCF (glycosylated) has been shown to be relatively lower by a factor of 5-10, and its mitogenic potency is lower also(14.Lu H.S. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Wypych J. Lee T.D. Swiderek K. Baltera Jr., R.F. Patel A.C. Brankow D.W. Liu X.-D. Ogden S.G. Karkare S.B. Hu S.S. Zsebo K.M. Langley K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two forms of Kit have been reported. They differ in that one (designated Kit A) has a 4-amino acid insert just prior to the transmembrane domain(39.Vandenmark G.R. deCastro C.M. Taylor H. Dew-Knight S. Kaufman R.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms arise as a result of alternative mRNA splicing(39.Vandenmark G.R. deCastro C.M. Taylor H. Dew-Knight S. Kaufman R.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, soluble Kit (sKit; i.e. Kit extracellular domain) has been found in the conditioned medium of various cells that express Kit (37.Broudy V.C. Kovach N.L. Bennett L.G. Lin N. Jacobsen F.W.

Blood. 1995; 85: 66-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the growth hormone receptor, it has been shown that a monomeric ligand can mediate receptor dimerization(41.Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 42.de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Because the ligands that associate with the type III tyrosine kinase type receptors appear to be dimeric, it is reasonable to suggest that this property may be important for mediating receptor dimerization within this family. However, this has not been definitively shown. Lev et al. (31.Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed and discussed a model for SCF-mediated Kit dimerization in which it is not essential that SCF be dimeric when bound to Kit, and the same group has shown that Kit-Kit interactions play a role in Kit dimerization(43.Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used recombinant human soluble SCFs and recombinant human sKit (Kit extracellular domain) to study the stoichiometries and affinities of SCF-Kit interactions by a variety of physical chemical methods. We demonstrate the formation of a complex containing two molecules of SCF monomer plus two molecules of Kit extracellular domain. E. coli-derived recombinant human SCF1-165 (unglycosylated) and CHO cell-derived recombinant human SCF1-165 (glycosylated) were prepared as described previously(43.Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); their concentrations were determined using ϵ0.1%280 nm of 0.536 and 0.540 liters/g•cm, respectively; these values were calculated from Trp, Tyr, and cystine composition(45.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For the CHO cell-derived human SCF1-165, the ϵ0.1%280 nm and any mass/volume concentrations given are representative of the polypeptide portion only (i.e. excluding attached carbohydrate). Molecular weight values of 18,656 and 18,525 (for monomers) or 37,313 and 37,051 (for dimers) (formula weights, calculated from amino acid sequence; note that the E. coli-derived SCF has a methionine at position −1(44.Langley K.E. Wypych J. Mendiaz E.A. Clogston C.L. Parker V.P. Farrar D.H. Brothers M.O. Satygal V.N. Leslie I. Birkett N.C. Smith K.A. Baltera Jr., R.F. Lyons D.E. Hogan J.M. Crandall C. Boone T.C. Pope J.A.

Biophys. 1992; 295: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) were used along with mass/volume values to arrive at molar concentrations of E. coli-derived or CHO cell-derived (respectively) SCF. Such concentrations therefore refer to SCF monomer in some cases and to SCF dimer in other cases, as indicated. 125I-labeled E. coli-derived human SCF of specific radioactivity 61 mCi/mg was prepared by the lactoperoxidase method(46.Marchalonis J.J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). 12.5 μCi (about 16 million cpm) of the labeled SCF was mixed with 2.4 mg of unlabeled E. coli-derived human SCF such that the volume of the mixture was 0.4 ml. This solution was applied to a Superose 6 size exclusion column (1 × 29 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with PBS. Eluting fractions were collected, and those corresponding to the single peak of A280-absorbing material, representing SCF, were pooled to give a solution of SCF at 1.71 mg/ml and about 6 million cpm/ml. CHO cell-derived recombinant human sKit was expressed and purified as described(38.Turner A.M. Bennett L.G. Lin N.L. Wypych J. Bartley T.D. Hunt R.W. Atkins H.B. Langley K.E. Parker V. Martin F. Broudy V.C. Blood. 1995; 8: 2052-2058Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the expressed sequence and the expected processing of the signal sequence, the material represents amino acids 24-520 according to the numbering of Yarden et al.(29.Yarden Y. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Franke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar), i.e. it corresponds to the entire extracellular domain of Kit. Note that the 4-amino acid insert (residues 510-513) characteristic of the Kit A isoform is present. The material is heavily glycosylated, with mostly N-linked carbohydrate but some O-linked carbohydrate as well(30.Wypych J. Bennett L.G. Schwartz M.G. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Broudy V. Bartley T.D. Parker V.P. Langley K.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 66-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mass/volume concentrations for the sKit were determined using an ϵ0.1%280 nm of 1.185 liters/g.cm, which is a value calculated from Trp, Tyr, and cystine composition (45.Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar); thus these concentrations represent the sKit polypeptide only, exclusive of carbohydrate. Molar concentrations of sKit were determined from mass/volume values using a molecular weight value of 55,815 (calculated from amino acid sequence of the polypeptide). Size exclusion chromatography of SCFs, sKit, and incubated mixtures of SCFs and sKit was carried out using a Superose 6 column (1 × 29 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS at 4°C at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. A280 of eluting material was monitored with a Pharmacia UV-M monitor. The on-line light scattering/chromatography system used three detectors in series: an absorbance monitor at 280 nm (Knauer A293), a laser light scattering detector (Wyatt Mini-Dawn), and a refractive index detector (Polymer Laboratories PL-RI). A Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS was used at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Because sKit is a glycoprotein, its refractive increment is unknown, and its total molecular weight cannot be determined from the light scattering data. However, as we have shown previously, polypeptide molecular weights (without the carbohydrate contribution) can be determined by combining the signals from all three detectors and using the extinction coefficient of the polypeptide alone (47.Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 48.Arakawa T. Wen J. Philo J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Calibration was accomplished using ribonuclease, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin monomer (Sigma) as molecular weight standards. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 25°C using 6-channel charcoal-Epon cells in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, with concentration distributions measured by absorbance at 280, 230, or 215 nm. The experimental and data analysis procedures followed those described previously(49.Philo J.S. Talvenheimo J.A. Wen J. Rosenfeld R. Welcher A.A. Arakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27840-27846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of sKit, E. coli-derived SCF, and CHO cell-derived SCF were run separately. Samples containing sKit and SCF were made up at ratios of 0.5, 1, or 2 sKit per SCF dimer and a range of sKit concentrations from 3 μM to 300 nM. The data were recorded at three different rotor speeds. Solvent densities were measured with a Mettler-Paar DMA-02 density meter. The sedimentation data on the mixtures were fitted to various heterogeneous association models. The fitting procedure accounts for the different molar extinction coefficients of the various species at the measurement wavelength. During the fitting, the reduced molecular weights of sKit and CHO cell-derived SCF were held fixed at the values determined when they were run alone; the molecular weight calculated from sequence for E. coli-derived SCF was used because its sedimentation data were consistent with that value. The data for up to 18 samples were globally fitted to determine the dissociation constants. During fitting, the fitted parameters were constrained to values that correctly accounted for the total concentrations of sKit and SCF placed into the cell. SCF and sKit solutions were dialyzed against the same PBS to minimize heat due to buffer differences. The data were obtained at 25°C in a Microcal Omega calorimeter and were analyzed using both the Microcal Origin analysis package and the program TITRATE, 2J. S. Philo, unpublished program. which provides a more robust analysis of the error in the fitted parameters as well as the ability to include a constant baseline heat per injection in the fitting. The stoichiometry of complex formation between SCF and sKit was investigated by mixing SCF and sKit in different molar ratios, incubating, and analyzing complex formation by size exclusion chromatography. The results are given in Fig. 1 for E. coli-derived SCF and sKit. It can be seen that the presence of SCF along with sKit results in the appearance of an early eluting species that must represent the sKit•SCF complex. (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that both sKit and SCF were part of this species (data not shown).) When sKit and SCF dimer are present at a 4 to 1 molar ratio during the incubation, integration of the chromatogram peaks shows half of the sKit remaining present in free form and the other half as complex (Fig. 1, chromatogram 6); note in chromatogram 6 that the absorbance of the peak representing complex is somewhat greater than that for the free sKit by an amount representing the SCF associated with the sKit. No free SCF is apparent. When sKit and SCF dimer are present at molar ratios of 2 to 1, 1 to 1, and 0.5 to 1, the size exclusion chromatography results show that all sKit is present as complex. Again in each case the absorbance of the peak representing complex is greater than that of the free sKit (Fig. 1, chromatogram 1) by an amount representing the associated SCF. In the case of the sKit to SCF dimer molar ratio of 2 to 1 (Fig. 1, chromatogram 5), no free SCF remains; in the case of the sKit to SCF dimer molar ratio of 1 to 1 (Fig. 1, chromatogram 4), half of the total SCF remains free; and in the case of the sKit to SCF dimer molar ratio of 0.5 to 1 (Fig. 1, chromatogram 3), three-quarters of the total SCF remains free. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that at the concentrations of sKit and SCF used, there is the formation of complex containing equimolar amounts of sKit and SCF monomer. This equimolar stoichiometry was confirmed with the use of 125I-labeled SCF. 125I-labeled SCF, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was mixed with unlabeled SCF (E. coli-derived) to give a preparation having specific radioactivity of 163 cpm/μg. A mixture of sKit (at 40 μg/ml) and the SCF preparation having molar ratio of sKit to SCF dimer of 1 was prepared, incubated, and subjected to size exclusion chromatography as in Fig. 1. Fractions containing complex were collected and pooled. Values of 2916 cpm/ml for radioactivity and 0.071 for absorbance at 280 nm were obtained for the pool. From the specific radioactivity of the SCF (163 cpm/μg), it could be calculated that SCF was present in the pool at 17.9 μg/ml or 0.96 μM (for SCF monomer). Because ϵ0.1%280 nm for the SCF is 0.536, it could also be calculated that absorbance due to SCF was 0.010. Thus absorbance due to Kit was 0.061 and, using ϵ0.1%280 nm of 1.185, sKit was present in the pool at 51.3 μg/ml or 0.92 μM, and the molar ratio of sKit to SCF monomer determined in this way was 0.96 for the complex. A priori, the equimolar amounts of sKit to SCF monomer in the complex could represent 1:1 or 2:2 complex. (Note that all references to stoichiometries for the complex, e.g. 1:1, 1:2, 2:2, will indicate the ratio of sKit to SCF monomer). The elution positions of marker proteins of known molecular weights are indicated by arrows in Fig. 1. However, because molecular shape as well as molecular size influences elution position, molecular weight values for SCF, sKit, and SCF•sKit complex cannot be reliably determined relative to marker proteins, and we did not attempt to determine stoichiometry of the complex on the basis on molecular weights estimated from elution positions. To distinguish between 1:1 and 2:2 stoichiometries for the complex, we accurately determined molecular weights of eluting species by using light scattering in combination with the size exclusion chromatography. The molecular weights determined by light scattering are independent of molecular shape and elution volumes. The size exclusion chromatography experiments were done using a system with refractive index and absorbance detectors in addition to the light scattering detector (“Experimental Procedures”). This allowed us to calculate the molecular weight of the complex (excluding contributions of carbohydrates) with an accuracy of ±5%. Experiments with sKit alone and E. coli-derived SCF alone gave molecular weights of 55,600 and 38,600, respectively, consistent with the formula weights of 55,815 for sKit monomer and 37,313 for SCF dimer. The value for SCF is also consistent with that determined previously (and below) by sedimentation equilibrium(19.Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.W. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L. Zsebo K.M. Mendiaz E.A. Wypych J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then applied a sample containing 0.60 mg/ml (10.75 μM) sKit plus 0.18 mg/ml SCF (2.2 mol of sKit/mol of SCF dimer), which produced a large peak corresponding to the sKit•SCF complex and a small peak of free sKit. As we have described previously(49.Philo J.S. Talvenheimo J.A. Wen J. Rosenfeld R. Welcher A.A. Arakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27840-27846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to calculate the polypeptide molecular weight of the complex we need its extinction coefficient, which depends on the (assumed) stoichiometry. We therefore used an approach in which the calculated molecular weight is deemed valid only if it is consistent with the stoichiometry assumed. If we assume the complex contains one sKit plus two SCF monomers (one SCF dimer), the data imply Mr = 163,000, which is inconsistent with the theoretical value of 93,128. With an assumed stoichiometry of two sKit plus four SCF monomers (two SCF dimers) for the complex, the light scattering data give Mr = 163,000, again inconsistent with the theoretical value of 186,256. In contrast, when we assume a stoichiometry of two sKit plus two SCF monomers (one SCF dimer), the calculated Mr of 149,000 agrees very well with t"
https://openalex.org/W2076358500,"Rab3A and Rab3B are highly homologous monomeric GTPases that are putative regulators of exocytosis in those tissues in which they are expressed. We have characterized and directly compared the targeting and functional properties of these isoforms in PC12 neuroendocrine cells. Rab3A and Rab3B both targeted to norepinephrine (NE)-containing large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) when stably expressed in PC12 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence and membrane fractionation. Both Rab3 isoforms also bound to recombinant rabphilin-3A in a GTP-dependent manner. The membrane association of rabphilin-3A was modestly enhanced in Rab3B-expressing PC12 cells relative to Rab3A-overexpressing cells. In addition, overexpression of Rab3A modestly inhibited Ca2+-evoked NE release, whereas Rab3B and a GTP binding mutant (Rab3B N135I) markedly stimulated the efficiency of [3H]NE secretion by PC12 cells (i.e. secretion normalized to total cell radioactivity). Expression of Rab3B and Rab3B N135I increased not only the efficiency of NE secretion but also the accumulation of [3H]NE into LDCVs (i.e. the secretory cargo available for secretion). Neither of these effects was attributable to changes in the numbers of LDCVs nor the docking of LDCVs at the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that Rab3A and Rab3B have similar membrane targeting properties and are capable of interacting with the same putative downstream effector; i.e. rabphilin-3A. However, these isoforms are functionally distinct monomeric GTPases with Rab3B stimulating a late step in Ca2+-evoked secretion when expressed in PC12 cells. Rab3A and Rab3B are highly homologous monomeric GTPases that are putative regulators of exocytosis in those tissues in which they are expressed. We have characterized and directly compared the targeting and functional properties of these isoforms in PC12 neuroendocrine cells. Rab3A and Rab3B both targeted to norepinephrine (NE)-containing large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) when stably expressed in PC12 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence and membrane fractionation. Both Rab3 isoforms also bound to recombinant rabphilin-3A in a GTP-dependent manner. The membrane association of rabphilin-3A was modestly enhanced in Rab3B-expressing PC12 cells relative to Rab3A-overexpressing cells. In addition, overexpression of Rab3A modestly inhibited Ca2+-evoked NE release, whereas Rab3B and a GTP binding mutant (Rab3B N135I) markedly stimulated the efficiency of [3H]NE secretion by PC12 cells (i.e. secretion normalized to total cell radioactivity). Expression of Rab3B and Rab3B N135I increased not only the efficiency of NE secretion but also the accumulation of [3H]NE into LDCVs (i.e. the secretory cargo available for secretion). Neither of these effects was attributable to changes in the numbers of LDCVs nor the docking of LDCVs at the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that Rab3A and Rab3B have similar membrane targeting properties and are capable of interacting with the same putative downstream effector; i.e. rabphilin-3A. However, these isoforms are functionally distinct monomeric GTPases with Rab3B stimulating a late step in Ca2+-evoked secretion when expressed in PC12 cells. INTRODUCTIONMembers of the Rab family of Ras-related monomeric GTPases are major candidates for controlling membrane docking and/or fusion in a wide variety of cell types. According to current models, the docking and fusion of donor and acceptor membranes is specified by interactions between proteins unique to transport vesicles, termed v-SNAREs, with their cognate t-SNAREs located on the intended target membrane(1.Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 2.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). Rabs are not found in purified SNARE complexes(3.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar); however, genetic studies in yeast indicate that additional proteins, including members of the Rab and Sec1 families, serve to control SNARE assembly by proofreading the fidelity of SNARE interactions and/or by imposing an additional layer of specificity(4.S⊘gaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5.Lian J-P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The Rab family represents a large number (>30) of homologous proteins, most of which are expressed in a wide variety of tissues where they probably regulate protein traffic pathways that are common to all cells (e.g. endocytosis in the case of Rab5)(6.Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). However, members of the Rab3 subfamily (Rab3A-Rab3D), which are 77-85% identical at the amino acid level, are tissue-specific proteins that may regulate cell type-specific secretory pathways. For example, Rab3A is a brain-specific monomeric GTPase that binds to small synaptic vesicles, from which it dissociates during neurotransmitter release(7.Fisher von Mollard G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rab3A also reportedly associates with the large secretory granules characteristic of adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 neuroendocrine cells(8.Darchen F. Senyshyn J. Brondyk W.H. Taatjes D.J. Holz R.W. Henry J.P. Denizot J.P. Macara I.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1639-1649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab3B and Rab3D are primarily expressed outside of the nervous system, with Rab3B being expressed in a wide variety of epithelial tissues (9.Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. John St., P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U. Jilling T. Sorscher E.J. Elton T.S. Abrahamson D.R. Kirk K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 583-594Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and Rab3D enriched in adipocytes(10.Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Rab3C shares many properties with Rab3A including expression in brain, targeting to synaptic vesicles, and transient dissociation from synaptic vesicles during neurotransmitter release(11.Fisher von Mollard G. Stahl B. Khokhlatcev A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10971-10974PubMed Google Scholar). Rab3A and Rab3C both bind in a GTP-dependent manner to rabphilin-3A, a Ca2+ and phospholipid binding protein that is a putative downstream effector for Rab3A in neurons(12.Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Horiuchi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10946-10949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yamaguchi T. Shirataki H. Kishida S. Miyazaki M. Nishikawa J. Wada K. Numata S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27164-27170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 885-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).All Rab3 isoforms have been proposed to regulate exocytosis in their respective tissues; however, in most cases direct evidence for such regulation is lacking. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that these structurally related proteins may in fact be functionally distinct. For example, on the basis of the results of antisense RNA experiments performed on anterior pituitary cells, Lledo et al.(15.Lledo P-M. Vernier P. Vincent J-D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) concluded that Rab3B is a positive regulator of Ca2+-evoked secretion from these cells. Conversely, Holz et al.(16.Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10229-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that transient overexpression of wild type Rab3A and certain mutants inhibited Ca2+-dependent secretion from bovine chromaffin cells. A similar conclusion was drawn by Johannes et al.(17.Johannes L. Lledo P-M. Roa M. Vincent J-D. Henry J-P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), who examined the effects of Rab3A mutants that were microinjected or transiently expressed in PC12 neuroendocrine cells. Such data have led to the proposal that Rab3A participates in the formation of a multimeric prefusion complex that must be dissociated prior to membrane fusion and secretion. This proposal seems consistent with the phenotype exhibited by Rab3A-negative transgenic mice, which display no obvious decrement in synaptic transmission except during repetitive stimulation, i.e. when synaptic vesicle recruitment to the presynaptic membrane becomes rate-limiting(18.Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).The preceding results imply that Rab3 isoforms, in particular Rab3A and Rab3B, may not be functionally interchangeable molecules, despite the fact that they are highly homologous proteins (~80% amino acid identity). The goal of the present study was to test this notion by characterizing the targeting and functional properties of Rab3A and Rab3B in PC12 neuroendocrine cells. PC12 cells were utilized because they have a well characterized, regulated secretory pathway (i.e. the norepinephrine-containing LDCVs) 1The abbreviations used are: LDCVlarge dense core vesicleMEMminimal essential mediumGSTglutathione S-transferaseNEnorepinephrinePBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. and because they normally express Rab3A but not Rab3B. Our results indicate that both of these monomeric GTPases target to LDCVs when stably expressed in PC12 cells and that both are capable of binding to rabphilin-3A, a putative downstream effector for Rab3A. Moreover, our functional data confirm that Rab3A overexpression inhibits secretion, albeit modestly and to varying degrees. Conversely, we observed that wild type Rab3B and a GTP-binding mutant (i.e. Rab3B N135I) are potent stimulators of catecholamine release. Interestingly, Rab3B stimulated secretion both by increasing the efficiency of radiolabeled catecholamine release (i.e. release normalized to cell-associated radioactivity) and by increasing the uptake of exogenous catecholamine into LDCVs (i.e. increasing the cargo available for secretion). Thus, Rab3A and Rab3B are functionally distinct molecules, with Rab3B enhancing secretion by PC12 cells at multiple levels of regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and AntibodiesRPMI 1640, poly-L-lysine (P1399), reserpine, GTPγS, and the anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody (Clone SVP-38) were purchased from Sigma, fetal bovine serum and equine (horse) serum from Hyclone (Logan, UT), and minimal essential medium (MEM), lipofectamine, and Opti-MEM media from Life Technologies, Inc. Hygromycin B and ionomycin were obtained from Calbiochem, [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) from DuPont NEN, norepinephrine from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA), and cell culture dishes from Costar (Cambridge, MA). PC12 cells were purchased from ATCC (catalog number ATCC CRL 1721). The generation and characterization of a Rab3B polyclonal antibody was described previously(9.Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. John St., P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U. Jilling T. Sorscher E.J. Elton T.S. Abrahamson D.R. Kirk K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 583-594Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies specific for Rab3A (Cl42.2) and for Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3C (Cl42.1) were generously provided by Dr. R. Jahn (Department of Cell Biology, Yale University Medical School, New Haven, CT)(19.Matteoli M. Takei K. Cameron R. Hurlbut P. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabphilin-3A antibody (14.Li C. Takei K. Geppert M. Daniell L. Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P.

Stenius K. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 885-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Dr. T. C. Südhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The secretogranin II polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Neill (Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL)(20.Wei N. Kakar S.S. Neill J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E145-E152PubMed Google Scholar).Cell CulturePC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% heat inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator as described(21.Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Stably transfected PC12 cells (passage numbers 1-24) and untransfected cells were cultured and plated on poly-L-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated dishes for NE secretion assays or on glass coverslips for immunofluorescent staining. All studies were performed in the absence of nerve growth factor.cDNA Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Expression VectorThe coding region of human Rab3B was generated by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction as described(9.Weber E. Berta G. Tousson A. John St., P. Green M.W. Gopalakrishnan U. Jilling T. Sorscher E.J. Elton T.S. Abrahamson D.R. Kirk K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 583-594Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this clone showed two differences when compared with the human Rab3B sequence originally reported by Zahraoui et al.(22.Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12394-12401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and submitted to the GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank (accession number M28214). These differences were as follows: AC instead of CA at nucleotide positions 25 and 26, which results in Thr versus His at amino acid position 9, and C instead of G at nucleotide position 120, which results in Phe versus Leu at amino acid position 40. To rule out the possibility of polymerase chain reaction error in the generation of our Rab3B clone, we also sequenced the human Rab3B clone originally isolated by Zahraoui et al.(22.Zahraoui A. Touchot N. Chardin P. Tavitian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12394-12401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a human pheochromocytoma cDNA library (kindly provided by A. Zahraoui, INSERM U-248, Paris, France). The two clones are identical. These results have been confirmed by A. Zahraoui, and a corrected human Rab3B sequence has been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL Data Bank.The GTP binding mutant Rab3B N135I was generated as described(23.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Rab3B coding region was subcloned into M13 mp19 phage, and a point mutation was generated using the mutagenic oligonucleotide primer 5′-GTCACACTTGATCCCCACCAG-3′. The mutation was confirmed by manually sequencing the entire coding region in single-stranded M13 templates using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). For expression in PC12 cells, all cDNAs were ligated into pMEP4 (a gift of M.L. Tykocinski, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH), an expression vector containing the human metallothionein promoter, SV40 polyadenylation site and a hygromycin B resistance element(24.Groger R.K. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 81: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Transfection of PC12 Cells5 × 106 PC12 cells were plated onto 100-mm Petri dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine and Opti-MEM media as described (25.Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Focus. 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar) with the following constructs: pMEP4 without insert (mock), pMEP4-Rab3B, pMEP4-Rab3B N135I, and pMEP4-Rab3A. Stably transfected colonies were selected by growth in complete media containing 320 units/ml hygromycin B. Colonies were screened for recombinant protein expression by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis (see below). In preliminary experiments we observed that recombinant protein expression levels were generally high without adding exogenous heavy metals (i.e. Zn2+ or Cd2+) to the tissue culture media (i.e. the metallothionein promoter was constitutively active under the growth conditions used in this study). In addition, we observed that the addition of heavy metals to the growth media had nonspecific effects on protein synthesis and NE secretion in PC12 cells. 2E. Weber, T. Jilling, and K. L. Kirk, unpublished observations. For these reasons our analyses of recombinant protein targeting and function were performed in the absence of added heavy metals.Immunofluorescence and ImmunoblottingFor immunofluorescence analysis PC12 cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 2-4 days, rinsed briefly in PBS, fixed in 3% formaldehyde at 4°C for 1 h, and permeabilized in 0.5% saponin/PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 1% swine γ-globulin or 5% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were washed three times in 0.5% saponin/PBS and exposed to the secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37°C in a 1:50 dilution (swine anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate or rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA)). Immunofluorescence images were collected using a slow scan, cooled CCD camera (Photometrics Inc., Tuscon, AR) interfaced to an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM-35; Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY).For Western blot analysis PC12 cells were grown in poly-L-lysine-coated 100-mm Petri dishes, washed in PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined using the micro-BCA assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline, and then blocked in 5% dry milk plus 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Blots were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h in 1 M glucose, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol and 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. The blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Corp.). For quantitative Western blotting the blots were analyzed by densitometry. In pilot experiments we calibrated the ECL signal by blotting serial dilutions of Rab3B-containing cell lysates and observed a linear relationship between density and protein amount.Membrane Preparation and Density Gradient Cell FractionationPC12 cell membranes and cytosol were prepared as described previously(26.Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, detached by scraping in PBS supplemented with 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, and then pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitors mentioned above and homogenized in a Potter homogenizer (1 × 40 strokes). The nuclei and other cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min at 4°C. To prepare cytosol and membranes, the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged in a 90Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 45,300 rpm (127,000 × g) for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant (i.e. cytosol) was collected, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors.For membrane fractionation, postnuclear supernatants that were prepared from cells grown on two 75-90% confluent 100-mm Petri dishes were layered onto a 0.6-1.8 M linear sucrose gradient in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with a 2.25 M sucrose pad (27.Liu Y. Schweitzer E.S. Nirenberg M.J. Pickel V.M. Evans C.J. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In order to label catecholamine-containing secretory granules, two 100-mm Petri dishes were also labeled with 40 μCi of [3H]norepinephrine/dish for 1 h at 37°C and then chased for 1 h at 37°C prior to fractionation (details described below for NE release assay). All gradients contained the protease inhibitor mixture described above. Equilibrium sedimentation was achieved by centrifugation in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 30,000 rpm for 6 h at 4°C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube (450-500 μl/fraction; 20 or 21 fractions). The protein content of each fraction from unlabeled cells was determined with the micro-BCA assay kit. The sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined by measuring the refractive index. The radioactivity of each fraction from cells preloaded with [3H]NE was measured by scintillation counting and corrected for quenching at high sucrose concentrations (as determined by counting [3H]NE standards in 0.6-1.8 M sucrose). For immunoblot analysis fractions were diluted 1:20 in water, and proteins were precipitated by incubation with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1 mg/ml deoxycholate overnight at 4°C. Protein pellets were washed twice with acetone and then solubilized in 5 × SDS sample buffer prior to immunoblot analysis.Production of GST Fusion Proteins and Immunoblot Analysis of Binding ProteinsGST fusion proteins containing full-length Rab3A, Rab3B, and rabphilin-3A were expressed in bacteria using the pGEX-2T prokaryotic expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Transformed Escherichia coli were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at 37°C for 3 h (for GST-Rab3A and GST-Rab3B) or with 50 μM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 5 h (GST-rabphilin-3A). GST-fusion proteins were affinity-purified from bacterial cell lysates with glutathione-agarose, as described(28.Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). For binding experiments cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (see immunoblotting protocol under “Materials and Methods”) or homogenized (see membrane preparation protocol under “Materials and Methods”) in the presence or absence of 50 μM GTPγS. Clarified cell lysates or high speed supernatants (i.e. cytosol) were incubated with GST fusion proteins (GST-3A, GST-3B, GST-rabphilin-3A) or GST alone immobilized on agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were washed four times with lysis or homogenization buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 5 × sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. Equal amounts of GST and GST-fusion protein (GST-rabphilin-3A, GST-3A, GST-3B) were used in each set of experiments. Bound proteins were eluted in similar volumes of 5 × sample buffer, and equal volumes of eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting.[3H]Norepinephrine Release AssayPC12 cells were grown in 35-mm poly-L-lysine-coated Petri dishes for 2-4 days until they reached 40-70% confluency. Cells were washed in RPMI and loaded at 37°C for 1 h in RPMI, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum containing 1-2 μCi of [3H]NE, rinsed with PBS, and then chased in complete media for an additional 1 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Release assays were performed at 37°C in 10 mM Hepes-buffered MEM (pH 7.4) or low K+/high K+ medium (10 mM Hepes, 5 or 55 mM KCl, 145 or 95 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) (29.Kongsamut S. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2243-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The low K+ medium was used for assays where the dependence of secretion on extracellular Ca2+ was examined, with Ca2+ concentrations that varied from 1 μM to 1.8 mM CaCl2. PC12 cells were incubated in MEM or low K+ medium for 10 min at 37°C prior to inducing secretion with 1 μM ionomycin or 55 mM K+. Except where noted, release was assessed in time course experiments in which the media was collected and replaced every 2 min. At the end of the experiment the cells were solubilized twice in 1 ml of 0.25 N NaOH, and the lysates were carefully collected. Media cpm were determined by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to total cell cpm. Total cell cpm were determined by summing all media counts and the radioactivity remaining in the cells at the end of the experiment, the latter of which was determined by counting the cell lysates.Transmission Electron Microscopy and MorphometryPC12 cells were grown in 35-mm poly-L-lysine-coated Petri dishes for 2-4 days until they reached 40-70% confluency, rinsed twice in PBS, and incubated in MEM supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) for 10 min. Monolayers were fixed in 1% buffered glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% buffered OsO4, dehydrated and embedded in Polybed, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The ultrathin sections were examined and photographed with a Hitachi-7000 transmission electron microscope. Numbers of dense core granules/cell and the numbers of granules within 100 nm of the plasma membrane were counted by six investigators in a double blind fashion.RESULTSExpression and Membrane Association of Rab3A and Rab3B in PC12 CellsIn order to directly compare the targeting and functional properties of Rab3A and Rab3B, we have generated PC12 cell lines that stably express recombinant Rab3A, Rab3B, or the Rab3B mutant, Rab3B N135I. Rab3B N135I corresponds to an oncogenic Ras mutant (H-Ras N116I) that has a substantially elevated dissociation rate for both GTP and GDP. Fig. 1A confirms for selected cell lines the expression of wild type Rab3B and Rab3B N135I protein, and the overexpression of Rab3A protein, as compared with nontransfected PC12 cells (nPC12) and mock-transfected cell lines. No expression of Rab3B protein was detected in nontransfected or in mock-transfected PC12 cells. Endogenous Rab3A and recombinant Rab3A and Rab3B all migrated as a ~25-kDa band in Western blots of total cell lysates, whereas Rab3B N135I migrated as a doublet with slightly faster mobility. Fig. 1B compares the efficiency of membrane association for Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3B N135I. The efficiency of Rab3A association with membranes was not substantially altered by the expression of recombinant Rab3B or Rab3B N135I. Interestingly, Rab3B N135I associated with PC12 membranes much less efficiently than either wild type Rab3B or wild type Rab3A; i.e. the great majority of mutant protein was present in the cytosol. Four out of five Rab3B N135I clones exhibited detectable but modest membrane association of the mutant protein (e.g. see clone 3B N135I 18 in Fig. 1B), whereas for one clone (3B N135I 32; see Fig. 1B) little or no Rab3B N135I protein was present on the membranes. This latter clone (mutant 32) also exhibits a different secretory phenotype than the other mutant Rab3B-expressing clones, as will be discussed below. Cytosolic Rab 3B N135I typically migrated as a doublet in which the dominant band had a higher mobility than that of wild type Rab3B, as noted above for cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Rab3B N135I also exhibits higher mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and poorly associates with membranes when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney renal epithelial cells.2Rab3A and Rab3B Target to Secretory GranulesThe targeting of Rab3A and Rab3B in PC12 cells was initially characterized by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2). Native Rab3A in untransfected cells and mock-transfected cells, as well as recombinant Rab3A in overexpressing cells, targeted at or very near the plasma membrane; in particular, at regions of cell-cell contact. Neither expression of recombinant Rab3B (Fig. 2) nor of Rab3B N135I (data not shown) changed this pattern of Rab3A targeting. Recombinant Rab3B protein was also detected predominantly in the region of the plasma membrane. Rab3B N135I protein was not detectable in any clone by immunofluorescence when the cells were permeabilized by our standard procedures (i.e. 0.5% saponin, see “Materials and Methods”). However, if the Rab3B N135I clones were permeabilized in 0.1% saponin, faint immunoreactivity was detected near the plasma membrane (except for mutant clone 32), along with increased cytoplasmic staining.2Figure 2:Immunofluorescence analysis of the expression and targeting of Rab3A and Rab3B in PC12 cells.

We have developed a novel in vivo system to analyze the role of flanking sequence on the modification of a single well characterized O-glycosylation site derived from human von Willebrand factor (PHMAQVTVGPGL). A secreted chimeric reporter protein, containing the human von Willebrand factor sequence, an antibody recognition epitope, and a heart muscle kinase site, was engineered and expressed in COS7 and MCF-7 cells. Glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the immunoprecipitated reporter were resolved electrophoretically and their relative amounts quantitated. Using mutational analysis we find that the glycosylation apparatus of COS7 cells can accommodate a broad range of changes in the flanking sequence without compromising glycosylation, but that the distribution of charged amino acids flanking the O-glycosylation site can have a profound influence on glycosylation with position −1 relative to the glycosylation site being particularly sensitive. A combination of acidic residues at positions −1 and +3 almost completely eliminates glycosylation of the reporter in both COS7 and MCF-7 cells. The overall density of charged amino acids is less important since substitution of acidic residues at position −2, +1, and +2 had no effect in the level of glycosylation observed.

These vesicles accumulate transport substrates when the appropriate transmembrane ion gradients are imposed. For NET, accumulation of [3H]dopamine (DA) was stimulated by imposition of Na+ and Cl- gradients (out > in) and of a K+ gradient (in > out). The presence of Na+ or Cl-, even in the absence of a gradient, stimulated DA accumulation by NET, but K+ had little or no effect in the absence of a K+ gradient. Stimulation by a K+ gradient was markedly enhanced by increasing the K+ permeability with valinomycin, suggesting that net positive charge is transported together with DA. Cationic DA is likely to be the major substrate for NET, since varying pH did not affect Km. We estimated the Na+:DA stoichiometry by measuring the effect of the transmembrane Na+ gradient on peak DA accumulation. The results suggest a 1:1 cotransport of Na+ with DA. Taken together, the results suggest that NET catalyzes cotransport of one cationic substrate molecule with one Na+ ion, and one Cl- ion, and that K+ does not participate directly in the transport process.

https://openalex.org/W2171443684,"At least three high affinity Na+- and Cl--dependent γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters are known to exist in the rat and mouse brain. These transporters share 50-65% amino acid sequence identity with the kidney betaine transporter which also transports GABA but with lower affinity. The betaine transporter (BGT) is expressed on the basolateral surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Recent evidence suggests that the signals and mechanisms involved in membrane protein sorting share many functional characteristics in polarized neurons and epithelial cells. It was previously shown that the rat GABA transporter GAT-1 is located in the presynaptic membrane of axons where it plays a role in terminating GABAergic neurotransmission. When expressed in MDCK cells by transfection, GAT-1 was sorted to the apical membrane. In this report, we have localized the other two GABA transporters, GAT-2 and GAT-3, in transfected MDCK cells by GABA uptake, immunofluorescence, and cell surface biotinylation. GAT-3, like GAT-1, localized to the apical membrane of MDCK cells while GAT-2, like BGT, localized to the basolateral membrane. We have also expressed BGT in low density cultures of hippocampal neurons by microinjection and immunolocalized it to the dendrites. The distribution of GAT-3 in these neurons after transfection was axonal as well as somatodendritic. These results indicate that highly homologous subtypes of GABA transporters are sorted differently when expressed in epithelial cells or neurons and suggest that these two cell types share the capacity to distinguish among these isoforms and target them to distinct destinations.

Another family member, the Na+- and Cl--dependent betaine transporter, has been cloned from MDCK cells (18.Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B.

The canine betaine transporter is a basolateral membrane protein which protects cells in the renal medulla from hypertonicity by mediating the uptake of the osmolyte betaine(20.Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202PubMed Google Scholar). GABA is also a substrate for the betaine transporter. In fact, the transporter's affinity for GABA (Km ~ 100 μM) is higher than its affinity for betaine (Km ~ 500 μM). More recently, the cDNAs for several subtypes of GABA transporters have been isolated from mouse and rat brain, bringing to four the number of GABA transporter isoforms which have been identified(21.Borden L.A.

Two of the high affinity (Km~ 10 μM) rat GABA transporters, GAT-2 and GAT-3 (also known as GAT-B), share higher amino acid identity (68% and 65%, respectively) with the betaine transporter than with GAT-1 (52% amino acid identity). γ-aminobutyric acid GAT-2, GAT-3, GABA transporter subtypes betaine transporter Madin-Darby canine kidney hemagglutinin minimal essential medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate phosphate-buffered saline. Recently, we have examined the sorting behaviors of members of this family expressed by transfection in polarized epithelial cells(24.Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane of an epithelial cell is divided into an apical membrane, which frequently faces a lumen, and a basolateral membrane which is in contact with the extracellular fluid space. The protein and lipid compositions of these two membrane domains are quite different (25.Mostov K. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26.Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Neurons are also polarized cells whose plasma membranes can be divided into two domains: axons (including termini) and the somatodendritic surfaces (composed of the cell body and the dendrites). Axons are thin and usually extend great distances from the cell body while dendrites are thick at the base, tapered and shorter in length. The axonal and dendritic processes must be biochemically distinct in order for them to receive and transmit information in a highly regulated manner. Very little is known about the mechanism of generating and maintaining polarity in neurons. Dotti and Simons (27.Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) proposed that the mechanisms involved in sorting proteins to the axonal and somatodendritic membranes are similar to those required to sort proteins to the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively, of polarized epithelial cells. When cultured hippocampal neurons were infected with the influenza fowl plague virus or vesicular stomatitus virus, these virus' major glycoproteins were targeted to distinct membrane domains just as they are in infected epithelial cells. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA), which is targeted to the apical membrane in MDCK cells, was predominantly sorted to the axon. In contrast, the vesicular stomatitus virus G protein, which accumulates in the MDCK basolateral membrane, was sorted to the dendrites. Furthermore, Thy-1, a glycophosphorylinositol-linked protein, was sorted to the axon in hippocampal neurons (28.Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Simons K. Nature. 1991; 349: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) whereas glycophosphorylinositol-linked proteins are generally present in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. The small GTP-binding protein rab8 (29.Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and the transferrin receptor (30.Cameron P.L. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) are endogenously expressed in the basolateral compartment of MDCK cells and in the somatodendritic domain of neurons. In order to examine this model further, Pietrini et al.(24.Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the sorting behavior of the neuronal GABA transporter (GAT-1) in both neuronal and epithelial cells. GAT-1 was localized exclusively to the axons of hippocampal neurons in culture (24.Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in situ(31.Radian R. Ottersen O.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Castel M. Kanner B.I. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the apical membranes of transfected MDCK cells. The betaine transporter, expressed by transfection, was basolateral in MDCK cells, in keeping with previous studies on the polarity of the MDCK cell's endogenous complement of betaine transporters(20.Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize further the nature and position of the sorting information which mediates the differential targeting of these proteins, we have expressed cDNAs encoding the highly homologous GAT-2 and GAT-3 transporters in MDCK cells. We find that in stably transfected MDCK cells, GAT-2 is expressed predominantly in the basolateral membrane while GAT-3 is expressed in the apical membrane. We have also expressed the basolateral betaine transporter protein in hippocampal neurons by microinjection and found that it accumulates in the dendrites. GAT-3, on the other hand, was found in both axons and the somatodendritic membrane. These results indicate that highly homologous subtypes of GABA transporters are distributed differently when expressed in epithelial cells and suggest that these transporters require distinct subcellular distributions in order to subserve their physiologic functions. Moreover, the apical/axonal and basolateral/dendritic sorting model proposed by Dotti and Simons (27.Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) is consistent with the behaviors manifest by this group of membrane proteins. Rabbit antisera R22 and R23, raised against amino acids 189-206 (VVEFWERNMHQMTDGLDK) and amino acids 270-288 (FYITPNFRKLSDSEVWLDA), respectively, of the rat GABA transporter (GAT-1) were a generous gift from L.

Production of the monoclonal antibody (6H) against the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase has been described(32.Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody and enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All chemicals, unless noted otherwise, were purchased from J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ. MDCK cells were maintained in complete medium consisting of minimal essential medium (MEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mML-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). Stably transfected MDCK cells were maintained in the above medium supplemented with 0.9 g/liter Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly through exposure to 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mM EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hippocampal neurons were isolated from 17 day rat embryos, plated on coverslips at 3000 cells/cm2, and co-cultured with glia as described previously(33.Goslin K. Banker G.A. Banker G.A. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990: 251-282Google Scholar). One-half of the conditioned medium was replaced with fresh neuronal medium (0.1% bovine albumin (Sigma), 2 mML-glutamine, 1% HL-1 supplement (Ventrex Laboratories)) every 4-5 days. When neurons were to be maintained for longer than 1 week, cytosine arabinoside was added to inhibit proliferation of non-neuronal cells. The c-Myc epitope EQKLISEEDL was added to the carboxyl terminus of the canine betaine transporter cDNA (BGT-1) by the polymerase chain reaction method. BGT-1 was first subcloned into the vector pACYC184 (New England BioLabs) which lacks BsaI and StuI restriction sites. This plasmid pACYC184-BGT1 was used as a template to synthesize a 0.8-kilobase fragment with the primers GTTGGGGAGAAGGAGACCCACTTGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCTCTGAGGAAGACCTCTAGGATGTGGCCAGC and TTGGAAGGCCTGTGA. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the TA cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), digested with BsaI and StuI, and ligated to the BsaI-StuI sites of pACYC184-BGT1. The modified BGT-1 (BGT∗) was finally cloned into the MluI-BamHI sites of the expression vector pCB6. Plasmid DNA was amplified in competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells (gift of L. Roman) and purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The modified region of pCB6-BGT∗ was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. GAT-2 cDNA (kindly provided by L. A. Borden and K. E. Smith, Synaptic Pharmaceutical, Paramus, NJ) was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCB6. GAT-3 was subcloned into the ClaI site of pCB6. MDCK cells were transfected in the presence of 0.1 mM chloroquine using the calcium phosphate method as described elsewhere(34.Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J.

After about 2 weeks of selection in 0.9 g/liter Geneticin, colonies of cells were transferred to 24-well plates using 8-mm cloning cylinders (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ). Subconfluent cultures were screened by their ability to take up [3H]GABA (see assay below). Cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran as described(37.Banerji J. Olson L. Schaffner W. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 105 per 35-mm dish) were plated on glass coverslips the night before transfection and washed twice in TBS (137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 37°C. To each dish, 0.5 ml of TBS containing 5 μg of DNA and 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added for 40 min at 37°C. The solution was discarded and the cells were incubated in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mM chloroquine for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were washed twice in TBS (37°C) and incubated in complete DMEM for 48 h before measuring protein expression. MDCK cells (4 × 104) were plated on 6.5-mm Transwell porous cell culture inserts (0.4-μm pore polycarbonate membrane, Costar, Cambridge, MA) 1 week before measuring GABA uptake. Assays were performed as described previously(21.Borden L.A. Smith K.E. Hartig P.R. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21098-21104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers were washed three times in PBS+ (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM NaPi, pH 7.4). [3H]GABA (γ-[2,3-3H]aminobutyric acid, 30 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in PBS+ was added to either the apical (0.2 ml) or basolateral (0.5 ml) side of the filter at a final concentration of 50 nM (0.33 μCi/ml). After 10 min at room temperature, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS+. Filters were excised and the cells were lysed in 200 μl of 1% SDS. A 50-μl aliquot of cell extract was removed for protein determination using the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine albumin as the standard. The remainder was counted in 3 ml of Optifluor (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Nonspecific uptake (<10%) was determined in the presence of 0.5 mM unlabeled GABA. Cells were grown on 24-mm Transwell inserts (0.4 μm pore, Costar) for 1 week and the medium was replaced with complete MEM (without Geneticin) containing 10 mM sodium butyrate 18-24 h before the experiment. Steady state biotinylation was carried out at pH 9.0 as described by Gottardi et al.(38.Gottardi C.G. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cells were incubated with NHS-biotin for 2 × 20 min. Biotinylation at pH 9.0 was chosen because our laboratory has previously shown that many membrane proteins are more efficiently biotinylated at pH 9.0. Performing the biotinylation at pH 7.5 instead of at pH 9.0 did not alter the results. The biotinylated proteins were isolated with 100 μl of packed immobilized streptavidin and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (40.Towbin H.

The blot was incubated with R22 (1:200) or 6H (1:500) primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and developed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham). DNA solutions (0.5-1 μg/μl H2O) were passed through a 0.22-μm Spin-X membrane (Costar) and verified on an ethidium bromide containing agarose gel. Lysine-fixable fluorescein/dextran (Mr 10,000; Molecular Probes) was added to the DNA at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, 2.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Injection pipettes were pulled from Narishige model GD-1 microcapillary tubes to an approximate diameter of 0.5 μm. The pipette was filled through the larger opening with 2.5 μl of solution using Seque/pro pipette tips (Bio-Rad). Each coverslip with neurons attached was transferred, cell side up, to a 35-mm dish containing 1.5 ml of fresh neuronal medium supplemented with 20 mM NaHepes, pH 7.4. The dish was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus) and a filled pipette was positioned vertically over the cells. The cells were injected manually using a micromanipulator (Narishige). Injection was indicated by swelling of the nucleus and change in light reflection. Fifty to one hundred cells were injected per coverslip over a period of 15 min at room temperature. Dishes were kept in a humidified 37°C incubator until the injections were completed (up to 3 h). The coverslips were returned, cell side down, to glial cultures in conditioned medium for 48 h. MDCK cells were grown on 9-mm Falcon cell culture inserts (0.45 μm pore size Cyclopore membrane, Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) or 24-mm Transwell inserts (0.4 μm pore, Costar) and processed for indirect immunofluorescence(34.Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All primary and secondary antibodies and Texas Red avidin were diluted in GSDB (16% goat serum (Sigma), 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.45 M NaCl, 20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4; (30.Cameron P.L. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)). Incubations were carried out at room temperature in a humidified, light-protected box. MDCK cells were rinsed in PBS+ and fixed in methanol (−20°C) for 10 min or in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min. After washing in PBS+, the cells were incubated for 15 min in 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS+ (Buffer A), and blocked for 30 min in GSDB. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-GABA transporter (R22 or anti-670, diluted 1:50) and anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit (6H, 1:100) antibodies for 1 h, followed by three washes (5 min each) in Buffer A. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim), both diluted 1:100, for 1 h and washed again in Buffer A. Hippocampal neurons were rinsed twice briefly in PBS+ (37°C), fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times (5 min each) in 10 mM glycine in PBS+, and once more in PBS+. Cells were permeabilized in Buffer A for 15 min, blocked in GSDB for 30 min, blocked in avidin solution (Vector Laboratories, diluted 1:1 with 2× GSDB) for 15 min, rinsed in PBS+ for 5 min, and blocked in biotin solution (diluted 1:1 with 2× GSDB) for 15 min. The cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc (Oncogene Sciences, 1:50) or anti-HA (1:200) monoclonal antibodies for 1 h. Double labeling was carried out by incubation with anti-MAP2 (1:100) or synapsin (1:50) polyclonal antibodies in the same primary antibody solution. The cells were washed three times (5 min each) in Buffer A, then incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector) and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals, 1:100) for 1 h. The washed cells (3 × 5 min in Buffer A) were incubated in Texas Red-conjugated avidin (Molecular Probes, 1:200) for 30 min and washed again. All specimens were washed for 10 min in 5 mM NaPi, pH 7.5, before mounting. Coverslips were mounted cell side down in a freshly prepared solution of 0.1% p-phenylenediamine (Sigma), 70% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, or in Vectashield mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and sealed with nail polish. Filters were mounted cell side up and coverslipped. The cells were initially examined using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Immunofluorescence and phase-contrast images were photographed using TMX100 or 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Confocal images were generated on a Zeiss laser scanning microscope using the following excitation/emission wavelengths: 488 nm/515-560 nm (fluorescein), 568 nm/590-640 nm (Texas Red), 647 nm/650-710 nm (Cy5). Confocal xz sections were generated using a 0.2-μm motor step. All images are the product of 8-fold line averaging. There was no significant bleed-through from the fluorescein to rhodamine/Texas Red channels since many of the cells which were strongly labeled with fluorescein had no rhodamine or Texas Red labeling. The GABA transport activities catalyzed by the different MDCK cell lines expressing GAT-2 or GAT-3 are shown in Fig. 1. Five positive clones were isolated from each transfection. Cells transfected with GAT-2 transported GABA 3-10 times faster when the labeled substrate was added to their basolateral surfaces as opposed to their apical surfaces. Cells transfected with GAT-3 transported GABA rapidly only when GABA was added to their apical surfaces. Therefore, these two GABA transporters are functionally expressed on opposite membranes in MDCK cells. Cell lines GAT2#70 and GAT3#3 were used in subsequent experiments. We wished to confirm the apparent polarized distributions of these transporters using a method to localize the expressed proteins which is independent of their transport capacities since functional assays only report the distribution of the active populations. We chose, therefore, to complement the transport assay with antibody based detection methods. Two polyclonal antibodies (R22 and R23) raised against peptides from GAT-1 were tested for their ability to cross-react with GAT-2 and GAT-3. In order to express high levels of transporter for antibody characterization studies, we transiently transfected COS-1 cells with GAT-2 or GAT-3 cDNAs and measured antibody binding by indirect immunofluorescence. R22 recognized GAT-2 and GAT-3 in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2, a and b); however, the intensity of fluorescence was considerably lower for the GAT-3 transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2b). Antibody R23 recognized neither GAT-2 nor GAT-3 (not shown). Although cell surface labeling was clearly visible, most of the transporters were localized intracellularly, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This pattern of staining is often seen in COS-1 cells induced to overexpress membrane proteins. The GAT-3 specific antibody, anti-670, labeled the surface as well as intracellular membranes of COS-1 cells expressing GAT-3 (Fig. 2c). This antibody did not react with cells expressing GAT-2 (not shown). When stably transfected MDCK cells expressing GAT-2 were labeled with R22, a lateral staining pattern was observed (Fig. 3, A and C), similar to the pattern obtained with an antibody against the Na,K-ATPase, a known basolateral protein (Fig. 3, B and D). We discovered that MDCK cells transfected with GAT-3 did not stain with R22, so anti-670 had to be used for immunofluorescence. With the latter antibody, we observed bright staining of the apical membrane of MDCK cells transfected with GAT-3 (Fig. 3, E and G) while the Na,K-ATPase was distributed basolaterally in the same cells (Fig. 3, F and H). Finally, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments to confirm the polarity of GAT-2 and GAT-3 in MDCK cells. Fig. 4A shows that GAT-2, an 85-kDa protein, was accessible to biotinylation predominantly from the basolateral side of intact MDCK cells. In contrast, GAT-3 was prefer"

Both mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface and bound insulin normally, but showed markedly impaired autophosphorylation in response to insulin. In addition, the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of both mutant receptors toward an artificial substrate was also severely impaired. Despite these defects of kinase activity, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled cells showed insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of ~185 kDa to an extent comparable to that seen in CHO cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptors. Anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting confirmed that this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was IRS-1. In contrast, CHO cells expressing an insulin receptor mutated at the ATP binding site (Lys-1030 → Arg) showed no insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of IRS-1. Despite exhibiting apparently normal insulin stimulation of IRS-1 tyrosine-phosphorylation, cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln or Pro-1178 → Leu receptors showed marked impairment in insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis, thymidine incorporation, and activation of MAP kinase. The inability of these mutant receptors to signal normally to metabolic and mitogenic responses suggests that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 alone is insufficient to fully mediate insulin action.

The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric transmembrane tyrosine kinase (Ullrich et al., 39.Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C.

Binding of ligand to the extracellular α subunit activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, the initial substrate of which appears to be the receptor itself (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 38.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Three tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor (1158, 1162, and 1163) are phosphorylated in trans by the reciprocal half-receptor (Lammers et al., 14.Lammers R. van Obberghen E.

Phosphorylation of all three tyrosines appears to be necessary to allow full activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity toward other substrates and to allow normal signaling to downstream effectors (Murukami and Rosen, 22.Murukami M.S. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22653-22660PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike many other receptor tyrosine kinases, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor itself do not appear to act primarily as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing signal transduction proteins. The insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors phosphorylate one or more substrate proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 185 kDa. Further characterization of the ~185-kDa substrate(s) resulted in the cloning of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHOChinese hamster ovaryMBPmyelin basic proteinBSAbovine serum albuminPIphosphatidylinositol.

The precise function of each of these signal transduction molecules and their relationship to the spectrum of biological responses to insulin is currently the focus of major attention. Evidence is rapidly emerging to indicate that IRS-1 is not the only protein directly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (Lavan and Lienhard, 15.Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Naturally occurring mutations in the insulin receptor have provided considerable insights into the residues and domains of the receptor that are important for function (Taylor et al., 36.Taylor S.I.

Rev. 1992; 13: 566-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Study of the functional properties of mutations occurring in association with human disease has the advantage that there is often good a priori evidence that altered function caused by the mutation produces a physiologically significant defect in insulin signaling in the whole organism. To date, most studies of both naturally occurring and artificial mutant insulin receptors have confirmed the important role for IRS-1 phosphorylation in the mediation of insulin signaling. In general, mutant receptors that have impaired autophosphorylation also fail to phosphorylate IRS-1 and show impaired insulin-mediated signaling to downstream metabolic and mitogenic events (Moller et al., 19.Moller D.E.

Additional evidence for the importance of IRS-1 phosphorylation for insulin signaling comes from studies of artificial insulin receptor mutants, which show a dissociation between receptor autophosphorylation and IRS-1 phosphorylation (White et al., 42.White M.F.

Studies of these mutant receptors have supported the concept that the phosphorylation of IRS-1, rather than that of the insulin receptor itself, correlates with insulin's activation of downstream effects. We report on the unique functional properties of two naturally occurring mutants in a region of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain distal to the major sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation. These mutations are the cause of dominantly inherited resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal in vivo. Both mutations result in the abolition of insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation but retention of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine-phosphorylation. Despite mediating apparently normal IRS-1 phosphorylation, neither mutant insulin receptor was capable of stimulating metabolic and mitogenic events. These results lend support to the notion that IRS-1-independent signaling events are necessary for the mediation of the downstream effects of insulin. A 4.4-kilobase pair full-length human insulin receptor cDNA (gift of Jonathan Whittaker, State University of New York, Stonybrook, NY) was subcloned into the pRC.CMV expression vector (Invitrogen) to create pRC.CMV.HIR. A 2.43-kilobase pair cDNA fragment, encoding the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, was then excised from pRC.CMV.HIR using HindIII and BamHI. This fragment was cloned into M13mp18. Mutagenesis was carried out using the Bio-Rad Mutagene kit, with the primer TGCCATCCACTGTACAGGGAG (for the 1174 mutation) or CAGGGACTCCAGTGCCATCCA (for the 1178 mutation). After mutagenesis, E. coli JM109 were transformed with double-stranded DNA, and several plaques were picked and sequenced around the area of the mutation to confirm the presence of the mutation. The mutated insulin receptor fragment cDNA was then excised with HindIII and BamHI and religated back into the expression vector pRC.CMV.HIR. Religated clones were sequenced across ligation sites and translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) to verify that protein products of the appropriate size were synthesized. CHO cells were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (75 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37°C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For transfection, CHO cells (approximately 30% confluent) in four-well tissue culture plates were incubated at 37°C in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a transfection mixture composed of 2 μg of plasmid/well and 10 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h, the medium was changed to F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were left for 48 h. Subsequently, the medium was supplemented with Geneticin (600 mg/liter) to select neomycin-resistant cells. After 10 days, surviving CHO cells were harvested and subcultured in the presence of Geneticin (600 mg/liter). Single clones were isolated from this cell line by limiting dilution, and cells expressing high levels of human insulin receptors were selected by insulin binding as described previously (Moller et al., 1990). CHO cells expressing human insulin receptors mutated at the ATP binding site (Lys-1030 → Arg) were generously provided by William J.

White, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, and anti-Erk 2 antibody was a gift from Prof. Chris Marshall, Chester Beatty Laboratory, London, United Kingdom. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from ICN (PY20) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (4G10). Transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with insulin binding buffer (100 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM glucose, 1% BSA, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 15 mM sodium acetate, and 1.2 mM MgSO4). Cells were then incubated in insulin binding buffer at 4°C for 16 h with 125I-insulin (20,000 cpm/well) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled insulin (10-9 to 10-5M). After 18 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 200 μl of 0.03% SDS before determining cell-bound radioactivity by counting samples in a γ counter. Serum-arrested CHO cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated with insulin as indicated, washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 500 μM NaVO3, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with 5 μl of either anti-insulin receptor antibody Ros-1, anti-IRS-1 antibody CT, or anti-Erk 2 antibody plus 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, the monoclonal PY20 antibody was used. Immune complexes were washed four times in ice-cold lysis buffer and once in ice-cold 100 mM Tris, pH 6.8. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (20 μl) containing 100 mM dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% slab gels) and transferred by electroblotting to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked for 2 h in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer A). Blots were probed for 90 min with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (1:5000 dilution) in buffer A or with the anti-insulin receptor antibody CT-3 (1:2000 dilution) in PBS containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (buffer B). Blots were washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako Ltd.; 1:10,000 dilution) in buffer B. After 1 h, blots were washed as above and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For immunoblotting of total cell lysates, CHO cells were harvested directly in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. After sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, aliquots of supernatants were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis was carried out as described above. 10 cm plates of serum arrested CHO cells were washed twice with phosphate-free Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 107 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 7 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, and 0.1% BSA) and incubated with 5 ml/plate KRBB with 1 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) for 3 h at 37°C. Insulin was then added to 100 nM final concentration as indicated and incubated for another 5 min. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold KRBB, harvested in 400 μl lysis of buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-insulin receptor antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography. Transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in 6-cm (four-well) dishes, serum-starved for 16 h, and treated with insulin as indicated, before being harvested into 300 μl of lysis buffer as described above. Lysates were incubated on ice (15 min) and then cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min at 4°C). Insulin receptors were captured by overnight incubation of clarified lysate extracts on a 96-well microtiter plates that had been coated the previous day with 50 μl/well anti-insulin receptor antibody 83-7 (2.5 μg/ml) in 20 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6. Clarified cell lysate (200 μl) was then added to each well, and plates were incubated at 4°C for 16 h. The wells were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA) before the addition of the tyrosine kinase reaction mixture (20 μl/well) containing 130 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mM EGTA, 12 nM MgCl2, 0.2 mM peptide substrate (RDIFEADYFRK), and 2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. After 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 2 M HCl. 32P incorporation into the peptide substrate was measured by spinning the reaction mixture through phosphocellulose columns (Spinzyme(™) Pierce). Columns were washed twice with 0.75 mM phosphoric acid, and incorporated γ-32P counted in a scintillation counter. Transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes, serum-starved for 16 h, and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Insulin was added at the indicated concentrations (10-10-10-6M) for 1 h, followed by the addition of 1 μCi of [14C]glucose/well (Amersham) and incubated at 37°C for 90 min. Plates were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS before solubilizing cells in 0.03% SDS and transferring to 15-ml Falcon tubes. 100 μl of cold carrier glycogen (20 mg/ml, Sigma) was added, and tubes were boiled for 30 min before adding three volumes of ice-cold ethanol and shaking at 4°C overnight. Precipitated glycogen was collected by centrifugation, the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, and the radioactivity was then measured in a scintillation counter. Transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes, serum-starved for 16 h, and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Insulin was added at the indicated concentrations (10-10 to 10-6M) for 16 h, with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well. CHO cells were then further incubated at 37°C for 90 min. The plates were placed on ice and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were solubilized in 0.03% SDS. 1.5 volumes of trichloroacetic acid (20%, w/v) was added, and acid-precipitable radioactivity was then determined. MAP kinase immunoprecipitates collected on protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2) before being resuspended in 35 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μM ATP, 5 μl of myelin basic protein (MBP) (1.5 mg/ml), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30°C with gentle shaking, the reaction was terminated by spinning through a phosphocellulose column (Spinzyme(™), Pierce). The columns were washed twice with 0.75 mM phosphoric acid, and [32P]MBP was counted in a scintillation counter. The identification of the Arg-1174 → Gln mutation and the Pro-1178 → Leu mutation have been described previously (Moller et al., 20.Moller D.E. Cohen O. Yamaguchi Y. Assiz R. Grigorescu F. Eberle A. Morrow L.A. Moses A.C. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 247-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Krook et al., 1994). Both mutations were identified in heterozygous form in adolescent females suffering from the Type A syndrome of insulin resistance. In both families insulin resistance was inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Both mutations have been described in additional independent kindreds, also in association with Type A insulin resistance (Kim et al. 1993; Moritz et al. 21.Moritz W. Froesch E.R. Bönischnetzler M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Following transfection and selection with G418, multiple clones with similarly high levels of tracer insulin binding were selected for further study. The displacement of tracer insulin by unlabeled insulin was similar in cells expressing wild-type, Arg-1174 → Gln, and Pro-1178 → Leu receptors. Thus, the mutant insulin receptors were expressed on the cell surface and bound insulin with normal affinity relative to wild-type insulin receptors (data not shown). The in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of both mutant and wild-type insulin receptors was measured using antibody capture of insulin receptors from insulin-stimulated cells, followed by assaying the kinase activity of the bound insulin receptor toward an artificial peptide substrate. Insulin receptors mutated at the ATP binding site (Arg-1030 → Lys) were studied in parallel. This mutant receptor has previously been shown to have severely impaired insulin stimulated kinase activity (Ebina et al. 1987). The Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutated receptors showed markedly impaired tyrosine kinase activity compared to wild-type receptors (Fig. 1). The degree of impairment observed was similar to that seen with the Arg-1030 → Lys insulin receptors. In order to examine whether the severe defect seen in insulin-stimulated in vitro tyrosine kinase activity was also present in whole cells, cells expressing similar numbers of wild-type, Arg-1174 → Gln, or Pro-1178 → Leu receptor were treated with 100 nM insulin for 2 min, harvested, and immunoprecipitated using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Subsequent anti-insulin receptor immunoblotting of the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates revealed that Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu receptors failed to undergo insulin-stimulated β-subunit autophosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Defective autophosphorylation of both mutants was confirmed in anti-insulin receptor immunoprecipitates of cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 2B). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of total cell lysates also confirmed the absence of normal receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, however, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates obtained from cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors revealed insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of approximately 185 kDa. The 185-kDa phosphoprotein appeared to be similar in intensity to that seen in cells expressing wild-type receptor, but it was not seen in the mock-transfected CHO cells. Similarly, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation of cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with 1 μM insulin for 5 min again showed absent autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor β-subunit but preservation of tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 (data not shown).Figure 3:CHO cells expressing Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors mediate insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185. Cell lysates from mock-transfected CHO cells and cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptor, Arg-1174 → Gln, or Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors were either untreated or treated with 100 nM insulin for 2 min and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). The positions of the insulin receptor β-subunit and pp185 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the ~185-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein seen in Fig. 3 corresponded to (or contained) IRS-1, cells were stimulated with insulin for 2 min, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-IRS-1 antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, this demonstrated that insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of IRS-1 was similar in cells expressing wild-type, Arg-1174 → Gln, and Pro-1178 → Leu receptors. To confirm that this was a specific feature of Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors, and not a general property of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain mutations, cells overexpressing similar numbers of Lys-1030 → Arg mutated insulin receptors were also studied. In these cells, stimulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation was not increased above the low background seen in mock-transfected CHO cells. Given the discordance between the severely defective receptor autophosphorylation (and in vitro tyrosine kinase activity) and the preservation of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1, experiments were undertaken to determine whether signaling to downstream insulin responses was impaired in cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln or Pro-1178 → Leu mutant insulin receptors. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of wild-type insulin receptors, as expected, resulted in significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity with respect to [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors show marked impairment in both these responses. At lower (10-100 nM) insulin concentrations, the stimulation of glycogen synthesis through the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu receptors was impaired relative to that seen in mock-transfected CHO cells, suggesting that the mutant receptors were interfering with signaling through endogenous CHO insulin receptors. This dominant-negative effect is consistent with the dominant inheritance of insulin resistance seen in the families with these mutations. Similarly, insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation was also markedly defective in cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln or Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors (Fig. 5B). Cells expressing wild-type receptors achieved 65% of maximal response at 1 nM insulin concentration, whereas at that insulin concentration there was no measurable response in the cells expressing either of the mutant receptors. In contrast to insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, there was no evidence of dominant-negative interference with signaling through the endogenous CHO insulin receptors with respect to insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA. Insulin stimulation of MAP kinase is thought to be important in the mediation of insulin's biological effects, particularly on mitogenesis (Marshall, 18.Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 nM insulin for 10 min, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with anti-MAP kinase antibody. MAP kinase activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP) was measured in the immunoprecipitates. The insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of MBP by anti-MAP kinase immune complexes derived from insulin-stimulated cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln or Pro-1178 → Leu mutants was severely impaired compared to that seen in cells expressing the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6). This result, indicating that the pathway from the insulin receptor to MAP kinase was not activated, correlates with the impaired mitogenic response as measured by thymidine incorporation into DNA. Thus, despite a normal capacity for IRS-1 phosphorylation, MAP kinase is not activated by insulin in cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln or Pro-1178 → Leu receptors. Two naturally occurring insulin receptor mutations (Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu) associated with dominantly inherited insulin resistance displayed unusual signaling properties when expressed in CHO cells. Both mutant receptors were found to mediate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin but showed markedly impaired receptor autophosphorylation and in vitro tyrosine kinase activity toward an artificial substrate. Despite the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, both mutant receptors were unable to mediate insulin's effects on glycogen synthesis and mitogenesis. The lack of insulin signaling to downstream effectors in the face of normal IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation is in marked contrast to several previous studies of mutant insulin receptors, which have suggested that an insulin receptor's ability to signal to downstream biological effects correlates well with the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Cama et al., 1992; Moller et al., 1990). For example, White et al. demonstrated that a Tyr-972 → Phe mutant receptor was capable of normal autophosphorylation but did not phosphorylate IRS-1 (White et al., 1988). Intact cells expressing this receptor show marked impairment of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, thymidine incorporation (White et al., 1988), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation (Kapeller et al., 11.Kapeller R. Chen K.S. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B.S. Backer J.M. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Ruderman N.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant lacking 12 amino acids in the juxta-membrane region of the receptor similarly displayed normal insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation but severely impaired phosphorylation of IRS-1 and parallel impairment of insulin-stimulated downstream effects (Backer et al., 3.Backer J.M. Schneider G.G. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. Siddle K. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 6366-6372Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Backer et al., 1992). These studies suggest that the juxtamembrane region of the receptor may be important in allowing access of IRS-1 to the catalytic domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase, a concept that is further supported by experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system, which demonstrate that residues within this region directly interact with IRS-1 (Gustafson et al., 9.Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 49APubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, a mutant receptor lacking the 82 C-terminal amino acids did not show any detectable autophosphorylation upon insulin stimulation but tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was normal (Yamamoto-Honda et al. 1993). CHO cells expressing the Δ82 receptors show normal insulin stimulation of thymidine incorporation and PI 3-kinase activation compared to cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptors. Thus, previous studies of mutant insulin receptors suggest a key role for IRS-1 phosphorylation in the mediation of the biological effects of insulin. Despite exhibiting a pattern of behavior in terms of receptor autophosphorylation versus IRS-1 phosphorylation comparable to that seen with the Δ82 mutant, both the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors differed markedly from the Δ82 receptor in their failure to mediate insulin-stimulated mitogenic and metabolic effects. It is possible that we did not detect a more subtle defect in IRS-1 phosphorylation. Thus time points beyond 5 min were not studied, and it is conceivable that mutant receptors might be capable of initiating phosphorylation of IRS-1 yet be defective in maintaining further rounds of tyrosine phosphorylation. It is also possible that qualitative aspects of IRS-1 phosphorylation, perhaps related to the specific sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, may be defective in cells expressing the mutant receptors. Notwithstanding these caveats, it is of interest that despite apparently normal IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation at physiologically relevant concentrations of insulin, downstream signaling remained significantly impaired. The data obtained from study of both the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors suggests that IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation may not be sufficient for full activation of insulin signaling. This is consistent with a growing body of evidence indicating the existence of other signal transduction pathways from the insulin receptor to downstream events. Recent evidence suggests that the main route of insulin-stimulated GTP loading of p21ras occurs through the direct phosphorylation by the insulin receptor of Shc (Sasaoka et al., 29.Sasaoka T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, insulin receptors in which two of the three major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites have been replaced by phenylalanine show marked impairment of IRS-1 phosphorylation but signal normally to insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and activation of p21ras (Ouwens et al. 23.Ouwens D.M. van der Zon G.C.M.

Studies of mice lacking IRS-1 have indicated the existence of another IRS-1-related molecule (Araki et al., 2.Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Brüning J.C. Haag B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar; Tamemoto et al., 35.Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S.

This molecule (IRS-2) has recently been characterized and shows considerable homology to IRS-1 (Tobe et al., 46.Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). CHO cells express both IRS-1 and IRS-2, 2M. White, personal communication. and pp185 appears to be composed of both molecules. As tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 appears to be preserved in cells expressing the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu mutant receptors, it is likely that IRS-2 phosphorylation is also normal in these cells, although definitive confirmation that this is the case will require direct study of IRS-2. Thus it appears that at least three substrates of the insulin receptor kinase (IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc) can act as intermediates between the receptor and downstream events. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified in insulin-stimulated cells but have not yet been precisely characterized (Lavan and Lienhard 1993). The fact that the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase has been shown to be capable of direct interaction with the autophosphorylated insulin receptor (Ruderman et al., 28.Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar; Levy-Toledano et al., 17.Levy-Toledano R. Taouis M. Blaettler D.H. Gorden P. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also provides a potential mechanism for insulin-mediated signal transduction that is independent of the phosphorylation of adapter molecules. It has recently become apparent that the interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor is capable of stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. This observation has led to experiments that also suggest the requirement of IRS-1-independent events for the mediation of normal insulin action. Thus, phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IL-4 receptors expressed in L6 myoblasts was not sufficient to promote mitogenesis (Pruett et al., 27.Pruett W. Yuan Y. Rose E. Batzer A.G. Harada N. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same system, phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IL-4 was also incapable of stimulating glucose uptake (Isakoff et al., 10.Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 19AGoogle Scholar). Despite the evidence for multiple routes from the insulin receptor to downstream pathways, there is a considerable body of evidence that indicates the importance of IRS-1 phosphorylation to insulin signaling. Down-regulation of IRS-1 expression in CHO cells, via antisense RNA, impaired insulin-stimulated mitogenic signaling (Waters et al., 41.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22231-22234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Micro-injection of IRS-1 into Xenopus oocytes permits insulin mediation of germinal vesicle breakdown (Chuang et al., 7.Chuang L.M. Myers M.G. Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. Birnbaum M.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6653-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) Insulin-responsive mitogenesis in 32D cells is seen after co-transfection of these cells with the insulin receptor and IRS-1 but not with the insulin receptor alone (Wang et al., 40.Wang L.M Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations is the fact that in IRS-1 knockout mice, despite normal phosphorylation of IRS-2 and Shc, modest impairment of insulin-stimulated growth and glucose metabolism is found (Araki et al., 1994;,Tamemoto et al., 1994). However, mice with a complete deletion of the insulin receptor have a substantially more severe defect in insulin action than that seen in the IRS-1 knockout experiments (Accili et al., 1.Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Taylor S.I. Westphal H. 77th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society. Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of other, non-IRS-1-mediated pathways from the insulin receptor. Thus, although IRS-1 is apparently required for the full activation of insulin-stimulated biological events, an emerging body of evidence supports the hypothesis that IRS-1 phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for normal insulin signaling. Our findings with the Arg-1174 → Gln and Pro-1178 → Leu insulin receptor mutants indicate that additional signals, other than that of IRS-1 phosphorylation, must be activated to permit normal insulin signaling to downstream events. We thank Professors Morris White and Chris Marshall for valuable reagents, Drs. Yoshihiko Yamaguchi and Jeffrey S. Flier for their contribution to the identification of the Arg-1174 → Gln mutation, and Professor Jonathan A Wass for his contribution to the identification of the Pro-1178 → Leu mutation.

The eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4E 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorUTRuntranslated region. (or eIF-4α; see (1.Safer B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) is an essential component of the eukaryotic translational apparatus. eIF-4E constitutes part of the so-called cap-binding complex eIF-4F (eIF-4), which, in higher eukaryotes, also contains eIF-4A and p220 (eIF-4γ) (2.Sonenberg N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3.Merrick W. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This complex, together with eIF-4B, is thought to mediate binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex to mRNA(5.Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF-4E has been shown to form a complex with two proteins, p150 (thought to be the homologue of mammalian p220) and p20. The functions of p20 and p150 are as yet unknown(6.Altmann M. Trachsel H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 18: 429-432Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7.Goyer C. Altmann M. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7603-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Lanker S. Müller P.P. Altmann M. Goyer C. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it is generally assumed that yeast eIF-4F fulfills the same function(s) as its mammalian counterparts. eukaryotic initiation factor untranslated region. The sequencing of eIF-4E genes from several species has revealed strong homology within the group of known mammalian polypeptide sequences and less extensive but clearly evident homology between the yeast eIF-4E sequence and the sequences of the counterpart proteins of mammals and wheat. The mammalian and yeast proteins are immunologically distinct (10.Altmann M. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mouse eIF-4E can substitute for its yeast homologue in vivo(11.Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is also at least partial functional homology between eIF-4E from diverse species. At the same time, the functional role(s) of eIF-4E is not yet clear. The two main lines of evidence for this factor's involvement in yeast translation derive from in vitro experiments. First, addition of a cap analogue (12.Gasior E. Herrera F. Sadnik I. MacLaughlin C.S. Modave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3965-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a monoclonal antibody against yeast eIF-4E leads to inhibition of translation in a dose-dependent fashion(10.Altmann M. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Second, in a cell-free system derived from a yeast strain carrying a temperature-sensitive form of eIF-4E, the translation defect could be complemented by addition of purified wild-type eIF-4E(13.Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the step(s) of in vivo translation in which eIF-4E is involved and its mechanism of action remain uncharacterized. Moreover, other reports have indicated that this protein might be directly or indirectly involved in processes other than translation initiation. For example, the yeast eIF-4E gene has been identified as the locus of a cell cycle mutation (cdc33) that arrests the mitotic cycle at the “start” stage(14.Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M. Tanaka K. Toh-E A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a fraction of the cellular population of eIF-4E in COS cells (15.Lejbkomiczh F. Goyer C. Darveau A. Neron S. Lemieux R. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9612-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and yeast (16.Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) localizes to the nucleus. Much attention has been paid to the fact that eIF-4E can be phosphorylated in the cell. Many apparent correlations between the level of eIF-4E phosphorylation and the rate of cellular protein synthesis have been reported(17.Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Clearly, any global regulation of protein synthesis mediated via eIF-4E phosphorylation would have to be based on a specific and precisely controlled mechanism, yet this remains an unresolved issue in mammalian cells. In S. cerevisiae, eIF-4E phosphorylation is unlikely to be regulated by the mechanisms proposed for its mammalian counterparts(18.Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A common property of all known eIF-4E proteins is recognition of the mRNA cap structure(19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the estimated binding affinity is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of the most tightly binding RNA-binding proteins for their targets(20.McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), yet the significance of this binding activity for the cytoplasmic (and possibly nuclear) functions of eIF-4E remains unclear. A key question here is how the affinity of eIF-4E for the cap relates to the ability of ribosomes to bind and translate mRNA efficiently. This relationship is central to the potential function of eIF-4E as a regulatory factor, whose activity might be modulated by phosphorylation or via its interaction with other proteins. Furthermore, the availability and/or activity of eIF-4E might not influence the translation of all mRNAs equally, yet it remains uncertain whether specific mRNA populations can be differentially activated via this factor. It has been suggested that eIF-4E is “rate-limiting” for translation initiation on at least some eukaryotic mRNAs because of its low abundance in the cell relative to other initiation factors(19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21.Hiremath L.S. Webb N.R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7843-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

This might be especially applicable to those mRNAs whose translation is restricted by intramolecular structure(19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23.Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In certain higher cells, the overproduction of eIF-4E results in a transformed phenotype, an effect proposed to be attributable to relaxation of the inhibitory effect imposed by secondary structure on the translation of growth-controlling mRNAs(24.Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 25.De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this paper, we address the above issues by varying both the abundance and the specific activity of eIF-4E in yeast, making use of a series of deletion mutations that progressively reduce its cap binding affinity. A newly developed experimental strategy has allowed us to characterize how altered interactions of these mutant proteins with mRNA influence the translational apparatus in vivo. The yeast strain used as the basis for the construction of haploid eIF-4E deletion strains was 4-2 (aeIF-4E::LEU2 ura3 trp1 leu2 [pMDA101 cdc33 [E73K, G179D]])(11.Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diploid strain (GEX1) used for tetrad analysis after transformation with the various eIF-4E expression plasmids was created by mating strains 4-2 and SL988 (α met8-1 leu2-1 his3Δ1 trp1 ura3-52) and subsequent elimination of pMDA101. An additional strain, YPM150A (α ura3-52 his3), was used for comparative assessment of the amount of eIF-4E present in haploid cells bearing the chromosomal CDC33 gene. Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract) containing either 2% glucose (for mutant eIF-4E genes transcribed from the TRP1 promoter) or 2% galactose (for the GPF promoter constructs; see below). For the growth rate determinations and polysomal gradients, a complete medium containing lactate and 2% galactose was used. Yeast transformation as well as plasmid shuffling and tetrad analysis were performed according to standard procedures(26.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain used for the expression of the recombinant proteins was TG2 (supE hsdΔ5 thi Δ(lac-pro AB) Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10 (tetr) F′ [traD36 proAB+lacIqlacZΔM15]). DNA cloning and sequencing techniques were performed using standard methods(27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis of the eIF-4E gene was performed using the system version 2.1 kit from Amersham Corp. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using Applied Biosystems Model 380B and 394 DNA/RNA synthesizers. All new plasmid constructs were checked by means of restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Proteins were separated on 13.5 or 15% SDS gels according to Laemmli(28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207502) Google Scholar). Gels were stained using either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver nitrate. Western blots, performed as described by Towbin et al.(29.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar), were treated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies (against eIF-4E and eIF-2α) diluted 1:2500 (16.Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with a monoclonal mouse antibody (against ribosomal protein L15) diluted 1:500. The antibodies against recombinant yeast eIF-4E and eIF-2α were obtained as described previously(16.Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.van den Heuvel J. Lang V. Richter G. Price N. Peacock L. Proud C. McCarthy J.E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody against ribosomal protein L15 was kindly given to us by Prof. Juan-Pedro Ballesta (Centro de Biologia Molecular, Madrid, Spain). After washing with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, membranes were treated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) secondary antibody and stained using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Promega). pCYTEXP1 (31.Belev T.N. Singh M. McCarthy J.E.G. Plasmid. 1991; 26: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used both for eIF-4E expression in E. coli and to provide single-stranded DNA template for in vitro mutagenesis. Recombinant eIF-4E purification was performed as described previously(16.Lang V. Zanchin N.I.T. Lünsdorf H. Tuite M. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6117-6123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Expression of the wild-type and mutant eIF-4E genes in yeast was achieved using the yeast single-copy vector YCpSupex(33.Oliveira C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two different promoters were employed in this vector: GPF (the inducible GAL1-PGK1 fusion promoter constructed by Oliveira et al.(33.Oliveira C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) and the TRP1 promoter(34.Dobson M.J. Tuite M.F. Mellor J. Roberts N.A. King R.M. Burke D.C. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2287-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which was cloned into the YCpSupex vector as a 1.6-kilobase pair HindIII-BamHI fragment in place of the GPF promoter. The LUC expression vectors used were YCpLUCEX1, which has a relatively unstructured 5′-UTR, and the derivatives of this plasmid, B3 and X3 (33.Oliveira C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The latter two plasmids encode LUC mRNAs whose leaders bear a stem-loop structure positioned either close to the 5′-end (B3) or close to the start codon (X3). Luciferase assays and Northern blots were performed as described previously(33.Oliveira C. van den Heuvel J.J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were harvested in mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.8), washed twice with cold water, and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by vortexing in the presence of glass beads (0.45-0.5-mm diameter). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The extracts were either used directly for Western blots or passed through a 7-methyl-GDP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in order to isolate the cap-binding proteins. The latter were eluted using buffer A containing 0.1 mM 7-methyl-GDP after washing steps using buffer A alone and buffer A containing 0.1 mM GDP, respectively. In a procedure adapted from Sagliocco et al.(35.Sagliocco F. Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. Brown A.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26522-26530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100-ml yeast cultures (A600 = 0.5) were harvested for the preparation of extracts. The extracts were loaded onto 12-ml 15-38% sucrose gradients prepared in 50 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 50 mM NH4Cl, 12 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. High salt conditions were achieved by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.7 M. The extracts to be loaded onto the high salt gradients were adjusted to 0.8 M NaCl, thus dissociating nontranslating 80 S ribosomes. Gradients were centrifuged for 14 h at 4°C and 60,000 × g. Fractions were collected from these gradients and treated as described previously (36.Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) before being analyzed by Western blotting. mRNA encoding luciferase was synthesized using the in vitro transcription vector LUCEX as described previously (37.Oliveira C.C. Goossen B. Zanchin N.I.T. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M. Stripecke R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5316-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting run-off transcripts had A30 tails and were synthesized either capped, by adding the cap analogue m7GpppG, or uncapped. Electroporation of spheroplasts was performed essentially as described previously(38.Everett J.G. Gallie D.R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereby pulses were applied at 800 V, 400 ohms, and 25 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The strains used were haploid derivatives of strain 4-2 (11.Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were generated by plasmid shuffling (see above). They had a disrupted chromosomal CDC33 gene and were dependent upon expression of either the wild-type CDC33 gene or the Δ196 mutant on a single-copy plasmid (see above). Extracts for luciferase assays were prepared after a 5-h recovery period. To initiate structure-function studies of eIF-4E, we constructed a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants. In vitro mutagenesis of the gene inserted into pCYTEXP1 was used to create NdeI (CATATG) sites at various positions downstream of the authentic start codon (7.Goyer C. Altmann M. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7603-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.van den Heuvel J. Lang V. Richter G. Price N. Peacock L. Proud C. McCarthy J.E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The DNA between the wild-type start codon and the newly created start codon could in each case be eliminated by cleavage with NdeI and religation. The newly created AUG codons functioned as translation initiation codons in E. coli and S. cerevisiae. To shorten the gene at the C terminus, in vitro mutagenesis was used to introduce two adjacent TAG codons at different positions 5′ of the authentic termination codon (Fig. 1). The above strategy was used to generate prematurely terminated eIF-4E proteins with stops at positions 183, 200, and 206 in the amino acid sequence. The deletion constructs have been named (using the prefix Δ) according to the positions of the engineered start and stop codons, respectively. Three N-terminal deletion derivatives were combined with Δ206, yielding Δ7/206, Δ19/206, and Δ30/206. The construction of Δ196 followed a different strategy. EcoRI cuts both in the eIF-4E gene (at position 582 of the reading frame nucleotide sequence) and in the expression vector downstream of the wild-type reading frame. Religation yielded a gene encoding the wild-type eIF-4E amino acid sequence up to position 196, extended by two codons arising from the vector sequence. We tested the viability of strains dependent on these eIF-4E mutants for translation. After transformation of the diploid strain GEX1, tetrad analysis was used to assess the viability of haploid cells lacking the wild-type gene but carrying each deletion mutant (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed that all of the deletion mutants except Δ183 allowed growth (see Table 1 and Table 2). Tetrad analysis with Δ196 gave very poor spore survival rates when expressed using the TRP1 promoter (see legend to Fig. 2), but since plasmid shuffling was possible (see below), this is not an indicator that Δ196 normally cannot support growth. In a parallel strategy, the mutant eIF-4E expression plasmids were transformed into strain 4-2, and the resulting transformants were cured of pMDA101. This produced haploid strains that each contained only a mutant form of cdc33. Each of the mutant genes was expressed at low levels using the TRP1 promoter and at high levels using the GPF promoter. Δ30/206 allowed growth only when expressed from the GPF promoter. Complementation and growth were poor with Δ196. Western blotting was used to estimate the relative amounts of mutant eIF-4E proteins synthesized using the two promoters (Fig. 3A). Quantitative analysis revealed that expression from the GPF promoter yielded a steady-state level of eIF-4E ~16-fold greater than that supported by the TRP1 promoter (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the steady-state level of eIF-4E was ~2-fold lower using the TRP1 promoter plasmid than was observed in a haploid strain (YPM150A195-4C) bearing the chromosomal eIF-4E gene expressed from its own promoter (Fig. 3A). In further experiments, we compared the abundance of eIF-4E in extracts from the strains YPM150A, 4-2 [pMDA101], and 4-2 [YCpSupexTRP1 CDC33] (i.e. the wild-type plasmid described in Fig. 1) (data not shown). The plasmid-borne cdc33 genes supported a steady-state level of eIF-4E that was ~50% less than that of the strain with a chromosomal CDC33 gene and also apparently less than that of strain 4-2. This is consistent with an earlier comparison between strains T93C and 4-2(13.Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4467-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Tabled 1Tabled 1Figure 3:Relative levels of expression of eIF-4E from the TRP1 and GPF promoters. Extracts from transformed haploid yeast strains containing only the indicated form of the eIF-4E gene on the single-copy expression plasmid (Fig. 1) were subjected to SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The samples were loaded in pairs, each pair comprising extracts from strains bearing one of the types of eIF-4E reading frames: wild-type (wt) or one of the deletion mutants, under the control of either the GPF1 promoter or the TRP1 promoter (A). Equal amounts of each cell extract within each pair were loaded, permitting direct comparison of the relative amount produced by the respective promoters. The GPF promoter reproducibly supported the maintenance of an amount of eIF-4E greatly exceeding that found in cells using the TRP1 promoter. Serial dilution of extracts from cells expressing eIF-4E from the GPF promoter allowed us to estimate the presence of an ~16-fold greater amount of eIF-4E in comparison with the TRP1 promoter. An example of such a comparison is shown in B. This second Western blot also shows the relationship between the relative level of eIF-4E in cells producing eIF-4E from the chromosomal wild-type promoter (P4E-4E; in the strain YPM150A) and that maintained by the TRP1 promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell-free extracts were prepared from the yeast mutant strains and used for the isolation of cap complex proteins. The cap binding affinity of eIF-4E was progressively reduced by deletions of increasing length (Fig. 4A), so that this dropped below a detectable level with C-terminal deletions equal to or greater than Δ196 (Table 1). These results indicated that even extreme reductions in cap analogue binding affinity did not prevent eIF-4E from functioning in vivo (Table 1). In experiments where eIF-4E is isolated from yeast cells, it remains associated with the other cap complex proteins (p20 and p150) during purification using the cap analogue column. To examine the effects of the deletions on the binding of eIF-4E in the absence of these other proteins, we overexpressed some of the mutants in E. coli and recovered (and renatured) the recombinant initiation factor from the resulting cellular inclusion bodies. We found that the binding behavior of the recombinant mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the equivalent mutant proteins from yeast (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the data presented in Table 1 apply to the behavior of mutant eIF-4E proteins whether they are present in the yeast cap-binding complex or in a free form. Measurements of the growth rates of the various strains revealed extended doubling times for the mutant genes expressed from the relatively weak TRP1 promoter (Table 2). However, use of the GPF promoter resulted in dosage compensation, thus eliminating or reducing the severity of the slow growth phenotype(s). Thus, yeast can grow almost normally even with a mutant eIF-4E protein that is seriously defective in cap binding provided this protein is overproduced in the cell. In an additional approach to analysis of the eIF-4E mutants, we used electroporation to introduce in vitro transcribed mRNA into yeast spheroplasts (Fig. 5). This method allowed us to compare the translation of capped and uncapped mRNAs in vivo. The results clearly demonstrate that the deletion mutant Δ196, when expressed at a level comparable to that of eIF-4E in wild-type yeast cells, confers reduced selectivity upon the translational apparatus with respect to capped mRNA. The uncapped mRNA is able to compete more effectively as a translational template in the strain containing the mutated eIF-4E. The luciferase activity encoded by a capped mRNA in a strain containing wild-type eIF-4E was up to 5 times greater than that encoded by an uncapped mRNA, whereby the ratio averaged over the four different amounts of mRNA used (Fig. 5A) in 16 independent experiments was 4.3. This ratio was never more than 2.0 in a strain containing Δ196 instead of wild-type eIF-4E, whereby the average for the equivalent set of experiments was 1.9. These results show that eIF-4E has a major influence on the ability of ribosomes in vivo to select mRNA on the basis of the modification status of its 5′-end. However, the distinction between capped and uncapped mRNAs is also markedly reduced when wild-type CDC33 is overexpressed (Fig. 5B). The presence of a defective eIF-4E protein resulted in changes in the profiles obtained from polysomal gradient analysis. Thus, as clearly evident in the case of Δ196, the relative proportion of ribosomes in the 80 S peak increased markedly (Fig. 6). Salt treatment resulted in the dissociation of most of the 80 S ribosomes into 40 S and 60 S subunits, thus indicating that a large proportion of the 80 S ribosome population comprised nontranslating 80 S “couples” (compare with (36.Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). Examination of the influence of the promoter used on the relative sizes of the 80 S peaks reveals that there is again an eIF-4E dosage effect. The increased abundance of the Δ196 eIF-4E mutant synthesized from the GPF promoter compensated partially for its reduced specific activity, allowing more ribosomes to be translationally active. A further unusual aspect of the polysomal profiles was the enlarged 40 S/43 S peak, which was particularly exaggerated in extracts from cells containing GPF promoter constructs. One possible explanation of this phenomenon might be the release of non-scanning 40 S subunits that are normally involved in complexes (e.g. post-termination complexes) with the mRNA. Both wild-type eIF-4E and the mutant derivatives were present in all fractions of the gradient (Fig. 6)."
https://openalex.org/W2018268495,"Through the analysis of the porcine gene encoding the elastase inhibitor elafin, we demonstrated that there are at least three closely related members of the elafin family, and their genes have arisen by accelerated evolution. A porcine genomic DNA library was screened with a previously cloned human elafin cDNA probe, and several positive clones were obtained that can be distinguished by a combination of restriction enzymes. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed the presence of three homologous members whose genes, all consisting of three exons and two introns, are almost identical except the exon 2 sequences encoding the inhibitor domain called “WAP motif”; the intron sequences are related to each other with sequence similarities of 93-98%, whereas the exon 2 sequences exhibited only 60-77% similarities among the three members. The extreme divergence in the exon 2 sequences compared to the highly conserved intron sequences may be generated by accelerated mutations confined in a short stretch of the genes following recent duplication events of a single ancestral gene. An RNase protection assay indicated that the messages of the elafin family members are abundantly expressed in the trachea and intestine, suggesting that the most likely selective forces for the accelerated evolution are extrinsic proteinases produced by invasive microorganisms.

Elafin is a unique elastase inhibitor (1.Wiedow O. Schroder J.M. Gregory H. Young J.A. Christophers E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14791-14795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) having a transglutaminase substrate domain that serves as an anchoring sequence to confine the inhibitor at its sites of action(2.Molhuizen H.O.

Hoppe Seyler. 1992; 373: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), is synthesized as pre-elafin and secreted into the extracellular matrix space where it is cross-linked to certain structural proteins through its transglutaminase substrate domain by the action of transglutaminase (for review on transglutaminase, see (8.Greenberg C.S.

Although elafin was first isolated as a 57-amino acid protein with a characteristic disulfide-linked structure called four-disulfide core or WAP motif (11.Bairoch A. Bucher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the 57-amino acid form is now considered to represent the inhibitor domain generated, by proteolytic cleavage, from the 95-amino acid native elafin which consists of the following two domains: 1) transglutaminase substrate domain that we termed cementoin moiety (3.Nara K. Ito S. Ito T. Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and 2) inhibitor domain or WAP motif. Biochemical and molecular biological studies on elafin have so far been performed using human materials; however, for more detailed studies such as identification of the acceptor proteins to which elafin is anchored by covalent cross-linking through the transglutaminase substrate domain, we considered it more appropriate to use other mammalian species from which fresh materials are relatively easily obtainable and initiated cloning and characterization of porcine elafin gene, which resulted in the following unexpected findings that 1) there are at least three elafin-related genes that are very similar to each other over the entire length of about 4 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s) or kilobase pair(s) bp, base pair(s)pgWAPporcine gene encoding an elafin family member or a WAP motif proteinpWAPporcine WAP motif proteinpWapinhibitor domain of porcine WAP motif proteinSINEshort interspersed repetitive element. including the intron sequences, suggesting that they have arisen by relatively recent gene duplications and 2) in contrast to the extremely high similarity (97-98%) in the intron and parts of the exon sequences corresponding to the noncoding regions, the gene sequences coding for the inhibitor domains or the WAP motif regions are surprisingly variable (77-81%) among the newly found elafin family members. This type of dramatic degree of non-homology within a short stretch of gene sequences that specifically affects the functionally important regions of protein sequences is called accelerated evolution. kilobase(s) or kilobase pair(s) bp, base pair(s) porcine gene encoding an elafin family member or a WAP motif protein porcine WAP motif protein inhibitor domain of porcine WAP motif protein short interspersed repetitive element. Accelerated evolution, or an unusually high rate of mutation in a certain segment of the genes, is a process postulated to occur in genes following a duplication event (12.Goodman M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1981; 37: 105-164Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13.Kimura M. J. Mol. Evol. 1981; 17: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is considered to be an effective mechanism to provide the hosts with a defense system against unwanted outsiders such as pathogens and parasites and, inversely, to provide the intruders with an increased capacity of invasion. Currently, however, only a few cases of accelerated evolution have been reported. 1) The first case is a family of the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) in which an unusually high degree of polymorphism was found in a narrow region surrounding the reactive site. This original observation by Hill et al.(14.Hill R.E. Shaw P.H. Boyd P.A. Baumann H. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15.Hill R.E. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) was later extended to other members of the serpin family by Barriello and Krauter (16.Borriello F. Krauter K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the divergence was confirmed at the cDNA level, but their genes, especially the introns, have not been analyzed. Extrinsic proteinases used by parasites to facilitate their spread throughout the host are considered as the most likely selective force. 2) An extremely high rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions that cause amino acid changes has been found in the active domain-coding region of the wheat thionin genes by cDNA cloning(17.Castagnaro A. Marana C. Carbonero P. Garcia-Olmedo F. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thionins are a family of cysteine-rich proteins and active against plant pathogens. 3) Nakashima et al.(18.Nakashima K. Ogawa T. Oda N. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Kihara H. Ohno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5964-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19.Nakashima K. Nobuhisa I. Deshimaru M. Nakai M. Ogawa T. Shimohigashi Y. Fukumaki Y. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Hattori S. Ohono M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5605-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have found that the introns and noncoding regions of the Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Habu snake) venom gland phospholipase A2 isozyme genes are unusually conserved as compared to the protein-coding regions except for the presequence-coding regions, indicating that the genes have evolved so as to bring about accelerated amino acid substitutions in the mature protein-coding regions. An additional example of the accelerated evolution reported here for the elafin family genes will be helpful for both theoretical and experimental analyses of the unique events in the evolution of the genes. It should also be emphasized that the genes analyzed in the present study are the first mammalian family of genes that have unique introns whose sequences are exceptionally highly conserved (93-98% sequence identities) compared to their relatively divergent exons. The genes may therefore be one of the most recently duplicated gene families. Fresh porcine tissues were obtained from the Shibaura abattoir sanitation inspection station, Tokyo, Japan; restriction enzymes, random primer DNA labeling kit version 2, and DNA ligation kit were from Takara, Kyoto, Japan; pBluescript II SK- plasmid vector and RNA transcription kit were from Stratagene; porcine genomic library constructed in λEMBL3 SP6/T7 using Sau3A partial digest was from Clontech; plasmid vector pBluescript II was from Stratagene; double-stranded nested deletion kit and AutoRead sequencing kit were from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden; 17-mer oligonucleotide primers labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Biologica Co., Nagoya, Japan; 32P-labeled nucleotides were from DuPont NEN; RPA II ribonuclease protection assay kit was from Ambion Inc., Austin, TX; RNase-free DNase I was from Boehringer Mannheim; RNase inhibitor RNasin was from Toyobo, Osaka, Japan; X-Omat AR x-ray film was from Kodak, Rochester, NY; nitrocellulose filters (BA 85, 0.45 μm) were from Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany; human elafin and N-methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc(OMe)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-MCA) were from Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan; porcine pancreatic elastase was from Sigma. The WAP motif regions or inhibitor domains of the porcine WAP family members WAP-1, WAP-2, and WAP-3 were chemically synthesized according to the published method (20.Ito O. Araki K. Kuroki J. Kuwada M. Tachibana S. Peptide Chemistry. 1990; 1989: 353-358Google Scholar, 21.Tsunemi M. Kato H. Nishiuchi Y. Kumagaye S. Sakakibara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A porcine liver genomic DNA library, constructed in λEMBL3 SP6/T7 using Sau3A partial digest, was obtained from Clontech. Approximately 3 × 105 plaques were screened on nitrocellulose membranes by hybridization with the 3-kb XbaI/BamHI fragment of human elafin gene (22.Saheki T. Ito F. Hagiwara H. Saito Y. Kuroki J. Tachibana S. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer DNA labeling kit. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 37°C in 50% formamide plus 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's: 0.1% each of bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and Ficoll), and 0.1% SDS. The filters were rinsed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.1 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.05% SDS and twice at 55°C in 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 1 h and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film with a Konica enhancer screen for 24 h at −70°C. For DNA sequencing, 3-3.2-kb HindIII and 628-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragments of the porcine WAP family genes were subcloned into the pBluescript II SK- plasmid vector (Stratagene). Overlapping deletion clones were obtained by exonuclease III digestion using a Pharmacia double-stranded nested deletion kit. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (23.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using a Pharmacia AutoRead sequencing kit with either T3, T7, or synthetic 17-mer primers labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. DNA sequence data were organized and analyzed using the program GENETYX-MAC (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Sequence comparison was done using the FASTA (24.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) and BLAST (25.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) electronic mail server on the GenomeNet and WAIS server in the DNA data bank of Japan. For the comparisons of nucleotide sequences among the human elafin gene and the genes of the porcine WAP family members, the numbers of nucleotide substitutions were estimated by the method of Jin and Nei(26.Jin L. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1990; 7: 82-102PubMed Google Scholar); the numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions which cause amino acid changes and synonymous substitutions which cause no amino acid changes were computed according to the method of Nei and Gojobori (27.Nei M. Gojobori T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1986; 3: 418-426PubMed Google Scholar) using the molecular evolution analysis system ODEN in the DNA data bank of Japan. Total RNA was prepared from porcine tissues by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method(28.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Antisense RNA probes were prepared from the subclones carrying the 249-bp BglII/BamHI fragment of pgWAP-1, the 417-bp BglII fragment of pgWAP-2, or the 359-bp BglII fragment of pgWAP-3 in the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK-, which contains the T3 promoter for transcription of antisense RNA. These three fragments were designed to contain parts of exon 2 and intron 2. Riboprobes were transcribed from SalI-linearized templates using an RNA transcription kit in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and RNasin, an RNase inhibitor. The template DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I, and the labeled probe was purified by gel filtration using a Pharmacia NICK column. The following procedures were carried out using an RPA II ribonuclease protection assay kit. The radiolabeled probe (1-2 ×105 cpm) was hybridized to 5 μg of total RNA from various porcine tissues, or to 5 μg of yeast tRNA as a negative control, and incubated overnight at 43°C. Single-stranded RNA was removed by digestion with DNase-free RNase A and RNase T1, and the protected fragments were separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and quantitated by fluorography. The inhibitory activities of human elafin and the structurally related porcine proteins WAP-1, WAP-2, and WAP-3 were assayed according to a modification of Wiedow et al. (1.Wiedow O. Schroder J.M. Gregory H. Young J.A. Christophers E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14791-14795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the use of the fluorogenic substrate Suc(OMe)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-MCA. Samples (100 μl) were preincubated with porcine pancreatic elastase (1 μg in 100 μl) in assay buffer (0.1 M Hepes, 0.5 M NaCl, 10% Me2SO, 0.01% lysozyme, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature, and the remaining elastase activities were measured by adding 1.8 ml of assay buffer containing 0.1 mM substrate. The fluorescence intensities were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 383 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm using a Hitachi 850 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Screening of a porcine genomic DNA library with a 3-kb XbaI/BamHI fragment of human elafin gene (22.Saheki T. Ito F. Hagiwara H. Saito Y. Kuroki J. Tachibana S. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) led to the isolation of 13 positive clones. Restriction mapping with EcoRI, BamHI, BglII, HindIII, SacI, and SpeI revealed that they could be divided into three groups with very similar but slightly different restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 1); the three independent clones were designated λpgWAP-1, λpgWAP-2, and λpgWAP-3. Southern blot and sequencing analyses of the restriction enzyme fragments of the three clones revealed that the common ~3.7-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment contained the entire gene sequence that is divided into three exons by two introns (Fig. 1 and 2). Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide sequence of porcine elafin gene (pgWAP-1) and those of the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. The nucleotide sequences of the other members pgWAP-2 and pgWAP-3 have been deposited in the DDBJ data bank with accession numbers D50320 and D50321, respectively. Interestingly, short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) were found in intron 2 of the three genes. Fig. 3 shows the amino acid sequences of the three members of the porcine elafin family deduced from the open reading frames of their genes by reference to the exon-intron organization of the human elafin gene(22.Saheki T.

All three members contained, in common, a presequence of about 25 amino acids, a transglutaminase substrate domain composed of 10-17 semiconserved repeats of 6 amino acids rich in Lys and Gln, and an inhibitor domain where the 8 Cys residues responsible for forming the four-disulfide core structure or WAP motif (11.Bairoch A. Bucher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) are conserved.Figure 2:Nucleotide sequence of the porcine WAP-1 (elafin) gene and amino acid sequence deduced from its open reading frame.

Boxes 1 and 2 indicate highly variable regions and correspond to boxes 1 and 2 in Fig. 5, respectively. The box 2 region corresponds to the reactive site of the acid-stable proteinase inhibitor of human mucous secretions (HUSI-I or antileukoprotease) which consists of two WAP motifs(32.Grütter M.G.

Lottspeich F.

To confirm this, we synthesized chemically the three polypeptides (pWap-1, pWap-2, and pWap-3) and examined their abilities to inhibit elastase. As expected, pWap-1 inhibited porcine pancreatic elastase with an IC50 of approximately 2 μg/ml (Fig. 4); however, pWap-2 and pWap-3 exerted no inhibitory effects on the elastase, suggesting that they display a relatively narrow and quite distinct spectrum of anti-proteinase activities. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the elafin family genes revealed a surprisingly high similarity with each other (Table 1, Fig. 5). The highly conserved regions include the two introns, exon 1 encoding the presequence, and exon 3. Certain regions of exon 2, however, share only 60-77% nucleotide identity; the highest divergence is in the active center coding region. This degree of divergence is in striking contrast to the high conservation of the other regions that display at least 97-98% identity. It should be noted, however, that within the variable region, the structurally important 8 Cys residues are completely conserved among the members. To evaluate more quantitatively the nucleotide substitutions, we calculated the KA (number of substitutions per nonsynonymous site), KS (number of substitutions per synonymous site), and KN (number of substitutions per site in the noncoding regions) values for the 6 possible comparisons among the genes of the elafin family members (Table 2). The ratio KA/KS measures the rate of amino acid replacement in a selected region relative to the neutral rate; a ratio less than 1 indicates that the amino acid replacement rate is less than the neutral rate, and, generally, this is the case because of functional constraints placed on the proteins. In fact, in most regions of the elafin family genes, the KA values are lower than the KS values (Table 2). In the regions coding for the hypervariable regions 1 and 2 (Fig. 5), the KA values exceed significantly the KS values, suggesting that the hypervariable regions have undergone accelerated evolution.Tabled 1Figure 5:High similarity in overall structures and extreme sequence divergence in a limited region of the genes of the elafin family members. The complete nucleotide sequences of the porcine WAP-1 (elafin), WAP-2, and WAP-3 genes were determined, deposited in the GSDB/DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI Data Bank, and compared to each other and to that of human elafin gene (h-ela)(22.Saheki T. Ito F. Hagiwara H. Saito Y. Kuroki J. Tachibana S. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this figure, only the exon 2 sequences and parts of the intron sequences flanking them are shown. Identical nucleotides are shown as dots. Gaps are designated by dashes. Stop codons are boxed. Note the high degree of sequence conservation in the intron sequences relative to the hypervariable regions 1 and 2 (open boxes) in the WAP motif-coding regions(- - -). The amino acid sequences encoded by the hypervariable regions are shown in Fig. 3(boxes 1 and 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1 The comparisons, especially the intraspecies and interspecies comparisons of the intron sequences, strongly suggest that the porcine elafin gene duplication and diversification occurred after the porcine had diverged from the human lineage. This conclusion is supported by the presence in the porcine genes but the absence in the human elafin gene of SINE (see below and “Discussion”) (Fig. 1). The 5′ half of exon 2 of each elafin family gene encodes the transglutaminase substrate domain or cementoin-like moiety (3.Nara K. Ito S. Ito T. Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4.Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that consists of several semiconserved repeats of 6 amino acids. The corresponding gene sequences are also composed of semiconserved tandem repeats of 18 nucleotides. Although the repetitive sequences are highly conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels among the family members, the numbers of repeats are variable (Fig. 3, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6). Such size polymorphism presumably arose from “slippage” of the DNA polymerases or gene conversions or both as often occurs in the regions containing repeated sequences. Fig. 6 compares the repetitive sequences of pgWAP-1, −2, and −3 by highlighting the nucleotide positions that are different from the consensus sequence AAAGGTCAAGATCCAGTC, which revealed an interesting pattern of similarity among the family members; for example, the repetitive sequences can be subdivided into 3 blocks, each of which consists of several 18-nucleotide repeating units (blocks A, B, and C in Fig. 6). pgWAP-1 and pgWAP-2 have block A in common; pgWAP-1 and pgWAP-3, a part of block A; and pgWAP-2 and pgWAP-3, block B and a part of block C. To obtain some insight into how these blocks of repeating sequences were generated, we constructed a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) of the three porcine WAP family genes based on their nucleotide sequence similarities and tried to locate, on the dendrogram, the points of insertion or deletion of the blocks (Fig. 6A). The following series of events may have occurred. 1) Block A was inserted before the first duplication of the ancestor gene; 2) block B was inserted after the first but before the second duplication that produced pgWAP-2 and pgWAP-3; 3) block C was inserted following the second duplication; and 4) block D was deleted after the second duplication from the pgWAP-3 trait. The insertion of block C is considered to be a relatively recent event since the repeating unit in the block is most highly conserved.

The three SINE sequences, inserted in the opposite direction, are highly homologous and flanked by a 9-bp direct repeat, GAGTGTTTG. They have an internal RNA polymerase III promoter with a typical A and B box consensus, a property common to SINEs (34.Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the localization of the elafin family members, we performed an RNase protection assay using 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes representing the variable regions of exon 2 and total RNA preparations from the following porcine tissues: cerebrum, cerebellum, trachea, lung, atrium, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and large intestine. After hybridization of the RNA preparations with the antisense probes, the samples were digested with RNases A and T1, and the protected fragments were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The elafin family members exhibited quite distinct tissue distributions (Fig. 7); for example, the pWAP-1 (elafin) message is abundantly expressed in the trachea and large intestine, whereas that of pWAP-2 appears to be confined in the small intestine. pWAP-3 was expressed at relatively low levels in the large intestine. In the present paper, we reported that the porcine elafin family genes show an exceptionally high rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions in a narrow region encoding the mature protein sequence; the overall sequence similarity outside this narrow region is very high including the intron sequences. A similar case has been reported for the genes of snake venom phospholipase A2 isozymes(18.Nakashima K. Ogawa T. Oda N. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Kihara H. Ohno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among the reports describing accelerated evolution, the above two reports are unique in demonstrating an unexpectedly high conservation of introns since the evolution rates of introns are generally considered to be much greater than those of exons(35.Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Crossref Google Scholar); the other studies concerning 1) α1-proteinase inhibitor or α1-antitrypsin, a major plasma proteinase inhibitor (15.Hill R.E.

Biol. 1992; 224: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have demonstrated greater substitution rates in the reactive center region based on the protein or cDNA sequences. For example, in the case of the plasma proteinase inhibitor α1-antitrypsin, certain species such as mouse(16.Borriello F. Krauter K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), guinea pig(37.Suzuki Y. Yoshida K. Honda E. Sinohara H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22080-22086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unlike humans who have a single gene(39.Long G.L. Chandra T. Woo S.L.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4828-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), have been suggested, by cDNA cloning, to have multiple genes that are very similar in the overall exon sequences (97-98% identity) but show a strikingly high level of sequence divergence at a short segment coding for a 9-amino acid stretch encompassing the reactive center. Such an unusual kind of divergence has been interpreted as a result of positive Darwinian evolution, thereby creating new reactive site sequences with varying specificities to cope with an increasing number of attacking proteinases. The localization of the porcine elafin family members in the trachea and intestine (Fig. 7) is consistent with this view since such regions are exposed to a variety of infectious agents such as bacteria and parasites. Another explanation for the divergence in the narrow region is the neutralist theory which suggests that whenever an exceptionally high rate of substitutions is encountered in molecular evolution, we should suspect loss of constraint that allows previously harmful mutants to become selectively neutral(13.Kimura M. J. Mol. Evol. 1981; 17: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The variable region is indeed located in a surface loop that is not crucial for maintaining the tertiary structure of the protein, so that mutations in this region are not selected against, as opposed to other parts of the protein(40.Braciak T.A.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the neutralist concept, however, the question remains as to why the intron sequences of the snake venom phospholipase A2 isozyme (18.Nakashima K. Ogawa T. Oda N. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Kihara H. Ohno M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5964-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19.Nakashima K. Nobuhisa I. Deshimaru M. Nakai M. Ogawa T. Shimohigashi Y.

A. 1995; 92: 5605-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and porcine elafin gene families are conserved much more highly than those of the exons coding for the hypervariable regions. The first identification, reported here, in the mammalian genomes of a family of genes that are almost identical including the intron sequences except for a short stretch of exons where mutational burst is observed should contribute to a better insight into the molecular mechanism of evolutionary manifold. Furthermore, the presence of short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) in the conserved introns may make the genes suitable for such analyses of diversification of duplicated genes as discussed below. Eukaryotic genomes contain repeated sequence elements dispersed to thousands of locations. SINEs are the most abundant of such elements and constitute 1-5% of the total mass of DNA. Each species has its own SINEs; for example, the human SINE, Alu family, and the porcine SINE, PRE-1, are quite different. This fact and their common properties such as the presence of an internal RNA polymerase III promoter, an A-rich tract at the 3′ side, and a direct terminal repeat at the 5′ and 3′ ends strongly suggest that SINEs are retroposons dispersed through an RNA intermediate after speciation(34.Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SINEs are therefore useful markers for estimating relative dates of gene duplications and for constructing gene phylogenies(42.Okada N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the present study, SINEs were detected in the second introns of the porcine elafin gene family. In the human elafin gene, such a sequence is not present (Fig. 1)(22.Saheki T. Ito F. Hagiwara H. Saito Y. Kuroki J. Tachibana S. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This fact suggests that duplications of the porcine elafin gene and evolution, by the following diversification, of the three genes cloned here occurred after the speciation of porcines and humans.

The ability of bacterial plasmids to regulate their replication is critical to the stable maintenance of these extrachromosomal elements. RK2 and other plasmids of the incompatibility group IncP are distinguished by their ability to be stably maintained in a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria (see (1.Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Promiscous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 1-25Google Scholar) for references). Controlled replication of RK2 in these bacteria requires only two plasmid encoded elements: the origin of replication, oriV, and the initiation protein, TrfA(2.Schmidhauser T.J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 446-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Thomas C.M. Meyer R. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 222-231Google Scholar, 4.Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). All other replication functions are provided by the host bacterium. The trfA gene encodes two forms of the RK2 initiation protein. The smaller 33-kDa protein, TrfA-33, is the result of an independent in-frame translational start in the open reading frame used for the larger 44-kDa protein, TrfA-44 (5.Kornacki J.A. West A.H. Firshein W. Plasmid. 1984; 11: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6.Shingler V. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 229-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7.Smith C.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). While the significance of two forms of the initiation protein may be in extending the host range of RK2, the TrfA-33 protein by itself is capable of initiating RK2 replication in a number of different Gram-negative bacteria(8.Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1987; 18: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9.Shingler V. Thomas C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The TrfA protein specifically binds to eight directly repeated sequences, called iterons, found in the origin of replication(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The iterons are arranged in oriV in groups of five and three. The eight-iteron origin is utilized in all Gram-negative bacteria examined(2.Schmidhauser T.J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 446-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the five-iteron origin is also functional in Escherichia coli(13.Thomas C.M. Stalker D.S. Helinski D.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two iterons outside of oriV have also been identified(14.Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D.

The iterons in RK2 were originally defined as 17-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)Ni-NTAnickel nitriolotriacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. sequences separated by a 4-6-bp spacer(16.Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A later study demonstrated that certain bases within the less conserved spacer sequence are also required for specific binding of TrfA to the iterons(17.Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding by TrfA to the origin iterons is a key step for the regulation of replication initiation. However, binding alone is not sufficient to initiate replication, as several mutants of TrfA have been isolated that are capable of binding to oriV in vitro and in vivo, but which are defective for replication in a number of bacterial hosts(18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Cereghino J.L. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24926-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the TrfA protein by itself must carry out other functions at the origin or host proteins must interact with TrfA bound to oriV to form the prepriming nucleoprotein structure required for DNA replication to begin. base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) nickel nitriolotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both TrfA-33 and TrfA-44 proteins have been shown to purify as a dimer in solution by sucrose gradient analysis (18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 2J. L. Cereghino and D. R. Helinski, unpublished results. and by chemical cross-linking(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol.

Most prokaryotic DNA binding proteins that bind as dimers recognize sites that reflect the symmetry of the proteins by having a dyad symmetry in the DNA sequence (for review, see (20.Harrison S.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 21.Steitz T.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar)). The DNA binding site for TrfA has a highly conserved region (the 17-bp iteron) and a 5′ less conserved region (the 4-6-bp spacer sequence). Contacts with TrfA are made in both regions(17.Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TrfA binding site does not posses any obvious dyad symmetry. However, analysis of the methylation interference pattern of TrfA-33 protein binding to a single binding site revealed putative TrfA•DNA contacts localized in two adjacent major grooves on one face of the DNA(17.Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results could be an indication that TrfA binds as a dimer to DNA even if the sequence itself does not show an evident symmetry. The replication initiation proteins from several narrow host range iteron-containing plasmids have been studied. For plasmids P1(23.Swack J.A. Pal S.K. Mason R.J. Abeles A.L. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3737-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSC101(24.Sugiura S. Tanaka M. Masamune Y. Yamaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and F(25.Masson L. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the wild-type Rep protein is primarily purified as a dimer in solution, but, in each case, the monomeric form of the protein binds to the iteron sequences at their replication origins(26.Manen D. Upegui G.L. Caro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8923-8927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27.Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For pSC101 and F, the dimeric form of the Rep protein binds to inverted repeats that are related in sequence to the iterons and have a role in the autoregulation of rep gene expression (26.Manen D. Upegui G.L. Caro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8923-8927Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27.Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to determine the form of the TrfA protein that binds to the iterons at the RK2 origin of replication. The results presented below indicate that while purified TrfA-33 protein is largely a dimer in solution and forms, at least to some extent, dimers in E. coli cells, it is the monomer form of this protein that is bound to the iterons of RK2 oriV. Plasmid pKB277 (29.Backman K. Ptashne M. Cell. 1978; 13: 65-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) carries the gene encoding the λ cI repressor protein under contol of the lac promoter and was used for construction of the vector expressing the cI-TrfA fusion protein. This plasmid was modified by inserting a chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cmr), obtained as a 1324-bp HaeII fragment from plasmid pACYC184(30.Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), into the unique BamHI site located within the tetracycline resistance gene of pKB277 after blunting both insert and vector fragments. In the resulting construct, pKB277-Cmr, expression of the cat gene is in the same orientation as the cI gene. Plasmid pKB277-Cmr(ΔHindIII) was then constructed by deleting the 520-bp HindIII fragment from pKB277-Cmr in order to have a source of the λ cI repressor truncated at its carboxyl terminus. The construct for expression of the cI-TrfA fusion protein was obtained by cloning into the HindIII site of pKB277-Cmr(ΔHindIII) the 0.9-kb NaeI-HindIII fragment from plasmid pEC1-33(18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment, which contains almost the entire TrfA-33 gene sequence, was ligated to 8-bp HindIII linkers (5′-CAAGCTTG-3′; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and after digestion with HindIII, it was ligated to HindIII-digested pKB277-Cmr(ΔHindIII). The construct in which the cI and TrfA sequences were put into the same reading frame, generating the cI-TrfA fusion protein, was called pSP32. For expression of the His6-TrfA fusion protein the vector pAT30 was constructed as follows. The 0.9-kb EcoRI-PstI trfA-33 gene fragment from plasmid pRD110-16 (31.Durland R.H. Toukdarian A. Fang F. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the same sites of the pSELECT vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 3B. L. Kittell and D. R. Helinski, unpublished results. This plasmid was then mutagenized using the oligonucleotide 5′-ACACGCGAGGAtCcATGACGACCAAG-3′ and the Altered Sites in vitro Mutagenesis System following directions supplied by the manufacturer (Promega). The mutagenesis altered two bases (noted in lower case above) to create a BamHI site adjacent to the start of the trfA gene sequence coding for TrfA-33 resulting in plasmid pAT18. The 0.9-kb BamHI-PstI trfA fragment from pAT18 was then cloned into the same sites of pTrcHis-A (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), yielding an in-frame fusion of a 36-amino acid polypeptide with the TrfA-33 sequence. This plasmid was designated pAT30. It was necessary to reclone the gene expressing His6-TrfA from pAT30 into a vector compatible with the pBR325 based vectors used to express TrfA-33 (plasmid pBK3) (11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TrfA-NΔ123 (plasmid pKK233-2-NΔ123)(18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was achieved by digesting pAT30 with EcoRV, ligating the digestion products to EcoRI linkers, and then digesting again with EcoRI. The 2-kb EcoRI fragment (which included the gene encoding His6-TrfA as well as the upstream elements required for expression of the fusion protein) was cloned into the unique EcoRI site of the R6K-derived plasmid pRR15(32.Roberts R.C. Burioni R. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6204-6216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in plasmid pAT35 in which expression of His6-TrfA was in the opposite direction as the lacZα of the vector. E. coli 71/18 (Δ{lac, proAB}, thi, supE, [F′ proA+B+, lacIq, ΔlacZM15]) cells containing a given plasmid, including the cI-TrfA fusion construct pSP32, were grown under selection and then assayed for their sensitivity to infection by the λ reference (λref) phage (33.Bailone A. Galibert F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2147-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) after plating on BBL Trypticase medium(34.Arber W. Enquist L. Hohn B. Murrary N.E. Murrary K. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 433-466Google Scholar). TrfA-33 and TrfA-NΔ123 were purified from E. coli BL21 (F-, hsdS [r-B m-B], ompT) carrying pBK3 or pKK233-2-NΔ123, respectively, as described previously(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His6-TrfA was purified from E. coli BL21 (pAT30) as follows. The strain was grown on R medium (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% glycerol, 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.2) containing 200 μg/ml penicillin at 30°C to an A600 of 1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the culture was grown an additional 2-6 h before harvesting. To prepare a cleared lysate, the cell pellet was resuspended at 4°C in Buffer A (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) containing 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using 3 ml of buffer for each gram wet weight of cells. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 85,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. His6-TrfA was purified from the lysate by affinity to a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) using approximately 4 ml of resin for 24 ml of cleared lysate. The cleared lysate was added to resin (prewashed with Buffer A), and the sample was incubated at 4°C for 30 min on a rotating table. The lysate-resin was spun 1.5 min in a clinical centrifuge at room temperature, and the supernatant (containing the unbound proteins) was discarded. The protein-resin was then washed with Buffer A 3 times using 5 times the volume of resin per wash. For each wash, the protein-resin plus buffer were incubated for 1-5 min on a rotating table at 4°C and then spun for 1.5 min in a clinical centrifuge at room temperature. The protein-resin was then washed 4 times with Buffer A containing 10% glycerol and 40 mM imidazole using 5× the volume of resin per wash. For the first two washes, the sample was incubated for 5-10 min on a rotating table at 4°C before spinning. For the last two washes, the sample was mixed briefly before spinning. The protein-resin was next washed 2 times using 5× Buffer H6 (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) and then resuspended in an equal volume of Buffer H5 (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 5.0). The protein-resin was then poured into an empty column at 4°C. After the resin had settled, the column was washed using Buffer H5 until the A280 of the column effluent was less then 0.01. His6-TrfA was then eluted using Buffer H4 (50 mM NaPO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.0). Peak fractions were then pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM NaPO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0, and stored at −70°C. The His6-TrfA plus TrfA-33 or the His6-TrfA plus TrfA-NΔ123 proteins were purified as above using E. coli BL21 (pAT35)(pBK3) or E. coli BL21 (pAT35)(pKK233-2-NΔ123), respectively, grown on R medium containing 200 μg/ml penicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin as the starting cultures. To form heterodimers in vitro, TrfA-33 or TrfA-NΔ123 were diluted either alone or mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1 (unless otherwise noted) to final concentrations of 0.125 μM (for each protein alone) or 0.25 μM (when the two proteins were combined) in HEPES Buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with 4 M guanidine HCl and incubated on ice for 30 min. The guanidine HCl was removed by dialysis at 4°C against HEPES Buffer over a 12-h period with three changes of buffer. To dissociate TrfA proteins into monomers, His6-TrfA was diluted to 0.27 μM (10 μg/ml) in Tris Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) with or without 4 M guanidine HCl and incubated on ice for 30 min. The proteins were then dialyzed at 4°C against T/N Buffer (Tris Buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 M NaCl) over a 12-h period with three changes of buffer. Plasmids pSP25 and pSP28 (17.Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as the source of probes containing, respectively, one and two TrfA binding sites. After digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, or with EcoRI and HincII, these plasmids yielded two fragments, the smaller one containing the binding site and the larger one containing the vector. The probe containing the minimal RK2 origin of replication was obtained by digestion of pSP6 (11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with EcoRI and HincII followed by isolation of the 400-bp oriV fragment. Probes were labeled using [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and Klenow polymerase for 10 min at room temperature. DNA binding reactions and gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that poly(dI-dC) was omitted in those assays involving activation of His6-TrfA or when assaying binding activity of the sizing column fractions (see below). 10% acrylamide nondenaturing gels were used in some assays to enhance the differences in the migration of the complexes. TrfA-33 alone, TrfA-NΔ123 alone, or an equimolar mixture of the two proteins was treated as described above for the in vitro formation of heterodimers. Controls of the three protein preparations were similarly treated but in HEPES Buffer without guanidine HCl. Proteins were cross-linked at a concentration of 3.75 μg/ml with 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature in a 30-μl reaction volume. The proteins in the cross-linking reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting to an Imobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used to detect the cross-linked products(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys.

His6-TrfA protein diluted to 1.35 μM in Tris Buffer with or without 4 M guanidine HCl was treated as described above to activate the protein. 200-μl aliquots of the activated protein (+ guanidine) or the treated but not activated protein (- guanidine) were run on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography sizing column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C in T/N Buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and 5-μl aliquots were analyzed for binding activity using the gel mobility shift assay with the oriV probe. His6-TrfA protein was detected in 100-μl aliquots of column fractions using an antibody capture assay(37.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 561-598Google Scholar), using the previously described anti-TrfA antiserum (36.Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit EIA-grade affinity-purified IgG and the TMB Peroxidase EIA substrate kit (Bio-Rad) for detection. A mixture of 100 μg each of bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and carbonic anhydrase in a 200-μl volume of T/N Buffer was run under the same condition to provide size standards. An aliqout of each column fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the position of the protein standards. It has been shown previously by sucrose gradients and glutaraldehyde cross-linking that purified TrfA proteins are dimers in solution(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Cereghino J.L. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24926-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known if TrfA can form dimers in vivo. The phage λ cI repressor is a DNA binding protein that needs to be dimeric to efficiently bind to the λ operators. The amino terminus of the cI protein contains the DNA binding domain; the carboxyl terminus contains the dimerization domain(38.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Sturtevant J.M. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1608-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The two domains can be separated; the carboxyl-terminal domain maintains the ability to dimerize, while the monomeric amino-terminal domain binds DNA at a significantly decreased efficiency(39.Sauer R.T. Pabo C.O. Meyer B.J. Ptashne M. Backman K.C. Nature. 1979; 279: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a fusion of the amino-terminal domain of cI with the leucine zipper region of the yeast transcriptional regulator GCN4 resulted in a stable and biologically active dimer for repression in vitro as well as in vivo(40.Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We used a similar approach to determine if TrfA forms dimers in vivo. The gene fragment encoding the amino terminus of cI (amino acids 1-94) was fused in-frame to the TrfA-33 coding sequence, which had been deleted for the first nine amino acids of the TrfA-33 protein, thereby generating the chimeric protein designated cI-TrfA. Cells expressing the cI-TrfA fusion were tested for their sensitivity to phage λ infection. E. coli 71/18 cells expressing the full-length cI repressor from plasmid pKB277-CmR are immune to infection by the phage λref, and, therefore, no plaques are formed after infection of the strain with λref. Cells expressing only the amino terminus of cI, strain 71/18 (pKB277-CmrΔHindIII), are sensitive to λref infection, resulting in the same number of plaques as with infection of the 71/18 cells alone (>1-3 × 108 plaques/ml). Finally, cells expressing the cI-TrfA fusion, from plasmid pSP32, were immune to λref infection. Thus, the cI-TrfA fusion is a biologically active dimer where the dimerization functions of TrfA restored cI affinity for the λ operators. This result indicated that TrfA is able to form dimers in vivo. Purified wild-type and mutant TrfA proteins are largely in the form of dimers(11.Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Cereghino J.L. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24926-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the stability of TrfA dimers, we examined the ability of TrfA-33 and a functional variant, TrfA-NΔ123, which has a deletion of 20 amino acids at the amino terminus to form heterodimers in solution. TrfA-NΔ123 is able to support replication of mini-RK2 plasmids in vivo and in vitro, to form dimers in solution, and to bind specifically to the iterons of the plasmid origin(18.Lin J. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4110-4119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of the monomer form of TrfA-NΔ123 is 30,599 Da as compared with 33,151 Da for TrfA-33. Samples of TrfA-33 protein alone, of TrfA-NΔ123 alone, and of an approximately 1:1 molar mixture of the two proteins were diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.125-0.25 μM and incubated on ice for 30 min and then at room temperature for 10 min. They were then tested for heterodimer formation by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde followed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1(panel U), the mixed proteins did not form heterodimers. Similar results were obtained when the proteins were incubated on ice overnight (data not shown). However, when the proteins after mixing were diluted to the same concentration in HEPES Buffer containing 4 M guanidine HCl, incubated, and then renatured by dialysis against buffer without guanidine, glutaraldhyde cross-linking revealed the formation of heterodimers (H; Fig. 1, panel T). This indicated that once a dimer was formed, there was little dissociation of the subunits but that dimers could reform after denaturation and renaturation of the protein. In order to initiate replication of plasmid RK2, it is essential that the TrfA protein binds to the iterons contained at the replication origin. The quaternary form of TrfA that binds to the iterons to promote replication initiation is not known. To determine this, the complexes formed by the binding of homodimeric and heterodimeric TrfA proteins with DNA fragments containing one or two binding sites were analyzed. We performed gel mobility shift assays using the TrfA-33 protein alone, the TrfA-NΔ123 protein alone, and the two proteins mixed. All three samples were denatured in HEPES Buffer containing 4 M guanidine HCl and then renatured by dialysis in HEPES Buffer without guanidine. The treated proteins were incubated with labeled DNA containing a single binding site (pSP25) or two binding sites (pSP28). In assays using each protein alone, a single retarded complex was observed with the single binding site probe (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3), while two retarded complexes were observed for the double binding site probe (Fig. 2, lanes 4-7 and 12-15). As expected, the complexes formed by TrfA-NΔ123 binding to the DNA probes were retarded less than the ones formed by wild-type TrfA-33 binding. When the protein sample containing a TrfA-33 plus TrfA-NΔ123 mix (which should contain the TrfA-33 homodimer, the TrfA-NΔ123 homodimer, and the TrfA-33/TrfA-NΔ123 heterodimer) was used with the single binding site probe, there were only two retarded complexes that migrated to the same position in the gel as the complexes formed by each protein alone (Fig. 2, lane 2). When a TrfA-33 plus TrfA-NΔ123 mix was used with the double binding site probe a total of five complexes were formed (Fig. 2, lanes 8-11). The two fastest migrating complexes (which should represent binding to one of the two sites on the probe) ran at the same position as a complex formed by each protein alone. Of the three slowest migrating complexes (which resulted from the binding of both sites on the probe), the upper and lower band corresponded to complexes formed by each protein alone. The intermediate band was unique to the mixed protein sample. These results suggest that TrfA binds as a monomer and that the intermediate band represents the situation where both the truncated and the wild-type TrfA monomer were bound to the same DNA fragment, which contains two binding sites. However, the possibility that TrfA binds as a dimer and that the heterodimer form is not functional for binding could not be r"

We determine that the 1st molecule of histone H1 to associate with the 5 S nucleosome binds with high affinity (KD ~ 2 nM), and the 2nd molecule of H1 binds with a reduced affinity (KD~ 10 nM). This latter binding is comparable with the association of histone H1 with naked DNA. Neither molecule of histone H1 alters the helical periodicity of DNA in the nucleosome as revealed by hydroxyl radical cleavage. We conclude that although multiple molecules of histone H1 can associate with nucleosomal DNA, there is only a single high affinity binding site for histone H1 within the 5 S nucleosome.

In vivo during the maturation of the chromatin of chicken erythrocytes, multiple molecules of linker histones have been shown to become associated with a single nucleosomal repeat length of DNA containing a single histone octamer(1.Olins A.L.

In contrast, the chromatin of mammalian tissue culture cells contains on average a single molecule of histone H1 per histone octamer(5.Goodwin G.H. Nicholas R.H. Johns E.W. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6.Caron F. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 513-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In vitro deconstruction and reconstruction experiments indicate that two H1-binding sites exist within each nucleosome and that the presence of 2 molecules of H1 per nucleosome generates a more compact structure than native chromatin(7.Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological and structural significance of chromatin potentially consisting of a mixture of nucleosomes containing 0, 1, or 2 molecules of histone H1 has not been resolved. More recently several investigators have made use of Xenopus or Drosophila chromatin assembly extracts to investigate the influence of chromatin structure on transcriptional regulation. These extracts are deficient in the normal somatic form of histone H1(8.Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9.Wolffe A.P.

Dworkin M.D. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Dimitrov S. Dasso M.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Deficiency in the normal somatic form of histone H1 should have allowed these extracts to prove useful in determining the influence of this variant of histone H1 on transcription. However, the results of such experiments are controversial. Histone H1 has been variously reported to act as a general inhibitor of transcription within chromatin (10.Shimamura A. Sapp M. Rodriguez-Campos A. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5573-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12.Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or to selectively inhibit the transcription of particular genes(9.Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vivo the selective inhibition of particular genes by the normal somatic variant of histone H1 is observed(18.Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1147-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the discrepancy in results is that chromatin templates with different structural properties are being assembled as a consequence of including histone H1 in varying stoichiometries. The standard assay for the assembly of histone H1 into chromatin in the Xenopus and Drosophila assembly systems requires measurement of the change in nucleosome spacing(19.Rodriguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The nucleosomal spacing increases from 180 bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). without addition of exogenous H1, to a repeat of 205 bp when 2 molecules of histone H1 are present per nucleosome, to a repeat of 220 bp when an excess of 5 molecules of histone H1 per nucleosome is present(19.Rodriguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Without histone H1, transcription in the Xenopus extract is repressed by histone octamers alone only at very high densities (one per 160 bp), but with histone H1 transcription was repressed at a ratio of 1.5 molecules of H1 per nucleosome, at a nucleosomal repeat length of 205 bp(10.Shimamura A. Sapp M. Rodriguez-Campos A. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5573-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19.Rodriguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Comparable results in which exogenous histone H1 increases the spacing of nucleosomes were reported in Drosophila extracts; 1 molecule of histone H1 per nucleosome increased nucleosome spacing from 190 to 210 bp, and 3 molecules per nucleosome increased spacing to 220 bp(15.Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, transcription results were very different; Kamakaka and colleagues (15.Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) find that 3 molecules of H1 per nucleosome are necessary to repress transcription, whereas Sandaltzopoulos and colleagues (16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) find that histone H1 makes a negligible contribution to transcriptional repression. base pair(s). A concern with these studies is whether an unusual or atypical chromatin structure is being assembled as a consequence of including much higher stoichiometries of histone H1 than are normally present in chromatin. The spacing of nucleosomes in a normal somatic cell is typically 180-200 bp(20.van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Thus multiple molecules of histone H1 must be physically associated per nucleosome to generate the increase in nucleosome spacing to 220 bp. How might these additional molecules bind to nucleosomal DNA? We have investigated this issue using a positioned nucleosome containing a fragment of the Xenopus 5 S rRNA gene(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22.Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We establish conditions under which a 2nd molecule of histone H1 can be stably incorporated into a 5 S nucleosome protecting additional linker DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion. We find that the association of this 2nd molecule of histone H1 with nucleosomal DNA occurs with comparable affinity to the association of H1 with naked DNA. Thus, only a single high affinity histone H1 binding site exists on the 5 S nucleosome. Radiolabeled DNA fragments contained the Xenopus borealis 5 S rRNA gene. A 237-bp HpaII-DdeI fragment derived from plasmid pJHX1 (27.Ura K. Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27171-27174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for nucleosome reconstitution after radiolabeling, either at the HpaII site 102 bp upstream from the initiation site for transcription of the 5 S gene (+1) or at the DdeI site 137 bp downstream from the start of transcription. Histone H1 was prepared from calf thymus as described previously(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nucleosome cores were reconstituted onto radiolabeled DNA fragments either by exchange with chicken erythrocyte core particles (28.Tatchell K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 24: 5295-5303Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29.Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) or by dialysis using purified histone octamers(30.Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The original 20 μl of exchange reaction containing 3.0 μg of donor chromatin, 0.5 μg of naked nonspecific DNA, and 10-100 ng of labeled 5 S fragment was incubated for 1 h (all incubations at room temperature). This was then diluted from 1 M NaC1 with two 5-μl additions of TE (to 0.8 and 0.66 NaCl, respectively, where TE is 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), each for 1 h. The salt concentration was then diluted to 0.2 M with 170 μl of TE for 15 min and later finally diluted to 100 mM NaCl with 200 μl of TE. About 50-60% of the labeled 5 S fragment was assembled into mononucleosome cores without detectable dinucleosome complexes with this procedure as monitored by electrophoresis. Cleavage of DNA in the reconstituted nucleosome with hydroxyl radical was as described(31.Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-330Google Scholar). All footprinting was accomplished by gel isolation of the nucleoprotein products of digestion, followed by deproteinization and denaturing gel electrophoresis. Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, approximately 5 ng of labeled 5 S DNA, either naked in the presence of 50 ng of unlabeled calf thymus DNA or reconstituted with a single histone octamer in the presence of 50 ng of unlabeled “nonspecific” chromatin, were incubated with various amounts of linker histone H1 (see figure legends) in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and loaded directly onto running 0.7% agarose gels in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 90 mM Tris base, 90 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Digestions were for 5 min with 0.01-0.5 unit of enzyme/sample at 22°C. Samples contained ~100 ng of reconstituted chromatin, and the incubation with H1 was as described(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Ca2+ was adjusted to 0.5 mM concomitantly with addition of micrococcal nuclease. Digestion was terminated by the addition of EDTA (5 mM), SDS (0.25% w/v), and proteinase K (1 μg/ml). The DNA was recovered and 5′-end labeled with polynucleotide kinase, and fragments were separated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels (21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease cleavage to determine the exact position of micrococcal nuclease cleavage sites was as described(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32.Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For these experiments purified histones were used to reconstitute nucleosomes (30.Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Nucleoprotein-containing bands were excised from the gel, and proteins were electroeluted in 2 × TE, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 25 min at about 5 V/cm and dialyzed thoroughly to 0.01% SDS, freeze-dried, and dissolved in 5 μl of 5 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA. The eluted proteins (or the reference protein mixtures) were radioiodinated by adding an aliquot of the protein solution to a test tube with 10-40 μCi of Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp., freshly dried by a stream of dry nitrogen). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature, stopped by 10 μl of 1 M Tris/glycine, pH 8.0, incubated at 95°C for 1 min, and adjusted to 60 μl of 0.2% SDS. The labeled proteins were precipitated by 27 μl of 5 M NaCl on ice, redissolved in 30 μl of TE containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol on 0.1 μg/μl protein carrier (see below), adjusted to 0.3 M NaCl and precipitated by 6 volumes of acetone, dissolved in the appropriate sample buffer, and resolved by gel electrophoresis. We used a mixture of peptides derived from histone H5 by prolonged hydrolysis in 2.5% acetic acid at 105°C as a carrier protein. The advantage of this carrier is that although the component polypeptides closely resemble the histones by molecule size and composition, none of them match the histones by electrophoretic mobility. Earlier work has examined the structure of a nucleosome in which a single molecule of histone H1 associates with the X. borealis 5 S RNA gene wrapped around an octamer of core histones(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24.Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Association of histone H1 is dependent on the length of linker DNA available for binding; removal of linker DNA eliminated the selective association of histone H1 with nucleosomal DNA compared with naked DNA(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The association of histone H1 with DNA in the 5 S nucleosome is asymmetric(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24.Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since one model of asymmetric histone H1 association with nucleosomal DNA would potentially leave a second histone H1 binding site exposed(26.Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we examined whether we could bind a 2nd molecule of histone H1 to the 5 S nucleosome containing a long linker DNA segment (Fig. 1). At a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of histone H1 per 5 S nucleosome, a clear preferential binding of histone H1 to nucleosomal compared with naked DNA is apparent (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3). At higher ratios of histone H1 molecules per 5 S nucleosome, two phenomena occur: a second complex containing nucleosomal DNA is formed, and naked DNA begins to be bound by histone H1 (Fig. 1, compare lanes 4 and 5). The second complex containing nucleosomal DNA contains at least 2 molecules of histone H1 per histone octamer (see below). At higher excesses of histone H1, both naked and nucleosomal DNA begin to form aggregates (Fig. 1, lane 6)(34.Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We wished to further substantiate the stoichiometry of histone H1 association with nucleosomal DNA(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by recovery of nucleoprotein complexes from the non-denaturing gels followed by radioiodination of the associated proteins. Control iodinations of known masses of histone H1 and core histones allowed the stoichiometry of histone H1 to the histone octamer to be determined as 1 under the reconstitution conditions shown in Fig. 1, lane 3 (data not shown). The formation of aggregates of histone H1 with naked DNA that migrate as a diffuse smear (see Fig. 2C) prevents the exact stoichiometry of linker histones within the second octamer-containing complex to be determined; however, our iodination experiments indicate a stoichiometry of 2 or 3 molecules of histone H1 per octamer (not shown). These methodologies also allowed the demonstration that no histone H1 was associated with the DNA migrating at the position indicated as Free DNA in Fig. 1. We conclude that it is possible to form three types of nucleoprotein complexes in our H1 reconstitution experiments: complexes of the histone octamer and a single molecule of histone H1, complexes of the histone octamer and at least 2 molecules of histone H1, and complexes of histone H1 with naked 5 S DNA. We next examine both the nature and strength of association of histone H1 with DNA in these different nucleoprotein complexes. We made use of the gel retardation assay to determine the affinity with which histone H1 interacts with naked and nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 2 and 3). The 1st molecule of histone H1 binds to nucleosomal DNA with a KD of ~2 nM (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3). Assuming that only a 2nd molecule of linker histone H1 binds to the nucleosome leads to an estimation of a KD of ~10 nM for this association (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3). The binding of histone H1 to naked DNA was also with a KD of ~10 nM (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3). The initial association of histone H1 with the naked 5 S DNA fragment leads to the appearance of specifically retarded nucleoprotein species (Fig. 2A, lane 9; Fig. 2C, lanes 2-5). This may reflect the stable association of linker histone at a single site before additional molecules of linker histones associate. Note that the binding curve for H1 association with naked DNA (Fig. 3) is consistent with cooperative binding(34.Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The binding constants obtained in these assays are consistent with the preferential association of the 1st molecule of histone H1 with DNA wrapped around a histone octamer and the disappearance of naked DNA only at high H1 excess (Fig. 2A). The ability of histone H1 to bind naked DNA and form aggregates is unaffected by the presence of octamer-bound DNA (Fig. 2, compare B with C). Dissociation experiments yield the same relative affinities (Fig. 4), and the 2nd molecule of histone H1 is displaced from nucleosomal DNA at the same level of competitor DNA required to release naked DNA from association with histone H1 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 12). These results lead to the conclusion that a single high affinity site exists on each nucleosome for the binding of histone H1. Importantly the additional molecules of histone H1 that bind to the nucleosome do so with comparable affinity to the binding of H1 to naked DNA.Figure 4:Dissociation of histone H1 from nucleoprotein complexes. Left panel, dissociation of histone H1 from nucleosomal DNA. A mixture of naked and octamer-bound 5 S DNA (10 ng) (shown in lane 1) was incubated with 100 ng of histone H1 for 15 min before the addition of increasing amounts of linearized competitor DNA. Lanes 2-8 contain 0, 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, and 250 ng of competitor DNA, respectively. Right panel, as in left panel except 10 ng of naked 5 S DNA was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The original assay for the stable inclusion of histone H1 into a nucleosome is the generation of a “chromatosome stop” (35.Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this assay, histone H1 association leads to the appearance of a new kinetic intermediate during the digestion of chromatin by micrococcal nuclease. Typically for nucleosomes containing a mixture of a large number of DNA sequences, 1 molecule of histone H1 will protect a total of 20 bp of linker DNA immediately contiguous to the 146 bp in the nucleosome core(35.Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 36.Todd R.D. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3074-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier work, we have documented that the histone octamer adopts a single translational position on the 5 S RNA gene and that the association of histone H1 extends this protection into the linker DNA(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24.Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37.Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38.Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4197-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We repeated this analysis for nucleosomal structures containing 1 and 2 molecules of histone H1. A 5 S nucleosome core without histone H1 protects approximately 149 bp of DNA from micrococcal nuclease whereas a 5 S nucleosome containing a single molecule of histone H1 protects approximately 175 bp of DNA (21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and a 5 S nucleosome containing 2 molecules of histone H1 protects both 175 and 200 bp of DNA from micrococcal nuclease (not shown). The variation in the size of fragments protected between 5 S nucleosomes (149 bp) and 5 S chromatosomes (175 bp) from those of mixed sequence nucleosomes (146 bp) and chromatosomes (166 bp) is due to sequence-specific variation in micrococcal nuclease cleavage of a defined sequence DNA fragment(24.Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ~200-bp DNA fragment derived from the 5 S nucleosome is much less abundant than the 175-bp DNA fragment (not shown). This may reflect the necessity of 2 molecules of histone H1 binding to nucleosomal DNA to protect 200 bp and the reduced binding affinity of the 2nd molecule of histone H1 to the nucleosome (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Weaker association of histone H1 with DNA is less likely to impede the digestion of DNA by micrococcal nuclease. A feature of histone H1 association with 5 S nucleosomal DNA is that the additional linker DNA protected from micrococcal nuclease digestion is asymmetrically distributed with respect to the nucleosome core(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We next mapped the micrococcal nuclease digestion boundaries of the 175- and 200-bp DNA fragment using denaturing gel electrophoresis. We found the boundaries of histone-DNA interactions in the 175-bp DNA fragment to be tightly distributed as previously determined ((21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), not shown). However, the boundaries of the 200-bp fragment were much more diffuse and weaker than those obtained with the 175-bp fragment (not shown). The variation in the position of the boundaries of the 200-bp fragment indicates that either significant heterogeneity in the position of histone H1-DNA contacts exists or that these additional histone-DNA contacts are easily displaced during digestion. Finally we examined the influence of incorporating 2 molecules of histone H1 into the nucleosome for the wrapping of DNA around the core histones. Previous work with 5 S monosomes and dinucleosomes had not detected any change in DNA structure on the surface of the histone octamer following inclusion of histone H1(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37.Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38.Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4197-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl cleavage of the 5 S nucleosome does not reveal any change in the helical periodicity of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer or in the extent of histone DNA interactions following inclusion of a single molecule of histone H1 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 4, and 8 and 9). Neither does addition of a 2nd molecule of histone H1 alter the wrapping of DNA within the nucleosome (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 5, and lanes 8 and 10). We conclude that the incorporation of a 2nd molecule of histone H1 into the nucleosome does not significantly alter pre-existing contacts made by the core histones and histone H1 with DNA. These experiments were designed to examine the nature of a defined sequence nucleosome containing 1 or more molecules of histone H1. The major conclusion is that although multiple molecules of histone H1 can bind to DNA wrapped around a single histone octamer, only a single preferential high affinity binding site exists for histone H1 (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Structural changes to this defined sequence nucleosome following inclusion of more than one histone H1 molecule are minor (Fig. 5). Although these results are obtained with a particular nucleosome they have general implications for studies interrelating the influence of histone H1 on chromatin structure and transcription. We have determined that a single molecule of histone H1 prefers to bind to nucleosomal DNA with a 5-fold higher affinity than the affinity for nucleosomes already containing H1 or for naked DNA (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). This increased affinity of histone H1 for nucleosomal compared with naked DNA may depend on contacts the linker histone makes with the core histones (39.Boulikas T. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40.Glotov B.O. Itkes A.V. Nikolaev L.G. Severin E.S. FEBS Lett. 1978; 91: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or a preference for DNA that is curved through interaction with the core histones (24.Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or that contains two DNA helices that are juxtaposed in space(41.Singer D.S. Singer M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2531-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42.Krylov D. Leuba S. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5052-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 43.Varga-Weisz P. Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. Schroth G.P. van Holde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The preferential binding of a single molecule of histone H1 in a nucleosomal context indicates that studies examining the binding of histone H1 to naked DNA as a model for chromatin structure (34.Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44.Thomas J.O. Rees C. Finch J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) might not recapitulate the same quality of histone H1 association with DNA as seen within the nucleosome(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This might account in part for the failure of histone H1 complexes with naked DNA to repress transcription, under conditions where histone H1 incorporated into a nucleosome will repress transcription(12.Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 45.Croston G.E. Kenigan K.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A weaker association of histone H1 with DNA will make the repressive “chromatin” complex more accessible to the transcriptional machinery. The binding of a 2nd molecule of histone H1 to nucleosomes may occur in vivo(4.Bates D.L. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5883-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and has been documented in vitro (Refs. 7, 15, 16, and 19, and this work). The association of additional molecules of basic protein with nucleosomal DNA is not surprising, since additional histone octamers can also bind to the nucleosome(46.Eisenberg H. Felsenfeld G. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The association of additional molecules of histone H1 during chromatin assembly does, however, lead to a decreased density of nucleosomes on the DNA molecule and an increased length of DNA bound by H1 away from core histone-DNA contacts(15.Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19.Rodriguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The additional molecules of histone H1 bound to nucleosomal DNA under these conditions are likely to be bound more weakly than the 1st molecule to bind to the nucleosome (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Thus it is possible that the repressive character of chromatin will decrease as more histone H1 is reconstituted into chromatin. This result is in fact observed by Sandaltzopoulos et al.(16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We make use of two established assays to demonstrate the association of multiple molecules of histone H1 with nucleosomal DNA. The first is the gel retardation assay, which clearly resolves a second nucleoprotein complex that migrates more slowly than nucleosomal DNA containing a single molecule of H1 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4). The second assay is the protection of linker DNA from digestion with micrococcal nuclease. Each molecule of histone H1 protects an additional ~25 bp of linker DNA from digestion by micrococcal nuclease. The exact basis for this protection is not known; it could derive from direct contacts made between histone H1 and DNA, or it could derive from allosteric changes in contacts made between the core histones and DNA(25.Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6810-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mapping the boundaries of histone DNA contacts in the nucleosome containing at least 2 molecules of histone H1 reveals that strong histone-DNA contacts are not apparent (data not shown). Moreover, inclusion of 1 or more molecules of histone H1 has no apparent influence on the wrapping of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer (Fig. 5)(21.Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus major changes in chromatin structure attributed to the incorporation of multiple molecules of linker histone per nucleosome repeat (7.Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are unlikely to derive from structural changes at the level of the single nucleosome. Chromatin templates containing either histone H1 bound to naked DNA, a single molecule of histone H1 bound per nucleosome, or 2 molecules of histone H1 bound per nucleosome will differ significantly in the quality and stability of histone H1 association. It is probable that these differences will contribute to variation in the transcriptional properties of these chromatin templates(15.Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16.Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B.

https://openalex.org/W2034598544,"The complete sequence of the Dictyostelium myo J heavy chain gene has been determined from overlapping genomic clones. The gene spans ~7400 base pairs, is split by two small introns, and encodes a 2241-residue, 258-kDa heavy chain polypeptide that that is composed of an N-terminal 944-residue myosin head domain, a central 863-residue domain that is predicted to form an α helical coiled-coil containing six hinges, and a C-terminal 434-residue globular domain. The head domain is notable in that it contains a ~30 residue insert near the nucleotide binding pocket, and five potential calmodulin/myosin light chain binding sites at the head/tail junction. The existence within the Myo J tail domain of both an extensive coiled-coil structure and a large globular domain suggests that this myosin is dimeric and incapable of self-assembly into filaments. While these properties, as well as the overall predicted structure of the Myo J protein, are reminiscent of class V myosins, the sequence of the 434-residue globular tail piece of Myo J shows no similarity to that of either yeast or vertebrate myosins V. Consistent with this, phylogenetic analyses based on myosin head sequence comparisons do not classify Myo J as a type V myosin. These and other sequence comparisons indicate that Myo J and two as-yet-unclassified unconventional myosins from Arabidopsis represent members of the newest class within the myosin superfamily (class XI). Northern blots analyses suggest that Myo J may function predominantly in vegetative Dictyostelium cells. Finally, Southern blot analyses suggest that Dictyostelium possesses another myosin that is very closely related to Myo J.

While these properties, as well as the overall predicted structure of the Myo J protein, are reminiscent of class V myosins, the sequence of the 434-residue globular tail piece of Myo J shows no similarity to that of either yeast or vertebrate myosins V. Consistent with this, phylogenetic analyses based on myosin head sequence comparisons do not classify Myo J as a type V myosin. These and other sequence comparisons indicate that Myo J and two as-yet-unclassified unconventional myosins from Arabidopsis represent members of the newest class within the myosin superfamily (class XI). Northern blots analyses suggest that Myo J may function predominantly in vegetative Dictyostelium cells. Finally, Southern blot analyses suggest that Dictyostelium possesses another myosin that is very closely related to Myo J."
https://openalex.org/W1993270020,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the roles of a short series of hydrophobic amino acids in the b-subunit of the Escherichia coli F0F1-ATPase. A mutation affecting one of these, G131D, had been previously characterized and was found to interrupt assembly of the F0F1-ATPase (Jans, D. A., Hatch, L., Fimmel, A. L., Gibson, D., and Cox, G. B.(1985) J. Bacteriol. 162, 420-426). To extend this work, aspartic acid was substituted for each one of the residues from positions 124 to 132. The properties of mutants in this series are consistent with the region from Val124 to Gly131 forming an α-helix. Two of the mutations, V124D and A128D, resulted in a similar phenotype to the G131D mutation. This suggested that Val124, Ala128, and Gly131 form a helical face which may have a role in inter- or intrasubunit interactions. This was tested by overexpressing and purifying the cytoplasmic domains of the wild type and A128D mutant b-subunits. Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation indicated that the wild type domain formed a dimer whereas the mutant was present as a monomer.

INTRODUCTIONThe F0F1-ATPase enzyme complex catalyzes the terminal step in oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation and is located in mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes. In Escherichia coli the enzyme comprises eight non-identical subunits, a, b, c, α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ, encoded by the genes uncB, F, E, A, D, G, H, and C, respectively(1.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The a, b, and c subunits are integral membrane proteins and form the F0 portion of the complex which can function as a proton pore. The α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ subunits are peripheral membrane proteins forming the F1-ATPase portion of the complex and which retains ATP hydrolytic activity when removed from the membrane.The a, b, and c subunits are all required for the formation of a proton pore (2.Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and are present in a stoichiometry of 1:2:6-12(3.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Nature. 1981; 298: 867-869Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The b-subunit consists of a single transmembrane helix at the N terminus with the rest of the protein extending into the F1-ATPase. The cytoplasmic domain is strongly hydrophilic and is predicted to form two long α-helices separated by a turn(4.Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 5.Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Existing evidence is consistent with this structure. The cytoplasmic domain has been expressed and purified and an elongated structure with a high α-helical content was indicated by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit was found to form a dimer which was capable of interacting with the F1(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy of the complex formed between the F1 and the purified dimer indicated that one of the β subunits showed an increased density, suggesting that the b-subunit may interact with a specific β subunit(7.Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interactions between the hydrophilic domain of the b-subunit and F1 subunits may also be required for assembly of the F0F1-ATPase. A number of b-subunit mutations which affect assembly of the ATPase complex have been isolated(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem.

One of these, G131D, resulted in the b-subunit being able to assemble into the membrane but assembly of the whole complex was blocked at the 1α2β stage, suggesting that this mutation interfered with the b-subunit's interaction with one of the minor subunits(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Although the cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit is extremely hydrophilic, Gly131 lies in a short stretch of hydrophobic residues (Val124 to Ala132). These lie near the end of a larger region predicted to be α-helical. In the present study the effect of replacing each of these hydrophobic residues with aspartic acid was examined.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes and ChemicalsAll chemicals and enzymes used were of the highest quality available. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Biomolecular Resource Facility, A.N.U., Canberra.

Glutathione-linked agarose resin and thrombin were obtained from Sigma.Media and Growth of OrganismsAll bacterial strains were derived from E. coli K12. The mineral salts minimal medium used and additions were as described previously(12.Gibson F. Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Radik J. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells for the preparation of membranes and for the overexpression of GST fusion proteins were grown in 14-liter fermenters as described previously(13.Cox G.B. Newton N.A. Gibson F. Snoswell A.M. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells to be used for membrane preparation were grown in minimal salts medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) Luria broth (14.Luria S.E. Burrous J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 461-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while cells expressing GST fusions were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 33 mM glycerol.Turbidities of cultures were measured with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter. Growth yields were measured as turbidities after growth had ceased in medium containing limiting (5 mM) glucose.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of PlasmidsProcedures for the preparation of phage and plasmid DNA were based on standard techniques(15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutants were obtained as outlined in the Amersham handbook “Oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system.” The presence of each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain terminating method of Sanger et al.(16.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar) using a Pharmacia T7 dideoxy nucleotide sequencing kit with [α-35S]dATPαS. A 2.2-kilobase HindIII-ClaI fragment carrying the uncB, uncE, and mutated uncF genes was subcloned from M13 mp18 replicative form into the vector pAN174 as described previously(17.Howitt S.M. Lightowlers R.N. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The correct plasmid was identified as one which conferred on strain AN943 (uncE429) the ability to grow on succinate minimal medium in the presence of chloramphenicol. Restriction analysis confirmed the presence of the desired insert. Plasmids containing the correct insert were then used to transform strain AN1440 (uncF469)(18.Jans D.A. Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 764-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant plasmids generated are shown in Table 1.Tabled 1One transformant from each was purified and retained for further work. A similar plasmid carrying the G131D mutation was generated by digesting pAN257 (8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with HindIII and ClaI and subcloning the 2.2-kilobase fragment into pAN174 as described above. Coupled and uncoupled controls were produced by transforming strain AN1440 with pAN495, which carries the wild type uncB, uncE, and uncF genes(17.Howitt S.M. Lightowlers R.N. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and pAN174, respectively.The vector used to construct GST fusion proteins was p2GEX-4T, which carries two copies of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase(20.Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 111-115Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A BamHI site was introduced into the wild type and A128D mutant b-subunit genes by site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the codons for Pro-27 and Pro-28. This creates a thrombin cleavage site at the junction between GST and the b-subunit portion, allowing the release of the b-subunit domain by digestion with thrombin. A 1.0-kilobase BamHI/EcoRI fragment carrying the portion of the uncF gene encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit and the uncH gene was then subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the vector. After confirmation of the presence of the insert by restriction analysis, plasmids were used to transform strain AN3347 which also contains the plasmid pGroESL (Table 1).Preparation of Subcellular FractionsThe preparation and treatment of subcellular fractions were as described previously (21.Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Gibson F. Langman L. Senior A.E. Fimmel A.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Expression of GST Fusion Proteins and Purification of b-subunit Cytoplasmic DomainsProduction of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-thio-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.1 mM when the cell density had reached 200 Klett units. After a further 2-h growth, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed and resuspended in STEM buffer(21.Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Gibson F. Langman L. Senior A.E. Fimmel A.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted in a French press and the cell debris and unbroken cells removed by centrifugation (30 min at 30,000 × g at 4°C). Since initial experiments showed that a significant amount of the b-subunit cytoplasmic domain/GST fusion proteins was soluble, the supernatant was used directly for affinity chromatography on a glutathione-linked agarose resin. The resin was washed in SMP buffer which contained 86 g/liter sucrose, 20 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The fusion proteins contain an engineered high affinity thrombin recognition site so the b-subunit cytoplasmic domains were released into SMP buffer by cleavage with thrombin (10 units/ml, 4 h at 25°C). The eluate was then treated with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inactivate thrombin and the b-subunit cytoplasmic domain purified by HPLC using a TSK G3000SW column.UltracentrifugationSedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using 12-mm path length cells with carbon-filled double-sector centerpieces. The solution sector contained 100 μl of sample (at a concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/ml) dissolved in SMP buffer, and the solvent sector contained 110 μl of the same buffer as a reference. All experiments were carried out at 4°C to minimize any potential hydrolysis of the sample. Scans at sedimentation equilibrium of absorbance (A) versus radial distance (r) in centimeters from the axis of rotation were collected at 230 nm. The attainment of sedimentation equilibrium was checked by collecting and superimposing scans at 2-h intervals. This revealed that equilibrium had been reached in all cases after 6 h at the chosen speed (15,000 rpm). Scans at 360 nm were collected and subtracted from the equilibrium scans to correct for anomalies arising from cell windows. The resulting A versus r data was analyzed using the standard programs supplied with the instrument, XLAEQ and XLAMW, employing the sedimentation equilibrium equation, (M¯W)r=2RT(1−v¯ρ)ω2(dln(A)dr2)r(Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, ω is the angular rotation in radians per second, v is the partial specific volume of the protein, 0.73 in this case, and r is the density of the buffer. The density of SMP buffer, which is significantly higher than that of water due to the presence of the sucrose, was determined using a digital precision densitometer to be 1.048 g/ml. The procedure followed in analyzing the data was to obtain the best fit molecular weight for the sample using the program XLAEQ which assumes the sample is homogeneous and thermodynamically ideal and evaluates the molecular weight corresponding to the best fit straight line through the A versus r data from. Point average molecular weights as a function of concentration were also evaluated from using the program XLAMW which fits groups of points along the A versus R scan and uses the slope of the ln A versus r2 data at the central point of the group to give a point average molecular weight at the corresponding concentration. Examination of the plot of molecular weight versus concentration indicated whether there was size heterogeneity in the sample. Dependence of weight average molecular weight on concentration was interpreted in terms of the known subunit molecular weight of the protein as described in the text.Other MethodsATPase and atebrin fluorescence quenching activities were assayed as described previously(14.Luria S.E. Burrous J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 461-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Folin's phenol reagent (23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard.RESULTSIdentification and Functional Analysis of a Conserved Hydrophobic Region of the b-SubunitHydropathy plots of b-subunits from several species show two hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1). One of these, at the N terminus of the protein includes 33 amino acids and is generally believed to form a transmembrane helix. The other region includes nine residues toward the C terminus and is more highly conserved than the b-subunit as a whole (Fig. 2A). The high conservation of this region, and its presence in organisms in which two identical b-subunits are incorporated into the ATP synthase, raises the possibility that it may have a functional role in the interaction between the two b-subunits. One residue in this region, Gly131, had previously been replaced with aspartic acid in a strain generated by random mutagenesis and the properties of this mutant suggested that interaction of the b-subunit with one of the minor subunits was affected(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Figure 1:Hydropathy plots of b-subunits from different species.

Sources of the sequences were as for Fig. 1. Conserved amino acids are in bold. B, properties of mutants of E. coli in which each residue in this region was replaced by aspartic acid. The ability of each strain to grow on solid succinate medium is indicated as + or -. The values for the growth yield on 5 mM glucose and ATPase activity of each mutant are expressed as percentages, with the values for the coupled and uncoupled controls being set at 100% and 0, respectively. The ATPase activity of the coupled control was 0.8 μmol/min/mg protein. Atebrin fluorescence quenching activities are given as percentages of the maximum quench. The wild type values were 85% for NADH-dependent quenching activity and 92% for ATP-dependent quenching activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further investigate the role of this region, a series of mutants was constructed in which aspartic acid replaced each residue from Val124 to Ala132. Each mutant plasmid was transformed into strain AN1440 (uncF469) which carries the chromosomal mutation Trp26 → stop(18.Jans D.A. Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 764-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from each strain and the growth properties of the mutant strains and the ATPase activity and proton pumping activities of the membranes were determined. The results are shown in Fig. 2B and examination of all the properties of the mutant strains suggests a helical periodicity for this region. The most severely affected strains were those carrying the V124D and A128D mutations. These two strains were unable to grow on succinate and had growth yields typical of the uncoupled control. The membranes had no ATPase activity or ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching activity. The NADH-dependent quenching activity was reduced, indicating that the membranes were permeable to protons. If this region was helical, Val124 and Ala128 would be one helical turn apart and would lie on the same face of the helix as Gly131. The G131D mutation resulted in similar properties to V124D and A128D although the effects were slightly less severe.On the opposite side of the helix are Ile126 and Ala130 and mutation of either of these residues resulted in strains which were similar to the wild type. The introduction of an aspartic acid residue at these positions did have some effect as both the I126D and A130D strains had reduced ATPase activity and reduced levels of ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching. However, both strains showed significant growth on succinate and had growth yields which approached the wild type level. The NADH-dependent fluorescence quenching activity of these two strains was similar to the wild type.Of the remaining mutants, all except the A132D mutant were unable to grow on succinate. Replacement of Ala125, Leu127, or Val129 with aspartic acid was not as deleterious as at positions 124 or 128 because some ATPase function was retained in each of these mutants. The L127D and V129D mutants had reduced NADH-dependent fluorescence quenching activities indicative of proton permeable membranes. The only exception to the apparent helical periodicity of this region was the A132D mutant which had growth properties identical to the coupled control. Residue 132 is the last hydrophobic residue in this stretch. The A128D mutation was selected for further experimentation to investigate the possible role of this region in interaction between the two b-subunits.Expression and Purification of the Cytoplasmic Domains of the Wild Type and A128D Mutant b-SubunitsTwo plasmids which carried the cytoplasmic domains of the wild type and A128D mutant b-subunits fused to GST were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The plasmids carrying equivalent constructs for the wild type and mutant cytoplasmic domains were introduced into strain AN3347 which also contains a plasmid encoding the two chaperonin proteins GroES and GroEL(19.Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). After induction with isopropyl-β-thio-galactopyranoside, it was found that high levels of both fusion proteins were produced and a significant proportion was soluble (Fig. 3). Both the wild type and the A128D mutant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-linked agarose resin and the b-subunit domains liberated by digestion with thrombin (Fig. 3). The proteins were then further purified by size exclusion HPLC. The wild type protein eluted with an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa whereas the A128D mutant protein eluted with an apparent molecular mass of about 85 kDa. The b-subunit domains are 131 amino acids long with glycine and serine as the N-terminal residues preceding leucine (residue 29 of the full-length b-subunit). The predicted molecular mass is 14.2 kDa.Figure 3:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purification of the GST/b-subunit (cytoplasmic portion) fusion. Cells were grown and induced with isopropyl-β-thio-galactopyranoside as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were taken at various stages of the purification procedure and run on a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel which was then stained with Coomassie Blue. Lanes 1 and 8, molecular weight markers; lane 2, cell debris; lane 3, cytoplasmic fraction; lane 4, unbound material following exposure of the cytoplasmic fraction (lane 2) to glutathione-agarose beads; lane 5, material bound to the beads; lane 6, material bound to the beads following digestion with thrombin; lane 7, material in supernatant following centrifugation to remove beads. The A128D mutant b-subunit behaved similarly to the wild type during purification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Molecular Mass Determination by Analytical UltracentrifugationAnalytical ultracentrifugation was used to investigate the self-association properties of the wild type and mutant b-subunit cytoplasmic domains. The absorbance at 230 nm versus radial distance data collected at sedimentation equilibrium were fitted assuming the protein samples were homogeneous in molecular weight and thermodynamically ideal using the program XLAEQ supplied with the Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The latter assumption is valid as the proteins are of low molecular weight and charge in aqueous buffer and of a concentration below 1 mg/ml. The molecular weight obtained for the wild type sample was 28,000 with an estimated error of ±1000. This indicates that the wild type b-subunit cytoplasmic domain forms a dimer, as has previously been reported(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was possible to fit all of the data with a single molecular weight of this value although there was slight deviation in the last few high concentration points indicating possible minor aggregation at higher concentration. The mutant protein fitted in the same way gave a best fit using a value of 15,000 ± 500. A constrained fit using a value of 14,000 for the molecular weight also gave an acceptable fit. Thus, the mutant protein is present as a monomer. Deviation of the fitted curve from the experimental points at the highest concentrations in the latter case indicated that the value of 15,000 reflects the presence of minor amounts of higher molecular weight material, possibly some dimer.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that a single mutation, A128D, is sufficient to prevent dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit. Our results with the wild type b-subunit are consistent with an earlier study (6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which examined the properties of the cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit. This study found that the soluble portion of the b-subunit could form a dimer which was capable of binding to F1-ATPase, although with a low affinity. This suggested that it formed a structure similar to the native b-subunits. In both this study and the present one, gel sieve HPLC of the cytoplasmic portion of the wild type b-subunit gave a high apparent molecular mass, consistent with an elongated structure. The native structure was proposed to be a coiled-coil(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based on a high α-helical content, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and on the presence of the characteristic heptad repeat in parts of the b-subunit. Since coiled-coils are stabilized by multiple interhelix contacts, our finding that dimer formation can be prevented by a single mutation would suggest that other structures should be considered.Ala128 lies in the center of a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids which is conserved among b-subunits from many non-photosynthetic bacteria (Fig. 1). Photosynthetic organisms possess two different homologues of the b-subunit (28.Cozens A.L. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 359-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29.Herrmann R.G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann G.S. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and this region is not present in either one of them. In these organisms it is thought that one of each of the two b-subunit homologues may replace the pair of identical b-subunits found in non-photosynthetic bacteria. The presence of the conserved hydrophobic region only in species where the F0F1-ATPase contains two identical b-subunits is consistent with its role in dimerization. In E. coli, this region is predicted to form part of an extended α-helix (5.Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and our data suggests that the residues from Ala124 to Gly131 do form a helix. The most severe effects occurred when aspartic acid was placed on the helical face defined by positions 124, 128, and 131. On the opposite face, defined by Ile126 and Ala130, the mutants showed normal or near normal behavior. Aspartic acid at positions 125, 127, and 129 resulted in intermediate phenotypes, as would be expected if this region does form a helix. The only mutant where results were inconsistent with a helix was the A132D mutant which was similar to the wild type. However, Ala132 is the last hydrophobic residue in this stretch and may mark the end of the helix or aspartic acid at this position may interact with neighboring charged residues.In the normal b-subunit Val124, Ala128, and Gly131 may form a helical face which interacts with another hydrophobic surface. In the mutants, this interaction would be disrupted by the introduction of an aspartic acid residue. The finding that the cytoplasmic domain of the A128D mutant b-subunit is unable to form a dimer suggests that this interaction occurs between the two b-subunits. An earlier study of the G131D mutation (8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported results consistent with those described here. However, data from two-dimensional gels indicated that assembly of the F1-ATPase was blocked at the 1α2β stage(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), implying that one of the minor subunits was unable to interact with the mutant b-subunit. The observation that the membranes prepared from the A128D mutant were permeable to protons implies that the hydrophobic domains of the mutant b-subunits were correctly located in the F0. The inability of the hydrophilic domains to dimerize may therefore provide a rational explanation for the failure of the mutant to complete F1 assembly. INTRODUCTIONThe F0F1-ATPase enzyme complex catalyzes the terminal step in oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation and is located in mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes. In Escherichia coli the enzyme comprises eight non-identical subunits, a, b, c, α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ, encoded by the genes uncB, F, E, A, D, G, H, and C, respectively(1.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The a, b, and c subunits are integral membrane proteins and form the F0 portion of the complex which can function as a proton pore. The α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ subunits are peripheral membrane proteins forming the F1-ATPase portion of the complex and which retains ATP hydrolytic activity when removed from the membrane.The a, b, and c subunits are all required for the formation of a proton pore (2.Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and are present in a stoichiometry of 1:2:6-12(3.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Nature. 1981; 298: 867-869Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The b-subunit consists of a single transmembrane helix at the N terminus with the rest of the protein extending into the F1-ATPase. The cytoplasmic domain is strongly hydrophilic and is predicted to form two long α-helices separated by a turn(4.Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 5.Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Hatch L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Existing evidence is consistent with this structure. The cytoplasmic domain has been expressed and purified and an elongated structure with a high α-helical content was indicated by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit was found to form a dimer which was capable of interacting with the F1(6.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy of the complex formed between the F1 and the purified dimer indicated that one of the β subunits showed an increased density, suggesting that the b-subunit may interact with a specific β subunit(7.Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interactions between the hydrophilic domain of the b-subunit and F1 subunits may also be required for assembly of the F0F1-ATPase. A number of b-subunit mutations which affect assembly of the ATPase complex have been isolated(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem.

One of these, G131D, resulted in the b-subunit being able to assemble into the membrane but assembly of the whole complex was blocked at the 1α2β stage, suggesting that this mutation interfered with the b-subunit's interaction with one of the minor subunits(8.Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Although the cytoplasmic domain of the b-subunit is extremely hydrophilic, Gly131 lies in a short stretch of hydrophobic residues (Val124 to Ala132). These lie near the end of a larger region predicted to be α-helical. In the present study the effect of replacing each of these hydrophobic residues with aspartic acid was examined."

Biochem. (Tokyo) 116, 923-930; Okuno, S., Kitani, T., and Fujisawa, H.(1995) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 117, 686-690). After the maximal phosphorylation, the continued incubation in the presence of excess EGTA resulted in additional autophosphorylation of the enzyme, leading to a complete loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity, while causing no significant change in the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the autophosphorylation after removal of Ca2+ occurred on Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis clearly showed that the autophosphorylation site responsible for the inactivation is Ser332. Thus, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV activated by the kinase kinase may lose its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity by autophosphorylation on Ser332 located within the putative calmodulin-binding domain in the absence of Ca2+.

A recent discovery of CaM-kinase IV kinase in the brain (6.Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggested the existence of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase cascade which is involved in the activation of CaM-kinase IV in the central nervous system. CaM-kinase IV kinase has more recently been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat cerebral cortex(7.Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the activation mechanism of rat brain CaM-kinase IV by CaM-kinase IV kinase has been studied(8.Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that CaM-kinase IV activated by CaM-kinase IV kinase lost its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity by autophosphorylation on Ser332 (in CaM-kinase IVα) located within the putative calmodulin-binding domain in the absence of Ca2+. Thus, unlike CaM-kinase II, which is activated upon autophosphorylation on Thr286 in the autoinhibitory domain (9.Kwiatkowski A.P. Shell D.J. King M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6484-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Katoh T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3039-3044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ikeda A. Okuno S.

Wistar rats were purchased from the Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center. Calmodulin was purified from Escherichia coli transformed with expression vector pET11d carrying a cDNA encoding chicken brain calmodulin(18.Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), essentially as described by Gopalakrishna and Anderson(19.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Biotinylated calmodulin was prepared from the recombinant chicken calmodulin as described by Mangels and Gnegy(20.Mangels L.A. Gnegy M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5847-5854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant rat brain CaM-kinase IVα expressed in E. coli was prepared as described previously(6.Okuno S.

Recombinant rat brain CaM-kinase IVα expressed in Sf9 cells was purified to apparent homogeneity as described previously (18.Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rat brain CaM-kinase IV was purified from rat cerebellum by a modification (7.Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activity of CaM-kinase IV was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of syntide-2 at 30°C. The standard assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 50 mM Mops-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, either CaCl2 of a concentration 0.1 mM higher than the total concentrations of EGTA and EDTA or excess EGTA, 1 μM calmodulin, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (approximately 1 × 105 cpm/nmol), 40 μM syntide-2, and a suitable amount of CaM-kinase IV. After incubation for 1 or 5 min, the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into syntide-2 was determined by the phosphocellulose paper method of Roskoski(21.Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). CaM-kinase IV was incubated with 0.2 μg/ml CaM-kinase IV kinase in the phosphorylation mixture containing 50 mM Mops-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.14 mM CaCl2, 1 μM calmodulin, and 0.5 mM ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (0.4-1.1 × 106 cpm/nmol), at 30°C. Incorporation of [32P]phosphate into CaM-kinase IV was determined by the 3MM paper method of Corbin and Reimann(22.Corbin J.D. Reimann E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), except that the filter papers were washed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mM ATP. CaM-kinase IV phosphorylated with [γ-32]ATP was precipitated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to give a final concentration of 10%. The precipitate obtained on centrifugation was washed twice with ice-cold acetone and hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 2 h at 110°C. The hydrolysate was electrophoresed on a cellulose-precoated thin layer plate in pH 3.5 buffer consisting of pyridine/glacial acetic acid/H2O (10/100/1890), and 32P radioactivity, and amino acids were located by autoradiography and staining with ninhydrin, respectively(23.Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 μg (10 μg/ml) of CaM-kinase IV was incubated with 2 μg (0.2 μg/ml) of CaM-kinase IV kinase, in a final volume of 10 ml, in the phosphorylation mixture containing 0.5 mM ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (6.3 × 104 cpm/nmol) at 30°C. After incubation for 60 min, EGTA was added to a final concentration of 0.24 mM, and the incubation was continued for an additional 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ATP and ice-cold trichloroacetic acid at final concentrations of 2 mM and 10%, respectively. The precipitate obtained on centrifugation was washed by sonication once in 1.6 ml and then seven times in 1.0 ml of ice-cold acetone, and it was air-dried at room temperature. The resulting protein was dissolved in 15 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 M urea and after incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the mixture was diluted with 31 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After addition of 2.4 μg (7 μl) of lysyl endopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I), the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 4 h. Another 2.4 μg (7 μl) of lysyl endopeptidase was added and the mixture was incubated for a further 14 h at 30°C. Then 6 μl of 0.24 M dithiothreitol (a final concentration of 20 mM) was added under an argon atmosphere. To the mixture was added 5 μl of 0.56 M iodoacetamide (40 mM), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Some experiments were carried out on a scale of 1/20. The mixture digested by lysyl endopeptidase as described above was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and then loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (0.46 × 25 cm, TSK gel ODS-80Ts, Tosoh) equilibrated with 20 mM triethylamine phosphate (pH 3). The column was eluted successively, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with a linear gradient of 0-45% (v/v) acetonitrile in the same buffer for 50 min and then 45-90% acetonitrile for 5 min and with 90% acetonitrile for 5 min. Peptide and phosphopeptide peaks were monitored spectrophotometrically at A215 or A230 using an on-line UV monitor, Tosoh UV-8000, and radiometrically by Cerenkov counting using an on-line detector, Raytest Ramona 90, respectively. The radioactive fractions corresponding to each peak were pooled and subjected to the second HPLC on the same column. The second column was equilibrated with 20 mM triethylamine acetate (pH 6.5) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-7.2% (v/v) acetonitrile in the equilibration buffer for 5 min, then 7.2-16.2% acetonitrile for 90 min, and then 16.2-90% acetonitrile for 5 min, and with 90% acetonitrile for 5 min, or it was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 40 min and then 40-100% acetonitrile for 5 min, and with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. The phosphopeptide purified as described above was dried in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube by centrifugation under vacuum and solubilized in 50 μl of the modification mixture, consisting of 60 μl of ethanethiol, 200 μl of water, 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, 80 μl of ethanol, and 65 μl of 5 N NaOH, as described by Meyer et al.(24.Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25.Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 50°C under an argon atmosphere and then cooled, 5 μl of acetic acid was added. The sample was stored at −20°C until subjected to amino acid sequence analysis with an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein/peptide sequenator with an on-line model 120A PTH analyzer. The cDNA coding the entire rat brain CaM-kinase IVα was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET11a expression vector (6.Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The SmaI-PstI fragment was isolated and inserted into pUC119 to produce the single-stranded DNA, which was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. The sequence of the mutagenic antisense oligonucleotides used are: 5′-TGGTGGCCGATTCTCGGC-3′ (S332D); 5′-TGGTGGCCGCTTCTCGG-3′ (S332A); 5′-TGGCCTCTGATCGGCTGG-3′ (S333D); 5′-TGGCCTCTGCTCGGCTG-3′ (S333A); 5′-GGCTGGGAGATGCCAGCA-3′ (S337D); 5′-GGCTGGGAGCTGCCAGCA-3′ (S337A); 5′-CCAGCAGCGATCACACCA-3′ (S341D); 5′-CCAGCAGCGCTCACACCA-3′ (S341A). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the mutan-K kit (TAKARA), essentially according to the method of Kunkel et al.(26.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4876) Google Scholar, 27.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4538) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing(28.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52115) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNAs were inserted into the SmaI-PstI site of the wild type CaM-kinase IVα cDNA in pET11a expression vector, and the constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (29.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5976) Google Scholar). The bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.6 to 1.0 at 30°C in 50 ml of M9ZB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, and then isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 4 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 at 4°C) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of microbial protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain A, and chymostatin), and then disrupted by sonic oscillation. The residue was removed by centrifugation to generate crude extracts. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204996) Google Scholar). Gel overlay assay by biotinylated calmodulin was carried out as described by Kincaid et al.(31.Kincaid R.L. Billingsley M.L. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 605-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(32.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Peterson (33.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. When recombinant rat brain CaM-kinase IVα expressed in insect Sf9 cells was incubated with CaM-kinase IV kinase purified from rat cerebral cortex under the phosphorylation conditions in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, rapid marked activation and rather slow phosphorylation of the enzyme occurred as shown in Fig. 1, in agreement with our earlier observation(8.Okuno S.

After the phosphorylation had reached a maximum level, the extent of the phosphorylation being approximately 4.2 mol of phosphate/mol of the enzyme, the addition of excess EGTA to remove free Ca2+ resulted in an additional fairly slow incorporation of phosphate into the enzyme, the extent finally reaching approximately 7.2 mol of phosphate/mol of the enzyme (Fig. 1B), indicating that 3 mol of phosphate was incorporated into 1 mol of the enzyme in the presence of EGTA. The phosphorylation after removal of Ca2+ was accompanied by loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity but by no significant loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity of the enzyme (Fig. 1A) and after incubation for 5 h, the enzyme became an almost completely Ca2+/calmodulin-independent form whose activity was 15 times higher than that of the original enzyme. When excess EDTA was added to the incubation mixture to chelate free Mg2+ at 5 min after the addition of EGTA, both the phosphorylation and inactivation of the enzyme in the presence of EGTA were completely blocked instantaneously. These results, taken together, suggest that the phosphorylation of CaM-kinase IV in the presence of EGTA resulted in the almost complete loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity, although not affecting the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity. Similar results were obtained with CaM-kinase IV purified from rat brain (data not shown). To characterize the mechanism of the phosphorylation causing the inactivation of the enzyme, effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme on the phosphorylation rate was investigated as shown in Fig. 2. The plot of the logarithm of the phosphorylation rate versus the logarithm of the enzyme concentration (van't Hoff plot) (34.Todhunter J.A. Purich D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35.van't Hoff J.H. Etudes de Dynamique Chimique. F. Muller, Amsterdam1884: 87Google Scholar) gave a straight line with a slope of 1.2 (approximately 1), suggesting that the phosphorylation of CaM-kinase IV in the absence of Ca2+ causing the enzyme inactivation occurs through an intramolecular autophosphorylation mechanism. The fact that the rate of the phosphorylation after removal of Ca2+ was not affected by increasing the concentration of CaM-kinase IV kinase (data not shown) provides support for the autophosphorylation mechanism. Analysis of the phosphorylated amino acids in CaM-kinase IV which had been phosphorylated by incubation with CaM-kinase IV kinase in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin or phosphorylated after the addition of EGTA, as shown in Fig. 3, indicated that CaM-kinase IV was much more strongly phosphorylated on serine residues than on other phosphorylatable amino acids in either case. In order to identify the phosphorylation sites of CaM-kinase IV after removal of Ca2+, phosphorylated CaM-kinase IV was digested with lysyl endopeptidase and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 4), and the purified phosphopeptides were analyzed by a protein sequenator (Fig. 5). The HPLC analysis (in triethylamine phosphate, pH 3) of the enzyme, which had been phosphorylated with radioactive ATP for 60 min in the presence of CaM-kinase IV kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin and then for another 60 min in the presence of excess EGTA, revealed four radioactive peaks, a big broad peak eluting at a retention time around 48 min, E2, C2, and C3, as shown in Fig. 4B. The big broad peak was resolved into three peaks, ATP, E1, and C1, by the second HPLC (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the enzyme phosphorylated for 60 min in the presence of CaM-kinase IV kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin gave three peaks, a big broad peak at 48 min, C2, and C3, upon HPLC (pH 3), as shown in Fig. 4C, and the big broad peak was also resolved into three peaks, ATP, E1, and C1, by the second HPLC (data not shown). Thus, the radioactive peak E2 appeared only when the enzyme had been phosphorylated in the absence of Ca2+. The enzyme, which had been incubated with nonradioactive ATP for 60 min in the presence of CaM-kinase IV kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin and then phosphorylated with radioactive ATP for 60 min in the presence of EGTA, produced two peaks, a big but rather sharp peak at 48 min and E2, upon HPLC (pH 3) as shown in Fig. 4D, confirming that E2 contained phosphopeptide(s) which was phosphorylated only after removal of Ca2+. The big peak was resolved into two peaks, ATP and E1, by the second HPLC as shown in Fig. 4G. These results, taken together, indicate that phosphorylation of C1, C2, and C3 occurred only in the initial 60-min incubation of the enzyme in the presence of CaM-kinase IV kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin, but did not occur in the subsequent 60-min incubation in the presence of EGTA, that phosphorylation of E1 occurred during both the incubations and that phosphorylation of E2 did not occur in the initial incubation but occurred in the subsequent incubation in the absence of Ca2+. When the radioactive fractions corresponding to E2, whose phosphorylation was possibly responsible for the inactivation of the enzyme, were subjected to HPLC in triethylamine acetate, pH 6.5, six contiguous radioactive peaks, E2-1, E2-2, E2-3, E2-4, E2-5, and E2-6, were obtained (Fig. 4H). Similar results were obtained with recombinant CaM-kinase IV expressed in Sf9 cells, except that a small radioactive peak, C2 (Fig. 4, B and C), was not observed with the recombinant enzyme, suggesting that C2 was derived from the amino-terminal serine-rich segment (MSCAGNDQAAASGSSSGSGGIFRSPAAK) of CaM-kinase IVβ(36.Sakagami H. Kondo H Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 19: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because only this segment of 28 amino acids is deleted in CaM-kinase IVα. Fig. 5 shows the results of amino acid sequence analysis of phosphopeptides, C1, C3, E1, E2-4, and E2-6, by an automated protein sequenator. The sequences of C1 (Fig. 5A), C3 (Fig. 5B), E1 (Fig. 5C), and E2-4 (Fig. 5D) and E2-6 (Fig. 5E) were assigned to the proteolytic peptides corresponding to Arg435-Lys442 (C1), Val4-Lys34 (C3), Ala351-Lys362 (E1), and Ala328-Lys350 (E2-4 and E2-6) of the predicted amino acid sequence of CaM-kinase IVα(37.Ohmstede C.-A.

Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 8). Since C1 contains only one serine residue, the phosphorylation site in C1 may be Ser437, consistent with our earlier observation(39.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine the precise serine residues phosphorylated in phosphopeptides C3, E1, E2-4, and E2-6, each phosphopeptide was treated with alkali-ethanethiol to convert specifically the phosphoserine residue to S-ethylcysteine prior to sequence analysis(24.Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25.Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, Ser8, Ser11, and Ser15 in C3 (Fig. 5B), Ser353 in E1 (Fig. 5C), Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341 in E2-4 (Fig. 5D), and Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341 in E2-6 (Fig. 5E) were identified as the phosphorylation sites. Although amino acid sequence analysis suggested that phosphopeptides E2-1, E2-2, E2-3, and E2-5 were the proteolytic peptide corresponding to Ala328-Lys350, significant amounts of S-ethylcysteine were not detected, owing to low abundance of these peptides. The results thus far obtained suggest that the phosphorylation of one or some of Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341 may be responsible for the inactivation of the enzyme. In order to establish which serine residue of Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341 is responsible for the enzyme inactivation upon autophosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+, these four serine residues were replaced with alanine to eliminate their phosphorylation and with aspartic acid to mimic their phosphorylation. Fig. 6 shows the time course of changes in the enzyme activity of the recombinant wild-type and mutant enzymes during the incubation with CaM-kinase IV kinase in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin followed by the incubation in the presence of excess EGTA. The reactions were carried out using the same amounts (2.8 μl) of the E. coli extracts. The activity of the wild-type enzyme was markedly increased with incubation under the phosphorylation conditions in the presence of CaM-kinase IV kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin, and the subsequent addition of excess EGTA resulted in a time-dependent loss of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity without affecting the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity (Fig. 6A), in accord with the result obtained with the recombinant Sf9 enzyme (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the mutant enzyme S332A, in which Ser332 was replaced with alanine, was markedly activated by incubation with CaM-kinase IV kinase under the phosphorylation conditions but the subsequent addition of EGTA caused no significant decrease in the enzyme activity (Fig. 6B), indicating the involvement of the phosphorylation of Ser332 in the inactivation of the enzyme after removal of Ca2+. The incubation of the mutant enzyme S332D, in which Ser332 was replaced with aspartic acid, with CaM-kinase IV kinase under the phosphorylation conditions resulted in a similar activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity to that of the wild-type enzyme, but caused no marked activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that Asp332 causes the enzyme to become insensitive to stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin by mimicking phospho-Ser332, confirming the importance of Ser332 in the enzyme inactivation. Replacements of Ser333, the amino acid residue next to Ser332, with alanine (Fig. 6D) or aspartic acid (Fig. 6E), and Ser337 and Ser341 with alanine or aspartic acid (data not shown), did not affect the time-dependent changes in the enzyme activity essentially. Thus, the phosphorylation of Ser332 appears to cause loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity without affecting the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity. Since Ser332 is located within the putative calmodulin-binding domain of CaM-kinase IV (40.Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3038-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41.Jones D.A. Glod J. Wilson-Shaw D. Hahn W.E. Sikela J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8), the loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of the wild-type enzyme autophosphorylated in the presence of EGTA and the mutant S332D was thought to be due to loss of Ca2+/calmodulin binding. Calmodulin overlay analysis (Fig. 7) showed that the wild-type enzyme, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, and the mutant enzyme S333D bound calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+, but the wild-type enzyme phosphorylated after addition of EGTA and the mutant S332D did not significantly bind calmodulin even in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, the autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase IV on Ser332 occurring only in the absence of Ca2+ appears to cause loss of the ability of the enzyme to bind calmodulin, thereby leading to loss of its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity. The shift in mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme upon phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin observed in Fig. 7A (lane 2) has been reported previously(42.Mc Donald O.B. Merrill B.M. Bland M.M. Taylor L.C.E. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10054-10059PubMed Google Scholar). CaM-kinase IV is thought to play important roles in the functioning of Ca2+ in the central nervous system, along with another Ca2+-responsive multifunctional protein kinase, CaM-kinase II, and therefore the regulation of its activity is very important. Discovery of CaM-kinase IV kinase in the brain (6.Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) provided insight into the mechanism by which CaM-kinase IV may be regulated, and phosphorylation of CaM-kinase IV by CaM-kinase IV kinase has recently been demonstrated to cause a marked activation of the enzyme(8.Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike CaM-kinase IV, CaM-kinase II is activated upon Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr286(9.Kwiatkowski A.P. Shell D.J. King M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6484-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Katoh T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3039-3044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ikeda A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11582-11588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two Ca2+-responsive multifunctional protein kinases occurring abundantly in the brain are activated upon phosphorylation, by two contrasting mechanisms. After activation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation at Thr286, CaM-kinase II undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr305 in the absence of Ca2+, resulting in decrease in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity without decrease in the Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity(12.Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8581-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Hashimoto Y. Schworer C.M. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

The present study demonstrates that CaM-kinase IV loses its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity by a similar autophosphorylation mechanism. When CaM-kinase IV was incubated with CaM-kinase IV kinase under the phosphorylation conditions in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin until the phosphorylation reached a maximum level (4.2 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme), both the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and independent activities were rapidly activated (Fig. 1) and phosphorylation of several serine residues (Ser8, Ser11, Ser15, etc.) in the segment of Val4-Lys34, Ser437, and Ser353 was observed (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Although threonine residues (Thr196 and Thr200) also have been reported to be phosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin(42.Mc Donald O.B. Merrill B.M. Bland M.M. Taylor L.C.E. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10054-10059PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), our phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3) could not detect phosphothreonine, probably owing to a low ratio of phosphothreonine to phosphoserine in the phosphorylated enzyme preparation. When the incubation was continued after the addition of EGTA to remove free Ca2+ until the additional phosphorylation reached a maximum (additionally 3 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme), the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity was decreased and finally completely lost (Fig. 1) and phosphorylation of Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, Ser341, and Ser353 was observed (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Thus, among many phosphorylation sites, four serine residues, Ser332, Ser333, Ser337, and Ser341, were phosphorylated only after removal of Ca2+. Replacement of Ser332 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis completely blocked the inactivation by the incubation after removal of Ca2+ (Fig. 6B), probably by elimination of the phosphorylation site responsive for the inactivation. Replacement of Ser332 with aspartic acid made the enzyme possess only very low activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity even after activation by CaM-kinase IV kinase (Fig. 6C), probably by the action of Asp332 mimicking phospho-Ser332. Replacement of Ser341, Ser337, and even Ser333 next to Ser332 with alanine or aspartic acid had essentially no effect on the time course of the enzyme activity (Fig. 6, D and E). Thus, among four serine residues which were phosphorylated in the presence of EGTA, the phosphorylation of only Ser332 appears to cause the inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity, although the possibility of a little involvement of other phosphorylation sites in the inactivation cannot be excluded, because the mutant enzyme S332D activated by CaM-kinase IV kinase exhibited very little but significant Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity, which was lost on incubation in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 6C). The rate of the inactivation appears to occur more slowly than that of the phosphorylation, judging from the result of Fig. 1, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ser332 occurs relatively slowly. The finding that only Ser332 of the four serine residues which become phosphorylatable after removal of Ca2+ was not phosphorylated in phosphopeptide E2-4 (Fig. 5E), although all the four serine residues were phosphorylated in E2-6 (Fig. 5D), also suggests the slow phosphorylation of Ser332. The inactivation rate of the mutant enzyme S333A was much higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, and that of S333D was also significantly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme, as shown in Fig. 6, indicate that the adjacent amino acids affects the phosphorylation rate of Ser332. As shown in Fig. 8, alignment of the amino acid sequences of CaM-kinase IV and CaM-kinase II showed that Ser332 may be located within or near the calmodulin-binding domain of CaM-kinase IV. The fact that replacement of Ser332 with aspartic acid strongly blocked the calmodulin binding indicates that Ser332 is located within the calmodulin-binding domain. In contrast, replacement of Ser333, the residue next to Ser332, with aspartic acid did not affect the calmodulin binding, indicating that this amino acid residue is not involved in the calmodulin binding. A similar regulatory mechanism by which phosphorylation of serine or threonine residue located within a calmodulin-binding domain abolishes calmodulin binding, thereby leading to a loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity, is also observed with CaM-kinase II; autophosphorylation of Thr305 within the calmodulin-binding domain in CaM-kinase II leads to a loss of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity (12.Schworer C.M.

It has been suggested that newly synthesized proteins may interact with a eukaryotic homolog of GroEL co-translationally, thereby sequestering the unfolded protein from other proteins in the cell. To test whether it is essential for GroEL to form a stable interaction with a nascent polypeptide co-translationally, we translated the well studied GroEL substrate rhodanese in bacterial and wheat germ translation extracts. We found that rhodanese formed stable complexes with GroEL solely posttranslationally. Upon binding to GroEL, the protease resistant N-terminal domain of rhodanese unfolds. This interaction with GroEL leads to productive folding of the full-length rhodanese. We conclude that GroEL is able to assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins following release from the ribosome and that GroEL can unfold a trapped protein folding intermediate of rhodanese.

We conclude that GroEL is able to assist in the folding of newly synthesized proteins following release from the ribosome and that GroEL can unfold a trapped protein folding intermediate of rhodanese. Two different sets of molecular chaperones are likely to facilitate the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol. One set includes the 70-kDa family of heat shock proteins (hsp70) and a family of 40-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp40) related to the DnaJ protein from Escherichia coli(1.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The other set of molecular chaperones is comprised of a family of proteins that are functionally related to the 60-kDa family of heat shock proteins(2.Yaffe M.B. Farr G.W. Miklos D. Horwich A.L. Sternlicht M.L. Sternlicht H. Nature. 1992; 358: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Whereas the members of the hsp60 class have little primary sequence similarity, all are polypeptides of approximately 60 kDa, which form stacked oligomeric ring structures(3.Hemminsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T.P.G. C. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 4.Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W.

In eukaryotic translation extracts there is evidence that both sets of chaperones engage the nascent polypeptide chain co-translationally.(6.Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J.

Presumably, hsp40 and hsp70 are interacting with exposed hydrophobic segments on the unfolded partially synthesized proteins(8.Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 9.Blonde-Elguindi S. Cwirla E.A. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The hsp70, hsp40, and hsp60 chaperones are also found in prokaryotes. In fact, the molecular chaperones from E. coli have been studied more extensively than from any other organism, and much is known about their requirements in vivo and their mechanism of action in vitro (for a review, see (10.Hartl F.U. Hlodan R. Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar)). The E. coli hsp60 homologue, GroEL, cooperates with the hsp70/hsp40 chaperones (DnaK/DnaJ) to facilitate protein folding in the cell(1.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 11.Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the hsp70/hsp40 chaperone system acts prior to the hsp60 along the same folding pathway, or if the two systems work along parallel pathways. Both molecular chaperone systems can function independently to assist the refolding of proteins in vitro(12.Laminet A.A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13.Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25425-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at least one model protein can be released from DnaK/DnaJ in a state competent to bind to GroEL, but not vice versa, suggesting that the chaperones may work along the same folding pathway (1.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for the mechanism of GroEL action. In the first model, sometimes called the infinite dilution model, the role of GroEL is to sequester the protein folding intermediates, thereby preventing aggregation of the folding protein(14.Martin J.

The protein is released from the GroEL oligomer only after it achieves its native state. In a contrasting model, the role of GroEL is to assist unproductive, or trapped, folding intermediates back onto the productive protein folding pathway(15.Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 16.Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We will call this second model the “kinetic detrapping” model. GroEL binds to partially folded proteins in solution and then uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive the protein to a folding-competent state. The cycle of binding and release may occur on average several times before a high percentage of a model protein has obtained its native structure. To distinguish between the infinite dilution and kinetic trapping models we investigated whether the hsp60 chaperone encounters a polypeptide attached to a ribosome. The infinite dilution model would be most compatible with a co-translational interaction between a folding protein and GroEL. This model predicts that as a protein is being synthesized it is immediately sequestered from solution to prevent aggregation. Co-translational interactions would seem unnecessary in the kinetic detrapping model, since the fully translated protein may release from and rebind to GroEL multiple times during the chaperone assisted folding. In this study we followed the interactions between GroEL and newly synthesized proteins in bacterial translation extracts, to test when this bacterial hsp60 first encounters a folding protein in the cell. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using pRhoD (18.Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as a template to generate a rhodanese gene flanked with BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The primers used for rhodanese polymerase chain reaction were: start, 5′-TAG GAT CCA TGC ATC AGG TGC TCT AC-3′ and end, 5′-AT AAG CTT CCC ACT CTT CCC-3′. The BamHI site is immediately 5′ of the translation start codon and the HindIII site replaced both the stop codon and the C-terminal alanine codon of rhodanese. This fragment was ligated into the plasmid vector pGEM-3Z (Promega), transformed into bacteria, and purified (19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for subsequent wheat germ translations or into pAED2 (20.Zhang T. Bertelsen E. Benvegnu D. Alber T.

Rhodanese DNA was linearized with HindIII, then transcribed in vitro (Promega Riboprobe) to generate truncated mRNA. For T4 lysozyme transcription and translation, cpT4L in pAED2 was used as template(20.Zhang T. Bertelsen E. Benvegnu D. Alber T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12311-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). cpT4L codes for the TA, or cysteineless “pseudo wild type” lysozyme. This lysozyme construct codes for a flexible linker extension on the C terminus (AGTGGTGGCGGTGGCGCC), which also contains a NarI restriction site used to generate the stop-codonless truncation in this study. NarI-linearized T4 lysozyme DNA was transcribed in vitro as with rhodanese and translated using bacterial S30. The additional C-terminal amino acids on the translated cpT4L are: Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly. Wheat germ extract was purchased from Promega, and in vitro translations were done according to their instructions with no additional potassium acetate. Bacterial S30 extract was prepared according to the method of Zubay(21.Zubay G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1973; 7: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). S30 translations were performed in 40 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 20 mM ammonium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, 0.04 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 40 μg/ml E. coli tRNA. Typical 25-μl reactions contained 4 μl of S30 extract, 0.5 μl of RNasin (Promega), 1-2 μg of mRNA, and 1 μl of Tran35S-label (ICN, 1200 Ci/mmol). Translations were done at 30°C for 1 h. Following translation, unless otherwise noted, apyrase (Sigma, grade VI) was added to 0.03 mg/ml to deplete ATP. When additional GroEL was added, the final GroEL concentration was 2 mg/ml. GroEL was always added prior to apyrase treatment. GroEL and GroES was purified as described(22.Bochkareva E.S. Lissen N.M. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Girsovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nascent chains were released with 2 mM puromycin for 10 min at 30°C. Protease digestions were done at 10 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 7.5, for 5-10 min and were quenched with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Step gradients were formed with 0.25 ml each of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% sucrose in translation buffer. Translation reactions (50-100 μl) were layered on top of gradients in centrifuge tubes (Beckman 11 × 34-mm polycarbonate), and these were centrifuged for 50 min at 54,000 rpm in a TLS-55 rotor. Gradients were fractionated into 100-μl aliquots. 10 μl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. and fluorography. Gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against GroEL by injection of the native tetradecamer into rabbits (23.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antiserum was shown to recognize a single protein in E. coli extracts by both Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled bacterial extract. Immunoprecipitations of translation reactions were performed on 80 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction with polyclonal antibodies raised against GroEL. Polyclonal antibodies were added to translations or sucrose gradient fractions (1:50 (v/v)), and primary complexes were formed for 1 h on ice. Secondary complexes were formed by the addition of 100 μl of 10% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0). Secondary complexes were formed for 1 h while shaking at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described above. Rhodanese, a 33-kDa monomer, has been used as a model protein in a number of chaperone assisted folding studies(14.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 24.Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When rapidly diluted into a buffer from denaturant, rhodanese tends to aggregate in the absence of detergent or chaperones(25.Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodanese renatured from urea binds tightly to GroEL and can be reactivated with the addition of the hsp60 co-factor GroES and Mg-ATP(24.Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether GroEL is able to bind rhodanese co-translationally, we generated stalled translation complexes with bound nascent rhodanese. Stalled ribosome-nascent chain complexes were created by translating mRNA in vitro lacking stop codons. In the absence of a termination codon, termination factors cannot bind and release the nascent chain from the ribosome (26.Perara E. Rothman R.E. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1986; 232: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For the following experiments, 35S-labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using either a wheat germ or a bacterial S30 translation extract with mRNA lacking stop codons. Of two model proteins studied in detail, both yielded relatively stable stalled mRNA-ribosome-nascent chain complexes, as determined by sedimentation over a sucrose gradient. Controls were performed to determine the sedimentation positions of small soluble proteins, GroEL, ribosomes, and polysomes on identical gradients (not shown). About 70% of full-length proteins remained bound to the ribosomes. The efficiency of release varied with the protein tested. For example, approximately 90% of T4 lysozyme could be released upon addition of the aminoacyl-tRNA analog puromycin, yet only about 70% of rhodanese was released under similar conditions. Release of the nascent chain was monitored by the sedimentation rate of the labeled protein through a sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 1, the bound 35S-labeled bacteriophage T4 lysozyme sedimented at the position of monosomes and polysomes (Fig. 1a). Following a brief puromycin treatment, the lysozyme sedimented more slowly and barely entered the sucrose gradient (Fig. 1b, lanes 1-3). This position on the gradient is consistent with the released protein behaving as a monomer. In contrast, truncated rhodanese released with puromycin sedimented over a very broad range of values, indicating that the puromycyl-rhodanese either aggregates or binds to other proteins in the wheat germ translation extract (Fig. 1c). Rhodanese found at the bottom of the gradient (fraction 14) likely represents aggregated rhodanese and not unreleased polysomes, as the characteristic high molecular weight peptidyl-tRNA band was not evident. As with T4 lysozyme, truncated rhodanese remains bound to ribosomes following translation (Fig. 2a), and sediments at the position of monosomes and polysomes (fractions 9-11 and fraction 14). If GroEL is added prior to puromycin addition, rhodanese released from the ribosome no longer was distributed over the entire sucrose gradient as seen in Fig. 1c, but was instead found mainly in the same fractions as GroEL (Fig. 2b, fractions 3 and 4). This peak of radioactivity could be well resolved from both monomeric rhodanese (see Fig. 3b, lane 1) and the monosome and polysomes (see Fig. 2a, lanes 10 and 14, respectively). Other proteins tested (α-luciferase and β-luciferase) also bound to GroEL following release from the ribosome (data not shown). In contrast, puromycin-released T4 lysozyme did not bind stably to GroEL (Fig. 1), as expected for this protein, which can spontaneously refold(27.Chen B.-L. Baase W.A. Nicholson H. Schellman J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the TA, or pseudo wild type lysozyme, which lacks disulfide-forming cysteines and is nearly as stable as wild type T4 lysozyme (65.8 versus 67.2°C), was used in this study(28.Matsamura M. Matthews B.W. Science. 1989; 243: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29.Pjura P.E. Matsamura M. Wozniak J.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2592-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30.Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Wozniak J.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 229: 747-769Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although these sucrose gradients suggest that stable binding of rhodanese to GroEL can occur posttranslationally, they do not address when GroEL is first able to bind to the nascent polypeptide chain. In order to determine whether GroEL can bind nascent rhodanese on the ribosome, immunoprecipitations were performed on sucrose gradient fractions shown in Fig. 2, a and b, using anti-GroEL antisera. Radiolabeled rhodanese in the GroEL containing peak (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4) could be co-immunoprecipitated with GroEL following release with puromycin. In contrast, no 35S-labeled rhodanese could be detected in immunoprecipitations on the monosome or polysome fraction prior to (Fig. 2c, fractions 9-14) or following puromycin treatments (Fig. 2d, fractions 9-14). Apparently, the anti-GroEL antiserum was unable to co-immunoprecipitate the radiolabeled rhodanese in these fractions. It is difficult to imagine that the polyclonal antiserum was simply unable to access and immunoprecipitate GroEL bound to a ribosome, since GroEL is such a large complex, consisting of two seven-membered rings stacked back to back(31.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Moreover, GroEL was found only in fractions 2-5 (with a peak in fractions 3 and 4), and not in the monosome or polysome fractions, on all the gradients probed by immunoblotting, both before and following release of the nascent chain (not shown). These results indicate that stable interactions between GroEL and rhodanese occur solely posttranslationally on the full-length protein. Identical results were obtained in both wheat germ and bacterial translation extracts (data not shown). Similar results were recently reported for bacterial proteins in the cell. In a pulse-chase experiment a large number of unidentified bacterial proteins were found to interact with GroEL solely posttranslationally (32.Gaitanaris G.A. Vysokanov A. Hung S.C. Gottesman M.E. Gragerov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar immunoprecipitation experiments were also performed with monoclonal antibodies against DnaK. No radiolabeled rhodanese could be detected in these precipitates from GroEL-rhodanese complexes or in the monosome or polysome fractions from bacterial extract translations (data not shown). It remains possible, however, that the epitope recognized by the monoclonal DnaK antibody was blocked in a DnaK containing complex. As described above, addition of GroEL prevents the puromycin-released rhodanese from aggregating or binding nonspecifically to other proteins. Like the full-length protein binding to GroEL upon dilution from urea, the rhodanese released from the ribosome binds tightly enough to GroEL to be isolated on a sucrose gradient(22.Bochkareva E.S. Lissen N.M. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Girsovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even after a prolonged attachment to GroEL, urea-denatured rhodanese can be renatured with the addition of ATP and the GroES co-factor. To test whether the GroEL bound form of the translated/puromycin-released rhodanese was capable of folding, GroEL-rhodanese complex isolated from a sucrose gradient (Fig. 2a, fractions 3 and 4) was incubated with ATP and GroES for 2 h at 30°C. Following this treatment, most of the rhodanese was released and sedimented near the top (Fig. 3b, fraction 1) of a second sucrose gradient. The labeled rhodanese remained bound to GroEL on the second sucrose gradient if GroES and ATP were omitted from the incubation (Fig. 3a, fractions 3 and 4). Although the radiolabeled rhodanese could be released from GroEL and sedimented similar to monomeric rhodanese, it was possible that the protein remained in a non-native structure. We therefore tested the folding state of the GroEL released rhodanese by protease sensitivity. Following an incubation of isolated GroEL-rhodanese complexes in which GroES and ATP were omitted, the radiolabeled rhodanese, still bound to GroEL, is protease-sensitive, and is completely digested with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) within 5 min (Fig. 4b). When released from GroEL in the GroES- and ATP-containing incubation, the radiolabeled rhodanese was much more protease-resistant. A substantial portion of the rhodanese released from GroEL remained intact upon a 30-min incubation under identical conditions (Fig. 4a). Taken together, these results suggest that the rhodanese released from GroEL with GroES and ATP is in a more folded state than in the GroEL bound state. However, we were unable to determine the fraction of rhodanese that was able to obtain its native state, since the quantities synthesized in these translation extracts were too low to measure the rhodanese enzymatic activity. Since GroEL only binds rhodanese after its release from the ribosome, we were able to test whether GroEL-independent folding of nascent rhodanese occurs co-translationally. Co-translational folding has been observed for both the β subunit of tryptophan synthetase and firefly luciferase, using antibody binding and proteolysis, respectively(7.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 33.Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rhodanese is a 33-kDa enzyme composed of two structural domains. These two domains, the N- and C-terminal domains, are structurally homologous despite little amino acid sequence similarity(34.Ploegman J.H. Drent G.H. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russel J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether any domains of rhodanese form co-translationally, the protease sensitivity of the ribosome attached full-length rhodanese was tested. The product of this digestion with proteinase K is shown in Fig. 4c. A digestion product of approximately 17 kDa appeared under a range of protease concentrations, suggesting that a stable domain of rhodanese formed co-translationally (Fig. 4c, lane 2). This domain was stable at proteinase K concentrations of at least 100 μg/ml (data not shown). Furthermore, the domain is protease-resistant for at least 90 min under the conditions used for Fig. 4c. Because approximately 35 amino acid residues of the C terminus of rhodanese are likely to be buried within the ribosome, and therefore unavailable for folding(35.Malkin L.I. Rich A. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 329-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36.Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to propose that the ribosome bound full-length rhodanese consists of a protease stable N-terminal domain and a less well folded C-terminal domain. This was tested directly by generating a stalled translation complex of rhodanese lacking the C-terminal domain. The mRNA from this truncated version of the rhodanese message (amino acids 1-206 rhodanese) would then allow the translation of the N-terminal domain, the short linker region between the two domains, and the first 35 amino acids of the C-terminal domain. Therefore only the N-terminal domain and the linker region would be protease-accessible in the stalled translation complexes. The amino acids 1-206 rhodanese stalled translation complex was formed and digested with proteinase K as described above (Fig. 4d). As seen with the full-length rhodanese, a 17-kDa protease-resistant fragment was generated from the ribosome-bound truncated rhodanese (lanes 5 and 6). It appears that the fragment generated by protease treatment of the stalled rhodanese ribosome complex corresponds to the N-terminal region that is similar or identical to the N-terminal structural domain of the native protein. It should be noted that the 17-kDa protease-resistant domain did not appear to be present on all nascent rhodanese molecules. Quantitation of the 17-kDa domain generated under a range of protease concentrations and time points indicate that about half of the full-length molecules do not have a protease-resistant N-terminal domain. In other words, at the first time point in typical rhodanese digestions, around 50% of the original signal is lost. It is unlikely that the loss of half the nascent N-terminal domains represents a rapid digestion of this domain under these conditions, however. As shown in Fig. 5a, for example, the protease-insensitive N-terminal domain that does form is quite stable for at least 90 min under relatively high concentrations of protease. In the previous experiments we observed that the N-terminal domain of rhodanese formed co-translationally, but that GroEL binding only occurred posttranslationally. This order of events raises a new question: what is the fate of the folded N-terminal domain upon release from the ribosome and subsequent binding to GroEL? Following a translation reaction, the reaction was divided, with GroEL added to only one fraction. Fig. 5, a and b, show the products of proteinase K digestions of these two reactions. In translation reactions lacking GroEL (a), the 17-kDa domain remained resistant to proteolysis for at least 90 min. In the reaction containing GroEL (b), the 17-kDa domain did not appear as a stable fragment at any point in the time course of protease digestion. This result suggests that GroEL is acting to destabilize, or unfold, the N-terminal domain of rhodanese. That the destabilization of the N-terminal domain is GroEL-dependent is shown in Fig. 5c. In this experiment, a stalled complex was briefly incubated with proteinase K to free the N-terminal domain from the ribosome. Since the N-terminal domain is relatively resistant to proteolysis, the initial cleavage probably occurred in the nonfolded linker region or in the C-terminal region of rhodanese. A brief proteinase K treatment, therefore, should generate a free N-terminal domain of rhodanese. Either GroEL or an equivalent mass of BSA was then added to the reaction and proteolysis was allowed to proceed for an additional 5 min. The arrow in Fig. 5c points out the 17-kDa fragment that remained after this treatment. The digestion in the presence of added GroEL (lane 1) resulted in over a 5-fold reduction of the 17-kDa fragment relative to the reaction containing BSA (lane 2). These results indicate that the molecular chaperone GroEL is capable of specifically destabilizing a domain of rhodanese. The generation of stalled translation complexes has allowed us to explore whether the bacterial chaperone GroEL binds to newly synthesized polypeptide chains immediately prior to or following the completion of translation. In the relatively slow process of translation, the growing polypeptide may expose regions that become quickly buried upon release from the ribosome. An incompletely translated polypeptide bound to a molecular chaperone may exist in a conformation different from that found in the full-length protein bound to the chaperone upon dilution from urea. Thus, the structure of a GroEL-bound protein in vitro may not reflect the structure of the polypeptide initially encountered by GroEL in the cell. The model protein used in our study, rhodanese, has been used in several GroEL-assisted refolding studies (14.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 15.Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 22.Bochkareva E.S. Lissen N.M. Flynn G.C. Rothman J.E. Girsovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore a good candidate to probe for co-translational interactions with GroEL. Our studies demonstrate, however, that the first stable binding between GroEL and rhodanese occurs posttranslationally. We would not have detected a transient interaction between GroEL and a partially translated rhodanese in this study. Therefore, it remains possible that GroEL needs access to the end of an unfolded protein in order to bind. Once the N-terminal domain rhodanese has folded, GroEL cannot rebind to the unfolded C-terminal domain until after the chain has been released from the ribosome. Since the first stable binding is found only after the entire polypeptide chain has been translated and released from the ribosome, it is reasonable to suppose that the rhodanese structure first recognized by GroEL following protein synthesis in the cell is similar or identical to the rhodanese structure first recognized by GroEL in refolding studies with full-length protein. A co-translational interaction between hsp60s and a nascent chain has been observed in a study using firefly luciferase as a model protein (7.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The cytosolic hsp60 homologue in eukaryotes called TRiC or TCP-1 bound stably to this protein when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. It was not determined whether the translation product interacted directly with TRiC or whether it remained bound to the other proteins in the complex, which included hsp70 and hsp40. These results are consistent with a sequestration, or infinite dilution function for hsp60s. In this model, even as the protein is being synthesized, it is being threaded into a chaperone, which effectively segregates the folding protein from all prospective aggregation partners. Through repeated rounds of ATP hydrolysis, the folding chain matures within or on a single GroEL oligomer. Only after the nascent protein obtains its native state is it released. A schematic model that summarizes our results is shown in Fig. 6. Only the N-terminal domain of the full-length rhodanese has folded while bound to the ribosome. This partially folded state (I) is maintained following release from the ribosome (1). Upon release, the nascent chain is now able to bind to the molecular chaperone GroEL (2), thereby causing the unfolding of the N-terminal domain (U). Since the binding to GroEL is sufficient to unfold the substrate protein, the energy of ATP hydrolysis is likely be used mainly to release the unfolded substrate from the GroEL surface (3). As suggested in the detrapping model, the unfolded and released rhodanese can (4) either fold to its native state (N), rendering it unable to rebind to rhodanese or can once again form a GroEL binding competent state (I). It is not clear if rhodanese would again pass through the same I state upon release from GroEL. Weissman et al.(15.Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that full-length rhodanese exchanges between GroEL oligomers, indicating that the protein does not remain sequestered within a single GroEL throughout the folding pathway. They also observed that the structure of rhodanese was essentially unchanged in successive GroEL bound states. In their kinetic detrapping model of GroEL-assisted folding, the folding of rhodanese does not occur on GroEL but in solution. The function of the chaperone is then to assist rhodanese back onto the productive folding pathway by successive rounds of binding and release. Our results demonstrating that GroEL actually unfolds rhodanese upon binding are more consistent with the kinetic detrapping model for GroEL function. In the infinite dilution model, the folding develops on the GroEL oligomer; GroEL must therefore be able to bind to a variety of folding intermediates. In contrast, in the kinetic detrapping model, either the binding of the protein to GroEL, or ATP hydrolysis, helps unfold kinetically trapped intermediates. We have found that the binding to GroEL is sufficient to unfold the co-translationally formed N-terminal domain of rhodanese. This domain had not been observed in previously published studies using rhodanese refolded from chemical denaturants. In the GroEL-bound form, as noted in previously published work, rhodanese does not generate any protease-resistant fragments (14.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The GroEL bound rhodanese is still competent to fold into a more protease-resistant form in the presence of ATP and the co-chaperone GroES. Using a coupled transcription/translation bacterial extract, Kudlicki et al.(37.Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have recently shown that puromycin released rhodanese possesses no enzymatic activity. Two possible explanations for this are that the puromycin group interferes directly with the active site of rhodanese or that proper folding is inhibited by puromycin. Our data support the former suggestion, as we have found that puromycin-released rhodanese can go on to become soluble and protease-resistant. Are the hsp60 class of molecular chaperones involved in folding and assembly? If assembly occurs through protein subunits free in solution, it is difficult to imagine how GroEL could be assisting in this process through an infinite dilution type mechanism. Individual subunits in some multisubunit proteins do not fold into their proper tertiary structure until they assemble. Therefore the subunits would need to be released from GroEL in a partially folded state. There is little distinction between protein folding and assembly in the kinetic detrapping model (see Fig. 6). In both cases the partially folding individual polypeptides can either proceed into their final native structure or can branch off the folding/assembly pathway to a non-native, possibly aggregated state. GroEL binding would help to reverse the off pathway reaction by generating a free folding/assembly-competent state. The folding and assembly would then occur free in solution.

https://openalex.org/W2071180383,"We have identified a negative cis-acting regulatory element in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor δ-subunit gene's promoter. This element resides within a previously identified 47-base pair activity-dependent enhancer. Proteins that bind this region of DNA were cloned from a λgt11 innervated muscle expression library. Two cDNAs (MY1 and MY1a) were isolated that encode members of the Y-box family of transcription factors. MY1/1a RNAs are expressed at relatively high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, testis, glia, and specific regions of the central nervous system. MY1/1a are nuclear proteins that bind specifically to the coding strand of the 47-base pair enhancer and suppress δ-promoter activity in a sequence-specific manner. These results suggest a novel mechanism of repression by MY1/1a, which may contribute to the low level expression of the δ-subunit gene in innervated muscle. Finally, the gene encoding MY1/1a, <i>Yb2</i>, maps to the mid-distal region of mouse chromosome 6."

Herein we studied the relationship between MAUB and other known mucins in the MGH-U3 bladder cancer line where MAUB expression is modulated by culture conditions. Northern blots, immunoradiometric assays, and Western blots showed that only MUC1 and MUC2 are expressed in this MAUB-positive cell line. MUC1 differs from MAUB by its molecular mass and its non-oligomeric nature, while MUC2 has similar molecular mass and response to culture conditions. However, in double determinant immunoradiometric assays, MAUB and MUC2 did not cross-react. Moreover, confocal microscopy showed different subcellular localization of the two antigens. Treatment of MGH-U3 cells with MUC2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in decreased expression of MUC2 and increased expression of MAUB, ruling out the possibility that monoclonal antibody M344 recognizes a different glycosylated form of MUC2. In addition, we identified a tumor specimen expressing MAUB but no MUC2 antigen or mRNA. Together, these results suggest that there is expression of at least three mucins in MGH-U3 cells and that MAUB is a cancer-associated mucin distinct from those identified so far.

https://openalex.org/W1715510646,"To define the presence and potential role of platelet-associated protease inhibitors, we initiated a study designed to characterize the platelet components that are responsible for the formation of two SDS-stable complexes of approximately 58 and 70 kDa initially observed following the incubation of 125I-thrombin and human platelets. We demonstrate that thermal-mediated unfolding of the 58-kDa complex between 125I-thrombin and a nonsecreted platelet protein leads to an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. This platelet component is functionally and immunologically indistinguishable from the cytoplasmic antiproteinase (CAP), also known as placental thrombin inhibitor, a recently cloned member of the ovalbumin family of intracellular serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors). CAP-specific mRNA and antigen were detected in human platelets, suggesting that CAP synthesis occurs concurrent with platelet development. Utilizing quantitative immunoblotting, CAP antigen was estimated at 1.014 ± 0.181 μg/109 nonstimulated platelets. After platelet activation with the calcium ionophore A23187, CAP antigen was detected in released microparticles at approximately 0.195 ± 0.031 μg/109 platelets and a fraction of platelet CAP was proteolytically modified. We provide evidence that these lower molecular mass species arise by cleavage of CAP at or near the reactive site loop. Most importantly, molecular sieving chromatography indicates the presence of an approximately 68-kDa SDS-labile complex between cleaved CAP and a cellular component in A23187-stimulated platelets, suggesting a physiological target of this intracellular serpin and a potential role for this inhibitor in regulating proteolytic activity that may be formed during platelet activation.

Serine protease inhibitors or serpins are a ubiquitous superfamily of homologous proteins that resemble α1-proteinase inhibitor in overall structure and include antithrombin III, protease nexin-1 (PN-1), 1The abbreviations used are: PN-1protease nexin-1CAPcytoplasmic antiproteinase6xHis/CAPrecombinant fusion protein of a six consecutive histidine residues containing peptide and CAPDTTdithiothreitolHELhuman erythroleukemiaMBP/CAPrecombinant fusion protein of maltose-binding protein and CAPPAI-2plasminogen activator inhibitor-2PBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionPMAphorbol myristate acetatePN-1pplatelet-associated protease nexin-1PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and α2-antiplasmin, to name a few(1.Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In general, serpins contain a highly exposed reactive site loop near the carboxyl terminus of the protein that interacts as a pseudosubstrate for the target protease. Interaction of the serpin reactive site loop with the substrate binding cleft of the target protease triggers a dramatic conformational change in the serpin that results in a stochiometric 1:1 inhibitory complex that is typically stable to treatment with denaturants, such as SDS(2.Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this manner, serpins play crucial roles in neutralizing serine protease activities that are involved in a wide variety of vital processes including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement activation, inflammation, and cell migration (2.Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the serpins that regulate protease activity, several members of this superfamily lack a protease inhibitory capability and have other physiological roles. These latter serpins were originally identified by data base searching and include thyroxine binding globulin, angiotensinogen, and ovalbumin(1.Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 3.Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Ovalbumin represents the parent prototype of a unique family within the serpin superfamily that lacks a typical cleavable signal sequence but has been found to reside either intracellularly, extracellularly, or both(4.Remold-O'Donnell E.

In the course of these studies, two additional SDS-stable complexes of approximately 58 and 70 kDa were detected following the incubation of 125I-thrombin with platelets(13.Shuman M.A. Isaacs J.D.

The observations of both Gronke et al.(15.Gronke R.S. Bergman B.L. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3030-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Miller et al.(17.Miller J.J. Browne P.C. Detwiler T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that disruption of the platelet membrane integrity is required for the detection of the 58-kDa thrombin-containing complex. In addition, no product-precursor relationship between this complex and the 77-kDa 125I-thrombin-PN-1p complex could be demonstrated(17.Miller J.J. Browne P.C. Detwiler T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the 58-kDa complex was not recognized by polyclonal antibodies against human PN-1(15.Gronke R.S. Bergman B.L. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3030-3036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because several studies have established the presence of an emerging family of intracellular serpins(2.Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we initiated the present investigation to determine the relatedness of the platelet molecules responsible for the 58- and 70-kDa 125I-thrombin-containing complexes to known serpins. We report that the platelet component of the 58- and 70-kDa 125I-thrombin complexes is immunologically and functionally indistinguishable from CAP. The mobility of the protease-CAP complex was dependent on the extent of thermal unfolding in the presence of SDS. Most importantly, we provide evidence that CAP interacts with a cellular protease upon platelet activation, suggesting a physiological target of this recently discovered serpin. Six parts blood were drawn from healthy individuals, who denied the ingestion of any medications, into one part acid-citrate-dextrose (NIH formula A), and the upper two-thirds of the platelet-rich plasma were obtained without disturbing the buffy coat after centrifugation at 160 × g for 15 min. All steps during the platelet preparation were performed at 23°C. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated in the presence of 0.3 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 (Sigma) for 10 min and centrifuged at 660 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mM HEPES, pH 6.8) and again centrifuged (660 × g for 10 min). This washing procedure was repeated twice, and the platelets were resuspended in a small volume of resuspension buffer (137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), counted using a hemocytometer, and diluted with resuspension buffer to a concentration of 109/ml. For the isolation of platelet mRNA, platelets from 2 units (900 ml) blood were washed by centrifugation and subsequently purified on Sepharose 2B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns according to the protocols described by Konkle et al.(21.Konkle B.A. Schick P.K. He X. Liu R.J. Mazur E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 669-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Giemsa-stained smears of the platelet preparation revealed an absence of blood leukocytes. For the activation of platelets, 1-ml samples of centrifuged-washed platelet suspension were incubated at 23°C for 20 min in the presence or the absence of 162 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma) or 1 μM of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma). For activation with A23187, the platelet suspension was supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and stirred during incubation with the agonist. In several experiments, the platelets were pelleted by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (13,600 × g for 30 s), 900 μl of the supernatant (releasate) were harvested, and the remaining supernatant was carefully removed. The platelet pellets were lysed in 1 ml of resuspension buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma). The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the cytoskeleton was pelleted by centrifugation (13,600 × g for 2 min), and 900 μl of the supernatant were harvested. Platelet preparations were either used immediately or snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C for up to 2 months. Incubations of platelet samples with 125I-thrombin were performed in the presence of 0.5 mM Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (Calbiochem) to inhibit fibrin formation (22.Harfenist E.J. Guccione M.A. Packham M.A. Mustard J.F. Blood. 1982; 59: 952-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High purity human α-thrombin (Sigma T6759; 3000 units/mg protein), high molecular weight human urokinase (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT), and trypsin (type III from bovine pancreas; Sigma T8253) were radiolabeled with 125I utilizing immobilized chloramine T (Iodo-Beads; Pierce) according to the standard protocol that is suggested by the manufacturer. A specific radioactivity between 0.8 × 104 and 1.4 × 104 cpm/ng protein was routinely obtained. Samples either were incubated in the presence of 2% SDS at 37°C for 10 min (nonreducing conditions) or were heated to 100°C for 3 min in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for disulfide reduction, unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis using 4% stacking and 9% separating polyacrylamide slab gels as described by Laemmli(23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) included lysozyme (Mr 14,300), β-lactoglobulin (Mr 18,400), carbonic anhydrase (Mr 29,000), ovalbumin (Mr 43,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 68,000), phosphorylase b (Mr 97,400), and myosin (H-chain) (Mr 200,000). Proteins were stained with silver nitrate, and gels were dried and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak, New Haven, CT) for 24-48 h utilizing intensifying screens. For quantification, the dried gels were exposed to a storage phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager and Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells (ATCC TIB 180, HEL 92.1.7) and the megakaryocytic DAMI cell line (ATCC CRL 9792) (24.Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). HEL cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C. HEL cells were induced to megakaryocytic differentiation by incubation with 10-8M PMA according to the protocol described by Long et al.(25.Long M.W. Heffner C.H. Williams J.L. Peters C. Prochownik E.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DAMI cells were grown and cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Bio Whittaker) as described(24.Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from PMA-stimulated HEL cells (1.5 × 108), DAMI cells (1.5 × 108), and platelets (1011) according the previously described protocols(26.Schleef R.R. Bevilacqua M.P. Sawdey M.

RNA was reverse-transcribed utilizing oligo p-(dt)15 primers, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and the commercially available First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples of the reverse transcriptase reaction mixtures were adjusted to PCR buffer conditions in a total volume of 100 μl with 60 pmol of each PCR primer and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCR was performed for 30 cycles in an automated thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer) with cycle times of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C. Primers were prepared utilizing an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer (PCR-MATE 391 DNA Synthesizer; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Primers were based on the published nucleotide sequences and included the following: sense, TGCTTAGGGTGGCCAACAGG (base position 272-291), and antisense, AGGTTGCGCAGGACACTCTC (base position 878-859), for CAP(10.Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and sense, CTCACTGTGAACGTGGCCTCC (base position 7013-7033), and antisense, GGCAGCACGCTGAGGTCTTACA (base position 7714-7693), for von Willebrand factor(28.Bonthron D. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ginsburg D. Handin R.I. Orkin S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7125-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of CAP at a molecular level, primers were also designed that flanked the complete coding region of CAP(10.Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) : sense, GTACTGCTCGAGGTCTGCCATCATGGATGTTC (base position 179-198), and antisense, GATGACGAATTCCTGCCCTGTCCTCACGGAGA (base position 1330-1311), with 12-base pair 5′ overhangs containing the unique restriction sites XhoI and EcoRI, respectively. The primers were employed to amplify PMA-stimulated HEL cell cDNA utilizing the aforementioned PCR conditions. PCR products were subcloned into the pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the EcoRI and XhoI sites. A cloned PCR product was sequenced by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method (29.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). The expression, purification, and characterization of CAP expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues (6xHis/CAP) will be described in detail elsewhere. 2M. Riewald and R. R. Schleef, manuscript in preparation. In essence, the complete coding region of CAP was PCR-amplified utilizing specific CAP primers and reverse-transcribed mRNA from PMA-stimulated HEL cells. Identity of the sequence was confirmed by sequencing of the cloned PCR product. The entire coding region for CAP was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and transformed into E. coli, and the cells were induced by incubation for 4 h at 37°C in the presence of 1 mM isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside. Recombinant 6xHis/CAP was purified on Ni2+-charged Sepharose to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. 6xHis/CAP was shown to inhibit the amidolytic activity of thrombin, trypsin, and urokinase and to be capable of forming SDS-stable complexes with these proteases, suggesting that this recombinant molecule folds correctly. Polyclonal rabbit anti-PN-1 serum (30.Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Knauer (University of California, Irvine, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against a fusion construct encoding maltose-binding protein/CAP (MBP/CAP) were provided by Dr. Walter Kisiel (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). Antibodies with reactivity against maltose binding protein were removed by passing the preparation over a maltose binding protein-AffiGel 15 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Antibodies against CAP were also prepared by injection of 6xHis/CAP into a New Zealand White rabbit according to standard protocols. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Affinity purified anti-6xHis/CAP was prepared by adsorption and elution of antibodies using 6xHis/CAP immobilized on nitrocellulose blots according to the protocols described by Smith and Fisher(31.Smith D.E.

Briefly, recombinant 6xHis/CAP (30 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the region between 38 and 50 kDa was excised and used as an affinity matrix to adsorb antibodies present within a protein A-purified anti-6xHis/CAP IgG preparation (100 μg in PBS/0.1% Tween 20). Antibodies were eluted from nitrocellulose strips by three successive 30-s washes (1.5 ml each) with 5 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.3, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and the eluate was immediately neutralized by the addition of 375 μl of 250 mM Na2HPO4. The resulting eluate is subsequently referred to as “affinity purified anti-6xHis/CAP.” As a control, an aliquot of protein A-purified anti-6xHis/CAP IgG (100 μg in 3 ml of PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) was incubated (4 h at 23°C) with nitrocellulose containing the 38-50-kDa region of electrophoresed recombinant 6xHis/CAP. This adsorption procedure was repeated twice on the solution phase antibodies, and the residual preparation that was depleted of antibodies to CAP is subsequently referred to as “adsorbed anti-6xHis/CAP.” After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 90 min at 700 mA in a buffer containing 50 mM Trizma base, 95 mM glycine, 10% methanol, 0.01% SDS. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at 23°C in 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and were incubated for 1 h at 23°C in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 in the presence of the primary antibody in a concentration of 1.5 μg of IgG/ml. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 30 min at 23°C in a 1:4,000 dilution of biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC), followed by avidin-peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, or in a 1:4,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Corp.). The blots were washed extensively with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and bound antibodies were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of immunoreactive bands was performed using a laser densitometer and Image Quant software (both from Molecular Dynamics). Incubation of solubilized, nonstimulated platelets (Fig. 1, lane 1) or the releasate of PMA-stimulated platelets (Fig. 1, lane 2) with 125I-thrombin followed by reducing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed the formation of a 77-kDa complex between 125I-thrombin and a platelet component, previously identified as PN-1p(14.Baker J.B. Gronke R.S. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1986; 12: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Gronke R.S. Bergman B.L. Baker J.B. J. Biol.

Analysis in the absence of reducing agents demonstrated the presence of high molecular weight material (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6) that has been previously shown to contain a ternary complex between 125I-thrombin-PN-1p and thrombospondin(17.Miller J.J. Browne P.C. Detwiler T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20.Browne P.C. Miller J.J. Detwiler T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additional SDS-stable complexes with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa under reducing SDS-PAGE and of 58 kDa under nonreducing conditions formed between 125I-thrombin and components in lysates of nonstimulated (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5, respectively) and PMA-activated (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 7, respectively) platelets. These smaller complexes were not detected in the releasate after stimulation with PMA (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 6). Because sample preparation for reducing SDS-PAGE involved heating to 100°C for 3 min, whereas sample preparation for nonreducing SDS-PAGE involved a 10-min incubation at 37°C, we analyzed whether the extent of thermal-mediated unfolding accounts for the differential mobilities of complexes between 125I-thrombin and a platelet pellet-associated protein. The 70-kDa 125I-thrombin complex in solubilized platelet pellets was detected only in samples that had been heated to 100°C prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6, 8, and 9). If the samples were heated to 65°C or less, the 58-kDa 125I-thrombin complex was observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3 and 7). Further experiments revealed that the temperature dependence of the mobilities of these 125I-thrombin complexes was not affected by the presence or the absence of reducing agents in the sample buffer (data not shown). To determine whether a product-precursor relationship between the 70- and 58-kDa complexes exists, the 58-kDa complex (Fig. 2B, lane 1) was excised from a gel, electroeluted, and heated to either 65°C (Fig. 2B, lane 2) or 100°C (Fig. 2B, lane 3), and subsequent reanalysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that the complex heated to 100°C migrated at 70 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 3).Figure 2:Thermal-mediated unfolding of the 58-kDa complex between 125I-thrombin and a platelet protein results in the migration of the complex at 70 kDa. A, nonstimulated (lanes 1-6) and PMA-stimulated (lanes 7-9) platelet pellets were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with 125I-thrombin (5 nM at 23°C for 30 min). Samples (100 μl, 108 platelets) were treated with SDS sample buffer containing 100 mM DTT and incubated at the indicated temperatures. SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 9% separating gel followed by autoradiography. Lane 10 contains 125I-thrombin alone (at 100°C for 3 min). B, PMA-stimulated platelets (500 μl, 5 × 108 platelets) were pelleted, lysed (0.5% Triton X-100), and incubated with 125I-thrombin (5 nM at 23°C for 30 min), and the reaction was terminated by the addition of reducing sample buffer. This sample was heated to 65°C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were immobilized in the gel by staining with 0.3 M CuCl2. The 58-kDa radioactivity-containing band was localized by phosphor imaging of the wet gel, the band was excised, and the gel slice was destained (250 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM EDTA) for 30 min with four changes of the destaining solution. Proteins were electroeluted (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 7.4, 0.025% SDS) from the gel slice at 50 V for 8 h(32.Tessmer U. Dernick R.

Samples of the eluted proteins were reanalyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE after heating to 65°C for 5 min (lane 2) and 100°C for 3 min (lane 3).

HN mutants with progressive NH2-terminal S/A deletions or insertions were expressed in HeLa cells, and the membrane targeting, folding, tetramer assembly, and intracellular transport of the proteins were examined. Changing the length of the S/A by two residues resulted in HN mutants that displayed aberrant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane targeting or translocation. This phenotype did not simply reflect upper or lower limitations on the size of a functional S/A, because normal signaling was restored by further alterations involving three or four residues.

HN mutants with S/A insertions of three or four Leu residues differed from wild-type HN by having heterogeneous Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications. Differences in ER-to-Golgi transport of the mutants did not strictly correlate with defects in either native folding of the ectodomain or the assembly of two dimers into a tetramer.

INTRODUCTIONThe synthesis and assembly of eukaryotic integral membrane proteins differs in several ways from the biosynthesis of other types of cellular proteins. A specific requirement for the biosynthesis of a membrane protein is that the nascent polypeptide chain must first be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumS/Asignal/anchorHNhemagglutinin-neuraminidaseendoHendoglycosidase HPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMtransmembraneWTwild typemAbmonoclonal antibodyDeldeletionInsinsertion. through interactions with a dedicated cellular machinery (reviewed in Walter and Lingappa(49.Walter P. Lingappa V.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 499-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar)). Once the nascent chain has been inserted into the lipid bilayer, additional unique aspects of the biosynthesis of membrane proteins involve the folding and assembly of distinct extracellular, cytoplasmic, and lipid-imbedded regions of the protein. Thus, individual segments of a single polypeptide chain must undergo maturation steps in very different environments, including the ER lumen, the cytosol, and the hydrophobic lipid bilayer.Proper folding of these individual domains and subunit assembly are important factors that influence the intracellular transport of membrane proteins. An ER-localized mechanism appears to act on newly synthesized integral membrane proteins to control ER-to-Golgi transport (reviewed in Doms et al.(8.Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), Hammond and Helenius (11.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and Pelham(31.Ng D.T.W. Randall R.E. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3273-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). For a large number of membrane proteins, progress has been made in our understanding of some of the factors and biosynthetic steps involving the ER-lumenal ectodomain that dictate the formation of a transport-competent protein, and ER proteins that assist in these steps have been identified (Hammond and Helenius, 1995; Pelham, 41.Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Likewise, a number of studies on the cytoplasmic tail of membrane proteins have identified a variety of distinct signals in this domain that act during biosynthesis and intracellular transport (e.g. Casanova et al.(6.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), Nilsson et al.(33.Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and Parks and Lamb(37.Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19101-19109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast to the ecto- and cytoplasmic domains, the questions of how lipid-imbedded segments influence membrane protein biosynthesis and the nature of structural requirements in this domain remain largely unanswered.For the majority of known integral membrane proteins, an NH2-terminal cleavable sequence serves to signal the nascent chain to the ER membrane and a separate COOH-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain acts as a membrane anchor. By contrast, the type II integral membrane proteins lack an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence, but contain an internal hydrophobic signal/anchor (S/A) domain that serves a dual function: the signaling of the nascent polypeptide to the ER membrane and the subsequent anchoring of the polypeptide in the lipid bilayer. Examples of type II proteins include the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Spiess and Lodish, 47.Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 44: 177-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the influenza virus neuraminidase (Bos et al., 3.Bos T.J. Davis A.R. Nayak D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2327-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), signal peptidase (Shelness et al., 45.Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases (Paulson and Colley, 40.Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the paramyxovirus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein (Hiebert et al., 13.Hiebert S.W. Paterson R.G. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HN protein of the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 has served as a model type II integral membrane protein for the analysis of the membrane insertion, assembly, and intracellular transport (Ng et al., 1989, 32.Ng D.T.W. Hiebert S.W. Lamb R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar; Parks and Lamb, 35.Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3605-3616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1990; 178: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 1993). The predicted structure of the simian virus 5 HN protein includes a 17-residue cytoplasmic tail, a 19-amino acid uncleaved S/A, and a large 523 residue COOH-terminal ectodomain (Hiebert et al., 1985). Newly-synthesized HN folds into a structure that is recognized by conformation-specific antibodies and oligomerizes into a tetramer (t½ ~25-30 min) before transport from the ER to the medial Golgi (t½~ 90 min; Ng et al.(1989)). Alterations to the HN COOH-terminal ectodomain can result in a block in ER-to-Golgi transport (Ng et al., 1990), consistent with an ER quality control mechanism governing HN transport (Hammond and Helenius, 38.Parks G.D. Pohlmann S. Virology. 1995; 213: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Recent work has shown that the uncleaved S/A domain serves multiple functions in the biosynthesis of a type II protein, including ER signaling, membrane anchoring, subunit assembly, and intracellular targeting. A typical S/A domain is longer than the hydrophobic core of a cleavable signal sequence (von Heijne, 51.von Heijne G. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1988; 947: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggesting that subdomains may exist within the S/A that direct these individual functions. Previous attempts to identify by deletion analysis the subdomains that are responsible for signaling and anchoring have led to the proposal that these two functions are encoded by redundant and overlapping segments within the S/A (Brown et al., 5.Brown D.J. Hogue B.G. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3824-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1988; Spiess and Handschin, 46.Spiess M. Handschin C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2683-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; reviewed in Nayak and Jabbar, 30.Nayak D.P. Jabbar M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 465-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mutational analysis of the HN protein has identified residues at the COOH-terminal end of the S/A that are important for the assembly of a tetramer from two dimers (McGinnes et al., 27.McGinnes L. Sergel T. Morrison T. Virology. 1993; 196: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Parks and Pohlmann, 1995), suggesting that the tetramer assembly function may reside in a subdomain of the HN S/A.It has been shown that S/A alterations can also influence the intracellular transport of a type II protein (reviewed in Machamer, 24.Machamer C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; Nayak and Jabbar, 1989), but to date no unifying theory has been developed for the role that the S/A domain serves in the formation of a protein that is competent for transport from the ER. Although it is proposed that ~20 amino acids are sufficient to span a lipid bilayer as an α-helix, comparisons of known type II proteins have shown a wide range of S/A lengths (Hartmann et al., 12.Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar; Bretscher and Munro, 4.Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In some cases, the length of a S/A and not the specific amino acid sequence per se may be an important aspect of intracellular targeting of type II proteins (Masibay et al., 26.Masibay A.S. Balaji P.V. Boeggeman E.E. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Munro, 29.Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this report, a systematic approach has been taken to analyze the influence of S/A length on the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of HN, a model type II plasma membrane protein. The results suggest that efficient entry into and exit from the ER are sensitive to changes in the conformation of the HN S/A that may reflect alterations to a structural requirement along one side of an α-helix.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction and MutagenesisAn EcoRI-PstI fragment of the simian virus 5 HN protein gene (encoding HN residues 1-81, Hiebert et al. (1985)) in pGem3 (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis exactly as described previously (Parks, 34.Parks G.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4862-4872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Parks and Pohlmann, 1995) using a 5′ mRNA-sense mutagenic oligonucleotide along with primers specific for the T7 and SP6 promoter sequence contained in pGem3. The resulting 280-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and PstI before ligating into the corresponding sites of pGem3 such that mRNA-sense transcripts could be produced using the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the entire polymerase chain reaction-derived DNA fragment was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. To reconstruct the full-length HN gene, plasmid DNA encoding the desired mutation was digested with PstI, phosphatase treated, and ligated with a DNA fragment encoding the WT HN ectodomain (residues 82-565).CellsMonolayer cultures of HeLa T4 cells (Maddon et al., 25.Maddon P.J. Dalgleish A.G. McDougal J.S. Chapman P.R. Weiss R.A. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 42: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (486) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum.Isotopic Labeling of Polypeptides, Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase Treatment, and Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisProteins were expressed in HeLa T4 cells from cDNA plasmids as described (Parks, 1994) using a modified version of the vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase system of Fuerst et al.(10.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 85: 8122-8126Crossref Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well dishes of subconfluent cells were infected for 1 h with vTF7.3, a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase (multiplicity of infection of ~10). Infected cells were then transfected with 0.5 μg of pGEM plasmid DNA encoding the HN mutants along with 5 μg of Lipofectin reagent in 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). All media contained 100 μg/ml cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, Sigmas) to inhibit the growth of vaccinia virus. Cells were radiolabeled at 4.0 h post-transfection with 100-200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals Inc., Irvine, CA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine and methionine as described previously (Parks and Pohlmann, 1995). In chase protocols, radiolabeled cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM nonradioactive methionine (chase medium), and then incubated in chase medium for the indicated times.Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1% SDS, boiled for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation. Where indicated, media were removed from cells and clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 15,000 × g). Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (Ng et al., 1989; Lamb et al., 18.Lamb R.A. Etkind P.R. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1978; 91: 60-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), using rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised to SDS-denatured HN (HN antisera, Ng et al.(1990)). Alternatively, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1b and 4b that recognize epitopes in the fully mature form of HN (Randall et al., 42.Randall R.E. Young D.F. Goswami K.K.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2769-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, samples were treated with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endoH) or peptide:N-glycosidase F (N-glycanase) as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography (Lamb and Choppin, 17.Lamb R.A. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1976; 74: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in dried gels was quantitated using an Ambis radioanalytic imaging system (San Diego, CA). Acquisition of endoH-resistant carbohydrate residues was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity in the endoH-resistant form divided by the total HN protein in both the endoH-resistant and -sensitive forms. The data are the average of at least two experiments (±10%), and are expressed as a percentage of that obtained with WT HN assayed in parallel.Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation AnalysisVaccinia virus vTF7.3-infected HeLa T4 cells (35 mm dishes) were transfected with plasmids (5 μg) encoding mutant HN proteins and radiolabeled for 15 min with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label as described above. Cells were incubated in chase medium for 90 min. The oligomeric form of the HN mutants was analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation as described previously (Ng et al., 1989; Parks and Pohlmann, 1995). Protein standards (rabbit hemoglobin, ~4S, and potato β-amylase, ~9S) were analyzed in parallel gradients and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.Indirect Immunofluorescence3.5-cm dishes of vTF7.3-infected HeLa T4 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the HN mutants as described above and processed at 15 h post-transfection for indirect cell surface immunofluorescence using mAb 4b (Randall et al., 1987) as described previously (Parks and Lamb, 1990a).RESULTSExpression of HN NH2-terminal S/A MutantsTo determine how S/A length influences the biosynthesis of HN, the NH2-terminal end of the HN S/A was modified by progressive single amino acid deletions to create mutants Del N1-4 (Deletion, N-terminal, 1-4 residues, Fig. 1). Mutant proteins were expressed to high levels by first infecting HeLa T4 cells with recombinant vaccinia virus that synthesizes bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) and then transfecting the cells with DNA plasmids encoding the HN mutants under control of the T7 promoter. Infected/transfected cells were then radiolabeled with Tran35S-label for 30 min and proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with antiserum that recognizes all forms of HN before analysis by SDS-PAGE.WT HN was synthesized as a single major polypeptide of ~68 kDa (Fig. 2, WT lane) and was converted to a faster migrating form after deglycosylation by treatment with N-glycanase (HNo, D lane). HN mutants containing deletions of one or two residues from the NH2-terminal end of the S/A (Del N1 and Del N2) were detected as polypeptides with an electrophoretic mobility matching that of WT HN (Fig. 2, deletion lanes 1 and 2). In the case of Del N2, however, approximately 20% of the newly-synthesized protein was detected as an additional form that had a mobility on gels matching that of deglycosylated HNo (deletion panel, lane 2). Digestion of Del N2 protein with N-glycanase resulted in a single HNo species on SDS gels (data not shown, but see below), indicating that the HN and HNo forms of Del N2 were a single polypeptide chain that migrated differently on SDS gels due to the presence and absence of carbohydrate chains, respectively. As the only sites for N-linked glycosylation of HN are in the COOH-terminal ectodomain, the presence of the unglycosylated HNo form of mutant Del N2 indicates that this protein is partially defective in some aspect of ER targeting or translocation across the ER membrane. To determine if the aberrant glycosylation of mutant Del N2 reflected a lower limit on the size of a functional HN S/A, two addition mutants were constructed that contained progressive NH2-terminal S/A deletions totaling three and four residues (Del N3 and N4, Fig. 1). Del N3 and Del N4 polypeptides were expressed as the major HN form, and relative to Del N2, only trace amounts of unglycosylated HNo was detected (Fig. 2, deletion panel, lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate that the aberrant glycosylation seen with mutant Del N2 was not simply a reflection of a lower limit on the size of a functional HN S/A.Figure 2:Expression of HN NH2-terminal S/A mutants. HeLa T4 cells were infected with vTF7.3 and then transfected with plasmid DNA encoding wild type HN (WT lane), one of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants Del N1-4 (Deletion lanes 1-4, respectively) or one of the HN Leu insertion mutants Ins N1-4 (Insertion lanes 1-4, respectively). After radiolabeling cells with Tran35S-label for 30 min, proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with HN antiserum before analysis by SDS-PAGE. The positions of WT (HN) and deglycosylated (HNo) forms of HN are indicated by arrows. M, molecular weight marker lane with indicated sizes in kDa; D, marker lane of deglycosylated HN protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine if S/A insertions had a similar effect on HN biosynthesis, HN mutants Ins N1-4 (Insertion, N-terminal, 1-4 residues, Fig. 1) were constructed in which one to four Leu residues were inserted into the NH2-terminal end of the S/A. When expressed using the vaccinia virus/T7 system described above, all of the insertion mutant produced a protein that comigrated on SDS gels with WT HN (Fig. 2, Insertion panel, lanes 1-4). Most importantly, the insertion of two additional Leu residues into the S/A resulted in a mutant (Ins N2) in which nearly half of the newly-synthesized protein was detected as the unglycosylated HNo form (Insertion panel, lane 2). In contrast, mutants with insertions of one, three, or four Leu residues produced relatively little of the HNo form (<5% of total HN protein). The finding that insertions or deletions of two S/A residues results in an unglycosylated form of HN suggests a phase-specific requirement in the HN S/A for efficient ER targeting or translocation (see below). Treatment of membranes isolated from cells expressing the Ins N2 mutant protein with pH 11.0 buffer did not extract the HNo polypeptide into a soluble form (data not shown), suggesting that this protein species was stably associated with membranes (Steck and Yu, 48.Steck T.L. Yu J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 220-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is possible that the deletion or insertion of two residues into the S/A leads to molecules that are partially defective in ER targeting or translocation, such that the COOH-terminal domain of these molecules, which contains the only sites for glycosylation, had not been translocated into the ER lumen.Previous work has demonstrated that alterations to charged residues flanking the HN S/A can lead to molecules that are inserted into the ER membrane but have an inverted transmembrane topology (Parks and Lamb, 1993). Thus, a possible explanation for the presence of the faster migrating HNo form of the Del N2 and Ins N2 mutants is that they represent molecules whose transmembrane orientation has been reversed, such that they are now anchored in the membrane with the NH2-terminal domain in the ER lumen. A prediction of this outcome is that translocation of the NH2-terminal domain of the inverted molecules across the ER membrane should expose the NH2 terminus to the glycosylation machinery that resides in the ER lumen. To test this possibility, a consensus site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-Ala-Thr; Parks and Lamb(1993)) was added by site-specific mutagenesis to the NH2-terminal domain of mutant Ins N2 to create Ins N2∗ (see asterisk in Fig. 1 for location). A previously characterized HN mutant containing substitutions of glutamate for arginine 13 and arginine 17 on the cytoplasmic side of the S/A (see Fig. 1) was expressed as a positive control for inversion of HN membrane topology, as this mutant adopts two opposing transmembrane topologies due to these amino acid changes (HN 18∗, Parks and Lamb(1993)). Following expression in HeLa cells and radiolabeling with Tran35S-label, HN proteins were immunoprecipitated, treated with endoglycosidase, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The addition of carbohydrate to the NH2-terminal glycosylation site of the inverted HN 18∗ molecules (Fig. 3, lane 2, HNN-exo) results in a slower electrophoretic mobility than deglycosylated HN (+lane 2). The mobility of the HN species is not altered by the presence of the new glycosylation site, because the NH2 terminus is in the cytoplasm.Figure 3:The NH2 terminus of HN mutant Ins N2 is not translocated into the ER lumen. vTF7.3 infected HeLa T4 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding a modified version of mutant Ins N2 (Ins N2∗, lane 1) or with a charge-altered HN mutant that adopts two opposing transmembrane orientations (mutant HN18∗, lane 2). Both proteins contained a site for the addition of N-linked carbohydrate at the NH2 terminus. Following a 30-min radiolabeling with Tran35S-label, cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-HN serum. Immune complexes were incubated with (+lanes) or without (-lanes) N-glycanase before analysis by SDS-PAGE. The positions of WT (HN), deglycosylated (HNo), and inverted (HNN-exo) forms of HN are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ins N2∗ was detected in equal amounts as two major polypeptide species (Fig. 3, lane 1): one form with an electrophoretic mobility matching fully glycosylated WT HN and a second form with a mobility matching the deglycosylated protein (HNo). The comigration of the faster migrating Ins N2∗ species with deglycosylated HN indicates that the new NH2-terminal glycosylation site in the Ins N2∗ mutant was not utilized. Given the caveat that alterations to the S/A may have prevented glycosylation of a fully-translocated NH2-terminal domain of Ins N2∗ molecules, these data indicate that the HNo form seen with mutants Del N2 and Ins N2 is not due to bona fide inversion of the normal HN transmembrane orientation. While the nature of the unglycosylated form of these mutants was not explored further, the insertion or deletion of two residues at the NH2-terminal end of the HN S/A results in polypeptides that are aberrantly targeted to or translocated across the ER membrane.Intracellular Transport of HN S/A MutantsThe transport of the HN S/A mutants from the ER was examined to determine if changes in the length of the HN S/A affected biosynthetic steps subsequent to ER membrane targeting and insertion. The HN mutants were expressed in HeLa cells as described above and radiolabeled for 30 min with Tran35S-label. Cells were then incubated in chase medium for 90 min, the half-time for transport of HN to the medial Golgi (Ng et al., 1989). To monitor ER-to-Golgi transport of the mutants, the conversion of COOH-terminal glycans from a high-mannose ER form to a complex Golgi-specific form was assayed by treating immune complexes with endoH before SDS-PAGE.As shown in Fig. 4(WT + lane), approximately half of the WT HN polypeptides had acquired carbohydrate residues that were resistant to endoH digestion by 90 min after synthesis. The electrophoretic mobility of the endoH-resistant form of HN (Fig. 4, R arrow) is not the same as that of the undigested HN (- lane), because only two of the four COOH-terminal carbohydrate residues are processed from a simple (endoH-sensitive, S) to complex (endoH-resistant, R) form after transport to the Golgi apparatus (Ng et al., 1989, 1990). In contrast to the acquired endoH resistance seen with WT HN, mutants Del N1 and N2 accumulated much lower levels of endoH-resistant glycans by 90 min after synthesis (Fig. 4A, compare WT, 1 and 2 + lanes). Quantitation of gels from multiple experiments indicated that the fraction of the total Del N1 protein that had accumulated endoH-resistant carbohydrates (i.e. the ratio of the resistant form to total radiolabeled protein) was only ~30% of the value obtained for WT HN. In the case of Del N2, only trace amounts of protein with endoH-resistant glycans were detected. These data indicate that decreasing the HN S/A by one or two residues can reduce or block ER-to-Golgi transport.Figure 4:Acquisition of endoH resistance for HN S/A mutants. HeLa T4 cells were infected with vTF7.3 and then transfected with plasmid DNA encoding wild type HN (WT lanes), one of the NH2-terminal deletion mutants Del N1-4 (panel A, lanes 1-4, respectively) or one of the HN Leu insertion mutants Ins N1-4 (panel B, lanes 1-4, respectively). Cells were radiolabeled with Tran35S-label, and incubated in nonradioactive chase medium for 90 min. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with HN antiserum. Immune complexes were then divided into two aliquots which were incubated with buffer alone (-lanes) or with endoH (+lanes) before analysis of samples by SDS-PAGE. R, endoH-resistant HN species; S, endoH-sensitive HN species. The asterisk in panel B indicates the position of a variant form of endoH-resistant HN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Surprisingly, however, a further deletion that removed a total of three consecutive residues from the NH2-terminal end of the S/A resulted in a mutant protein (Del N3) that was competent for transport from the ER (Fig. 4A, + lane 3). Quantitation of gels from multiple experiments indicated that the fraction of the total Del N3 protein that had accumulated endoH-resistant carbohydrates was on average ~70% of the value found with WT HN analyzed in parallel. The removal of a total of four S/A residues resulted in a mutant that accumulated only trace amounts of endoH-resistant glycans (+ lane 4). Thus, transport of HN from the ER is reduced or blocked by removal of one, two, or four consecutive residues from the NH2-terminal end of the S/A, but transport can be restored to levels similar to that obtained with WT HN when a total of three residues are deleted from this region.The effect of extending the length of the HN S/A"
