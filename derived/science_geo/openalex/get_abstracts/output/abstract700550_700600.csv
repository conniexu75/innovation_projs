https://openalex.org/W4295907787,"Necrosis of macrophages in the granuloma, the hallmark immunological structure of tuberculosis, is a major pathogenic event that increases host susceptibility. Through a zebrafish forward genetic screen, we identified the mTOR kinase, a master regulator of metabolism, as an early host resistance factor in tuberculosis. We found that mTOR complex 1 protects macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death by enabling infection-induced increases in mitochondrial energy metabolism fueled by glycolysis. These metabolic adaptations are required to prevent mitochondrial damage and death caused by the secreted mycobacterial virulence determinant ESAT-6. Thus, the host can effectively counter this early critical mycobacterial virulence mechanism simply by regulating energy metabolism, thereby allowing pathogen-specific immune mechanisms time to develop. Our findings may explain why Mycobacterium tuberculosis, albeit humanity's most lethal pathogen, is successful in only a minority of infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4295709330,"In the context of global warming, although the coordinated development of tourism has led to regional economic growth, the high energy consumption-driven effects of such development have also led to environmental degradation. This research combines the undesired output of the Super-SBM model and social network analysis methods to determine the eco-efficiency of provincial tourism in China from 2010-2019 and analyzes its spatial correlation characteristics as well as its influencing factors. The aim of the project is to improve China's regional tourism eco-efficiency and promote cross-regional tourism correlation. The results show that (1) the mean value of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is maintained at 0.405~0.612, with an overall fluctuating upward trend. The tourism eco-efficiency of eastern China is higher than that of central, western and northeastern China, but the latter three regions have not formed a stable spatial distribution pattern. (2) The spatial network of provincial tourism eco-efficiency in China is multithreaded, dense and diversified. Throughout the network, affiliations are becoming closer, and network structure robustness is gradually improving, although the ""hierarchical"" spatial network structure remains. In individual networks, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shandong provinces in eastern China have higher centrality degrees, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality than other provinces, which means they are dominant in the network. Hainan Province, also located in eastern China, has not yet built a ""bridge"" for tourism factor circulation. In the core-periphery model, the core-periphery areas of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency are distributed in clusters, and the number of ""core members"" has increased. (3) The economic development level, information technology development level, and tourism technology level collectively drive the development and evolution of China's provincial tourism eco-efficiency spatial network."
https://openalex.org/W4295709166,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health emergency driven by the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents in humans and animals. Antimicrobial consumption surveillance guides its containment efforts. In this study, we estimated, for the first time, veterinary consumption of Critically Important Antimicrobials with Highest Priority (CIA-HtP) for Pakistan.The study used an export/import database which provided imports data collected from the Pakistan Customs Authority. We investigated imports of 7 CIA-HtP and various poultry feed additives/growth promoters (FAs/GPs) identified from a survey of 10 poultry and dairy farms in Punjab province in Pakistan and a previously published study, over a three-year period of 2017-2019. Antimicrobial consumption was estimated in mg/kg of country's animal biomass.Imports, in tonnes, for these 7 CIA-HtP were for the years 2017-19: tylosin 240.84, enrofloxacin 235.14, colistin 219.73, tilmicosin 97.32, spiramycin 5.79, norfloxacin 5.55, ceftiofur 1.02 for a total 805.39 tonnes. The corresponding antimicrobial consumption was 10.05 mg/kg of animal biomass. The poultry FAs/GPs contained: zinc bacitracin, enramycin, bacitracin methylene disalicylate, tylosin, tiamulin, colistin, lincomycin, streptomycin, flavophospholipol, tilmicosin, and penicillin with a total antimicrobial chemical compound (ACC) import volume of 577.18 tonnes for the years 2017-2019; and an estimated consumption of 96.53 mg/kg of poultry biomass.These antimicrobials were a mix of macrolides, quinolones, polymyxins and cephalosporins, among which are some also on the Watch or Reserve list by the WHO, indicating the need for stewardship and to conserve essential antimicrobials to contain AMR. The finding that a yearly average of 192.39 tonnes of the ACC imported were FAs/GPs further highlight the need for stronger regulation and enforcement."
https://openalex.org/W4295709328,"Tooth loss is associated with nutritional status and significantly affects quality of life, particularly in older individuals. To date, several studies reveal that a high BMI is associated with tooth loss. However, there is a lack of large-scale studies that examined the impact of obesity on residual teeth with respect to age and tooth positions.We assessed the impact of obesity on the number and position of residual teeth by age groups using large scale of Japanese database.This was a cross-sectional study of 706150 subjects that were included in the database that combined the data from health insurance claims and health check-up, those lacking information about BMI, HbA1c level, smoking status, and the number of residual teeth were excluded. Thus, a total of 233517 aged 20-74 years were included. Subjects were classified into 4 categories based on BMI, and the number of teeth was compared between age-groups. The percentage of subjects with residual teeth in each position was compared between groups with obesity (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2) and non-obesity. Logistic regression analysis was performed to clarify whether obesity predicts having <24 teeth.Higher BMI was associated with fewer teeth over 40s (P for trend <0.0001 when <70s). Obesity was associated with the reduction of residual teeth in the maxillary; specifically, the molars were affected over the age 30. Smoking status further affected tooth loss at positions that were not affected by obesity alone. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and HbA1c ≥6.5%, obesity remained an independent predictive factor for having <24 teeth (ORs: 1.35, 95% CIs: 1.30-1.40).We found that an increase in BMI was associated with a decrease in the number of residual teeth from younger ages independently of smoking status and diabetes in the large scale of Japanese database."
https://openalex.org/W4295709355,"Background Real-world data on multimorbidity represents an important but underutilised source of evidence for the planning of healthcare services, including prevention, treatments, and health economic modelling. Aims This study aimed to estimate means of multimorbidity and provide associated prevalence rates and frequencies between 199 x 199 chronic conditions and disease groups based on the total adult Danish population and sex, age, and educational attainment. Thus, this study provides an off-the-shelf catalogue for use in treatments and planning by clinicians, decision-makers and researchers. Methods The study population contained all Danish residents above 16 years on 1 January 2013 (n = 4,555,439). The data was based on the linkage of six national registers covering hospital contacts, services in general practice, filled-in out-of-hospital prescriptions, and educational attainments. The health registers were used to identify the 199 chronic conditions based on the ICD-10 classification system. Results The mean number of chronic conditions (NCC) was 2.2. The mean increased with age, women had a higher mean than men, and there was a social gradient with the mean increasing with lower educational attainment. The mean NCC varied from 3.3–9.8 among all conditions. Across disease groups, the highest mean NCC were found within disease group N (chronic renal failure, mean = 8.8), D (in situ and benign neoplasms; mean = 6.5), K (diseases of the digestive system; mean = 5.7), and H (diseases of the eye and the ear; mean = 5.6). The highest mean NCC among the 29 common diseases was heart failure, ischemic heart diseases, angina pectoris, stroke, and dementia, with a mean above 6.5. Several prevalent conditions like hypertension, arthritis, chronic lower respiratory diseases, depression, type 2 diabetes, and overweight transcended other conditions regarding the associated prevalence rates. As one of the most frequent, hypertensive diseases were highly associated with arthritis (50.4%), depression (37.4%), type 2 diabetes (75.4%), cancers (49.7%), and being overweight (39.7%)–meaning that 50.4% of people with arthritis, 37.4% of people with depression and so on also had hypertensive diseases. The largest differences in means between individuals with no educational attainment and individuals with high educational attainment were found within disease groups J (diseases of the respiratory system, ratio = 1.8), Q (congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, ratio = 1.7), and B (viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus disease, ratio = 1.7). Conclusions The current study provides a nationwide off-the-shelf catalogue of multimorbidity means and real-world associations estimates of 199+ chronic conditions for future clinical treatments and health care systems planning. The findings described are just one example of numerous results and underline that multimorbidity is highly prevalent in the adult Danish population and that it is a vital condition transcending all future medical treatment. The data offer essential information on the multimorbidity burden of disease in future differentiated treatments, healthcare planning, and economic, aetiological, and other research."
https://openalex.org/W4295709367,"The discovery of non-chromosomal circular DNA offers new directions in linking genome structure with function in plant biology. Glyphosate resistance through EPSPS gene copy amplification in Palmer amaranth was due to an autonomously replicating extra-chromosomal circular DNA mechanism (eccDNA). CIDER-Seq analysis of geographically distant glyphosate sensitive (GS) and resistant (GR) Palmer Amaranth ( Amaranthus palmeri ) revealed the presence of numerous small extra-chromosomal circular DNAs varying in size and with degrees of repetitive content, coding sequence, and motifs associated with autonomous replication. In GS biotypes, only a small portion of these aligned to the 399 kb eccDNA replicon, the vehicle underlying gene amplification and genetic resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. The aligned eccDNAs from GS were separated from one another by large gaps in sequence. In GR biotypes, the eccDNAs were present in both abundance and diversity to assemble into a nearly complete eccDNA replicon. Mean sizes of eccDNAs were similar in both biotypes and were around 5kb with larger eccDNAs near 25kb. Gene content for eccDNAs ranged from 0 to 3 with functions that include ribosomal proteins, transport, metabolism, and general stress response genetic elements. Repeat content among smaller eccDNAs indicate a potential for recombination into larger structures. Genomic hotspots were also identified in the Palmer amaranth genome with a disposition for gene focal amplifications as eccDNA. The presence of eccDNA may serve as a reservoir of genetic heterogeneity in this species and may be functionally important for survival."
https://openalex.org/W4295757813,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) consists of the cluster of central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidaemia. It is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mortality. The prevalence of MetS has not been described in older adults from a population-representative sample in a European country before. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS in older adults in Ireland and examine the association between MetS and socio-demographic, health, and lifestyle factors. This study used data from a population aged ≥50 years from waves 1 and 3 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. The prevalence of MetS using the National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATPIII) and the International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) criteria were determined. Weighted logistic regression examined the association between MetS and age, sex, education, and physical activity. MetS status was determined at both waves with transitions examined. 5340 participants had complete data for MetS criteria at wave 1. 33% had MetS according to the ATPIII criteria (32.5%; 95% CI: 31.1, 34.0), with 39% according to the IDF criteria (39.3%; 95% CI: 37.8, 40.8). MetS was more prevalent with advancing age, among males, those with lower educational attainment and lower physical activity. 3609 participants had complete data for both waves- 25% of those with MetS at wave 1 did not have MetS at wave 3 but the overall number of participants with MetS increased by 19.8% (ATPIII) and 14.7% (IDF). MetS is highly prevalent in older adults in Ireland. 40% of the 1.2 million population aged ≥50 years in Ireland meet either the ATPIII or IDF criteria. Increasing age, male sex, lower educational attainment, and lower physical activity were all associated with an increased likelihood of MetS."
https://openalex.org/W4295709350,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity to explore how health systems adapt under rapid and constant change and develop a better understanding of health system transformation. Learning health systems (LHS) have been proposed as an ideal structure to inform a data-driven response to a public health emergency like COVID-19. The aim of this study was to use a LHS framework to identify assets and gaps in health system pandemic planning and response during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic at a single Canadian Health Centre.This paper reports the data triangulation stage of a concurrent triangulation mixed methods study which aims to map study findings onto the LHS framework. We used a triangulation matrix to map quantitative (textual and administrative sources) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data onto the seven characteristics of a LHS and identify assets and gaps related to health-system receptors and research-system supports.We identified several health system assets within the LHS characteristics, including appropriate decision supports and aligned governance. Gaps were identified in the LHS characteristics of engaged patients and timely production and use of research evidence.The LHS provided a useful framework to examine COVID-19 pandemic response measures. We highlighted opportunities to strengthen the LHS infrastructure for rapid integration of evidence and patient experience data into future practice and policy changes."
https://openalex.org/W4295709360,"The objective of this study was to investigate the treatment effects of non-thermal atmospheric gas plasmas (NTAP) on destruction and the recovery (or re-colonization) of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in biofilms. P. gingivalis is a well-known keystone periodontal pathogen strongly associated with periodontal diseases, especially periodontitis. P. gingivalis biofilms were formed on stainless steel coupons and treated for 1, 2, and 5 minutes by NTAP of pure argon gas and argon+oxygen gas mixture. MTT assay, colony forming unit (CFU) counting assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to assess the destruction efficiency. In addition, the plasma treated biofilms were re-cultured in the medium supplemented with antibiotics and oxidative stress sources to determine the synergy of the NTAP with other antimicrobial agents. The results showed the plasma treatment could result in 2.7 log unit reduction in bacterial load. The recovered biofilm CFU with NTAP treatment combined with sub minimal inhibition concentration of amoxicillin was 0.33 log units less than the biofilm treated with amoxicillin alone. The recovered biofilm CFU in NTAP groups was about 2.0 log units less than that in the untreated controls under H2O2 treatment. There was approximately 1.0 log unit reduction of biofilm CFU in plasma treated biofilm compared with untreated control under paraquat treatment. The plasma treated biofilms exhibited less resistance to amoxicillin and greater susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat, suggesting that NTAP may enhance biofilm susceptibility to host defense. These in vitro findings suggested that NTAP could be a novel and effective treatment method of oral biofilms that cause periodontal diseases."

Objective The current study aims to investigate the factor structure of the SVCq to increase the usability of this measure in clinical practice and facilitate the interpretation of visual complaints in people with PD. Methods We performed a confirmatory factor analysis using the 19 items of the SVCq of 581 people with PD, investigating the fit of three models previously found in a community sample: a one-factor model including all items, and models where items are distributed across either three or five factors. The clinical value of derived subscales was explored by comparing scores with age-matched controls (N = 583), and by investigating relationships to demographic and disease related characteristics. Results All three models showed a good fit in people with PD, with the five-factor model outperforming the three-factor and one-factor model. Five factors were distinguished: ‘Diminished visual perception–Function related’ (5 items), ‘Diminished visual perception–Luminance related’ (3 items), ‘Diminished visual perception–Task related’ (3 items), ‘Altered visual perception’ (6 items), and ‘Ocular discomfort’ (2 items). On each subscale, people with PD reported more complaints than controls, even when there was no ophthalmological condition present. Furthermore, subscales were sensitive to relevant clinical characteristics, like age, disease duration, severity, and medication use. Conclusions The five-factor model showed a good fit in people with PD and has clinical relevance. Each subscale provides a solid basis for individualized visual care."
https://openalex.org/W4295706133,"Medical textiles are subject to particularly harsh disinfection procedures in healthcare settings where exposure risks are high. This work demonstrates a fabric treatment consisting of a reactive silver ink and low surface energy PDMS polymer that provides for superhydrophobicity and antiviral properties against enveloped herpes simplex virus stocks even after extended ultrasonic bleach washing. The antiviral properties of reactive silver ink has not been previously reported or compared with silver nanoparticles. The fabric treatment exhibits high static contact angles and low contact angle hysteresis with water, even after 300 minutes of ultrasonic bleach washing. Similarly, after this bleach washing treatment, the fabric treatment shows reductions of infectious virus quantities by about 2 logs compared to controls for enveloped viruses. The use of silver ink provides for better antiviral efficacy and durability compared to silver nanoparticles due to the use of reactive ionic silver, which demonstrates more conformal coverage of fabric microfibers and better adhesion. This study provides insights for improving the wash durability of antiviral silver fabric treatments and demonstrates a bleach wash durable, repellent antiviral treatment for reusable, functional personal protective equipment applications."
https://openalex.org/W4295709286,"Women's empowerment is a fundamental human right but attempts to measure progress in this area have been limited. We used 142 nationally representative surveys to quantify empowerment in six domains (Intimate Partner Violence, Family Planning, Reproductive Healthcare, Employment, Education, and Decision-Making) for first-level subdivisions of all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for three years (1995, 2005, and 2015). The possible value for each domain ranged between zero (worst) and one (best). The median value for employment decreased by 0.02, but it increased between 0.09 and 0.16 for the other domains. The average empowerment score increased from 0.44 to 0.53, but it remained low for Education (0.34). While progress was clear and consistent, it was uneven within and between countries, and Sahelian West Africa fell further behind. The expanded understanding of geographic variation and trends in women's empowerment that we provide should be instrumental in efforts to improve women's lives."
https://openalex.org/W4295752268,"The core competency of patient-centered care (PCC) states that for positive patient outcomes, the provider must respect the patient's views and recognize their experiences. The Athletic Training Strategic Alliance Research Agenda Task Force identified a profession-wide belief that examining the extent to which athletic trainers (ATs) provide PCC in their clinical practice would benefit the profession. To first address this line of inquiry, we must study the subjectivity of how ATs view PCC. This study used Q methodology which is a research design that collects data from participants from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. A total of 115 (males = 62, females = 53, age = 37±10 y, experience = 13±10 y) ATs dispersed between 11 job settings volunteered for this study. Participants were asked to pre-sort (agree, disagree, neutral) 36 validated statements representing the 8 dimensions of PCC, then completed a Q-sort where they dragged-and-dropped the pre-sorted statements based on perceived importance in providing PCC. The Q-sorts were analyzed using QMethod software. A principal component analysis was used to identify statement rankings and factors. Factors were determined by an Eigenvalue > 1 and analyzed using a scree plot. The 6 highest selected statements per factor were assessed to create the distinguishing viewpoints. Two distinguishing viewpoints emerged from the factor analysis of the Q-sorts: 1) the interpersonal connection that valued teamwork, open communication, and respectful care with varied populations; 2) the holistic gatekeeper that valued personal promotion for activities of daily living, self-care, and quality of life. Overall, ATs value patient's preferences and respect. However, a lack of importance was identified for incorporating the disablement model which is a core competency and adopted framework by the athletic training profession."
https://openalex.org/W4295753559,"Excavations at Abu Hureyra, Syria, during the 1970s exposed a long sequence of occupation spanning the transition from hunting-and-gathering to agriculture. Dung spherulites preserved within curated flotation samples from Epipalaeolithic (ca. 13,300–11,400 calBP) and Neolithic (ca. 10,600–7,800 calBP) occupations are examined here alongside archaeological, archaeobotanical, and zooarchaeological data to consider animal management, fuel selection, and various uses of dung. Spherulites were present throughout the entire sequence in varying concentrations. Using a new method to quantify spherulites, exclusion criteria were developed to eliminate samples possibly contaminated with modern dung, strengthening observations of ancient human behavior. Darkened spherulites within an Epipalaeolithic 1B firepit (12,800–12,300 calBP) indicate burning between 500–700°C, documenting early use of dung fuel by hunter-gatherers as a supplement to wood, coeval with a dramatic shift to rectilinear architecture, increasing proportions of wild sheep and aurochsen, reduced emphasis on small game, and elevated dung concentrations immediately outside the 1B dwelling. Combined, these observations suggest that small numbers of live animals (possibly wild sheep) were tended on-site by Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers to supplement gazelle hunting, raising the question of whether early experiments in animal management emerged contemporaneously with, or pre-date, cultivation. Dung was used to prepare plaster floors during the Neolithic and continued to be burned as a supplemental fuel, indicating that spherulites were deposited via multiple human- and animal-related pathways. This has important implications for interpretations of archaeobotanical assemblages across the region. Spherulite concentrations dropped abruptly during Neolithic 2B (9,300–8,000 calBP) and 2C (8,000–7,800 calBP), when sheep/goat herding surpassed gazelle hunting, possibly corresponding with movement of animals away from the site as herd sizes increased. As hunter-gatherers at Abu Hureyra began interacting with wild taxa in different ways, they set in motion a remarkable transformation in the ways people interacted with animals, plants, and their environment."
https://openalex.org/W4295761790,"Perceived racial discrimination has been associated with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activities-two major stress response systems. To date, most studies have used cross-sectional data that captured retrospective measures of the racial discrimination associated with current physiological stress responses. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between racial discrimination measured in real-time and physiological stress responses. Twelve healthy Black adults completed baseline surveys and self-collected saliva samples 4x/day for 4 days to measure cortisol and alpha amylase (AA) as a proxy of HPA and ANS systems, respectively. Real-time racial discrimination was measured using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) sent to participants 5x/day for 7 days. Multilevel models were conducted to examine the relationship between racial discrimination and stress responses. In multilevel models, the previous day's racial discrimination was significantly associated with the next day's cortisol level at wakening (β = 0.81, partial r = 0.74, p<0.01) and diurnal slope (β = -0.85, partial r = -0.73, p<0.01). Also, microaggressions were significantly associated with the diurnal cortisol slope in the same day, indicating that on the day when people reported more microaggressions than usual, a flatter diurnal slope of cortisol was observed (β = -0.50, partial r = -0.64, p<0.01). The concurrent use of salivary biomarkers and EMA was feasible methods to examine the temporal relationship between racial discrimination and physiological stress responses. The within-person approach may help us understand the concurrent or lagged effects of racial discrimination on the stress responses. Further studies are needed to confirm the observed findings with a large sample size and to improve stress related health outcomes in racial/ethnic minorities."
https://openalex.org/W4295785874,"Voxel-based specific region analysis systems for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) are clinically used to measure the atrophied hippocampus captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, motion artifacts during acquisition of images may distort the results of the analysis. This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of the Pix2Pix network in motion correction for the input image of VSRAD analysis. Seventy-three patients examined with MRI were distinguished into the training group (n = 51) and the test group (n = 22). To create artifact images, the k-space images were manipulated. Supervised deep learning was employed to obtain a Pix2Pix that generates motion-corrected images, with artifact images as the input data and original images as the reference data. The results of the VSRAD analysis (severity of voxel of interest (VOI) atrophy, the extent of gray matter (GM) atrophy, and extent of VOI atrophy) were recorded for artifact images and motion-corrected images, and were then compared with the original images. For comparison, the image quality of Pix2Pix generated motion-corrected image was also compared with that of U-Net. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean of the limits of agreement was smaller for the motion-corrected images compared to the artifact images, suggesting successful motion correction by the Pix2Pix. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between original and motion-corrected images were almost perfect for all results (severity of VOI atrophy: 0.87-0.99, extent of GM atrophy: 0.88-00.98, extent of VOI atrophy: 0.90-1.00). Pix2Pix generated motion-corrected images that showed generally improved quantitative and qualitative image qualities compared with the U-net generated motion-corrected images. Our findings suggest that motion correction using Pix2Pix is a useful method for VSRAD analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4295786722,"The global COVID-19 pandemic effects people and the health system. Some international studies reported an increasing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Comparable studies regarding the impact of COVID-19 on incidence and outcome of OHCA are not yet available for Germany.This epidemiological study from the German Resuscitation Registry (GRR) compared a non-pandemic period (01.03.2018-28.02.2019) and a pandemic period (01.03.2020-28.02.2021) regarding the pandemic-related impact on OHCA care.A total of 18,799 cases were included. The incidence of OHCA (non-pandemic 117.9 vs. pandemic period 128.0/100,000 inhabitants) and of OHCA with resuscitation attempted increased (66.0 vs. 69.1/100,000). OHCA occurred predominantly and more often at home (62.8% vs. 66.5%, p<0.001). The first ECG rhythm was less often shockable (22.2% vs. 20.3%, p = 0.03). Fewer cases of OHCA were observed (58.6% vs. 55.6% p = 0.02). Both the bystander resuscitation rate and the proportion of telephone guided CPR remained stable (38.6% vs. 39.8%, p = 0.23; and 22.3% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.77). EMS arrival times increased (08:39 min vs. 09:08 min, p<0.001). Fewer patients reached a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (45.4% vs. 40.9%, p<0.001), were admitted to hospital (50.2% vs. 45.0%, p<0.001), and discharged alive (13.9% vs. 10.2%, p<0.001).Survival after OHCA significantly decreased while the bystander resuscitation rate remained stable. However, longer EMS arrival times and fewer cases of witnessed OHCA may have contributed to poorer survival. Any change to EMS systems in the care of OHCA should be critically evaluated as it may mean a real loss of life-regardless of the pandemic situation."
https://openalex.org/W4295786840,"Objectives To determine the prevalence of use of complementary medicine (CM) in Switzerland in 2017, its development since the 2012 Swiss Health Survey, and to examine specific and non-specific sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related determinants of CM use as compared to determinants of conventional health care use. Materials and methods We used data of 18,832 participants from the cross-sectional Swiss Health Survey conducted by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office in 2017 and compared these data with those from 2012. We defined four CM categories: (1) traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture; (2) homeopathy; (3) herbal medicine; (4) other CM therapies (shiatsu, reflexology, osteopathy, Ayurveda, naturopathy, kinesiology, Feldenkrais, autogenic training, neural therapy, bioresonance therapy, anthroposophic medicine). Independent determinants of CM use and of conventional health care use were assessed using multivariate weighted logistic regression models. Results Prevalence of CM use significantly increased between 2012 and 2017 from 24.7% (95% CI: 23.9–25.4%) to 28.9% (95% CI: 28.1–29.7%), respectively, p&lt;0.001). We identified the following independent specific determinants of CM use: gender, nationality, age, lifestyle and BMI. Female gender and nationality were the most specific determinants of CM use. Current smoking, being overweight and obesity were determinants of non-use of CM, while regular consumption of fruits and/or vegetables and regular physical activity were determinants of CM use. Conclusion Prevalence of CM use significantly increased in Switzerland from 2012 to 2017. Gender, nationality, age, lifestyle and BMI were independent specific determinants of CM use as compared to conventional health care use. Healthier lifestyle was associated with CM use, which may have potentially significant implications for public health and preventive medicine initiatives. The nationality of CM users underlines the role of culture in driving the choice to use CM but also raises the question of whether all populations have equal access to CM within a same country."
https://openalex.org/W4295787408,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) expression have been both positively and negatively associated with tumorigenesis. Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of Syk and its two splice variants, full length Syk (L) and short isoform Syk (S), in the tumor biology of colorectal cancer cells (CRC). The analysis of Syk expression in primary human colorectal tumors, as well as the analysis of TCGA database, revealed a high Syk mRNA expression score in colorectal cancer tumors, suggesting a tumor promotor role of Syk in CRC. Our analysis showed that Syk (L) isoform is highly expressed in the majority of the tumor tissues and that it remains expressed in tumors in which global Syk expression is downregulated, suggesting the dependence of tumors to Syk (L) isoform. We also identified a small cluster of tumor tissues, which express a high proportion of Syk (S) isoform. This specific cluster is associated with overexpressed genes related to translation and mitochondria, and down regulated genes implicated in the progression of mitosis. For our functional studies, we used short hairpin RNA tools to target the expression of Syk in CRC cells bearing the activating K-Ras (G13D) mutation. Our results showed that while global Syk knock down increases cell proliferation and cell motility, Syk (L) expression silencing affects the viability and induces the apoptosis of the cells, confirming the dependence of cells on Syk (L) isoform for their survival. Finally, we report the promising potential of compound C-13, an original non-enzymatic inhibitor of Syk isolated in our group. In vitro studies showed that C-13 exerts cytotoxic effects on Syk-positive CRC cells by inhibiting their proliferation and their motility, and by inducing their apoptosis, while Syk-negative cell lines viability was not affected. Moreover, the oral and intraperitoneal administration of C-13 reduced the tumor growth of CRC DLD-1 cells xenografts in Nude mice in vivo."

However, the short history of these high-resolution collection techniques presents challenges when assessing canopy changes over longer time scales (&gt; 50 years). This research shows how using high-resolution LiDAR data in conjunction with historical aerial photos can overcome this limitation. We used the University of British Columbia’s Point Grey campus in Vancouver, Canada, as a case study, using both historical aerial photographs from 1949 and 2015 LiDAR data. TCC was summed in 0.05 ha analysis polygons for both the LiDAR and aerial photo data, allowing for TCC comparison across the two different data types. Methods were validated using 2015 aerial photos, the means (Δ 0.24) and a TOST test indicated that the methods were statistically equivalent (±5.38% TCC). This research concludes the methods outlined is suitable for small scale TCC change detection over long time frames when inconsistent data types are available between the two time periods."
https://openalex.org/W4295709242,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young. We aimed to characterize detailed family history, symptoms, hospital utilization and ECG changes before SCD.We extracted all cases suffering SCD with HCM from the SUDDY cohort, which includes all cases of SCD between 2000-2010 in Sweden among individuals aged 0-35 years along with their controls. We gathered data from mandatory national registries, autopsy reports, medical records, ECGs (including military conscripts), and detailed family history from an interview-based questionnaire (with relatives, post-mortem).Thirty-eight cases (7 female), mean age 22 years, with HCM were identified. Among these, 71% presented with possible cardiac symptoms (chest pain [26%], syncope [22%], palpitations [37%]), before death; 69% received medical care (vs 21% in controls) within 180 days before death. The majority (68%) died during recreational activity (n = 14) or exercise/competitive sports (n = 12). Fifteen (39%) had a known cardiac disorder prior to death, with HCM being diagnosed pre-mortem in nine cases. 58% presented with abnormal ECG recordings pre-mortem, and 50% had a positive family history (1st-3rd generation) for heart disease.In this comprehensive, nationwide study of SCD due to HCM, 87% (33/38) of cases had one or more abnormality prior to death, including cardiac symptoms, a positive family history, known cardiac disease or ECG abnormalities. They sought medical care prior death, to a larger extent than controls. These findings suggest that cardiac screening should be expanded beyond competitive athletes to aid SCD prevention in the young population with HCM."
https://openalex.org/W4295709287,"Introduction Older adults are always at a greater risk of physical and functional health challenges. These complications result into morbidity, disability and death making them more vulnerable at later ages. Therefore, this paper will examine the functional health status among older adults and its gender perspective, along with associated risk factors. Materials and methods Using the first round of Longitudinal ageing survey of India (2017–18). Functional disability was computed based on general and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL and IADL) (n = 20910). Functional disability was coined with individual having at least one of the limitations of these activities. Applying bivariate and multivariate analysis the present paper studied the association, gender perspective and risk factors of functional disability among older adults aged 50 and above in India. Results Our results clearly showed the gender bias in functional disability, with greater proportion of women (52%) at risk for functional disability then men (35%). Factors like multimorbidity, depression and life satisfaction are key risk factors identified by this study that increase the likelihood of disability. Conclusion Functional disability is key to healthy ageing and needs immediate attention given its greater concentration among the elderly, particularly women. The results reflect the substantial burden of functional disability than self-care among older adults in India and therefore indicates some significant policy interventions to reduce the likely impact of functional disability."
https://openalex.org/W4295709295,"Japan has been facing a population decline since 2010 due to low birth rates, interregional migration, and regional traits. In this study, we modeled the demographic dynamics of Japan using a transition matrix model. Then, from the mathematical structure of the model, we quantitatively evaluated the domestic factors of population decline. To achieve this, we constructed a multi-regional Leslie matrix model and developed a method for representing the reproductive value and stable age distribution using matrix entries. Our method enabled us to interpret the mathematical indices using the genealogies of the migration history of individuals and their ancestors. Furthermore, by combining our method with sensitivity analysis, we analyzed the effect of region-specific fertility rates and interregional migration rates on the population decline in Japan. We found that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to the migration rate from urban areas with large populations to prefectures with high fertility rates was greatest for people aged under 30. In addition, compared to other areas, the fertility rates of urban areas exhibited higher sensitivity for people aged over 30. Because this feature is robust in comparison with those in 2010 and 2015, it can be said to be a unique structure in Japan in recent years. We also established a method to represent the reproductive value and stable age distribution in an irreducible non-negative matrix population model by using the matrix entries. Furthermore, we show the effects of fertility and migration rates numerically in urban and non-urban areas on the population growth rates for each age group in a society with a declining population."

https://openalex.org/W4295709343,"We recently published a preliminary assessment of the activity of a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, also known as 2X-121, which inhibits viral replication by affecting pathways of the host. Here we show that stenoparib effectively inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 wild type (BavPat1/2020) strain and four additional variant strains; alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2) and gamma (P.1) in vitro , with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) estimates of 4.1 μM, 8.5 μM, 24.1 μM, 8.2 μM and 13.6 μM, respectively. A separate experiment focusing on a combination of 10 μM stenoparib and 0.5 μM remdesivir, an antiviral drug, resulted in over 80% inhibition of the alpha variant, which is substantially greater than the effect achieved with either drug alone, suggesting at least additive effects from combining the different mechanisms of activity of stenoparib and remdesivir."
https://openalex.org/W4295755852,"Background Parental support programmes aim to strengthen family functioning and the parent–child relationship and to promote the mental health of children and parents. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how parenting support programmes can be implemented for newly arrived immigrant parents. This process evaluation describes the implementation of a successful parenting programme for immigrant parents from Somalia and identifies key components of the implementation process with a focus on Reach, Adaptation, and Fidelity of Ladnaan intervention. Method This process evaluation considered context, implementation and mechanism of impact, in accordance with the Medical Research Council’s guidance. Data were collected through focus group discussions, a questionnaire, attendance lists, field and reflection notes and observations of the sessions. The data were then analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics. Results Of the 60 parents invited to the parenting programme, 58 participated in the sessions. The study showed that involving key individuals in the early stage of the parenting programme’s implementation facilitated reaching Somali-born parents. To retain the programme participants, parents were offered free transportation. The programme was implemented and delivered as intended. A majority of the parents were satisfied with the programme and reported increased knowledge about children’s rights and the support they could seek from social services. Conclusions This study illustrates how a parenting support programme can be implemented for Somali-born parents and provides guidance on how to attract immigrant parents to and engage them in participating in parenting support programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4295758151,"Musicians with absolute pitch (AP) can name the pitch of a musical note in isolation. Expression of this unusual ability is thought to be influenced by heritability, early music training and current practice. However, our understanding of factors shaping its expression is hampered by testing and scoring methods that treat AP as dichotomous. These fail to capture the observed variability in pitch-naming accuracy among reported AP possessors. The aim of this study was to trial a novel explicit priming paradigm to explore phenotypic variability of AP. Thirty-five musically experienced individuals ( M age = 29 years, range 18–68; 14 males) with varying AP ability completed a standard AP task and the explicit priming AP task. Results showed: 1) phenotypic variability of AP ability, including high-accuracy AP, heterogeneous intermediate performers, and chance-level performers; 2) intermediate performance profiles that were either reliant on or independent of relative pitch strategies, as identified by the priming task; and 3) the emergence of a bimodal distribution of AP performance when adopting scoring criteria that assign credit to semitone errors. These findings show the importance of methods in studying behavioural traits, and are a key step towards identifying AP phenotypes. Replication of our results in larger samples will further establish the usefulness of this priming paradigm in AP research."
https://openalex.org/W4295759108,"Mutations of the n ucleophosmin1 ( NPM1 ) gene represent the most frequent molecular alteration in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), especially in patients with AML who have a normal karyotype. These alterations have been shown to carry favorable prognostic significance in patients with AML. Several methods have been developed for detection of NPM1 gene mutations. However, their ability to detect low levels of mutations in a wild-type background is limited. In this study, the Enhance improved and complete enrichment Co-amplification at Lower Denaturation temperature Polymerase Chain Reaction (E-ice-COLD-PCR) assay combined with High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was developed and validated for highly specific and sensitive screening for NPM1 gene mutations. A total of 83 blood samples from patients with AML were collected, and their DNA was extracted. For mutational analysis, the E-ice-COLD-PCR assay for the detection of NPM1 gene mutations was developed. PCR products were analyzed by HRM analysis. All positive samples were confirmed by direct sequencing. This assay enabled detection specificity and sensitivity of NPM1 mutations in 9/83 patients with AML. Direct sequencing results were 100% concordant with this method. In addition, the limit of detection was 12.5% mutant in the final concentration of 5 ng genomic DNA. The E-ice-COLD-PCR assay with HRM analysis is a highly specific and sensitive screening method for enrichment of detecting NPM1 gene mutations. This method has both a short turn around time and easier interpretation compared to those of other methods."
https://openalex.org/W4295786016,"Age-related cardiac fibrosis contributes to the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction which lacks ideal treatment. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is an oxidative stress sensor and could attenuate age-related pathologies in invertebrates. The present study aimed to test whether TRPA1 plays a role in age-related cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. The cardiac function and pathology of 12-week-old (young) and 52-week-old (older) Trpa1 -/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were evaluated by echocardiography and histologic analyses. The expression levels of 84 fibrosis-related genes in the heart were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction array. Young Trpa1 -/- and WT mice had similar left ventricular wall thickness, volume, and systolic and diastolic function. Older Trpa1 -/- mice had significantly increased left ventricular internal diameter and volume and impaired systolic (lower left ventricular ejection fraction) and diastolic (higher E/A ratio and isovolumetric relaxation time) functions compared with older WT mice ( P &lt;0.05 or P &lt;0.01). Importantly, older Trpa1 -/- mice had enhanced cardiac fibrosis than older WT mice ( P &lt;0.05) while the two strains had similar degree of cardiac hypertrophy. Among the 84 fibrosis-related genes, Acta2 , Inhbe , Ifng , and Ccl11 were significantly upregulated, while Timp3 , Stat6 , and Ilk were significantly downregulated in the heart of older Trpa1 -/- mice compared with older WT mice. Taken together, we found that knocking out Trpa1 accelerated age-related myocardial fibrosis, ventricular dilation, and cardiac dysfunction. These findings suggest that TRPA1 may become a therapeutic target for preventing and/or treating cardiac fibrosis and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W4295786619,"This study aimed to examine the association between infant sleep quality and temperament in one-month-old infants using a large cohort study data. We used data from the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, a cohort study which follows around 100,000 women from pregnancy until their children’s development. The mothers were asked about their infants’ sleep and temperament using a structured questionnaire. Frequent crying (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00–1.10) and intense crying (AOR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.13–1.25) were positively associated with longer sleep periods during the day than at night. Female infants with longer daytime sleep periods than that at nighttime were more likely to cry frequently (AOR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04–1.20). Parous women with infants who had frequent night awakening believed their infants cried more intensely (AOR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03–1.31). The study demonstrated a specific association between sleep quality and temperament in one-month-old infants. Based on the results of this study, further sleep intervention studies are required to improve infant temperament."

https://openalex.org/W4295709258,"This study tracked and recorded the weight changes of 13 captive Sunda pangolin cubs from lactation to maturity to explored the appropriate weaning time and reveal the rules of its weight growth. SPSS 25.0 was used to build a cubic equation model to fit the body weight change rules of 4 individuals who nonvoluntarily ingested artificial feed (NIAF) at 127 days after birth and 5 individuals who voluntarily ingested artificial feed (VIAF) at 86-108 days after birth. The body weight of NIAF cubs aged 0-120 days and VIAF cubs aged 0-150 days were estimated according to the fitting model. An independent sample T-test was performed on the mean body weight of the two groups during the late lactation period. The results showed that at 105 days after birth, the body weight of the VIAF group was significantly higher than that of the NIAF group (P = 0.049), and the body weight of the VIAF group was extremely significantly higher than that of the NIAF group at 114 days (P = 0.008); The peak cumulative body weight of the NIAF cubs during lactation appeared around 130 days of age (n = 3); The mortality rate was 66.7% (n = 3) after about 150 days if the feed was continuously consumed nonvoluntarily. It was concluded that the milk secretion period of the mother is about 0-5 months after giving birth; the weaning period of the cubs should be 4-5 months after birth. If the cubs don't follow the mother to eat artificial feed for 3 months after birth, it can start be induced with artificial diet which adds termites, and the time point cannot be later than 130 days, otherwise it is not conducive to the survival of the cubs; When sexually mature, the body length and body weight of female cubs account for about 84% and 60% of the adult, respectively; the body maturity and body weight of female cubs tend to be stable about 15.3 months and 16.4 months, respectively. Finally, a special needle-shaped nipples and nursing patterns of female Sunda pangolins were also recorded in this study. These findings play an important role in guiding the nursing of captive Sunda pangolin cubs and other pangolin cubs. It is expected to improve the survival rate of the cubs by exploring the appropriate weaning time and the rules of weight growth. By scientifically planning the reproductive cycle of the female Sunda pangolins, our goal is to expand the population size and eventually release to the wild, meanwhile improving knowledge of this critically endangered species."
https://openalex.org/W4295709268,"The Nepali-speaking Bhutanese (NSB) community is a rapidly growing population in Central Pennsylvania. A community-based diabetes education pilot program found a large gender disparity with fewer women in attendance; participants reported that primary household cooks and caretakers were women. This may be an indication of women's status in the NSB community, their healthcare access, autonomy, and ability to manage their diabetes. Hence, this study aims to understand the manifestations of patriarchy and its impact on NSB women's diabetes self-management employing a conceptual framework based on Walby's structures of patriarchy.An exploratory feminist qualitative inquiry was conducted. Fifteen NSB women with Type 2 Diabetes were interviewed about their diabetes self-management. Transcripts were coded for key concepts that emerged from the data. A thematic analysis was conducted. Themes were developed inductively through those categories as well as through an a priori approach using the conceptual framework.Cultural influences such as family structure, religious beliefs, traditional healthcare and gender roles determined NSB women's patriarchal upbringing and lifestyle. Unpaid household production was largely dependent on women. Multiple immigrations led to poor socioeconomic indicators and marginalization of NSB women. Women's access to healthcare (including diabetes) was entirely reliant on other family members due to poor autonomy. Women experienced adverse physical and emotional symptoms related to diabetes and their ability and attempts to maintain a healthy diabetes lifestyle was determined by their physical health condition, knowledge regarding good dietary practices and self-efficacy.Patriarchal practices that start early on within women's lives, such as child marriage, religious restrictions as well as women's access to education and autonomy impacted NSB women's access to healthcare, knowledge regarding their diabetes and self-efficacy. Future interventions tailored for diabetes prevention and self-management among NSB women should factor in patriarchy as an important social determinant of health."
https://openalex.org/W4295709284,"Objectives To assess impacts of early detection and prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the latest epidemiologic situation to inform intervention strategy. Methods We analysed data from two clinical cohorts in Hong Kong where sexual transmission accounted for the majority of HIV infections. The two cohorts comprised patients newly diagnosed in 2007–2008 and 2016–2018 respectively. Secular trend and differences between men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual patients were examined. Predictors of late presentation (defined as CD4 ≤350 or AIDS-defining illness within 3 months of diagnosis) and prolonged interval between diagnosis and ART initiation were assessed by multivariable regressions. Results There were 1,136 newly diagnosed HIV patients with 644 in the first and 492 in the second cohort, a majority (91.7%) presented with sexually acquired infection. There were less MSM in the first than the second cohort (50.3%% vs 87.8%, χ 2 = 117.05, p&lt;0.001). The mean (SD) number of days between diagnosis and ART initiation decreased from 514.3 (516.1) to 61.8 (94.2) days across the two cohorts. Younger age, non-Chinese, outpatient-based service and lower CD4 count were predictors of faster ART initiation in the first but not in the second cohort. Interval between diagnosis and ART initiation became highly uniform among groups in the second cohort. Nearly 60% were classified as late presenters in both cohorts. Heterosexuals (aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13–2.19) had a higher risk of late presentation. Conclusions There was remarkable improvement in acceleration of ART initiation. Clinical implementation of accelerated ART recommendations has been effective for both MSM and heterosexuals. Late presentation was more marked among heterosexuals and remained a problem. The continued phenomenon of late presentation could offset the epidemiologic gains from accelerated ART initiation."
https://openalex.org/W4295709294,"Thousand-grain weight is a key indicator of crop yield and an important parameter for evaluating cultivation measures. Existing methods based on image analysis are convenient but lack a counting algorithm that is suitable for multiple types of grains. This research develops an application program based on an Android device to quickly calculate the number of grains. We explore the short axis measurement method of the grains with morphological thought, and determine the relationship between the general corrosion threshold and the short axis. To solve the problem of calculating the number of grains in the connected area, the study proposes a corrosion algorithm based on the short axis and an improved corner point method. After testing a variety of crop grains and equipment, it was found that the method has high universality, supports grain counting with white paper as the background, and has high accuracy and calculation efficiency. The average accuracy rate is 97.9%, and the average time is less than 0.7 seconds. In addition, the difference between the average accuracy for various mobile phones and multiple crops is small. This research proposes a grain counting algorithm with a wide range of applications to meet the requirements of nonglare use in the field. The algorithm provides a fast, accurate, low-cost tool for counting grains of wheat, corn, mung bean, soybean, peanut, rapeseed, etc., which is less constrained by space and power conditions. The algorithm is highly adaptable and can provide a reference for the study of grain counting."
https://openalex.org/W4295709324,"The question of whether it is appropriate to attribute authorship to deceased individuals of original studies in the biomedical literature is contentious. Authorship guidelines utilized by journals do not provide a clear consensus framework that is binding on those in the field. To guide and inform the implementation of authorship frameworks it would be useful to understand the extent of the practice in the scientific literature, but studies that have systematically quantified the prevalence of this phenomenon in the biomedical literature have not been performed to date. To address this issue, we quantified the prevalence of publications by deceased authors in the biomedical literature from the period 1990-2020. We screened 2,601,457 peer-reviewed papers from the full text Europe PubMed Central database. We applied natural language processing, stringent filtering and manual curation to identify a final set of 1,439 deceased authors. We then determined these authors published a total of 38,907 papers over their careers with 5,477 published after death. The number of deceased publications has been growing rapidly, a 146-fold increase since the year 2000. This rate of increase was still significant when accounting for the growing total number of publications and pool of authors. We found that more than 50% of deceased author papers were first submitted after the death of the author and that over 60% of these papers failed to acknowledge the deceased authors status. Most deceased authors published less than 10 papers after death but a small pool of 30 authors published significantly more. A pool of 266 authors published more than 90% of their total publications after death. Our analysis indicates that the attribution of deceased authorship in the literature is not an occasional occurrence but a burgeoning trend. A consensus framework to address authorship by deceased scientists is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4295709331,"The aim of this study was to analyse the content of online reviews posted by hospital employees on job websites for themes of organisational culture. 103 anonymous online reviews across three job websites, posted by hospital employees of four hospitals within an Australian health network were extracted. Reviews had been posted across a period of six years, from 2014 to early 2020. Sentiment rating based on user-allotted ratings on the selected websites was calculated. The sentiment score was validated against the textual content of the review to confirm employee recommendation and sentiment. Sentiment was coded as neutral, positive, or negative. Significant keywords, associations, and usage within the context of identified sentiment were deductively coded and clustered manually against eight pre-determined safety culture themes. These themes were derived from the most used assessment tools for self-reported measures of occupational health and safety, and safety culture in healthcare. Workers across clinical roles (n = 49) and non-clinical roles (n = 50) were evenly represented in the dataset. 35.9% of commenters (n = 37) reported their length of employment in the hospitals that they reviewed. Most online employee reviews addressed broad themes related to perceptions of management (n = 98), safety climate (n = 97), teamwork climate (n = 91) and working conditions (n = 98). A significant set of reviews addressed themes related to job satisfaction (n = 49) and learning, training, and development (n = 41). 72.8% of online reviews (n = 75) expressed positive sentiment towards their employer. Reviews expressing negative sentiment were largely posted by former employees and indicated areas of discontent that reflected organisational and systemic factors. Online employee reviews posted by hospital workers on job sites provide valuable insights into healthcare organisational culture. Therefore, employee online reviews could be used as a supplementary source of data to inform organisational employee engagement initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W4295709332,"Identifying promising research as early as possible is vital to determine which research deserves investment. Additionally, developing a technology for automatically predicting future research trends is necessary because of increasing digital publications and research fragmentation. In previous studies, many researchers have performed the prediction of scientific indices using specially designed features for each index. However, this does not capture real research trends. It is necessary to develop a more integrated method to capture actual research trends from various directions. Recent deep learning technology integrates different individual models and makes it easier to construct more general-purpose models. The purpose of this paper is to show the possibility of integrating multiple prediction models for scientific indices by network-based representation learning. This paper will conduct predictive analysis of multiple future scientific impacts by embedding a heterogeneous network and showing that a network embedding method is a promising tool for capturing and expressing scientific trends. Experimental results show that the multiple heterogeneous network embedding improved 1.6 points than a single citation network embedding. Experimental results show better results than baseline for the number of indices, including the author h -index, the journal impact factor (JIF), and the Nature Index after three years from publication. These results suggest that distributed representations of a heterogeneous network for scientific papers are the basis for the automatic prediction of scientific trends."
https://openalex.org/W4295755849,"Population sizes of adolescent (15- to 19-years) and young (20 to 24-years) key populations at risk for HIV transmission are essential for developing effective national HIV control strategies. We present new population size estimates of adolescent and young men who have sex with men and females who sell sex from 184 countries in nine UNICEF regions using UNAIDS published population size estimations submitted by national governments to derive 15-24-year-old population proportions based on the size of equivalent adult general populations. Imputed sizes based on regional estimates were used for countries or regions where adult proportion estimates were unavailable. Proportions were apportioned to adolescents and young adults based on age at sexual debut, by adjusting for the cumulative percentage of the sexually active population at each age for sex. Among roughly 69.5 million men who have sex with men, 12 million are under the age of 24 years, of whom 3 million are adolescents. There are an estimated 1.4 million adolescent and 3.7 million young females who sell sex. Roughly four and a half million adolescent men who have sex with men and females who sell sex would benefit from early HIV interventions. These population size estimates suggest there are roughly 17 million adolescent and young men who have sex with men and females who sell sex who need HIV prevention services and social support. These data provide evidence for national and international programs to determine how many adolescent and young key populations need essential health services and are living with HIV and other infections. Age disaggregated population sizes inform epidemic models, which increasingly use age-sex structures and are often used to obtain and allocate resources and human capacity and to plan critical prevention, treatment, and infection control programs."

We investigated the effect of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) determined by creatinine on the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin to identify the optimal cut-off value in patients with renal dysfunction. A total of 834 patients aged ≥18 years with serum presepsin and creatinine measured on the same day over a period of 1 year were included. Sepsis was diagnosed in three ways: sepsis-1, sepsis-3, and clinical diagnosis (Sep-C). Presepsin showed a significant negative correlation with eGFR (r = -0.55, p<0.01), with median and interquartile ranges of presepsin values for patients in each eGFR category as follows: ≥90, 263 (169-460); ≥60-<90, 309 (205-578); ≥45-<60, 406 (279-683); ≥30-<45, 605 (379-1109); ≥15-<30, 1027 (675-1953); <15, 1977 (1199-3477); and on hemodialysis, 3964 (2343-6967). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) for sepsis-1 was the lowest (0.64 ± 0.02), while Sep-C (0.80± 0.03) and sepsis-3 (0.75 ± 0.03) were moderately accurate. Comparing AUCs after dividing patients into eGFR ≥60 and <60 showed that the AUC of Sep-C was lower in the eGFR ≥60 group, while the AUC of sepsis-3 was ≥ 0.7 in both groups. The following cut-offs were obtained by ROC analysis for sepsis-3: 466 pg/mL in the ≥60 group and 960 pg/mLin the < 60 group. Presepsin facilitated diagnosis sepsis based on sepsis-3 criteria regardless of renal function. We found that the optimal cut-offs for patients in this study were 500 pg/mL for eGFR ≥ 60 and 1000 pg/mL for < 60. However, future prospective diagnostic studies on sepsis-3 are needed to determine the cut-offs for patients with renal dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4295761954,"The COVID-19 pandemic changed people’s lives all over the world. While anxiety and stress decreased sleep quality for most people, an increase in total sleep time was also observed in certain cohorts. Dream recall frequency also increased, especially for nightmares. However, to date, there are no consistent reports focusing on pandemic-related changes in lucid dreaming, a state during which dreamers become conscious of being in a dream as it unfolds. Here we investigated lucid dreaming recall frequency and other sleep variables in 1,857 Brazilian subjects, using an online questionnaire. Firstly, we found that most participants (64.78%) maintained their lucid dream recall frequency during the pandemic, but a considerable fraction (22.62%) informed that lucid dreams became more frequent, whereas a smaller subset (12.60%) reported a decrease in these events during the pandemic. Secondly, the number of participants reporting lucid dreams at least once per week increased during the pandemic. Using a mixed logistic regression model, we confirmed that the pandemic significantly enhanced the recall frequency of lucid dreams (p = 0.002). Such increase in lucid dreaming during the pandemic was significantly associated with an enhancement in both dream and nightmare recall frequencies, as well as with sleep quality and symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder. Pandemic-related increases in stress, anxiety, sleep fragmentation, and sleep extension, which enhance REM sleep awakening, may be associated with the increase in the occurrence of lucid dreams, dreams in general, and nightmares."

Participants (41 women, 20 men, mean age 29.95 years) were assigned to primed (n = 30) or unprimed (n = 31) groups: the former were told the study was of 'purported ghosts voices', the latter 'voices in noisy environments.' Participants were assessed for perception of human voices within recordings of purported electronic voice phenomena (EVP), degraded human speech, normal human speech, and white noise. The primed group had significantly higher perception of voices within EVPs than in degraded speech, this difference was not found for unprimed participants. In contrast to the previous use of this design, the primed group did not have higher perception of voices in EVPs and degraded speech than did the unprimed group. The Aesthetic Sensitivity dimension of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS) was associated with detection of degraded stimuli, but not with accuracy of stimulus identification. HSPS score was related to lifetime reporting of anomalous and paranormal experiences. This study partially replicates a paranormal priming effect and shows relationships between HSPS and detection of ambiguous stimuli and anomalous and paranormal experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4295785856,"By the peak of COVID-19 restrictions on April 8, 2020, up to 1.5 billion students across 188 countries were by the suspension of physical attendance in schools. Schools were among the first services to reopen as vaccination campaigns advanced. With the emergence of new variants and infection waves, the question now is to find safe protocols for the continuation of school activities. We need to understand how reliable these protocols are under different levels of vaccination coverage, as many countries have a meager fraction of their population vaccinated, including Uganda where the coverage is about 8\%. We investigate the impact of face-to-face classes under different protocols and quantify the surplus number of infected individuals in a city. Using the infection transmission when schools were closed as a baseline, we assess the impact of physical school attendance in classrooms with poor air circulation. We find that (i) resuming school activities with people only wearing low-quality masks leads to a near fivefold city-wide increase in the number of cases even if all staff is vaccinated, (ii) resuming activities with students wearing good-quality masks and staff wearing N95s leads to about a threefold increase, (iii) combining high-quality masks and active monitoring, activities may be carried out safely even with low vaccination coverage. These results highlight the effectiveness of good mask-wearing. Compared to ICU costs, high-quality masks are inexpensive and can help curb the spreading. Classes can be carried out safely, provided the correct set of measures are implemented."
https://openalex.org/W4295785995,"Transporting patients down stairs by carrying is associated with a particularly high fall risk for patients and the occurrence of back pain among emergency medical technicians. The present study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the Airstretcher device, which was developed to reduce rescuers’ physical burden when transporting patients by dragging along the floor and down stairs. Forty-one paramedical students used three devices to transport a 65-kg manikin down stairs from the 3rd to the 1st floor. To verify the physical burden while carrying the stretchers, ratings of perceived exertion were measured using the Borg CR10 scale immediately after the task. Mean Borg CR10 scores (standard deviation) were 3.6 (1.7), 4.1 (1.8), 5.6 (2.4), and 4.2 (1.8) for the Airstretcher with dragging, Airstretcher with lifting, backboard with lifting, and tarpaulin with lifting conditions, respectively ( p &lt; 0.01). Multiple comparisons revealed that the Airstretcher with dragging condition was associated with significantly lower Borg CR10 scores compared with the backboard with lifting condition ( p &lt; 0.01). When the analysis was divided by handling position, estimated Borg CR10 values (standard error) for head position were 4.4 (1.3), 2.9 (0.9), 3.2 (0.8), and 4.0 (1.1) for the Airstretcher with dragging, Airstretcher with lifting, backboard with lifting, and tarpaulin with lifting conditions, respectively, after adjusting for participant and duration time (F = 1.4, p &lt; 0.25). The estimated Borg CR10 value (standard error) for toe position in the Airstretcher with dragging condition was 2.0 (0.8), and the scores for the side position were 4.9 (0.4), 6.1 (0.3), and 4.7 (0.4) for the Airstretcher with lifting, backboard with lifting, and tarpaulin with lifting conditions, respectively, after adjusting for participant and duration time (F = 3.6, p = 0.02). Transferring a patient down stairs inside a house by dragging using the Airstretcher may reduce the physical burden for rescuers."
https://openalex.org/W4295786243,"People with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) are at higher risk of TB coinfection and mortality. However, there are challenges in TB diagnosis with the currently recommended diagnostic tools. WHO recommends lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) assay to assist TB diagnosis among AHD patients. We assessed the utility and acceptability of using urine LF-LAM assay for TB diagnosis among patients at public Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Centres in Mumbai.The cross-sectional study was conducted among adult AHD patients accessing care from 17 ART centres during November,2020-June, 2021. Urine LF-LAM was offered as routine care for eligible patients in combination with standard diagnostic tests. We calculated the proportion of positive LF-LAM results by CD4 categories and TB symptoms and performed multivariable logistic regression to determine the factors associated with LF-LAM positivity.Among 2,390 patients, the majority (74.5%) had CD4 between 101-200 cells/mm3. The mean age was 43.7 years (SD:10.6), 68.6% were male, 8.4% had TB symptoms and 88.0% were on ART. The overall proportion of patients with urine LF-LAM positive results was 6.4%. Among PLHIV with CD4≤100 cells/mm3, the positivity was 43.0% and 7.7% in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Among PLHIV with a CD4>100 cells/mm3, the positivity was 26.7% and 2.7% in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients respectively. Urine LF-LAM positivity was higher among inpatients, ART naïve, patients on treatment for <6 months, symptomatic and in WHO clinical stage III/IV of HIV disease as compared to the reference categories. We detected an additional 131 TB cases with urine LF-LAM in combination with the standard diagnostic tests.The study demonstrated the utility of urine LF-LAM for TB diagnosis among AHD patients and the simple, user-friendly test was acceptable as part of routine care. Inclusion of urine LF-LAM test in the current diagnostic algorithm may facilitate early TB diagnosis among AHD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4295786299,"Introduction Shortages of human resources in radiation emergency medicine (REM) caused by the anxiety and stress of due to working in REM, are a major concern. The present study aimed to quantify stress and identify which tasks involved in REM response are most stressful to help educate (human resource development) and effectively reduce stress in workers. Furthermore, the final goal was to reduce the anxiety and stress of medical personnel in the future, which will lead to sufficient human resources in the field of REM. Methods In total, 74 nurses who attended an REM seminar were asked to answer a questionnaire (subjective) survey and wear a shirt-type electrocardiogram (objective survey). Then, informed consent was obtained from 39 patients included in the analysis. In the objective survey, average stress values of participants for each activity during the seminar were calculated based on heart rate variability (HRV). The average stress value was output as stress on a relative scale of 0–100, based on the model which is the percentile of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio derived from HRV at any point in time obtained over time. Results A total of 35 (89.7%) participants answered that they had little or no knowledge of nuclear disaster and 33 (84.6%) had more than moderate anxiety. Stress values observed during the decontamination process were significantly higher than those observed when wearing and removing protective gear and during the general medical treatment process ( P = 0.001, 0.004, and 0.023, respectively). Stress values did not increase during general medical treatment performed in protective clothing, but increased during the decontamination process, which is the task characteristic of REM. Discussion Stress felt by medical personnel throughout the entire REM response may be effectively reduced by providing careful education/training to reduce stress during the decontamination process. Reducing stress during REM response effectively could contribute to resolving the shortage of human resources in this field."
https://openalex.org/W4295786412,"Morphological and functional comparison of convergently-evolved traits in marsupials and eutherians is an important aspect of studying adaptive divergence in mammals. However, the anatomy of marsupials has been particularly difficult to evaluate for multiple reasons. First, previous studies on marsupial anatomy are often uniformly old and non-exhaustive. Second, muscle identification was historically based on muscle attachment sites, but attachment sites have since been declared insufficient for muscle identification due to extensive interspecific variation. For example, different names have been used for muscles that are now thought to be equivalent among several different species, which causes confusion. Therefore, descriptions of marsupial muscles have been inconsistent among previous studies, and their anatomical knowledge itself needs updating. In this study, the koala was selected as the representative marsupial, in part because koala locomotion may comprise primate (eutherian)-like and marsupial-like mechanics, making it an interesting phylogenetic group for studying adaptive divergence in mammals. Gross dissection of the lower limb muscles (the gluteal and the posterior thigh regions) was performed to permit precise muscle identification. We first resolved discrepancies among previous studies by identifying muscles according to their innervation; this recent, more reliable technique is based on the ontogenetic origin of the muscle, and it allows for comparison with other taxa (i.e., eutherians). We compared our findings with those of other marsupials and arboreal primates and identified traits common to both arboreal primates and marsupials as well as muscle morphological features unique to koalas."
https://openalex.org/W4295786415,"Background Child undernutrition is a challenge in Ethiopia, where morbidity and mortality among children are attributed to it. This study aimed to describe the dietary practices, household food insecurity, and nutritional status of young children in Dale district, Sidama region, southern Ethiopia. We discuss our findings in light of research from the same area 3 to 5 decades ago, and we analyze factors associated with linear growth of young children. Method A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed. Children less than two years old and their primary caretakers (n = 903) were included in this study. Among whom 791 children were aged above six months and 742 children out of 791 provided a 24-hour dietary recall. Interviews capturing other dietary practices, food insecurity, socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and haemoglobin assessments were performed for all. The WHO Child Growth Standards were used to calculate anthropometric indices and to describe stunting (length-for-age z-score &lt;-2). Haemoglobin measures below 11g/dl were defined as low haemoglobin levels (anaemia). Multilevel linear regression was used to identify factors associated with length-for-age z-scores. Result The prevalence of stunting, wasting, and anaemia was 39.5%, 3.9%, and 61.7%, respectively. The majority of children (97%) ate cereals (maize) during the past 24 hours, and 79.6% of households use maize as the main food. Three fourth (75%) of the total households were food insecure ranging from mild to severe food insecurity. Boys were at higher risk of having lower length-for-age z-score than girls (β -0.53; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.78, -0.27). For each month the children grew older, length-for-age z-score decreased slightly (β -0.06; -0.07, -0.04). Household food insecurity scores (β -0.05; -0.08, -0.01) and children haemoglobin levels, (β 0.21; 0.06, 0.35) were also associated with length-for-age z-score among young children. Conclusion Linear growth failure (stunting) was prevalent among young children in the rural Sidama region and the majority of them were also anaemic. Older age, male sex, a lower haemoglobin level in children, and household food insecurity were risk factors of linear growth failure in young children. Maize seems to be the dominant food in this previously ensete dominated area; however, there have been minimal improvements in length-for-age z-score over decades. Strategies to ensure household’s food access and improve the quality of child diets need to be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W4295786568,"Spatial cues can facilitate segregation of target speech from maskers. However, in clinical practice, masked speech understanding is most often evaluated using co-located speech and maskers (i.e., without spatial cues). Many hearing aid centers in France are equipped with five-loudspeaker arrays, allowing masked speech understanding to be measured with spatial cues. It is unclear how hearing status may affect utilization of spatial cues to segregate speech and noise. In this study, speech reception thresholds (SRTs) for target speech in ""diffuse noise"" (target speech from 1 speaker, noise from the remaining 4 speakers) in 297 adult listeners across 9 Audilab hearing centers. Participants were categorized according to pure-tone-average (PTA) thresholds: typically-hearing (TH; ≤ 20 dB HL), mild hearing loss (Mild; >20 ≤ 40 dB HL), moderate hearing loss 1 (Mod-1; >40 ≤ 55 dB HL), and moderate hearing loss 2 (Mod-2; >55 ≤ 65 dB HL). All participants were tested without aided hearing. SRTs in diffuse noise were significantly correlated with PTA thresholds, age at testing, as well as word and phoneme recognition scores in quiet. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that SRTs in diffuse noise were significantly predicted by a combination of PTA threshold and word recognition scores in quiet. SRTs were also measured in co-located and diffuse noise in 65 additional participants. SRTs were significantly lower in diffuse noise than in co-located noise only for the TH and Mild groups; masking release with diffuse noise (relative to co-located noise) was significant only for the TH group. The results are consistent with previous studies that found that hard of hearing listeners have greater difficulty using spatial cues to segregate competing speech. The data suggest that speech understanding in diffuse noise provides additional insight into difficulties that hard of hearing individuals experience in complex listening environments."
