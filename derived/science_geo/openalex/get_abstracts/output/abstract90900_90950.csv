https://openalex.org/W2151938814,"The kinetic parameters of bovine factor X activation by bovine factor IXa have been determined in the absence and presence of Ca2+, thrombin-activated bovine factor VIII (VIIIa), and phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidylserine, 75/25; mol/mol). Factor IXa in the absence of Ca2+, factor VIIIa, and phospholipid is able to catalyze factor X activation. The Km for factor X is 299 microM which is well above its concentration in bovine plasma, about 0.2 microM. The Vmax of factor Xa formation is 0.0022 mol of Xa . min-1 . mol of IXa-1 under these conditions. Addition of Ca2+ has little effect on the kinetic constants of factor X activation by factor IXa. In the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 the Km for factor X is 181 microM, and the Vmax is 0.0105 mol of Xa . min-1 . mol of IXa-1. The presence of 10 microM phospholipid dramatically decreases the Km for factor X to 0.058 microM, and the Vmax becomes 0.0025 mol of Xa . min-1 . mol of IXa-1. The Vmax of factor Xa formation slightly increases when more phospholipid is present in our experiments, and there is a considerable increase of the Km for factor X at higher phospholipid concentrations. Therefore, the Km measured in the presence of phospholipid has to be regarded as an apparent Km. The possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed. For the complete factor X-activating complex (i.e. factor IXa, factor VIIIa, Ca2+, and 10 microM phospholipid) the Km for factor X is 0.0063 microM, and the Vmax is raised 200,000-fold to 500 mol of Xa . min-1 . mol of IXa-1. In order to exert its stimulating effect on factor X activation factor VIII has to be activated with thrombin. Our results show that factor IXa is an enzyme which can activate factor X at a very low rate. The stimulating effect of phospholipid in factor X activation is mainly due to an effect on the Km for factor X, bringing it within the range of the plasma concentration. The stimulatory effect of factor VIIIa is explained by its 200,000-fold increase of the Vmax of factor Xa formation."
https://openalex.org/W1502671196,"In the present work a scheme is presented for the isolation of multiple components of human complement in a functionally and biochemically pure state and with full hemolytic activity. These preparative procedures allow high recovery of milligram and gram quantities of particular complement components from a large pool (2-11 liters) of fresh EDTA plasma in no more than four chromatographic steps. Many components (C3bINA, C5, C3, C1EI, C4, and C9) are recovered functionally pure or highly purified following the first chromatographic step employing DEAE-Sephacel and may be utilized as reagents with no further purification. Prior to anion exchange, individual units of plasma are treated with inhibitors of complement activation and serum proteases, the pooled plasma is fractionated with polyethylene glycol, depleted of plasminogen on Sepharose-lysine, and rapidly ultrafiltered to low ionic strength and high protein concentration. The high degree of resolution of the components on DEAE-Sephacel subsequently obtained is demonstrated by the functional recovery and purification in a representative experiment as indicated (in their order of elution) for the following proteins: C3bINA (24%, 18-fold), C2 (74%, 12-fold), C7 (87%, 14-fold), factor B (55%, 8.7-fold), C8 (50%, 16-fold), C6 (82%, 25-fold), beta 1H (39%, 12-fold), C5 (62%, 111-fold), C3 (99%, 64-fold), C1EI (42%, 135-fold), C9 (80%, 297-fold), and c4 (78%, 164-fold). Other components separated by these procedures include C1q and C4 binding protein. Additional steps described, which demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of this preparative scheme, have allowed isolation of C3, C5, and C7 as pure components with full hemolytic activity as judged by functional, immunochemical, and physicochemical criteria. C8, also isolated as a homogeneous protein, was recovered with partial hemolytic activity. All these components were recovered in high yield and in the purification as indicated: C3 (61%, 103-fold), C5 (24% 1350-fold), C7 (19%, 2260-fold), and C8 (32%, 547-fold). Complement components C6, beta 1H, factor B, and C2 in addition to C3bINA, C1EI, C4, and C9 are recovered partially purified with good activity and are amenable to further purification."

https://openalex.org/W149019623,"Abstract Liposomes which have entrapped the metallochromic dye, arsenazo III, constitute a sensitive assay system for ionophoresis of divalent cations. By this means we have compared known calcium (A23187, ionomycin) with membrane phospholipids, fatty acids, prostanoids, and retinoids. Added at micromolar concentrations to preformed multilamellar liposomes (phosphatidylcholine 7:dicetyl phosphate 2: cholesterol 1) both A23187 and ionomycin, as well as phosphatidic acid and products derived from linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and two eicosatrienoic acids provoked Ca influx (e.g. phosphatidic acid: 0.13 mol of Ca2+/mol of membrane lipid/5 min). A variety of other phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylinositol), fatty acids (e.g. arachidonic acid), prostanoids (e.g. PGE1) retinoids (e.g. retinoic acid), and glyceryl ether phosphorylcholines (platelet-activating factors) were without effect. Phosphatidic acid and oxidized fatty acids translocated divalent cations selectively, demonstrating the same rank order as A23187 or ionomycin: Mn greater than Ca greater than Sr much greater than Mg. Membrane lysis did not contribute to the perceived translocation; the liposomes remained impermeable to EDTA, EGTA, arsenazo III, or Mg. Liposomes with phosphatidic acid or oxidized trienoic acids preincorporated at 1-5 mole % of total lipids also permitted translocation of Ca but not Mg. Reduction of ionophoretic fatty acids or ionomycin with stannous chloride abolished their ionophoretic activity. Release of Ca from liposomes which had entrapped arsenazo III-Ca complexes into a medium rich in EGTA permitted calculation of efflux induced by ionophores, whether these were added to the outside of liposomes or preincorporated. Data suggest that phosphatidic acid and oxidized di- and trienoic fatty acids, which act as calcium in model bilayers, could serve as endogenous ionophores in cells."

The native protein has a molecular weight of 300,000 and is composed of three different subunits with masses of 68,000, 45,000, and 38,500. They are present in equal proportion, suggesting a stoichiometry of alpha 2, beta 2, gamma 2 in the native protein. The amino acid composition reveals a preponderance of acidic amino acid residues. The protein is yellow, having an absorption maximum at 425 nm and a shoulder at 455 nm. Reconstitution of the methyl coenzyme M methylreductase activity was linearly dependent on added component C. Component C has been detected in cell extracts of other methanogens."
https://openalex.org/W2020334067,"We have isolated a sigma-like regulatory protein termed sigma 29 whose synthesis or association with Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase was induced during spore formation. sigma 29 is a sporulation-specific component of RNA polymerase as it was absent in enzyme from an early-blocked sporulation mutant (SpoOA). We have demonstrated specific RNA synthesis by sigma 29-RNA polymerase using as a DNA template a cloned cluster of vegetative and sporulation genes from the purA-cysA region of the B. subtilis chromosome. The pattern of gene recognition by sigma 29-RNA polymerase was distinct from that observed for RNA polymerases containing sigma 55 or sigma 37, species of sigma factor that are present in vegetative cells of B. subtilis. A reconstitution experiment in which purified sigma 29 was added to core RNA polymerase demonstrates that sigma 29 was directly responsible for the altered transcriptional specificity of sporulation RNA polymerase. We propose that sigma 29 is a regulatory protein that controls developmental gene transcription at an early stage of spore formation."
https://openalex.org/W1558686699,"The turnover of phospholipid fatty acid moieties of bone marrow-derived macrophages was analyzed by separate determination of degrading and acylating activities. Acylating activities were followed in intact cells by incubation with excess arachidonic acid and degradation of phospholipids was followed in cells prelabeled with fatty acids. Significant phospholipase A2 activity was detectable only if the reutilization of liberated fatty acid was inhibited , e.g. by p-chloromercuribenzoate. It was of interest that the divalent cation ionophore A 23187 and various antiphlogistic drugs like indomethacin, diclofenac, and acetylsalicylic acid were found to inhibit the acylation reaction. These compounds led to increased levels of free arachidonic acid in stimulated, as well as in unstimulated cells. Increased activities of phospholipase A2 were achieved by treatment with the bivalent cation ionophore A 23187 and with zymosan. The effect of zymosan obtained from various sources was found to be exclusively due to contamination of tee zymosan particles with phospholipase A2 activity. Even when the cellular phospholipase activity was increased by the addition of exogenous phospholipase activity contained in the zymosan particles, degradation of cellular phospholipids was not measurable unless the reacylation was inhibited. These results suggest that in the cells studied, the level of free arachidonic acid is mainly controlled by the activity of the lysophosphatide acyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W1569328494,"Abstract The 75-, 33-, 30-, and 27-kilodalton polypeptide components (linker polypeptides) of the phycobilisome of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus 6301 have been purified and characterized. In 0.6 M NaK phosphate buffer at pH 8, the 33-, 30-, and 27-kilodalton polypeptides assemble phycocyanin into ordered aggregates, whereas the 75-kilodalton polypeptide does not interact with phycocyanin. In the presence of the 33- and 30-kilodalton polypeptides, phycocyanin is assembled into hexameric discs and rods of stacked discs with the ultrastructural characteristics of the rod elements of intact phycobilisomes. Interaction of phycocyanin with only the 27-kilodalton polypeptide leads solely to the formation of discs that do not assemble into rods. Rods formed by interaction of phycocyanin with the 30- and 33-kilodalton polypeptides in the presence of the 27-kilodalton polypeptide are much shorter than those formed in its absence. This suggests that addition to growing rods of discs formed from phycocyanin and the 27-kilodalton polypeptide terminates rod assembly. Ordered structures formed upon interaction of phycocyanin with individual linker polypeptides contain at least 1 eq of linker polypeptide/(alpha beta)6 hexamer of phycocyanin. Complexes of phycocyanin with different linker polypeptides have distinctive spectroscopic properties that suggest a polar energy transfer along rod substructures toward the core. The linker polypeptides show no absorbance in the visible region of the spectrum. Peptide mapping shows that they are not related to each other by proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1505038125,"The glycosphingolipids of meconium of a human O Le(a–b+) secretor have been subjected to structural and immunological characterization. Mass spectrometry, proton NMR spectroscopy, and gas-liquid chromatography were used for chemical analyses, and haemagglutination-inhibition for immunological characterization. The great amounts of glycolipids present also facilitated the analyses of minor species constituting only 1% or less of the total weight of the non-acid glycolipids. Glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide were the dominating glycolipids comprising 15 and 30%, respectively, of the total weight. The diglycosylceramides found were lactosylceramide and digalactosylceramide. The globo series was represented by globotriaosylceramide, small amounts of globotetraosylceramide, part of which had ceramide of phytosphingosine and hydroxy fatty acid, and a minor species of monofucosyl hexaglycosylceramide with an inner globotetraose oligosaccharide. No Forssman or Forssman-like antigen was found. The lacto series, quantitatively approximately 30% of the total weight, was mainly represented by lactotetraosylceramide and H-active, Lea-active, and Leb-active glycolipids with 5-6 sugars based on lactotetraosylceramide. Minor species having 0-3 fucoses in their carbohydrate chains and carrying up to 11 sugar residues were also identified. Great amounts of free ceramides were also found to be typical for this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1503565413,"Proteoglycan synthesis by cultured chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma was examined after treatment with 0.1 mg/ml of cycloheximide which inhibited [3H]serine incorporation into total protein by greater than 90%. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans decreased with nearly first order kinetics (t 1/2 = 96 +/- 6 min) with an accompanying increase in the size of the proteoglycan molecules, primary due to an increase in chondroitin sulfate chain sizes. After 5 h of cycloheximide treatment, when [35S]sulfate incorporation was inhibited by about 90%, addition of 1 mM beta-D-xyloside restored 76% of the incorporation into chondroitin sulfate observed in cultures treated only with xyloside. This suggests that the biochemical pathways for the affected by cycloheximide treatment. Cultures were prelabeled for 15 min with either [3H]serine or [35S]-methionine, and then cycloheximide was added to block further protein synthesis. Both precursors appeared in completed proteoglycan molecules with nearly first order kinetics with t 1/2 values of 92 +/- 8 and 101 +/- 11 min for [3H]serine and [35S]methionine, respectively, values in close agreement with the t 1/2 from the [35S]sulfate data. These results suggest that after cycloheximide treatment, the rate of [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan, after a correction for increases in chondroitin sulfate chain size, was directly proportional to the size of the intracellular pool of core protein. From the steady state rate of proteoglycan synthesis (estimated to be about 80 ng/min/10(6) cells in separate experiments) and a corrected t 1/2 value of 60 min, the amount of precursor core protein can be calculated to be about 500 ng/10(6) cells in these experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2080907649,"Upon heat shock, Drosophila Kc cells still contain normal cellular messenger RNAs in the cytoplasm. The distribution of these 25 degrees C mRNAs between polysomes and the postpolysomal fraction of heat-shocked cells appears unaltered as compared with control cells. The translatability of these normal cellular messages isolated from heat-shocked and non--heat-shocked Kc cells is unaltered when analyzed by in vitro translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In contrast, homologous cell-free translation systems obtained from Kc cells effectively discriminate between the in vitro translation of normal cellular messages and heat-shock--specific mRNAs. In particular, a cell-free system from heat-shocked Drosophila Kc cells almost completely shuts down the translation of 25 degrees C messenger RNA species, whereas the translatability of heat-shock--specific messenger RNA appears to be unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W1507214458,"The antifibrinolytic activity of cytosols obtained from cultured rabbit endothelial cells was studied to determine whether it resulted from the presence of an antiplasmin or an antiactivator. These cytosol preparations inhibited the fibrinolytic activity initiated by some plasminogen activators (e.g. urokinase, rabbit endothelial cell activator), but not others (e.g. activators associated with bovine endothelial cells and Rous sarcoma virus-infected chick embryo fibroblasts), suggesting that inhibition occurred at the level of plasmin formation, not plasmin activity. The fibrinolytic activity of plasmin itself was unaffected by concentrations of cytosol that completely blocked urokinase-mediated fibrinolysis consistent with this conclusion. In addition, the ability of urokinase to cleave 125I-plasminogen into its characteristic activation fragments was inhibited by cytosol in a dose-dependent manner. When urokinase was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, two peaks of activity were detected, corresponding to Mr = 55,000 and 32,000. Urokinase preincubated with cytosol and analyzed in a similar manner demonstrated no activity in any portion of the gel, suggesting that its ability to function as a plasminogen activator was irreversibly lost following its interaction with cytosol. These results indicate that the antifibrinolytic activity of rabbit endothelial cells results from the presence of a molecule or molecules with antiactivator activity. The cellular location and unusual degree of specificity distinguish the endothelial cell inhibitor(s) from antifibrinolytic agents observed in other cells and in plasma and platelets."

https://openalex.org/W2006527420,"The amount of profilactin in platelet extracts made in the absence of free Ca++ ions decreases and the amount of free profilin increases as a consequence of thrombin stimulation. This agrees with the proposed role of profilactin as a microfilament precursor in nonmuscle cells. Filamentous actin in extracts of unstimulated platelets appears partly in large aggregates that contain actin binding protein (ABP) and relatively few other proteins. After stimulation, the amounts of actin and ABP in the aggregates are increased and myosin is also included together with a few additional proteins. When the cells are lysed in the presence of Ca++, aggregation is drastically reduced. The data indicate that filamentous actin depolymerizes rapidly and recombines with available profilin, and that a Ca-specific interaction also occurs between actin and a new protein with molecular weight about 90,000."
https://openalex.org/W2060393008,"The biosynthesis of IgM mu polypeptides was studied in isolated populations of normal B lymphocytes and in various IgM-producing cell lines. Membrane and secretory mu were found to be distinct polypeptide species, with separate biosynthetic intermediates from the translation stage onwards. Various B cell populations express different portions of the two biosynthetic mu pathways. Normal, resting small B lymphocytes do not secrete detectable mu and lack the ater intermediate forms of secretory mu. However, they apparently possess, and translate, secretory mu mRNA, and show earlier secretory mu intermediate protein forms. Resting B cells thus exert posttranslational control over secretory mu expression. Since the later intermediate forms of secretory mu, which are lacking in small B cells, are due to carbohydrate modifications of the mu chain, it is suggested that the carbohydrate portion may be involved in regulating the expression of the secretory mu glycoprotein. In contrast to small B cells, highly differentiated IgM-secreting cells control the expression of membrane mu by a pretranslational mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1529328236,"A new procedure for inducing and purifying endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii was described. The enzyme was found to be induced with high efficiency in culture medium containing Smith-degraded hog gastric mucin, which was prepared from a commercially available starting material. Endo-beta-galactosidase was then purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and affinity chromatography on Sepharose conjugated with the Smith-degraded mucin. The enzyme thus purified by only three steps showed no other glycosidase or protease activities and had higher specific activity compared to the previous method. This new method has a great advantage since the gastric mucin is abundantly available and the efficiency of enzyme production was high without significant induction of exoglycosidase. The hydrolysis of oligosaccharides, glycosphingolipid, and keratansulfate was studied by using this newly purified enzyme. Kinetic data indicate that hydrolyzability of these substrates is largely affected by substrate concentration, enzyme concentration and the structure of substrates. Based on these results, the specificity of E. freundii endo-beta-galactosidase was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1552451187,"Abstract The structure of the branching site of poly(ADP-ribose) was determined as O-alpha-D-ribofuranosyl-(1' leads to 2)-O-alpha-D-ribofuranosyl-(1 leads to 2')-adenosine-5',5,5'-tris(phosphate) by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and 1H-NMR measurements. Thus the structures of all the ribose-ribose linkages known in poly(ADP-ribose) are uniformly alpha(1 leads to 2)glycosidic bond. This indicates that branching ADP-ribosylation and elongating ADP-ribosylation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis are catalyzed by similar alpha(1 leads to 2)-specific ADP-ribosyl transferases or the same enzyme. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, which specifically hydrolyzes the ribose-ribose bonds of poly(ADP-ribose), also cleaves the ribose-ribose-ribose bonds at the site of branching."

https://openalex.org/W2151139122,"A recombinant DNA phage containing a cluster of Drosophila melanogaster tRNA genes has been isolated and analyzed. The insert of this phage has been mapped by in situ hybridization to chromosomal region 50AB, a known tRNA site. Nucleotide sequencing of the entire Drosophila tRNA coding region reveals seven tRNA genes spanning 2.5 kb of chromosomal DNA. This cluster is separated from other tRNA regions on the chromosome by at least 2.7 kb on one side, and 9.6 kb on the other. Two tRNA genes are nearly identical and contain intervening sequences of length 38 and 45 bases, respectively, in the anticodon loop. These two genes are assigned to be tRNALeu genes because of significant sequence homology with yeast tRNA3Leu, and secondary structure homology with yeast tRNA3Leu intervening sequence. In addition, an 8 base sequence (AAAAUCUU) is conserved in the same location in the intervening sequences of Drosophila tRNALeu genes and a yeast tRNA3Leu gene. Similar sequenes occur in all other tRNAs containing intervening sequences. The remaining five genes are identical tRNAIle genes, which are also identical to a tRNAIle gene from chromosomal region 42A. The 5' flanking regions are only weakly homologous, but each set of isoacceptors contains short regions of strong homology approximately 20 nucleotides preceding the tRNA coding sequences: GCNTTTTG preceding tRNAIle genes; and GANTTTGG preceding tRNALeu genes. The genes are irregularly distributed on both DNA strands; spacing regions are divergent in sequence and length."
https://openalex.org/W1527740648,"Radioiodinated apolipoprotein E, added in small amounts to rat serum, rapidly associates with the serum very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins in proportion to their content of endogenous and apolipoprotein E. The labeled lipoproteins can be separated, without ultracentrifugation, by molecular sieve chromatography. When these labeled lipoproteins are injected intravenously into intact rats, the labeled apolipoprotein E rapidly exchanges with apolipoprotein E in the alternate lipoprotein fraction and is removed from the blood at a slow rate, comparable to that observed for apolipoprotein A-I in similarly labeled high density lipoproteins. No evidence was found for a rapidly turning over component of high density lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein E. When very low density lipoproteins, labeled endogenously with [3H]cholesterol and with radioiodinated apolipoprotein E, are added to perfusates of isolated rat livers, the labeled cholesteryl esters and apolipoprotein E are removed from the perfusate rapidly and at the same rate. Therefore, the slow removal of labeled apolipoprotein E in very low density lipoproteins in vivo is the result of rapid exchange with apolipoprotein E in high density lipoproteins."

The purified components had different amino acid compositions and antigenicities, and the toxicity of the toxin was neutralized completely by either anti-heavy chain Fab or anti-light chain Fab. the two components could be reconstituted to form an active molecule with recovered toxicity which varied according to the method used. Maximum recovery was obtained in a system in which the intersubunit S--S bond was first formed in the presence of high concentration of neutral salts, after which the concentration of salt was gradually decreased. The reconstituted preparation was highly toxic and had the same properties as the parental toxin on chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. By the use of three perturbants, the fractions of exposed tryptophans and tyrosines of the preparation were found to be almost the same as that of the parental toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1588731527,"Abstract The reading of glutamine and lysine codons during protein synthesis in vitro has been investigated using an MS2-RNA-programed system derived from Escherichia coli. Under conditions when either glutaminyl-tRNA1Gln (s2UUG) or glutaminyl-tRNA2Gln (CUG) was the only source of glutamine for protein synthesis both tRNAs were able to read the glutamine codons CAA and CAG as indicated by the incorporation of labeled glutamine into the pertinent coat protein tryptic peptides. On the other hand, when the glutamine tRNAs competed for the codon CAA the reading efficiency of the anticodon s2UUG, which reads the codon according to the wobble rules, was almost 40 times higher than that of the competing anticodon CUG, which reads the codon by two out of three, i.e. it cannot form a regular base pair with the third codon position. In reading the codon CAG the anticodon CUG was approximately eight times more efficient than the anticodon s2UUG. The lysyl-tRNA1Lys (CUU) could not alone sustain any detectable coat protein synthesis in the MS2 system indicating that there was no significant reading of the lysine codon AAA. This conclusion is supported by the outcome of experiments where lysyl-tRNA1Lys (CUU) and lysyl-tRNA2Lys (s2UUU) competed for the codon AAA. The reading efficiency of the anticodon CUU was less than 1% of that of the competing s2UUU which represents the limit of resolution of our experimental system. When the lysine tRNAs competed for the codon AAG the anticodon CUU was about four times more efficient than s2UUU. These results are discussed in the context of the out of three hypothesis, which attempts to relate the frequency of such reading to the hydrogen bonding properties of the codon nucleotides."

The enzyme is a glycoprotein with 11% by weight carbohydrate, which seems to have only asparagine-N-acetylglucosamine linkage-type carbohydrate chains.

This enzyme, the only histone acetylase detected in these extracts, acetylates only histone H4. All of the acetate groups are introduced within the NH2-terminal amino acids 4 to 17. This 14-residue peptide contains the four lysines which are acetylated in vivo. The acetylase is inhibited by its substrate, histone H4, and by several highly charged polymers including polylysine, polyarginine, DNA, RNA, and polyglutamic acid. It is not inhibited by polyethyleneimine, spermine, or the other histones H2A, H2B, H3, or H1. The enzyme does not acetylate H4 which is in chromatin. This enzyme is most likely involved in the acetylation of newly synthesized histones in the cytoplasm prior to chromatin assembly."

A sample of bovine alpha-lactalbumin was acetylated with a trace amount of high specific activity [3H]acetic anhydride to produce a population of protein molecules essentially all of which contain 0 to 1 acetyl group; partial labeling of all 13 amino groups was obtained. This material was mixed with bovine colostrum galactosyltransferase in the presence of Mn2+, UDP-glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine, at pH 8.0, to promote complex formation and was cross-linked with dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate. Covalently cross-linked alpha-lactalbumin-galactosyltransferase (1:1) complex with characteristic enzymic and other properties was purified from the reaction mixture, and the distribution of [3H]acetyl label on each amino group of the alpha-lactalbumin component was determined, using procedures similar to those described in previous differential labeling studies (Richardson, R., and Brew, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3377-3385). In comparison with the original labeled sample used for cross-linking, the specific activity of tritium label in 10 amino groups showed little change, whereas the labeling of three groups was changed markedly. The acetyl moiety on the epsilon-amino groups of lysines 5 and 108 showed major decreases in specific activity while that of lysine 114 was greatly increased. Similar results were obtained when the cross-linking was performed under different conditions of temperature, and cross-linker concentration. As the changes in lysines 5 and 114 are similar to those observed in differential labeling, they are attributed to alterations in the affinity for galactosyltransferase resulting from acetylation of these groups. In contrast, lysine 108, which is not sufficiently close to the interaction site to be perturbed in differential labeling studies but is greatly decreased in tritium content in the cross-linked complex, appears to represent the major site through which alpha-lactalbumin is cross-linked to galactosyltransferase as a result of the exclusion of protein molecules acetylated in this position from covalent cross-linking. Studies with a homologous series of bisimidoesters indicate that lysine 108 is situated 6.1 to 7.3 A degrees from an amino group on galactosyltransferase in the cross-linked complex. The general utility of the procedure and the nature of the interaction site in lactose synthase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W77806421,"The effect of Ca2+ ions on carbamoylphosphate synthetase (ammonia) (EC 6.3.4.16) of rat liver mitochondria was studied. In lysed mitochondria, carbamoylphosphate synthetase (ammonia) was inhibited by Ca2+ ions. In intact rat liver mitochondria, the rate of citrulline production from added ammonia, ornithine, and bicarbonate was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the intramitochondrial concentration of Ca2+. This effect was found at concentrations of Ca2+ which are within the physiological range. The inhibition was reversed by added Mg2+ and was not due to effects of Ca2+ on mitochondrial energy production. It is proposed that the activity of carbamoylphosphate synthetase (ammonia) may be modulated in vivo by changes in the concentration of Ca2+ ions in the mitochondrial matrix."

Purified acridine does not produce similar duplications of cricket heads or head structures nor do the substituted acridines proflavine, acriflavine, or acridine orange. A dose-response relation exists such that the number and severity of abnormalities increase with increasing concentration of the teratogen."
https://openalex.org/W2277049898,"The absorption spectrum of antibiotic X5108, the N-methylated derivative of kirromycin, has been found to be decreased in intensity on binding to elongation factor (EF)-Tu . GDP, EF-Tu . GTP, and nucleotide-free EF-Tu. This has allowed the binding of X5108 to be studied directly. In agreement with previous studies, a 1:1 stoichiometry is observed, with a dissociation constant of less than 1 microM. Identical results were obtained with all three EF-Tu species. The absorption spectrum of X5108 in increasing concentrations of isopropyl alcohol first intensifies and then decreases, 80% isopropyl alcohol giving the same spectrum as that of X5108 bound to EF-Tu. This result is interpreted as showing that the chromophoric moiety of X5108 is bound in a highly hydrophobic environment on EF-Tu. The rate of binding of X5108 to EF-Tu . GDP was measured using a stopped flow spectrophotometer. This rate was proportional to the concentration of X5108, giving a second order binding rate constant of 4.8 X 10(3) M-1 s-1. Since this is several orders of magnitude too slow for a diffusion-controlled reaction, the results are interpreted based on a two-step binding process. A half-time of about 10 min is calculated for the dissociation of X5108 from EF-Tu . GDP. The fact that X5108 bound to EF-Tu is not in rapid equilibrium with X5108 free in solution needs to be considered in studies on the effect of X5108 and kirromycin on partial reactions of protein biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1592877796,"An IgG heteropolymer containing rheumatoid factor activity was isolated from the serum of a patient with the polyclonal hyperviscosity syndrome. This aggregating system was characterized using ultracentrifugation, classical light scattering, and rheological methods. The degree of polymerization is shown to be reversible and dependent on both pH and concentration. Light-scattering studies show a minimum stable intermediate consisting of four IgG monomers to exist at pH 7.4. The theoretical intrinsic viscosity and radius of gyration for the feasible configurations of such a tetramer were calculated. These models were compared to the experimental values. A cyclic structure is shown to be most compatible with the experimental data. Immunochemical analysis suggests that each tetramer contains two IgG1 rheumatoid factors binding to determinants on IgG3 Fc regions."

https://openalex.org/W1526681077,"A protein that exhibits ferroactivator activity with purified rat liver P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine erythrocytes. The homogeneous protein has a molecular weight of 82,000 by high speed sedimentation equilibrium and 90,000 by gel exclusion chromatography. A subunit molecular weight of 22,500 was obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its isoelectric focusing indicated that the ferroactivator protein has an isoelectric point at pH 5.7. The reduced pyridine hemochrome of the denatured protein shows absorption maxima at 419, 527, and 557 nm which is characteristic of protoheme IX. The native protein is green in color with absorption maxima at 407, 507, and 543 nm. The amino acid composition and immunological studies show that bovine erythrocyte protein is structurally similar to the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase ferroactivator protein isolated from rat liver. Its function in the erythrocyte is unknown."
