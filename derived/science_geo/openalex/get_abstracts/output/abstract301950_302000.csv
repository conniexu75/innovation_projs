https://openalex.org/W2005732925,The Department of Energy's program for disposing of high-level radioactive wastes has been impeded by overwhelming political opposition fueled by public perceptions of risk. Analysis of these perceptions shows them to be deeply rooted in images of fear and dread that have been present since the discovery of radioactivity. The development and use of nuclear weapons linked these images to reality and the mishandling of radioactive wastes from the nation's military weapons facilities has contributed toward creating a profound state of distrust that cannot be erased quickly or easily. Postponing the permanent repository and employing dry-cask storage of wastes on site would provide the time necessary for difficult social and political issues to be resolved.

For A = K, Rb, and Cs, phase separation is observed with the spectra of C60, K3C60, K6C60, Rb3C60, Rb6C60, and Cs6C60 phases reported. The x = 3 phases show only three Raman active modes: two of Ag symmetry and only the lowest frequency Hg mode. The other Hg modes regain intensity in the x = 6 films, with several mode splittings observed. For A = Na, such phase separation is not clearly observed, and reduced mode shifts are interpreted as due to incomplete charge transfer in these films."

Calibrated accelerator radiocarbon dates on charcoal, shell, and pottery and a thermoluminescence date on pottery from the site fall from about 8000 to 7000 years before the present. The early fishing village is part of a long prehistoric trajectory that contradicts theories that resource poverty limited cultural evolution in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2005361046,"Analysis of globally disordered, nonequilibrium ""labyrinthine"" stripe-domain patterns in thin ferrimagnetic garnet films has revealed a well-defined local structure containing an oblong polygonal plaquette as the fundamental motif. Two types of labyrinths were found: one having topological defects, the other composed of a single, unbranched, meandering line. These patterns emerge when the labyrinthine state is approached either by heating at constant magnetic field or by demagnetizing from saturation at constant temperature. Size and aspect ratios of the oblong polygonal plaquettes prove to be independent of the choice of these two mutually orthogonal trajectories within the phase diagram, which is surprising in view of the different mechanisms and concomitant topological constraints governing the evolution of disorder. The significance of this unique local structure is discussed in the general context of defectmediated melting of two-dimensional stripe phases."
https://openalex.org/W2045970030,"Tunneling spectroscopy has been used to characterize the magnitude and temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap (triangle up) for K(3)C(60) and Rb(3)C(60). At low temperature the reduced energy gap, 2triangle upkappaT(c) (where T(c) is the transition temperature) has a value of 5.3 +/- 0.2 and 5.2 +/- 0.3 for K(3)C(60) and Rb(3)C(60), respectively. The magnitude of the reduced gap for these materials is significantly larger than the value of 3.53 predicted by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Hence, these results show that the pair-coupling interaction is strong in the M(3)C(60) superconductors. In addition, measurements of triangle up(T) for both K(3)C(60) and Rb(3)C(60) exhibit a similar mean-field temperature dependence. The characterization of triangle up and triangle up(T) for K(3)C(60) and Rb(3)C(60) provides essential constraints for theories evolving to describe superconductivity in the M(3)C(60) materials."
https://openalex.org/W4243664506,"Optical technologies are becoming increasingly important in areas that were traditionally the domain of electronics. This trend is likely to continue into the foreseeable future with optics and electronics being integral, mutually compatible components of systems for consumer markets, industry, and defense. The basis of this progress is the development of materials that have the required purity, physical properties, and optical quality; glass fibers for optical transmission, semiconductors for lasers and detectors, and nonlinear materials for optical switching are examples. In this article, some of the materials of choice for a variety of applications are described and the frontiers of materials research for new areas of opportunity are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on optical materials for the transmission and processing of information."
https://openalex.org/W1967635125,A brief historical perspective and a review of the current research on amorphous or glassy materials are presented. Glass formation by natural processes and by laboratory synthesis techniques is described. Recent efforts to characterize and model the atomic scale structure of amorphous phases are surveyed. The relation between amorphous and liquid states is emphasized in a discussion of thermodynamics and kinetics. The topic of crystal-to-glass transformation in the solid state and the related issue of crystal stability and melting are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2079298410,"In this commentary, the author considers the effort to save sea otters after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Despite immense expenditures, the emerging facts lead to two conclusions: population losses were poorly documented, and few animals were saved. These findings cast doubt on our ability to protect sea otters from future spills and lead to troubling questions about how to recognize and document the effects of catastrophic events, and, ultimately, the utility of highly visible and expensive efforts to save wildlife from perceived environmental catastrophes. On 24 March 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in northeastern Prince William Sound, spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude oil. Catastrophic losses were expected and a monumental effort was made to save sea otters. The Exxon Valdez spill spread over a linear distance of more than 700 kilometers and soiled an estimated 5,300 kilometers of shoreline. While cleaning up and capturing oiled wildlife for rehabilitation, 878 sea otter carcasses were recovered - a minimal estimate of loss. However, many animals killed by the spill undoubtedly were not found. Losses have been estimated from pre- and post-spill surveys, although these surveys shed little light on the population-level effect, mainly becausemore » the size and distribution of the population just prior to the spill is poorly known. This is because a comprehensive survey of Prince William Sound and adjacent waters was not done immediately after the spill but before oil dispersed into southwestern Prince William Sound and the northern Gulf of Alaska. Thus, although the Exxon Valdez spill undoubtedly killed many sea otters and may have reduced populations substantially, available data lack the power to demonstrate population changes.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2066507162,"The ability to artificially structure new materials on an atomic scale by using advanced crystal growth methods such as molecular beam epitaxy and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition has recently led to the observation of unexpected new physical phenomena and to the creation of entirely new classes of devices. In particular, the growth of materials of variable band gap in technologically important semiconductors such as GaAs, InP, and silicon will be reviewed. Recent results of studies of multilayered structures and interfaces based on the use of advanced characterization techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy will be presented."
https://openalex.org/W2012259486,"Some of the important ingredients used in theoretical investigations of the electronic properties of materials are delineated by means of examples. The importance of examining the physical behavior of related materials is emphasized as a means of establishing the credibility of theoretical explanations. Since the ability to deal realistically with complex technologically important materials is limited by analytic and computational capabilities, theories for materials science must aim at the development of comprehensive and predictive models based on physically motivated approximations. The emergence of such models and their ability to describe a broad range of properties foreshadows an increasingly important role of theoretical analysis in the future development of the field."

https://openalex.org/W2092195261,"A historical perspective on the development of physical metallurgy is presented. Two recent advances in the control of microstructure, rapid solidification and artificial multilayers, are discussed. Rapid solidification has produced metallic glasses and metastable crystalline systems, and has led to important technological and scientific discoveries. The synthesis of artificial multilayers by direct deposition represents the ultimate control of such microstructures."
