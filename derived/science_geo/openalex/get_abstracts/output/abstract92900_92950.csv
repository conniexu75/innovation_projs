https://openalex.org/W1979637191,"Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is a human type-C RNA tumor virus (retrovirus) previously identified in and isolated from several patients with T-cell leukemias or lymphomas. The known virus isolates from the United States and Japan are closely related and are found in adults with an acute malignancy of mature T cells. A related retrovirus has been found in a patient (Mo) with a somewhat different disease (a T-cell variant of relatively benign hairy cell leukemia). Serum from Mo contains antibodies to the major internal core protein (p24) of HTLV. A T-cell line established from the spleen of Mo expresses HTLV antigens. However, HTLV from Mo is significantly different from all previous HTLV isolates in immunological cross-reactivity tests of p24. The usual prototype HTLV isolate is represented as HTLV-I, and the HTLV from Mo is represented as HTLV-II. Individual members of each subgroup may then be identified by subscript initials of the patient [for example, HTLV-I(CR), HTLV-I(MB), and HTLV-II(Mo)]."
https://openalex.org/W2004106131,"Four distinct surface molecules on human T cells are defined by the monoclonal antibodies anti-T1, anti-T3 (anti-T3A), anti-T11 and anti-T12. Following cell binding, anti-T3 (anti-T3A) and anti-T1 induce independent modulation of their respective ligands, whereas anti-T11 and anti-T12 do not. To explore the biological consequences of this modulation, we used cloned populations of T4 and T8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Anti-T3 (anti-T3A), but not anti-T1, inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyte effector function by T4 and T8 clones as well as antigen-specific T cell recognition. The latter is not secondary to a generalized inhibitory effect since responsiveness to interleukin 2 is maintained. Moreover, after modulation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes recover cytolytic function in parallel with reexpression of surface T3 molecules. We provide evidence for a direct linkage between antigen recognition by T lymphocytes and surface expression of the T3 molecular complex."

The monoclonal antibodies bound to a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44,000 (Pb44), which envelopes the surface membrane of sporozoites. Incubation of sporozoites in vitro with antibodies to Pb44 abolished their infectivity."

https://openalex.org/W1964810688,Ictal patterns of local cerebral metabolic rate have been studied in epileptic patients by positron computed tomography with 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Partial seizures were associated with activation of anatomic structures unique to each patient studied. Ictal increases and decreases in local cerebral metabolism were observed. Scans performed during generalized convulsions induced by electroshock demonstrated a diffuse ictal increase and postictal decrease in cerebral metabolism. Petit mal absences were associated with a diffuse increase in cerebral metabolic rate. The ictal fluorodeoxyglucose patterns obtained from patients do not resemble autoradiographic patterns obtained from common experimental animal models of epilepsy.
https://openalex.org/W1989749109,"Cloned human cytotoxic T lymphocytes and monoclonal antibodies inhibiting their function (anti-T3A, anti-T4A, and anti-T8A) were used to elucidate the role of T cell surface glycoproteins in cell-mediated lympholysis involving individual classes of gene products of the major histocompatibility complex on target cells. The results indicate that several surface molecules are required for specific target recognition: T3 and T4 on T4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and T3 and T8 on T8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2016832835,"A 606 base pair segment of adenovirus type 2 DNA which includes the gene for polypeptide IX and its flanking regions has been sequenced. Comparison with the sequence of a cDNA copy of the 9S mRNA for polypeptide IX and direct analysis of its capped oligonucleotide show that the gene and its mRNA are colinear. The 9S mRNA has a length of 485 nucleotides, excluding the poly(A) tract and the m7G of the cap, and contains one single open translational reading frame which is sufficiently long to encode polypeptide IX. This reading frame contains three AUG codons, the first of which is used for initiation of protein synthesis. The mRNA has a 5' noncoding region of 24 nucleotides, excluding the m5G of the cap, and encodes a polypeptide which is 139 amino acids long and unusually rich in serine and alanine. The sequence TATATAA is found 25 nucleotides upstream from the cap site. The polyadenylation site has been identified but cannot be located unambiguously because of the presence of two A residues in the DNA sequence at this position. The 3' noncoding region is 41--43 nucleotides long and contains the hexanucleotide sequence AAUAAA. The mRNA for polypeptide IVa2 is encoded adjacent to that for polypeptide IX and is transcribed in the opposite direction. Sequence analysis revealed an overlap of 11--16 nucleotides, depending on the precise location of the polyadenylation sites, between 3' ends of these mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2075917639,"In concentrates of water produced in a laboratory simulation of a drinking water treatment process, direct-acting, nonvolatile mutagens were readily detected by means of the Ames Salmonella test. The mutagens were shown to be produced by the chlorination process. Treatment of the water with chloramine resulted in less mutagenic activity than treatment with free chlorine. Dechlorination of drinking water with sulfite sharply reduced the mutagenic activity. Treatment with sulfur dioxide is proposed as an effective, inexpensive method of reducing the direct-acting mutagenic activity of drinking water and of aqueous industrial effluents."

https://openalex.org/W1600647072,"CSF-1 is a glycoprotein growth factor which specifically stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage. In this study, microgram amounts of radiolabeled murine L-cell and human urinary CSF-1 were isolated in pure form and used to investigate the nature and extent of CSF-1 glycosylation and the requirement of the carbohydrate moiety for its biological and antibody-binding activities. The molecular weight of the preparations examined varied between approximately 47,000 and approximately 76,000. Reduction and alkylation halved the molecular weight of all preparations, reflecting within each the existence of two similar subunits. Exhaustive treatment of reduced and alkylated CSF-1 with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D, but not endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, gave rise to a molecule of Mr approximately 16,500 of which the polypeptide portion accounted for approximately 15,500. Whereas the parent molecule bound concanavalin A, the product did not, indicating that heterogeneity in the saccharide component could explain the observed variation in the molecular weight of CSF-1. These results also suggest that the two polypeptide chains in the dimeric CSF-1 molecule are very similar and possibly even identical. Because of the specificity of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D, it is concluded that the carbohydrate moieties are Asn-linked complex-type units. Examination of the effects of endo-alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminidase treatment on the molecular weight of reduced and alkylated CSF-1 failed to provide evidence for the existence of O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. Treatment of native CSF-1 with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D was almost as efficient in removing carbohydrate as in the case of the reduced and alkylated subunits. Removal did not cause loss of antibody binding, receptor binding, or biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1607666211,"The molecular basis for deficiency of beta-globin synthesis in beta-thalassemia was investigated by gene cloning and DNA sequencing. beta-Globin genes of two patients with beta 0-thalassemia were cloned in a phage lambda vector. Both beta-genes transcribed normally in vitro. The gene of an Italian individual had a single nucleotide substitution (C leads to T) in the codon for amino acid 39 that resulted in formation of a nonsense codon. In a Turkish individual, the cloned beta-globin gene had a dinucleotide deletion in the codon for amino acid 8. This frameshift mutation produced a termination codon at the position of the new 21st codon. Mutations that lead to premature termination of beta-globin synthesis appear to be among the common causes of beta 0-thalassemia in man."
https://openalex.org/W1629531300,"A partially purified preparation of a transforming growth factor (TGF) obtained from serum-free growth medium conditioned by a human melanoma tumor line was found to stimulate the phosphorylation of a synthetic tyrosine-containing peptide. The sequence of the peptide is related to that of the known site of tyrosine phosphorylation in the Rous sarcoma virus-encoded transforming protein, pp60src. In A431 membranes, the characteristics of TGF- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated peptide phosphorylation are nearly identical. The effects of the two growth factors are not additive, suggesting that TGF and EGF stimulate peptide phosphorylation through the same EGF receptor system. This conclusion is supported by the finding that both TGF and EGF stimulate peptide phosphorylation in wild type Swiss 3T3 cell membranes, but neither factor is effective in stimulating peptide phosphorylation in membranes prepared from EGF receptor-deficient NR6 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1774028102,"The structural gene for ompA protein, a major outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli, was cloned using the plasmid cloning vehicle, pMF21. The DNA sequence corresponding to the signal peptide of pro-ompA protein, a secretory precursor of ompA protein, was determined. The amino acid sequence of the signal peptide was deduced from the DNA sequence as follows: Met-Lys-Lys-Thr-Ala-Ile-Ala-Ile-Ala-Val-Ala-Leu-Ala-Gly-Phe-Ala-Thr-Val-Ala-Gin-Ala-. The amino acid sequence complies with all the features of the loop model proposed for the mechanism of protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1536883391,"Fractionation of the highly soluble collagens released during limited pepsin digestion of whole human placenta has resulted in the isolation of a unique collagenous fraction comprised exclusively of high molecular weight aggregates. On reduction and alkylation, the aggregates dissociated yielding collagen-like polypeptides with an apparent Mr = 40,000 as well as a heterogeneous mixture of much smaller noncollagenous peptides. Ion exchange chromatography of the collagen-like, 40,000-dalton subunits results in recovery of a single relatively acidic component and a mixture of at least two relatively basic components. Both the basic and acidic components contain large amounts of cysteine, hydroxylysine glycosides, and glucosamine, and exhibit compositional features indicative of the presence of collagenous and noncollagenous domains. These unusual features have been verified for the more acidic component through isolation of its major cyanogen bromide cleavage products. Characterization of the cyanogen bromide fragments further indicated that this particular subunit is characterized by alternating collagenous and noncollagenous domains as opposed to a lengthy collagenous domain which is either preceded or followed by noncollagenous sequences. The molecular organization and possible derivation of these unique pepsin-resistant collagenous components is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483906344,"The regulation of ferritin synthesis by iron was examined in the reticulocytes of bullfrog tadpoles where the induction was 40- to 50-fold, increasing from 0.17 +/- 0.05% of total protein synthesis ([3H]leucine incorporation in cell suspension) to 7.4 +/- 1.6% following intraperitoneal injection of ferric ammonium citrate. No significant difference was observed between the levels of ferritin mRNA in control or iron-induced cells, determined by translation of isolated mRNA in a wheat germ system, demonstrating that ferritin induction by iron occurs by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Total protein synthesis in the wheat germ system was half-saturating at 10 micrograms of mRNA/ml whereas ferritin synthesis increased linearly up to 40 micrograms of mRNA/ml, demonstrating that the ferritin mRNA is translated with high efficiency relative to the total proteins synthesized. Studies with the cap analogue 7-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate, suggest that cap binding is not directly involved in the high translational efficiency of the ferritin mRNA in the wheat germ system. The results indicate that iron-modulated changes in the availability of ferritin mRNA for translation, coupled with the high translational efficiency of the ferritin message, can account for the induction of ferritin synthesis by iron in embryonic erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981144690,"Mouse and human placental tissue contains a large number of mononuclear phagocytes. These cells, isolated from placenta, were shown to produce the multifaceted immune factor interleukin-1. Activity in the supernatants of 48-hour mononuclear phagocyte cultures was associated with a 12,000- to 18,000-dalton protein, consistent with known interleukin-1 characteristics. Stimulation of phagocytosis with latex beads increased the production and release of interleukin-1 from these placental cells, which may be a useful source of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2064570421,"Two filamentous phage gene products are required for the replication of phage DNA. One of these, the gene II protein, is a site-specific endonuclease required for all phage-specific DNA synthesis. The other, the gene V protein, is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein required only for single-strand synthesis. Purified gene V protein, when added to an in vitro protein synthesizing system programmed by f1 DNA, specifically inhibits the synthesis of gene II protein. Inhibition seems to be translational, since synthesis of gene II protein from an RNA template is also inhibited by gene V protein. Gene V protein control of gene II expression can account for the regulation of the level of expression of the filamentous phage genome."
https://openalex.org/W1586828328,"The potassium/proton antiport system of Escherichia coli has been characterized by the effect of monovalent cations on the pH gradient formed by oxidation of lactate in everted membrane vesicles. Substrates of the system include K+, Na+, Li+, Rb+, and Tl+. The antiporter could also be assayed by uptake of 204Tl+ into everted vesicles. The antiporter exhibits a basic pH optimum and catalyzes electroneutral proton/cation exchange. Antiporter activity is trypsin-sensitive, but trypsin inactivation is prevented by prior formation of an electrochemical proton gradient. Two other proton/cation exchangers, the Na+/H+ and Ca2+/H+ antiporters, were unaffected by the trypsin treatment. Regulation of cytosolic pH by K+/H+ exchange is postulated, where proton return to the cytosol by the K+/H+ antiporter prevents alkalinization of the cytosol during proton extrusion associated with the formation of a protonmotive force or during growth at alkaline pH."

https://openalex.org/W1859995617,"We show that phenylalanine is able to control the extent of activation and, as a result, the catalytic activity of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase in vivo, in perfused liver, and in vitro. Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated enzyme activities are controlled by phenylalanine activation and, overall, this mechanism appears to be a major means of regulating the enzyme's activity in rat liver. At normal phenylalanine levels in vivo, phenylalanine hydroxylase is at most 1-4% activated, and phosphorylated enzyme (glucagon-induced) appears at most 5-7% activated under similar conditions. In both cases, a phenylalanine load increased the percentage of activated enzyme found in vivo to about 40% of maximal. In perfused rat livers, a plasma phenylalanine concentration of only 4 times normal induced a 4-fold increase in the amount of activated enzyme present and a corresponding functional increase in the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation by the tissue. Under the latter conditions, more than 25% of the amino acid could be hydroxylated in a single pass through the organ. Purified phosphorylated phenylalanine hydroxylase must be activated to be catalytically active. The activation with phenylalanine, at equilibrium, is a cooperative process, and the phosphorylated enzyme is activated more rapidly at pH 6.8 and 8.0 and at lower phenylalanine concentration than the unphosphorylated species. Overall, phosphorylation appears to allow phenylalanine hydroxylase to be more easily activated at relatively low phenylalanine concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1562644461,"Ferrochelatase (protohaem ferro-lyase EC 4.99.1.1) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the facultative photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. The enzyme has been purified 1,640-fold with 43% recovery from isolated membrane fragments. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 115,000 as estimated by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography through Sephadex G-150 in the presence of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The purification procedure involves solubilization of ferrochelatase with sodium deoxycholate off of salt-washed membranes, followed by ammonium sulfate fraction, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, followed by chromatography on Amicon dye matrix blue B, and finally Sephadex G-150. The enzyme has an extinction coefficient of 90,000 at 278 nm, and the absorption spectrum reveals no chromophoric cofactors. Purified ferrochelatase is inhibited by iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, Hg, Pb, Cu, and hemin. The apparent Km values are for mesoporphyrin IX, 20 microM; deuteroporphyrin IX, 95 microM; and iron, 20 microM."

A complex of P37 and RNA polymerase can be isolated by sedimentation through a glycerol gradient. The complex is dissociated at the ionic strength of 0.9. The preferential binding of P37 with RNA polymerase form BI (with the unproteolyzed B220 subunit) was visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. Kinetic analysis of the RNA polymerase cofactor interaction indicated that the dissociation constant for the complex is 5 X 10(-8) M."

https://openalex.org/W1974673562,"A basic B-cell-specific protein of 35,000 daltons (XM1) is expressed at a high rate--comparable to actin--in resting splenic B lymphocytes of various species. Splenic or thymic T cells or fibroblasts do not express this protein. Upon polyclonal stimulation of B lymphocytes or in proliferating B-lymphocyte-derived cell lines, the synthesis of XM1 is switched off, but it is reinduced by agents that arrest replication, such as mitomycin C, hydroxyurea, ultraviolet light or gamma irradiation. Induction of XM1 after mutagen treatment is fast; the synthesis is regulated on the level of transcription or RNA processing. XM1 is turned over with half-life of less than 2 hr. XM1 is glycosylated. From compartment analysis and Triton solubilization it appears that XM1 is bound to the nuclear membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1500286375,"An activity dependent on an intact bacteriophage T4 gene 61 is required, along with the T4 gene 41 protein, for the synthesis of ribonucleotide primers in an in vitro T4 DNA replication system. In this paper, we present a method for purification of the protein catalyzing this gene 61-dependent activity based on an assay for primer-dependent DNA synthesis by the T4 DNA replication proteins. The T4 gene 32 helix-destabilizing protein influences the chromatographic behavior of 61 protein. The purification of 61 protein to near homogeneity by the scheme presented requires the presence of 32 protein in crude extracts. The isolated 61 protein is basic, with a molecular weight of 44,000, and is active as a monomer. Ribonucleotide primer synthesis shows a linear dependence on 61 protein concentration, but a sigmoidal dependence on 41 protein concentration. The dependence on 41 protein concentration is linear, however, if the 41 protein is first activated by incubation at high concentration in the presence of rGTP. Using this activated 41 protein and purified 61 protein, we show a stoichiometric relationship between the two proteins in the priming reaction consistent with the existence of a priming complex comprising an oligomer of 41 protein and a 61 protein monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1982590596,"Inducer T lymphocytes synthesize and secrete peptides that stimulate growth and differentiation of many cell types, including lymphocytes and monocytes that kill foreign organisms, B lymphocytes, mast cells and hematopoietic precursor cells. To define these inducer molecules more precisely, we have generated clones of these T cells as a source of homogeneous material for biochemical analysis. These clones synthesize peptides that stimulate T and B cells to divide and that also induce the latter cells to secrete immunoglobulin. Inducer cells synthesize a 14 kilodalton growth polypeptide that stimulates T and B lymphocytes, as well as other cell types, to divide. This 14 kilodalton peptide is normally associated with different, larger peptides that appear to focus its mitogenic activity to one or another target cell."

https://openalex.org/W1581071170,"Changes in hepatic mixed function oxidase kinetics after administration of allylisopropylacetamide (AIA) to chick embryos indicate that the activities of different cytochrome P-450 isozymes, including those participating in the metabolism of the same substrates, can be simultaneously increased and inhibited by a single xenobiotic. Up to 4 h after administration in ovo, or in vitro, AIA exclusively inhibited mixed function oxidases. At 24 h after administration in ovo, AIA simultaneously decreased the Vmax of the isozymes active in 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylation and in biphenyl and antipyrine hydroxylations in control liver and caused new isozymes with higher Km and Vmax values to appear. At the same time, AIA increased the Vmax values for isozymes active in aminopyrine demethylation and decreased the Vmax for benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylation (EC 1.14.14.1). As an inhibitor, AIA did not exhibit substrate selectivity but tended to inhibit isozymes with higher substrate affinity noncompetitively and lower affinity isozymes competitively. Competitive mechanisms and generalized P-450 breakdown could only partially account for the inhibition of mixed function oxidases by AIA. The inhibition at low doses of AIA (0.1 to 0.3 mg/egg) occurred without any decrease in P-450 and at higher doses it exceeded and was more persistent than the decrease in P-450. The data indicate that in addition to the known mechanisms for mixed function oxidase inhibition by AIA there is another noncompetitive mechanism independent of P-450 breakdown. As an inducer, AIA, like phenobarbital rather than beta-naphthoflavone increased the metabolism of aminopyrine and the concentration of Mr = 50,000 and 51,000 proteins preferentially. However, unlike either, AIA selectively induced new high Km and Vmax isozymes active toward 7-ethoxycoumarin, biphenyl, and antipyrine and increased the concentration of a Mr = 53,000 protein. These actions distinguish AIA from either the phenobarbital or polycyclic hydrocarbon class of inducers. The simultaneous inhibition by AIA of higher affinity isozymes with selective induction of low affinity isozymes produced a crossover effect in which after AIA administration the rates of 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase and biphenyl and antipyrine hydroxylases were decreased at low and increased at high substrate concentrations. The findings demonstrate the complexity and selectivity of AIA's actions as a mixed function oxidase inhibitor and inducer and illustrate the potential heterogeneity of responses that can occur in the mixed function oxidase system after exposure of an organism to a xenobiotic."

https://openalex.org/W1585271765,"To elucidate the role of charged groups in expression of factor XI coagulant activity, the charged groups of purified human blood coagulation factor XI/XIa containing 125I-XI/XIa were derivatized: free amino groups by succinylation, guanido groups of arginine by reaction with phenylglyoxal hydrate, and free carboxyl groups by reaction with ethylenediamine. The modified proteins were tested for: 1) ability to adsorb to glass, 2) ability to be cleaved by trypsin or factor XII-high molecular weight kininogen, 3) coagulant activity. The amino group-modified factor XI had a significantly decreased ability to bind to glass; modification of arginine or carboxyl groups did not affect adsorption. Trypsin cleaved factor XI with modified free amino, guanido, or carboxyl groups. Factor XII-high molecular weight kininogen could cleave only the arginine-modified factor XI. Amino group-modified factor XI and carboxyl group-modified factor XI lost all their factor XI assay activity, whereas arginine-modified factor XI retained 50% of the original activity. Amino group-modified factor XI could not be activated by trypsin, but arginine-modified and carboxyl group-modified factor XI could be activated by trypsin to 50% of the original activity. Succinylation of the amino groups of factor XIa destroyed all its factor XIa activity. Arginine-modified and carboxyl group-modified factor XIa retained 50% of their factor XIa activity. We conclude that epsilon-amino groups are essential for adsorption; activation by factor XII-high molecular weight kininogen requires free amino and carboxyl but not guanido groups; free amino, carboxyl, and guanido groups in factor XIa all appear to be critical for interaction of factor XIa with factor IX."
