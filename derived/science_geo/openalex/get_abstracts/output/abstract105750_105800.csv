https://openalex.org/W2069527370,"Cultured embryonic cortical neurons from rats were used to explore mechanisms of activity-dependent neuronal survival. Cell survival was increased by the activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) but not by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These effects correlated with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced by these two classes of calcium channels. Antibodies to BDNF (which block intracellular signaling by BDNF, but not by nerve growth factor, NT3, or NT4/5) reduced the survival of cortical neurons and reversed the VSCC-mediated increase in survival. Thus, endogenous BDNF is a trophic factor for cortical neurons whose expression is VSCC-regulated and that functions in the VSCC-dependent survival of these neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2068742932,"The apical ectodermal ridge permits growth and elongation of amniote limb buds; removal causes rapid changes in mesodermal gene expression, patterned cell death, and truncation of the limb. Ectopic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 supplied to the chick apical bud mesoderm after ridge removal will sustain normal gene expression and cell viability, and allow relatively normal limb development. A bioassay for FGFs demonstrated that FGF-2 was the only detectable FGF in chick limb bud extracts. By distribution and bioactivity, FGF-2 is the prime candidate for the chick limb bud apical ridge growth signal."
https://openalex.org/W1978757502,"To complete their maturation, most immature thymocytes depend on the simultaneous engagement of their antigen receptor [alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR)] and their CD4 or CD8 coreceptors with major histocompatibility complex class II or I ligands, respectively. However, a normal subset of mature alpha beta TCR+ thymocytes did not follow these rules. These thymocytes expressed NK1.1 and a restricted set of alpha beta TCRs that are intrinsically class I-reactive because their positive selection was class I-dependent but CD8-independent. These cells were CD4+ and CD4-8- but never CD8+, because the presence of CD8 caused negative selection. Thus, neither CD4 nor CD8 contributes signals that direct their maturation into the CD4+ and CD4-8- lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2111953261,"APETALA3 (AP3) specifies the development of petals and stamens in the Arabidopsis flower. We constructed a transgenic line, 35S-AP3, that ectopically expresses AP3 under the control of a constitutive promoter. The resulting flowers exhibit a replacement of carpels by stamens and resemble flowers homozygous for the previously described Arabidopsis mutation superman. Although AP3 RNA is detected at high levels throughout the flower and stem in 35S-AP3, AP3 protein is detected at high levels only in the second, third, and fourth floral whorls, demonstrating that AP3 is posttranscriptionally regulated. Ectopic expression of AP3 causes a second floral homeotic gene, PISTILLATA (PI), to function in the fourth whorl of 35S-AP3 flowers. AP3 and PI also activate an AP3 promoter-reporter gene fusion, demonstrating that AP3 positively autoregulates."
https://openalex.org/W2025809696,"IN the cerebellum, NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors play an important role in neuronal differentiation1,2 and excitatory synaptic transmission3–5. During early cerebellar development, marked changes occur in the distribution of messenger RNAs encoding various NMDA-receptor subunits6. To determine whether these changes result in the appearance of functionally distinct NMDA receptors7–9, we have recorded single-channel currents in rat cerebellar granule cells during the period of their migration from the external germinal layer to the inner granular layer10. Here we show that before synapse formation10,11, pre-migratory and migrating granule cells express NMDA receptors possessing single-channel properties similar to those previously described for many central neurons12-16. In contrast, mature post-migratory cells also express an atypical form of NMDA receptor that has a lower single-channel conductance and distinct kinetic behaviour. The properties of these 'low-conductance' channels correspond to those described17 for recombinant NMDA receptors formed by co-expression of NR1 and NR2C subunits8,9. The NR2C subunit appears postnatally and is found predominantly in the adult cerebellum6–8. Our data demonstrate developmental changes in NMDA-receptor properties at the single-channel level, and suggest that in the cerebellum the expression of a specific subunit protein results in a distinct form of native receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1584511565,"Abstract Reduced, denatured lysozyme tends to aggregate at neutral pH, and competition between productive folding and aggregation substantially reduces the efficiency of refolding (Goldberg, M.E., Rudolph, R., and Jaenicke, R. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2790-2797). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a catalyst of oxidative protein folding, has a variety of effects on the yield of native lysozyme during the oxidative refolding of the reduced, denatured protein. Depending on the concentration of lysozyme, the concentration of PDI, and the order in which lysozyme and PDI are added to initiate folding, PDI can produce a substantial increase or a substantial decrease in the recovery of native lysozyme, when compared with the uncatalyzed reaction. In the presence of a glutathione redox buffer, denatured lysozyme (1-10 microM) partitions almost equally between productive folding leading to native lysozyme (50-63%) and non-productive fates including the formation of disulfide cross-linked aggregates. At the higher lysozyme concentrations examined (5-10 microM), substoichiometric concentrations of PDI (0.5-1 microM) exhibit activity; PDI actively diverts most of the denatured lysozyme away from productive folding so that only 17 +/- 9% of the lysozyme is recovered as native enzyme. PDI's anti-chaperone activity results in extensive intermolecular disulfide crosslinking of lysozyme into large, inactive aggregates. On the other hand, if PDI is initially present at a large molar excess (5-10-fold) when denatured lysozyme is diluted to initiate folding, PDI demonstrates a chaperone-like activity that prevents aggregate formation and promotes correct folding. When PDI's chaperone activity is dominant, virtually all of the denatured lysozyme is correctly folded. The schizophrenic chaperone/anti-chaperone nature of PDI activity accounts for a number of observations on in vivo protein folding, including the necessity for maintaining a high concentration of PDI in the endoplasmic reticulum and the formation of disulfide cross-linked aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum during the expression of disulfide-containing proteins (deSilva, A., Braakman, I., and Helenius, A. (1993) J. Cell. Biol. 120, 647-655)."
https://openalex.org/W2093687422,"Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle protein implicated in neurotransmitter release. Molecular characterization of four mutant alleles of this protein in Drosophila melanogaster has permitted an investigation of synaptotagmin's role in synaptic physiology and of some of the structural requirements for its function. Reduced levels of synaptotagmin resulted in a substantial alteration in synaptic function in the eye and at larval neuromuscular junctions. Decreased neurotransmitter release caused smaller evoked synaptic potentials. However, the frequency, but not the size, of spontaneous quantal events was simultaneously increased. These abnormalities do not appear to be secondary to a detectable morphological change in the arborization of the synapse. The increased frequency of spontaneous events was insufficient to deplete significantly the vesicle supply and thereby account for reduced transmission. These data are discussed in the context of models in which synaptotagmin's function includes a role in vesicle docking."
https://openalex.org/W1598106324,"The chronic survival of many endoparasites is dependent on the ability of these organisms to escape the host immune response. Identification of the molecular mechanisms by which these organisms evade this response may yield novel approaches in the development of anti-inflammatory agents. We describe here the discovery and characterization of a novel 41-kilodalton glycoprotein from the canine hookwork (Ancylostoma caninum) that potently inhibits CD11/CD18-dependent neutrophil function in vitro. Neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) blocks the adhesion of activated human neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells as well as the release of H2O2 from activated neutrophils, over a similar concentration range (IC50 10-20 nM). Studies aimed at determining the nature of the NIF binding site on neutrophils revealed selective, high affinity binding of this protein to the integrin CD11b/CD18. A cDNA encoding NIF was isolated from a canine hookworm cDNA library. NIF comprises a mature polypeptide of 257 amino acids, preceded by a 17-amino acid leader. The mature protein has 10 cysteines and has seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites. NIF has no significant sequence homologies to any previously reported protein. As such, NIF represents a prototype of a novel class of leukocyte function inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1577612357,"P-glycoprotein consists of two homologous halves, each composed of six potential transmembrane sequences and an ATP-binding domain. The cDNA coding for human P-glycoprotein was divided in half and subcloned into separate plasmids in order to express each half as a separate polypeptide and to characterize its contribution to function. Expression of cDNAs coding for either the NH2- or COOH-terminal half-molecules in HEK 293 cells yielded products of 88 and 64 kDa, respectively. The NH2-terminal half-molecule was glycosylated, since its size decreased from 88 to 79 kDa when expressed in the presence of tunicamycin. No change was observed in the size of the COOH-terminal half-molecule when it was expressed in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that it was not glycosylated. The cDNAs coding for each half of P-glycoprotein were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells to test for biological activity. No drug-resistant colonies were obtained when cells were transfected with cDNA coding for each half-molecule or when cells were co-transfected with both cDNAs, although stable expression of each half-molecule was detected. The inability to confer drug resistance was likely due to a defect in targeting of the half-molecules to the cell surface. Each half-molecule was then expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus vector to allow measurement of partial function. The half-molecules exhibited ATPase activity, but their activities were not stimulated by drug substrates. Drug-stimulatable ATPase activity was present, however, when the half-molecules were expressed together. These results suggest that coupling of ATPase activity to drug binding requires interaction between both halves of P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1583825507,"The mechanism by which correctly folded proteins are recovered from stable complexes with groEL is not well understood. Certain target proteins require ATP and groES, while others seemingly dispense with the cochaperonin. Here, we examine the chaperonin-assisted folding of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, three proteins that are believed to require both chaperonin components for successful reactivation. Surprisingly, in all cases, the need for groES depended on the folding environment. Under non-permissive conditions, where unassisted spontaneous folding could not occur, reactivation to the native state required the complete chaperonin system (e.g. groEL, groES, and MgATP). However, under conditions where spontaneous folding could occur groES was no longer mandatory. Instead, upon the addition of ATP alone, all three target proteins could be released from groEL, in a form that was capable of reaching the native state. In the permissive setting, groES merely accelerated the rate of the ATP-dependent release process. The results suggest that the incompletely folded protein species that are released from groEL, in the absence of groES, are not necessarily committed to the native state. Similar to the unassisted folding reaction, they still partition between productive and unproductive folding pathways in an environment-dependent manner. It follows that the mechanistic contribution of the co-chaperonin, groES, and its physiological significance in cellular protein folding, could be entirely missed in a permissive in vitro environment."

https://openalex.org/W1578745312,"Verapamil-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by Chinese hamster P-glycoprotein in plasma membranes was shown to occur at a site(s) which is conformationally flexible and of relatively low affinity and specificity. Such properties distinguish P-glycoprotein from other transport ATPases. 8-Azido-ATP and 2-azido-ATP were excellent substrates, confirming that both analogs are suitable photoaffinity labels for investigating the catalytic site(s). Inactivation of ATPase activity occurred coincident with covalent incorporation of approximately two 8-azido-ATP/P-glycoprotein, with the incorporated analog distributed equally between N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule. N-Ethylmaleimide potently inactivated in an ATP-protected, dithiothreitol-irreversible manner, with maximal inactivation occurring coincident with incorporation of approximately two N-ethyl-maleimide/P-glycoprotein. The critical catalytic site sulfhydryls were shown to be located equally in N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule. Sulfhydryl-substituted purines also gave substantial inhibition of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, which was dithiothreitol reversible. The data provide guidelines for beginning investigation of catalytic site architecture by protein chemistry approaches."
https://openalex.org/W86821847,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate whether glycine residues in the predicted cytoplasmic loops play essential roles in the structure and function of human P-glycoprotein. Mutant cDNAs in which codons for each of the 20 glycine residues were changed to valine, were expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed with respect to their ability to confer resistance to various drugs. Mutation of Gly-251, -268, -269, or -781 yielded mutant proteins which were unable to confer drug resistance in transfected cells. Each of these mutant P-glycoproteins had an apparent mass of 150 kDa, compared with 170 kDa for wild-type P-glycoprotein and the apparent mass was altered by endoglycosidase H digestion. These observations suggest that these mutant proteins were improperly processed so that they were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and were not targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. The in vivo processing of mutants Gly-269 to Val and Gly-781 to Val was temperature-sensitive. When cells expressing these mutants were grown at a lower temperature (26 degrees C), the mature 170-kDa form of P-glycoprotein was the major product. Substitution of glycine with alanine at positions 251, 268, 269, or 781 yielded mutants with structural and functional characteristics similar to wild-type enzyme. Mutation of Gly-141, 187, 288, 812, or 830 to Val, altered the drug resistance profile conferred by P-glycoproteins expressed in transfected cells. All five mutations increased relative resistance to colchicine or adriamycin, without altering relative resistance to vinblastine. These results demonstrate that glycines located in the cytoplasmic loops play important roles in structure and function of P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1559573167,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) modulates epithelial and endothelial leukocyte adherence, but epithelial cell ICAM-1 levels (unlike endothelial cell levels) are selectively sensitive to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Nuclear run-off assays indicated that IFN-gamma regulation of epithelial ICAM-1 levels occurs at a transcriptional level, so the basis for selective cytokine control of ICAM-1 expression was investigated using the ICAM-1 gene promoter region. A plasmid construct containing 5.0 kilobases of ICAM-1 gene 5'-flanking region fused to a reporter gene was selectively responsive to IFN-gamma in (human tracheal) epithelial cells but not in (human umbilical vein) endothelial cells, indicating that this region is sufficient to mediate proper cell-specific expression. An IFN-gamma response element (IRE) was localized to a DNA segment (nucleotides -130 to -94) in the ICAM-1 gene by comparisons of nested 5'-deletional constructs and by demonstrating that this segment confers IFN-gamma responsiveness on heterologous promoters. This same IRE formed a single major binding complex (IRE-BC) in gel retardation assays with nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma-stimulated but not unstimulated epithelial cells, and mutation of the IRE consensus motif (TTTCCGGGAAA at -116 to -106) resulted in loss of IRE-protein binding and abolished IFN-gamma responsiveness, indicating that this sequence is required for ICAM-1 IRE function. Comparison of the ICAM-1 IRE to DNA elements that confer IFN responsiveness in other human genes indicated similarity only to response regions in the Fc gamma RI and IRF-1 genes. The findings provide evidence for a distinct IRE subset that combines a DNA element common to all IFN-responsive genes (GAAA) with a distinct flanking sequence (the inverted repeat GAAA) in order to fine-tune IFN responses and activate a subset of immune response genes (ICAM-1, Fc gamma RI, and IRF-1)."

https://openalex.org/W1496206652,"Natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) was identified in rat chondrocytes, and its physiological functions were investigated. Rat tissues, including the xiphoid cartilage, brain, lung, liver, adrenal gland, and kidney, were screened for NPR-B activity, which we assayed by receptor guanylate cyclase activity specifically stimulated by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a known selective activator of NPR-B. Cartilage showed distinctly higher NPR-B activity. Furthermore, exposure of cultured rat chondrocytes to CNP (10(-6) M) resulted in a large increase in intracellular cGMP production (376 +/- 38 pmol/well), with threshold responses occurring between 10(-10) and 10(-9) M CNP. Atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide also stimulated cGMP production in rat chondrocytes but with a potency that was at least 10 times less than that of CNP. Polymerase chain reaction analysis also demonstrated NPR-B gene expression in adult rat xiphisternum and cultured chondrocytes. These findings indicate that NPR-B is present in rat chondrocytes. In rat chondrocytes exposed to CNP, [3H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (half-maximal response, 10(-11)M). However, much higher concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were required to induce the inhibition of thymidine incorporation. Interestingly, CNP-like immunoreactivity was detected in the conditioned medium from chondrocyte cultures. In addition, TGF-beta 1, a multifunctional cytokine, induced a marked increase in CNP secretion and CNP mRNA levels in chondrocytes. These results indicate that autocrine CNP inhibits mitogenesis in chondrocytes via NPR-B under the control of TGF-beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W2085610641,"Homeotic genes function in blocks of cells along the body axis to specify diverse developmental pathways. Among the Drosophila homeotic genes, only one is known to be expressed in the endoderm. We show here that expression of this gene, labial (lab), coincides with copper cells, highly specialized cells of the larval midgut. lab is strictly required for copper cell formation, a requirement that starts in the embryo and extends through larval stages. This implies a function of lab not only in the determination and differentiation of copper cells, but also in the maintenance of their differentiated state. Ectopic expression of lab during embryogenesis reprograms other midgut cells within and outside the lab domain to become copper cell-like. Thus, lab functions in the larval midgut to specify a single cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1553804279,"The gene for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids, contains two distinct promoter regions, denoted PI and PII, which control the generation of different forms of mRNA. Multiple forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) mRNA with 5'-end heterogeneity are generated as a result of differential splicing of two primary transcripts formed under the control of these two promoters. PI is responsible for the generation of class I mRNAs of ACC, which are induced in a tissue-specific manner under lipogenic conditions. PII generates class II mRNAs of ACC, which are expressed constitutively. Possible mechanisms for the regulation of PI under normal physiological conditions and agents that activate the promoter have been investigated. PI contains a TATA and a CCAAT box. In addition to these sequences, this promoter contains a 28-CA repeat sequence 220 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site; the presence of this sequence leads to about 70% repression of the basal promoter activity. Repression by the 28-CA repeat sequence requires the GCAAT sequence in the CCAAT box. The negative effect of the 28-CA repeat sequence is relieved by a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), which binds to the GCAAT sequence. Insertion of the 28-CA repeat sequence into the thymidine kinase promoter results in repression that can also be relieved by the C/EBP gene product. However, the same sequence exerts no effect on ACC promoter II, which has no CCAAT box. During the differentiation of 30A5 preadipocytes into adipocytes, the expression of class I ACC mRNA and C/EBP mRNA is coordinately increased. Therefore, the presence of the CA repeat in the promoter may be responsible for the inactivity of PI, and C/EBP may be one of the factors that is responsible for the activation of PI under lipogenic conditions. Interaction of the CA repeat and the CCAAT box in the repression and derepression of the ACC gene provides a novel function for the CCAAT box and C/EBP in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1543673067,"Reduced oxygen tension (hypoxia) induces a 3-fold increase in stability of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, in the pheochromocytoma (PC12) clonal cell line. To investigate the possibility that RNA-protein interactions are involved in mediating this increase in stability, RNA gel shift assays were performed using different fragments of labeled TH mRNA and the S-100 fraction of PC12 cytoplasmic protein extracts. We identified a sequence within the 3‘-untranslated region of TH mRNA that binds cytoplasmic protein. RNase T1 mapping revealed that the protein was bound to a 28 nucleotide long sequence that is located between bases 1551-1579 of TH mRNA. Moreover, protein binding to this fragment was prevented with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against bases 1551-1579 and subsequent RNase H digestion. This fragment of the 3‘-untranslated region of TH mRNA is rich in pyrimidine nucleotides, and the binding of cytoplasmic protein to this fragment was reduced by competition with other polypyrimidine sequences including poly(C) but not poly(U) polymers. The binding of the protein to TH mRNA was increased when cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) for 24 h. Electrophoresis of the UV cross-linked RNA-protein complex on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a complex of 74 kDa. The potential role of this protein-TH mRNA interaction in regulation of TH mRNA stability during hypoxia is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483358522,"Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of human acid beta-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase). This enzyme is inactivated by the specific, mechanism-based enzyme inactivator 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, which functions by forming a stable 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-D-gluco-pyranosyl-enzyme intermediate. The key nucleophilic amino acid residue involved in formation of this intermediate was conclusively identified by tandem mass spectrometry as Glu340, and not Asp443 as thought previously. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Identification, and mass determination, of the labeled peptide in a proteolytic hydrolysate involved detection of a collision-induced fragmentation reaction specific to the sugar-peptide linkage. Confirmation of the identity of the labeled peptide was obtained both by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing and by chemical degradation of the purified peptide. This method allowed the rapid, sensitive, and non-isotopic determination of an essential amino acid residue in a clinically important enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1950635443,"Chimeric cDNAs encoding a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA1) and regions of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit were constructed to seek the minimal region of the alpha-subunit sufficient for assembly with the Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit. cDNAs encoding a chimera and the chicken beta-subunit were coexpressed in mammalian cells and assembly was assayed by immune precipitation of the chimeric subunit with a monoclonal antibody to the chicken beta-subunit. A chimera containing 26 amino acyl residues of the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1-subunit (NDVEDSYGQQWTFEQRKIVEFTCHTA) (Asn894 to Ala919) that replaced the corresponding avian SERCA1 Ca-ATPase amino acyl residues (Thr871 to Thr898) was able to assemble with the chicken beta-subunit. This alpha-subunit region is predicted to be extracellular, located between membrane-spanning domains 7 and 8 (H7-H8). Chimeras that assembled with full-length beta-subunit also assembled with a beta-subunit chimera that retained only the ectodomain of the chicken beta 1-subunit. These results suggest that the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit has the same topology in the membrane as the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase, probably with 10 membrane-spanning domains, and that the aminoacyl residues between membrane domains H7 and H8 are involved in assembly with the beta-subunit in the extracellular/lumenal space."
https://openalex.org/W1556220567,"Genes encoding 3 distinct subtypes of human alpha 2-adrenergic receptor are known and are found, respectively, on chromosome 10, 4, and 2 (alpha 2-C10, alpha 2-C4, and alpha 2-C2 adrenergic receptors). All 3 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi proteins. To study and compare their regulatory properties we assessed the ability of each to undergo agonist-promoted desensitization and phosphorylation. When Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing each of the three receptor genes were incubated with epinephrine for 20 min, a marked decrease in sensitivity to subsequent agonist-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was observed for the alpha 2-C10 and alpha 2-C2 receptors but not for the alpha 2-C4 receptors. When similar incubations were performed with 32Pi-labeled cells and the receptors were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, alpha 2-C10 and alpha 2-C2 receptors were found to undergo an approximately 3-fold increase in receptor phosphorylation after epinephrine exposure. When transfected into COS cells epinephrine also stimulated phosphorylation of alpha 2-C10 and alpha 2-C2 receptors while having only a slight effect on alpha 2-C4 receptors. Cotransfection of the cells with the cDNA encoding the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase further increased receptor phosphorylation for alpha 2-C10 and alpha 2-C2 receptors while having little or no effect on alpha 2-C4 receptors. Moreover purified and reconstituted recombinant alpha 2-C10 receptors could be phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent fashion whereas alpha 2-C4 receptors could not. These observations suggest receptor subtype-specific differences in susceptibility to regulatory phosphorylation and desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1551652137,"Acidic residues which are found on transmembrane segments within the lactose permease may play an important role in H+ and/or sugar recognition. To examine the functional roles of Glu-269 and Glu-325, we have constructed a variety of amino acid substitutions (e.g. aspartate, glycine, alanine, serine, or glutamine) via site-directed mutagenesis. At position 269, all mutations appear to have a detrimental effect on sugar affinity, downhill transport, and counterflow. The Asp-269 mutant was able to accumulate lactose against a concentration gradient, whereas all of the nonionizable substitutions at position 269 were completely defective. Nevertheless, in spite of their inability to actively accumulate sugars, Gly-269, Ala-269, and Gln-269 mutants were observed to transport H+ upon the addition of galactosides. Mutations at position 325 had a markedly different phenotype. For example, the Asp-325, Gly-325, and Gln-325 mutants exhibited an apparent Km for lactose transport (e.g. 0.21, 0.47, and 0.50 mM, respectively), which was actually lower than that of the wild-type strain (1.44 mM). In counterflow assays, all position 325 mutants also appear to catalyze lactose exchange. Similar to the results obtained at position 269, the Asp-325 mutant exhibited moderate levels of accumulation, whereas none of the nonionizable mutations at position 325 were able to accumulate galactosides against a concentration gradient. However, unlike the position 269 mutants, no H+ transport was observed in the Gly-325, Ala-325, Ser-325, or Gln-325 strains upon the addition of lactose, S-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,1)-beta-thiogalactopyranoside, 1-O-methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, or melibiose. Furthermore, in these mutants, the efflux of lactose during counterflow assays became insensitive to delta pH. Overall, these results are consistent with the notion that an acidic residue at position 325 is required for H+ transport via the lactose permease. Alternative hypotheses are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1587273245,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase delta and is required for both DNA replication and DNA repair. PCNA forms complexes with D-type cyclins, candidate G1 cyclins in mammalian cells. To better understand the functions of the complexes, we examined interactions between PCNA and D-type cyclins, using in vitro-translated mouse PCNA and mouse cyclin D1 or D3 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Analysis of a set of deletion mutants of PCNA revealed that either the N-terminal (residues 2-64) or the C-terminal (residues 197-228) region is necessary for association with D-type cyclins. The cyclin binding of the chimeric protein of the N-terminal (residues 1-68) or the C-terminal (residues 195-261) region of PCNA and rat DNA polymerase beta which does not bind to the cyclins by itself supports this notion. The purified recombinant mouse PCNA expressed in Escherichia coli bound to the D-type cyclin-GST fusion proteins, thereby suggesting that PCNA binds directly to D-type cyclins, without the requirement of other cellular factors. This is apparently the first report on the structure-function relationship of PCNA which may link DNA replication and DNA repair with cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W1518782890,"Reticulocytes contain an eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF-2 alpha) kinase that is negatively regulated by hemin. This protein kinase, which has been termed heme-regulated inhibitor and heme-controlled repressor (HCR), has a strong inhibitory effect on the initiation of protein synthesis and plays an important role in translational control in these cells. Previous evidence has suggested that HCR may be an erythroid-specific enzyme. As reported herein, we have cloned and characterized the cDNA encoding an eIF-2 alpha kinase from rat brain. The predicted amino acid sequence of the kinase from rat brain shows 82% homology to rabbit reticulocyte HCR with the greatest variation concentrated in a central region of approximately 135 amino acids located between protein kinase subdomains IV and VI. We have expressed the rat brain cDNA in Escherichia coli and have demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme is a hemin-sensitive eIF-2 alpha kinase. We have also shown that mRNA recognized by the rat brain cDNA is expressed in a wide range of non-erythroid rat tissues at a lower but significant level compared with reticulocytes. These findings raise the possibility of additional, uncharacterized roles for HCR in non-erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535761892,"Abstract The mechanism of nitrogen transfer in glutamine-dependent amidotransferases remains to be unambiguously established. We now report the overexpression, purification, and kinetic characterization of both the glutamine- and ammonia-dependent activities of Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase B (AS-B) and a series of mutants. In common with other members of the purF family of amidotransferases, the recombinant enzyme possesses an NH2-terminal cysteine residue. Replacement of Cys-1 by either alanine or serine results in a loss of glutaminase and glutamine-dependent activity, without out any significant effect upon ammonia-dependent asparagine synthesis. As previously observed for human AS (Sheng, S., Moraga-Amador, D., Van Heeke, G., Allison, R. D., Richards, N. G. J., and Schuster, S. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16771-16780), glutamine is an inhibitor of the ammonia-dependent reaction catalyzed by both the Cys-1-->Ala (C1A) and Cys-1-->Ser (C1S) mutants of AS-B. In the case of C1A, the inhibition pattern suggests that an abortive complex is formed. This is consistent with a recent proposal implicating the formation of an imide intermediate in the nitrogen transfer reaction (Richards, N. G. J., and Schuster, S. M. (1992) FEBS Lett. 313, 98-102). In contrast, glutamine appears to be only a competitive inhibitor of the ammonia-dependent activity of C1S. Cys-1 does not appear to be required for glutamine binding. Replacement of Asp-33 by either asparagine or glutamic acid has little effect on the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes when compared to wild-type AS-B. Cys-1 and Asp-33 are cognate to residues Cys-1 and Asp-29 in glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase which have been proposed to be members of a responsible for mediating nitrogen transfer in this enzyme (Mei, B., and Zalkin, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16613-16619). In the case of AS-B, although Cys-1 is essential for glutamine-dependent activity, Asp-33 does not appear to participate in mediating nitrogen transfer. In an effort to locate other residues which might form part of a catalytic triad in the glutamine amidotransferase domain of AS-B, we have expressed and characterized mutant proteins in which His-29 and His-80, which are conserved within the glutamine amidotransferase domain of purF amidotransferases, are replaced by alanine (H29A and H80A).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1620163750,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) not only links the translational machinery to the endomembrane system in eukaryotic cells but also provides a protective environment for the folding of exoplasmic proteins translocated across the ER membrane. Here we describe that the lumenal surface of the ER membranes transiently tethers the folding intermediate of secretory proteins via a 90-kDa ER membrane protein, calnexin. We demonstrate that p70, the precursor to gp80, the major secretory protein in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, was bound transiently to calnexin in the immediate post-synthetic period (0-10 min) and showed a t1/2 for dissociation from calnexin of 2.5 min. The bound p70 was found to be incompletely folded as assessed by susceptibility to proteinase K digestion. Perturbation of the redox state by 5 mM dithiothreitol or 1 mM diamide markedly inhibited the dissociation of p70 from calnexin (t1/2 > 30 min). Cellular depletion of ATP led to premature dissociation of p70 from calnexin and the formation of p70 aggregates that did not bind calnexin. These findings demonstrate that nascent unfolded p70 is tethered to calnexin during normal protein maturation, including the formation and editing of disulfide bonds and that ATP is required for the productive interaction of gp80 and calnexin."
https://openalex.org/W1553423334,"The Q42E mutation in the polar loop of subunit c of the Escherichia coli F1F0 ATP synthase leads to an uncoupling of H+ translocation through F0 and ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in F1. We have isolated four second-site suppressor mutants in which the coupling defect is corrected. Substitutions for Glu31 in F1 subunit epsilon were found in each suppressor mutant, where the substitutions were E31G, E31V, and E31K (the last being found twice). The different substitutions vary in effectiveness in restoring wild type growth properties in the order epsilon E31G > epsilon E31V > epsilon E31K. Biochemical properties of epsilon E31G/cQ42E and epsilon E31K/cQ42E membranes were compared. In epsilon E31G/cQ42E mutant membranes, ATP-driven H+ translocation by F1F0 and the binding and coupling of F1 to F0 showed a striking pH dependence. Near normal function was observed at pH 7.0, but function was lost at pH 7.8. The function of epsilon E31K/cQ42E membranes was much less affected by changes in pH. Relative to epsilon E31G/cQ42E membranes, the ATP-driven H+ transport function of epsilon E31K/cQ42E membranes was approximately the same at pH 7.5, greater at pH 7.8, and less at pH 7.0. The differences between mutants could be explained if cGlu42 ionized at pH 7.8 with loss of function in epsilon E31G/cQ42E membrane and a similar ionization were compensated for by the positively charged Lys in the epsilon E31K/cQ42E membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1487665505,"Abstract Deficient expression of glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI)-anchored surface proteins has been linked to six different genetic defects in Thy-1- murine lymphoma mutants. In this study, human K562 cell mutants defective in GPI anchoring were derived by anti-decay-accelerating factor (CD55) based negative fluorescent cell sorting of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine pretreated cells. Homologous cell fusions of six clones that complemented a previously described K562 mutant corresponding to one of the Thy-1- mutant classes (Hirose, S., Mohney, R. P., Mutka, S. C., Ravi, L., Singleton, D. R., Perry, G., Tartakoff, A., and Medof, M. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5272-5278) showed that they segregated into two complementation groups. In heterologous cell fusions, representative clones of each group complemented Thy-1 expression by all of the previously described GPI anchor pathway-defective Thy-1- murine lymphoma classes (A, B, C, E, F, and H) but not class(es) D (and I) defective in the Thy-1 structural gene. Analyses of putative GPI anchor precursors synthesized by the two lines revealed that one mutant exhibited a complete block in deacetylation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-inositol phospholipid to glucosamine (GlcN)-inositol phospholipid, whereas the other mutant assembled GlcN-inositol phospholipid and subsequent mannose (Man)-containing intermediates but showed markedly increased amounts of the terminal ethanolamine (EthN)-phosphate (P)-substituted putative anchor precursors, EthN-P-6ManMan(EthN-P-->)ManGlcN- and EthN-P-6Man(EthN-P-6)Man(EthN- P-->)ManGlcN-acylinositol phospholipid (H7 and H8). We designate these new complementation classes J, harboring a defect in N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-inositol phospholipid deacetylation, and K, deficient in a step preliminary to or associated with protein transfer of assembled anchor precursors. The availability of these new mutant classes should aid in characterization of the GPI anchor pathway enzymes providing for these reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1906087230,"The gut receptor of trypsin-modulating oostatic factor (TMOF), a decapeptide hormone that regulates trypsin biosynthesis in the mosquito gut, has been characterized. The binding of TMOF to mosquito gut membranes reached maximum at pH 7.4 and 24°C. No binding was observed at pH 2.5 and the binding to the membranes declined rapidly at pH 8.0. At equilibrium, maximum binding to the receptor was observed at 60 min and 24°C. A synthetic complementary decapeptide NH2-Ile-Leu-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-COOH (FOMT) for TMOF successfully competed with the gut receptor, and specifically bound TMOF (Kd = 4 μm and Kassoc = 2.5 × 105 m−1). TMOF binding to gut membranes was characterized with FOMT and a specific ELISA to the hormone at 24 and 72 h after blood feeding. Two classes of binding sites were found on the gut membrane; high affinity (Kd1 = 4.6 ± 0.7 × 10−7 m; Kassoc = 2.2 × 106 m−1 Bmax = 0.1 pmol/gut) and low affinity (Kd2 = 4.43 ± 1 × 10−6 m; Kaggoc = 2.3 × 105 m−1; Bmax = 0.2 pmol/gut). The total binding sites for high and low affinity classes of TMOF per gut were estimated as 6.3 × 1010 and 1.1 × 1011 sites, respectively. Specific binding sites on the gut increased after the blood meal and were visualized by immunocytochemical staining. These results suggest that TMOF regulates trypsin biosynthesis by binding to specific receptor sites that are located on the mosquito gut, and that this receptor can be studied using a complementary peptide approach.—Borovsky, D., Powell, C. A., Nayar, J. K., Blalock, J. E., Hayes, T. K.

https://openalex.org/W1585252702,"We investigated the mechanism of sodium butyrate (NaB)-mediated induction of mdr1 mRNA in parental (wild type) and multidrug-resistant (Ad1000) SW620 colon cancer cell lines. NaB treatment resulted in reversible, time-dependent increases in nuclear run-on transcription of endogenous mdr1 in these cell lines that paralleled the reversible increases of mdr1 mRNA in both timing and magnitude. In contrast, NaB treatment had no effect on mdr1 mRNA stability. Thus, the effects of NaB on mdr1 mRNA levels are fully attributable to altered mdr1 transcription. Furthermore, NaB induces the expression of transiently transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids that are under the transcriptional control of the mdr1 promoter (mdrCAT vectors). Transfections using mdrCAT vectors modified by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the mdr1 promoter indicate that NaB-mediated induction of these vectors is at least partially dependent upon sequences present in the basal mdr1 promoter between -89 and +11 relative to the start site of transcription. The Y-box motif located between -82 and -73 contributes to NaB inducibility of mdrCAT vector expression in Ad1000 SW620 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1488480847,"Chaperonin-60 is usually isolated as a tetradecameric form arranged as two stacked seven-member rings, and this structure has been considered to be required for promoting protein folding. However, monomeric chaperonin-60 (cpn60m), isolated from holo-chaperonin of Thermus thermophilus, and its proteolytic 50-kDa fragment, which lacks amino-terminal 78 amino acid residues, can interact with non-native rhodanese and lactate dehydrogenase, suppress formation of aggregates, and promote productive folding under the appropriate conditions. However, different from tetradecameric chaperonin-60, folding promoted by cpn60m and the 50-kDa fragment produces lower yields of active enzymes and does not require ATP or chaperonin-10. These effects are not due to transient reassembly of cpn60m into a tetradecamer during the reaction, since immobilized cpn60m and the 50-kDa fragment, both of which can not reassemble into a tetradecamer, can still promote protein folding. An excess amount of the 50-kDa fragment shows an inhibitory effect on MgATP-triggered holochaperonin-dependent folding, indicating the 50-kDa fragment and holo-chaperonin can interact with the same species of non-native proteins. Thus, cpn60m has an intrinsic activity as a molecular chaperone and amino-terminal region of cpn60 is dispensable for this activity."
https://openalex.org/W1567778715,"The chaperones GroEL/hsp60 are present in all prokaryotes and in mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. They are involved in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation, and control of protein-protein interactions. They interact with many polypeptides in an ATP-dependent manner and possess a peptide-dependent ATPase activity. The nature of the structural elements of substrate proteins recognized by GroEL/hsp60 is still unknown. In this study, we show that the GroEL chaperone of Escherichia coli interacts with single amino acids. The hydrophobic amino acids Ile, Phe, Val, Leu, and Trp present the strongest interaction with GroEL. While most of these hydrophobic amino acids are beta-sheet formers, GroEL interacts also with the alpha-helix formers Glu, Ala, Gln, and His. The multiple interactions of GroEL with the side chains of hydrophobic and polar amino acids, including the strongest alpha-helix and beta-sheet formers would allow this chaperone to act as an amphiphilic organizer of protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W1568330925,"To test the concept that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins might be useful as targeting molecules for liposomes, we engineered a GPI-anchored form of gp120 from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (termed gp120DAF) using the GPI signal of decay-accelerating factor (DAF). We show that (i) purified gp120DAF spontaneously inserts into liposome membranes via the GPI anchor; (ii) liposomes bearing gp120DAF bind specifically to cells expressing CD4, the cellular receptor for gp120; and (iii) the receptor-bound liposomes are internalized and recycle in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To test whether the lipid composition of the liposome affects any of these processes, we compared small unilamellar liposomes containing only phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol in a 7:1 molar ratio with artificial viral envelopes that mimic the lipid composition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We show that when tagged with gp120DAF, both liposome preparations bind specifically to cells expressing CD4, and both are endocytosed. However, artificial viral envelope liposomes are transported to late endosomes or lysosomes in the cell interior, whereas phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol liposomes are confined to a population of vesicles that remain close to the plasma membrane. Since the binding and internalization of both liposome preparations are mediated by the same receptor, we conclude that the lipid composition of the liposome profoundly influences the subsequent intracellular trafficking of the liposome-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492517090,"Resistance to the intracellular Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) is associated with overexpression of both Ca2+ transport ATPase and the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter P-glycoprotein (pgp). This is supported by increased resistance to TG following transfection of a functional pgp1 cDNA, and reversal of TG resistance with known inhibitors of pgp function. However, pgp is unlikely to represent the only mechanism of resistance to TG. Cell lines selected for high levels of resistance to TG (250-fold) show only a 3.7-fold increase in pgp expression and a 2-fold increase in cross-resistance to other drugs of the mdr class. Overexpression of endogenous Ca2+ transport ATPase may represent a second mechanism of resistance to TG. Increased Ca2+ ATPase expression (3-fold) is seen in cells made resistant to TG, and TG resistance increases with the transfection of a specific Ca2+ ATPase cDNA into DC-3F cells. If these transfectants are then made resistant to TG, both the endogenous Ca2+ ATPase and the exogenously transfected Ca2+ ATPase become overexpressed. These studies suggest that while TG may be a substrate for pgp, acquired resistance to TG can involve alterations in both pgp and Ca2+ ATPase expression. Additional, as yet unidentified, mechanisms of resistance may be involved in resistance to TG."

https://openalex.org/W1536920375,"GroEL assists other proteins to fold in vivo, usually requiring Mg2+ and ATP to function. Electron micrographs reveal that ATP binding induces a conformational change in this protein. Previously we have suggested that a thermally induced conformational change in GroEL results in the switching between enhanced and arrested reactivation of bacterial glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This thermal switching occurs over a narrow temperature range (25-30 degrees C). Recently it has aslo been reported that the binding affinity of the P22 tail spike polypeptide to GroEL changes abruptly over this same temperature range. To determine whether these conformational changes occur in GroEL in solution in absence of folding intermediates, the protein was stoichiometrically labeled with AEDANS (N-(acetylaminoacyl)-5-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid), a fluorescent label whose emission is environment-sensitive. By measuring changes in the fluorescence Stokes shift we have detected two thermally induced conformational changes between 25 and 30 degrees C. The first change occurs between 25 and 26 degrees C, resulting in less than a 1-nm shift in the fluorescence. The second conformational change occurs between 27 and 30 degrees C, resulting in a 3-nm fluorescence shift. The conformational change induced by ATP binding also results in a 3-nm shift in fluorescence. Our data provide a correlation between functional change and structural change in GroEL."
https://openalex.org/W1595670287,"The mouse gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma GT) gene encodes six distinct mRNAs that differ in their 5'-untranslated regions but appear to code for the same protein. To elucidate the mechanisms that generate these different mRNAs we determined the transcription start sites of gamma GT kidney mRNAs and investigated the ability of the 5'-flanking regions of mRNAs I, II, IV, V, and VI to direct transcription of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs in a mouse kidney cell line. Types I, II, and VI mRNAs show heterogeneous start sites, whereas types IV and V have more precise initiation sites. Only the type V 5'-flanking region contains a TATA-like element. The highest CAT activities were observed with 416 base pairs of type II and 240 base pairs of type IV flanking regions. We have also shown that types II and IV represent the predominant gamma GT mRNAs in kidney; therefore, these CAT activities correlate well with the relative amount of each gamma GT mRNA. This study shows that the mouse gamma GT gene is transcribed from at least five and possibly six different promoters. In addition, the gamma GT promoters show cell specificity because no significant CAT activity was detected when these constructs were introduced into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts."

Rate constants of 1.14 (+/- 0.09) and 2.11 (+/- 0.06) x 10(5) M-1 S-1 were measured for the association of Des(Arg-141) alpha with beta A and alpha A with beta A chains, respectively. The slower combination rate of Des(Arg-141) alpha with beta A chains is in agreement with that predicted solely on the basis of electrostatic considerations, as are the measured rate constants of 0.75 (+/- 0.12) and 1.86 (+/- 0.08) x 10(5) M-1 S-1 obtained for the combination of Des(Arg-141) alpha with variant beta S (Glu-6–>Val) and beta N Baltimore (Lys-95–>Glu) chains, respectively. However, the combination rates of alpha A and Des(Arg-141) alpha with beta A chains measured in the pH range from 7.0 to 9.0 demonstrated that the altered overall surface charge was not the only determinant of the assembly rates observed for Des(Arg-141) alpha chains. Furthermore, a rate constant of 11.3 (+/- 0.05) x 10(5) M-1 S-1 (which is 5.4-fold faster than the rate of alpha A beta A dimer assembly) was observed for Des(His-146,Tyr-145) beta chains. These kinetic studies suggest a critical role for the carboxyl-terminal domain in the assembly of human hemoglobin in vitro and perhaps in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1569859724,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is regulated allosterically by citrate and covalently by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. We have isolated and purified from rat livers a novel kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the carboxylase. This kinase is bound to the carboxylase and can be eluted in salt-rich solution. The native kinase exists as high molecular weight aggregates of a subunit that has a molecular weight of 40,000. The phosphorylation sites of the carboxylase were determined after tryptic and cyanogen bromide digestions of 32P-labeled carboxylase and separation of the peptides by various chromatographic procedures. Amino acid analyses of the phosphopeptides showed that the Ser77 and Ser1200 residues were the sites of phosphorylation. Treating the phosphorylated carboxylase with the Mn(2+)-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphatase 2 removed the phosphate and reactivated the carboxylase. These results suggest that both this kinase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphatase 2 act at the same site(s) in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase molecule. Citrate dramatically inhibits the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the carboxylase, suggesting that the allosteric modification and activation by citrate render the phosphorylation sites inaccessible to the kinase and therefore maintain high carboxylase activity. This observation indicates that there is a close interplay between the citrate effect on and phosphorylation of the carboxylase in regulating its activity."

https://openalex.org/W1666352647,"The trpG-type amidotransferases, a homologous but structurally diverse family of molecules, catalyze glutamine hydrolysis to supply ammonia for many biosynthetic reactions. The amidotransferase or glutaminase (GLNase) domain of mammalian carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase), part of a 243-kDa polypeptide that initiates de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Complementation studies showed that a functional protein was produced in vivo which could provide ammonia for carbamyl phosphate synthesis by the host CPSase synthetase subunit. The recombinant 38-kDa protein was identified by immunoblotting, but when purified to homogeneity, had marginal glutaminase activity. Titration of the E. coli CPSase synthetase subunit with the mammalian GLNase domain resulted in the formation of a fully active 1:1 stoichiometric stable complex which catalyzed the glutamine-dependent overall reaction. The hybrid, isolated by gel filtration, had kinetic parameters (KGLNm = 102 microM, KATPm = 1.8 mM, kcat = 5.7 s-1) similar to those of the native E. coli CPSase. Thus, the amidotransferase activity of mammalian CPSase is carried by an autonomous domain which folds independently. However, optimal catalytic activity requires association of the glutaminase and synthetase domains. The conservation of this linkage in the mammalian E. coli hybrid suggests that the subunit interfaces must be nearly identical in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins."
