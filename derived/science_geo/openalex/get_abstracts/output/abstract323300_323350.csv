https://openalex.org/W2004278384,"Organic electroluminescent devices are light-emitting diodes in which the active materials consist entirely of organic materials. Here, the fabrication of a white light-emitting organic electroluminescent device made from vacuum-deposited organic thin films is reported. In this device, three emitter layers with different carrier transport properties, each emitting blue, green, or red light, are used to generate white light. Bright white light, over 2000 candelas per square meter, nearly as bright as a fluorescent lamp, was successfully obtained at low drive voltages such as 15 to 16 volts. The applications of such a device include paper-thin light sources, which are particularly useful for places that require lightweight illumination devices, such as in aircraft and space shuttles. Other uses are a backlight for liquid crystal display as well as full color displays, achieved by combining the emitters with micropatterned color filters."

During the same period, the surface layer warmed-by more than 1.5 degrees C in some places-and the temperature difference across the thermocline increased. Increased stratification resulted in less lifting of the thermocline by wind-driven upwelling. A shallower source of upwelled waters provided less inorganic nutrient for new biological production and hence supported a smaller zooplankton population. Continued warming could lead to further decline of zooplankton."
https://openalex.org/W2026640159,"The high-resolution structure of halophilic malate dehydrogenase (hMDH) from the archaebacterium Haloarcula marismortui was determined by x-ray crystallography. Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of hMDH and its nonhalophilic congeners reveals structural features that may promote the stability of hMDH at high salt concentrations. These features include an excess of acidic over basic residues distributed on the enzyme surface and more salt bridges present in hMDH compared with its nonhalophilic counterparts. Other features that contribute to the stabilization of thermophilic lactate dehydrogenase and thermophilic MDH-the incorporation of alanine into alpha helices and the introduction of negatively charged amino acids near their amino termini, both of which stabilize the alpha helix as a result of interaction with the positive part of the alpha-helix dipole-also were observed in hMDH."
https://openalex.org/W2060109193,"A model that postulates a mixture of scroll-shaped and concentric, cylindrical graphene sheets is proposed to explain the microstructure of graphite multishell nanotubes grown by arc discharge. The model is consistent with the observed occurrence of a relatively small number of different chiral angles within the same tubule. The model explains clustering in a natural way and is consistent with the observation of asymmetric (0002) lattice fringe patterns and with the occurrence of singular fringe spacings larger than c/2 (c is the c parameter of graphite) in such patterns. Anisotropic thermal contraction accounts for the 2 to 3 percent increase in the c parameter of nanotubes, compared with bulk graphite, but is too small to explain the singular fringe spacings. The model also explains the formation of multishell closure domes. Nucleation is attributed to the initial formation of a fullerene ""dome."""
https://openalex.org/W1984196982,"The carbon, nitrogen, and strontium isotope compositions of elephants in Amboseli Park, Kenya, were measured to examine changes in diet and habitat use since the 1960s. Carbon isotope ratios, which reflect the photosynthetic pathway of food plants, record a shift in diet from trees and shrubs to grass. Strontium isotope ratios, which reflect the geologic age of bedrock, document the concentration of elephants within the park. The high isotopic variability produced by behavioral and ecological shifts, if it is representative of other East African elephant populations, may complicate the use of isotopes as indicators of the source region of ivory."
https://openalex.org/W1979019348,"A bacterial pathogen of coralline algae was initially observed during June 1993 and now occurs in South Pacific reefs that span a geographic range of at least 6000 kilometers. The occurrence of the coralline algal pathogen at Great Astrolabe Reef sites (Fiji) increased from zero percent in 1992 to 100 percent in 1993, which indicates that the pathogen may be in an early stage of virulence and dispersal. Because of the important role played by coralline algae in reef building, this pathogen, designated coralline lethal orange disease (CLOD), has the potential to greatly influence coral reef ecology and reef-building processes."
https://openalex.org/W1980999526,"The south flank of Kilauea volcano has experienced two large [magnitude (M) 7.2 and M 6.1] earthquakes in the past two decades. Global Positioning System measurements conducted between 1990 and 1993 reveal seaward displacements of Kilauea's central south flank at rates of up to about 10 centimeters per year. In contrast, the northern side of the volcano and the distal ends of the south flank did not displace significantly. The observations can be explained by slip on a low-angle fault beneath the south flank combined with dilation deep within Kilauea's rift system, both at rates of at least 15 centimeters per year."
https://openalex.org/W2043885177,"Sonication of aqueous Co(2+) and hydrazine resulted in the formation of anisometric (disk-shaped) cobalt nanoclusters that averaged about 100 nanometers in width and 15 nanometers in thickness. Electron diffraction from single particles revealed that they were oriented (001) crystals that conformed to a trigonal or hexagonal unit cell four times the size of the cell adopted by bulk alpha-cobalt. Lorentz microscopy indicated that these were single-magnetic domain particles, with the axis of magnetization located in the (101) plane, offset at some appreciable angle from the (001) axis."
https://openalex.org/W2066038681,"The measured reaction probability, gamma for the reaction of chlorine nitrate (CIONa(2)) with 60 percent (by weight) sulfuric acid aerosol increases monotonically with particle size at 250 kelvin. The reacto-diffusive length (l, the effective liquid depth over which reaction occurs) derived from these experiments is 0.037 +/- 0.007 micrometer (95 percent confidence level for precision). The reaction probability for the reaction of CIONO(2) with 60 percent sulfuric acid aerosol doped with approximately 7 x 10(-4) M hydrochloric acid at 250 kelvin is larger by about a factor of 4 than in the absence of hydrochloric acid and varies less with particle size (l = 0.009 +/- 0.005 micrometer). These results provide a test of the theory for gas-particle reactions and further insight into the reactivity of atmospheric aerosol."
