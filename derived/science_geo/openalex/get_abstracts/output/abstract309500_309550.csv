https://openalex.org/W2037315935,"The total thermal conductivity lambda of resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogel monoliths has been measured as a function of density rho in the range from rho = 80 to 300 kilograms per cubic meter. A record-low conductivity value in air at 300 K of lambda approximately 0.012 watt per meter per kelvin was found for rho approximately 157 kilograms per cubic meter. Caloric measurements under variation of gas pressure as well as spectral infrared transmission measurements allowed the determination of solid conductivity, gaseous conductivity, and radiative conductivity as a function of density. The development of such low conductivity materials is of great interest with respect to the substitution of environmentally harmful insulating foams made from chlorofluorocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W1978285793,"Data were compiled on the distribution of mammal taxa (883 species, 242 genera, 45 families, and 10 orders) among South America's six major macrohabitats: lowland Amazon forest, western montane forests, Atlantic rain forest, upland semideciduous forest, southern mesophytic forest, and drylands. The drylands are the richest area in numbers of species supported and are more diverse than the other habitats, including the lowland Amazon rain forest, when endemics are considered. An analysis of number of endemic and nonendemic taxa versus size of area found a simple positive linear relationship: the drylands, almost twice as extensive as the Amazon lowlands, support more endemic taxa. Conservation plans that emphasize the wet tropics and fail to consider the drylands as special repositories of mammal diversity will be unable to preserve a significant number of novel taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2000772258,"A central problem in ecology is predicting the diversity of communities. Insect parasitoids may encompass 20 percent of all insect species; hence, establishing the mechanisms that drive parasitoid species richness represents a major step in understanding the diversity of terrestrial communities. An assemblage model, based on population dynamic constructs, shows how the presence of refuges from parasitoid attack can generate diversity patterns that are in good accord with global data on structural protection from parasitism resulting from host feeding biology. This theory offers a simple ecological explanation for the range of diversities observed in real parasitoid assemblages. Predicting parasitoid diversity may be a realistic goal, at least for those systems in which the basic demography is well understood."

https://openalex.org/W2091894121,"IN the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, vol. li., 1907, p. 101, I described observations on the gametogenesis of Nematus ribesii, some of which subsequent work has shown to be erroneous. Since my statements have been quoted in several recent papers, I think it necessary to correct the mistakes as far as possible, although I have not yet reached a satisfactory solution of the phenomena. The errors arose partly through misinterpretation of the phenomena observed and partly through imperfect fixation, for I find that, unless the material is very accurately fixed, the chromosomes tend to adhere together and give the appearance of a smaller number than the true one. The same cause has led other observers to make similar mistakes."
