https://openalex.org/W2125828985,"An unusual group of carcinomas, here termed nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinomas (NMC), are characterized by translocations that involve NUT, a novel gene on chromosome 15. In about 2/3rds of cases, NUT is fused to BRD4 on chromosome 19. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified two NMCs harboring novel rearrangements that result in the fusion of NUT to BRD3 on chromosome 9. The BRD3–NUT fusion gene encodes a protein composed of two tandem chromatin-binding bromodomains, an extra-terminal domain, a bipartite nuclear localization sequence, and almost the entirety of NUT that is highly homologous to BRD4–NUT. The function of NUT is unknown, but here we show that NUT contains nuclear localization and export sequences that promote nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling via a leptomycin-sensitive pathway. In contrast, BRD3–NUT and BRD4–NUT are strictly nuclear, implying that the BRD moiety retains NUT in the nucleus via interactions with chromatin. Consistent with this idea, FRAP studies show that BRD4, BRD4–NUT and BRD3–NUT have significantly slower rates of lateral nuclear diffusion than that of NUT. To investigate the functional role of BRD–NUT fusion proteins in NMCs, we investigated the effects of siRNA-induced BRD3–NUT and BRD4–NUT withdrawal. Silencing of these proteins in NMC cell lines resulted in squamous differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Together, these data suggest that BRD–NUT fusion proteins contribute to carcinogenesis by associating with chromatin and interfering with epithelial differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2053197719,"The energy-based refinement of low-resolution protein structure models to atomic-level accuracy is a major challenge for computational structural biology. Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models."
https://openalex.org/W2079864309,"SIRT1 is the closest mammalian homologue of yeast SIR2, an important ageing regulator that prolongs lifespan in response to caloric restriction. Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate SIRT1 activity are unclear. Our study identifies a novel post-translational modification of SIRT1, namely sumoylation at Lys 734. In vitro sumoylation of SIRT1 increased its deacetylase activity. Conversely, mutation of SIRT1 at Lys 734 or desumoylation by SENP1, a nuclear desumoylase, reduced its deacetylase activity. Stress-inducing agents promoted the association of SIRT1 with SENP1 and cells depleted of SENP1 (but not of SENP1 and SIRT1) were more resistant to stress-induced apoptosis than control cells. We suggest that stress-inducing agents counteract the anti-apoptotic activity of SIRT1 by recruiting SENP1 to SIRT1, which results in the desumoylation and inactivation of SIRT1 and the consequent acetylation and activation of apoptotic proteins."

Autophagy has been linked to a variety of pathological processes such as neurodegenerative diseases and tumorigenesis, which highlights its biological and medical importance. We have previously characterized the vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) gene, which is highly activated in acute pancreatitis, a disease associated with morphological changes resembling autophagy. Here we show that VMP1 expression triggers autophagy in mammalian cells. VMP1 expression induces the formation of ultrastructural features of autophagy and recruitment of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3), which is inhibited after treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methiladenine. VMP1 is induced by starvation and rapamycin treatments. Its expression is necessary for autophagy, because VMP1 small interfering RNA inhibits autophagosome formation under both autophagic stimuli. VMP1 is a transmembrane protein that co-localizes with LC3, a marker of the autophagosomes. It interacts with Beclin 1, a mammalian autophagy initiator, through the VMP1-Atg domain, which is essential for autophagosome formation. VMP1 endogenous expression co-localizes with LC3 in pancreas tissue undergoing pancreatitis-induced autophagy. Finally, VMP1 stable expression targeted to pancreas acinar cell in transgenic mice induces autophagosome formation. Our results identify VMP1 as a novel autophagy-related membrane protein involved in the initial steps of the mammalian cell autophagic process.

By morphological studies, autophagy has been linked to a variety of pathological processes such as neurodegenerative diseases and tumorigenesis, which highlights its biological and medical importance (4Hara T.

Early reports of autophagy in human disease include the ultrastructural autophagic features described in pancreas from human pancreatitis (11Helin H. Mero M. Markkula H. Helin M. Virchows Arch.

Autophagy is characterized by sequestration of bulk cytoplasm and organelles in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which eventually acquire lysosomal-like features (13Mizushima N.

However, despite the advances in understanding autophagy, autophagosome formation in mammalian cells is a complex process, and neither the molecular mechanisms nor all the implicated genes involved in its formation are fully elucidated (20Juhasz G.

The pancreatitis-associated protein named vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is a transmembrane protein with no known homologues in yeast. We identified the VMP1 transcript because it is highly activated in acinar cells early during experimental acute pancreatitis and its transient expression induced the formation of numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles in mammalian cells (22Dusetti N.J. Jiang Y. Vaccaro M.I. Tomasini R. Samir Azizi A. Calvo E.L. Ropolo A. Fiedler F. Mallo G.V. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). VMP1 mRNA in situ expression correlated with the formation of vacuoles in acinar cells during experimental acute pancreatitis and in the course of chronic pancreatitis in WBN/Kob rats (23Vaccaro M.I. Grasso D. Ropolo A. Iovanna J.L. Cerquetti M.C. Pancreatology. 2003; 3: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Jiang P.H. Motoo Y. Vaccaro M.I. Iovanna J.L. Okada G. Sawabu N. Pancreas. 2004; 29: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study we tested the hypothesis that VMP1 expression is involved in the autophagic process. We show that VMP1 is a novel autophagy-related membrane protein that triggers autophagosome formation in mammalian cells. VMP1 is induced by autophagy stimuli; it is required for autophagosome development and its expression triggers autophagy, even under nutrient-replete conditions. VMP1 interacts with Beclin 1 through its hydrophilic C-terminal region, which we named Atg domain because it is essential for autophagosome formation. We also show that VMP1 co-localizes with the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in vacuole membranes in pancreas tissue undergoing pancreatitis-induced autophagy. Finally, we found that VMP1 expression promotes the formation of LC3-positive vacuoles when specifically targeted to the pancreas acinar cells in transgenic mice. Mammalian Cell Lines, Transfections, and Treatments—Human HeLa, 293T and MCF7, and mouse NIH3T3 (ATCC) cell lines were used. Low-Beclin 1 levels in MCF7 cells were verified by Western blot. Cells were transfected using FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Plasmids were pcDNA4-V5-His (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), containing full-length rat VMP1 cDNA (NM_138839) (22Dusetti N.J. Jiang Y. Vaccaro M.I. Tomasini R. Samir Azizi A. Calvo E.L.

Full-length human Beclin 1 cDNA (NM_003766) was subcloned into pECFP-C1 (Clontech) within the EcoRI and SalI or into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) within EcoRI and ApaI restriction sites. pRFP-C1 containing full-length rat LC3 was kindly provided by Dr. Maria I. Colombo (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina). Cells were also transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen)-mediated transfer with siRNA pre-designed for human VMP1 mRNA using 5′-GGCAGAAUAUUGUCCUGUGtt-3′, as sense, and 5′-CACAGGACAAUAUUCUCUGCCtt-3′, as antisense (Ambion ID32935) and 24 h later, cells were subjected to autophagy stimuli for an additional 6-h period. For autophagy inhibition, cells were treated with 10 mm 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Sigma) 2 h before and during co-transfection with pcDNA4-VMP1 and pRFP-LC3. The efficacy of 3-MA treatment was verified on starved cells (data not shown). For lysosomal hydrolase inhibition, cells were treated with E64d (10 μg/ml) for 4 h before processed. Autophagy was induced by amino acid/serum-deprived medium using Earle's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) or 55 μm rapamycin (Calbiochem) treatments. Fluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope Nikon Eclypse 200 (Plan100×), an inverted fluorescence microscopy Olympus GX71, a confocal microscope Nikon Eclipse C1 (Plan40×/0.95 and Plan60×/1.40), or an inverted confocal microscope Olympus FV1000 (PLAPO N/1.42). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed without being brought into suspension and processed for transmission electron microscopy by standard procedures. Grids were examined under a Carl Zeiss C-10 electron microscope (Laboratorio Nacional de Investigación y Servicios en Microscopía Electrónica, University of Buenos Aires). Percentage of RFP-LC3 Cells with Punctate Staining—The number of cells with punctate staining per 100 fluorescent RFP-LC3 transfected cells was determined in three independent experiments. To quantify, the number of fluorescent cells with punctate staining was counted in six random fields representing 100 fluorescent cells and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of combined results. We consider an RFP-LC3 cell to have punctate staining when all the red fluorescence is present as punctate and no diffused protein remains. Recombinant GST-VMP1 Peptides and His6-Beclin 1 Protein—VMP1 hydrophilic peptides were amplified from pcDNA4-VMP1 by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain GST-VMP1 peptides. Peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Beclin 1 cDNA was obtained from HeLa cell total RNA extracts and cloned into pQE31 (Qiagen). His6-Beclin 1 was expressed in E. coli M15 and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Membrane Isolation—Cells were washed and homogenized with a motor driven Teflon pestle homogenizer in ice-cold SBE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Membrane pellets were resuspended in ice-cold SBE buffer and treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0, or 1.5 m NaCl. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were obtained by centrifugation, and retained proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using as secondary antibody a peroxidase-labeled IgG antibody provided with the ECL-kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed using the ECL kit and membranes were exposed to a Kodak BioMax film. Pulldown Assays—HeLa cells transfected with the pcDNA4-VMP1, pcDNA4-VMP1ΔAtg, and pcDNA4-empty plasmids were lysed by sonication and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, followed by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatants containing His-tagged proteins were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C, extensively washed with a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, and eluted with a buffer containing 120 mm imidazole. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. In another experiment His6-Beclin 1 produced in E. coli was incubated in nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads with the purified GST-VMP1 peptides. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—For the co-immunoprecipitation assays, the supernatant from lysates of pcDNA4-VMP1-transfected or rapamycin-treated cells were incubated with antisera bound to protein A-Sepharose™ Cl-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed extensively. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in a SDS sample buffer. Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to VMP1 against the peptide MAQSYAKRIQQRLNSEEKTK (residues 386-406) was obtained and used at 1:100 dilution. Polyclonal goat anti-LC3, goat anti-Beclin 1, rabbit anti-GST, monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibodies were used according manufacturer. Donkey anti-rabbit and anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 and 590, and rabbit anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 590 (Molecular Probes) antibodies were used for immunofluorescence. Peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG antibodies were used for Western blot according Amersham Biosciences. Caerulein-induced Pancreatitis—Male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were used. Animals were housed with free access to food and water. Experiments were performed according to the standard ethical and legal guidelines of the Administración Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnología Medica, University of Buenos Aires, and the European Union regulations for animal experiments. Pancreatitis was induced by seven intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (Sigma, 50 μg/kg) given at 1-h intervals; the rats were killed by decapitation at different times after the first injection. In one series of experiments, the pancreas were removed, homogenized in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin) and processed for Western blot analysis. In another series of experiments, the pancreas were removed, fixed in formalin buffer, and processed for immunofluorescence. Transgenic Mice—The transgene cassette was made using the pBEG vector (25Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Mladek A. Ellenrieder V. Folch-Puy E. Millar L. Urrutia R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression cassette contains the acinar-specific control region (-500 to +8) from the rat elastase I gene and the human growth hormone 3′-untranslated region (+500 to +2657). This construct was digested with BamHI, filled in, dephosphorylated, and ligated with rat VMP1-EGFP released from pEGFP-VMP1 plasmid. A 1940-kb HindIII/NotI fragment was isolated and used for microinjections into in-bred Friend virus B-type susceptibility zygotes. Genomic DNA was prepared and tested by Southern blot or PCR. VMP1 Expression Triggers Autophagy—To know if VMP1 triggers autophagy, we transfected HeLa cells with the expression plasmid pcDNA4-VMP1, which codes for the VMP1-V5 fusion protein. The pcDNA4-empty plasmid was used in controls. Cells were cultured in nutrient and grown factor-replete conditions and fixed in glutaraldehyde 24 h later to perform transmission electronic microscopy. We found that cells expressing VMP1 showed multiple autophagic features. Fig. 1A shows cup-shaped structures, double-membrane structures containing cytoplasmic material (autophagosome like structure), as well as single-membrane structures containing cytoplasmic constituents at different stages of degradation (autolysosome-like structure) (26Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 27Klionsky D.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 31-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The same morphological features were obtained when 293T cells were transfected with the VMP1-expression plasmid, and they did not differ from those obtained in rapamycin-treated cells (data not shown). During autophagy, the cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) undergoes C-terminal proteolytic and lipid modifications (LC3-II) and translocates from the cytosol to the autophagosomal membrane (28Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, 29Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). LC3 is currently used as a specific marker of autophagy (30Yoshimori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 31Klionsky D.J. Cuervo A.M. Seglen P.O. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 181-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To confirm the extent and specificity of VMP1 autophagosome induction, we first immunostained pcDNA4-VMP1-transfected 293T cells with a specific LC3 antibody, and we observed the recruitment of endogenous LC3 in punctate structures consistent with autophagy (Fig. 1B). Then, we investigated LC3-I and -II forms by Western blot (Fig. 1C). We found induction of LC3 with increased LC3-II form signal in pcDNA4-VMP1-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Because intra-autophagosomal LC3-II is degraded by lysosomal proteases, we blocked its proteolysis using the lysosomal protease inhibitor E64d (32Tanida I. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and we found that LC3-II signal was enhanced in VMP1-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, lane 4). In another series of experiments HeLa, 293T, and NIH3T3 cells cultured under nutrient and grown factor-replete conditions were concomitantly transfected with an expression plasmid encoding for the RFP-LC3 fusion protein and pcDNA4-VMP1 or pcDNA4-empty plasmids. Fig. 1D shows the recruitment of LC3 fusion protein in punctate structures in VMP1-transfected cells in contrast to the diffuse RFP-LC3 fusion protein signal observed in control cells. We determine the percentage of fluorescent RFP-LC3 cells with punctate staining in three independent experiments per cell line as under “Experimental Procedures.” We found high recruitment of LC3 in VMP1-transfected cells. Finally, we investigated the potential for inhibiting the pathway with an agent well documented to inhibit autophagy. The progression of the autophagy is sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors such as 3-MA, with the target being the Class III PI3K (33Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). We treated cells with 3-MA before the co-transfection with pRFP-LC3 and pcDNA4-VMP1 expression plasmids, and we found that the percentage of RFP-LC3 cells with punctate staining was low and almost the same as the observed in pcDNA4-empty transfected cells (Fig. 1D). These results collectively demonstrate that VMP1 expression triggers autophagy in mammalian cells, even under nutrient-replete conditions. VMP1 Expression Is Required for Extracellular Stimuli-induced Autophagy—The autophagy trafficking pathway was first described as a cellular adaptation to starvation (34Mitchener J.S. Shelburne J.D. Bradford W.D. Hawkins H.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1976; 83: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether starvation activates endogenous VMP1 expression, we developed a rabbit polyclonal anti-VMP1 antibody. We subjected HeLa cells to a standard starvation protocol (amino acid/serum-deprived medium) and then analyzed the time course of VMP1-mRNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2A) and of VMP1-protein expression by Western blot (Fig. 2B). VMP1 expression was activated under starvation, and it was evident after 2-h treatment. Moreover, starvation-induced VMP1 expression was detected in punctate structures by immunofluorescence, whereas it was almost not detectable under nutrient-replete conditions (Fig. 2C). mTOR kinase plays a central role in the amino acid pool-sensing mechanism. In response to starvation, mTOR is inhibited, resulting in the induction of autophagy (35Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Because mTOR can be inhibited by rapamycin, we treated HeLa cells with rapamycin as a pharmacological agent to induce autophagy. We found that mTOR inhibition induces VMP1-mRNA and VMP1-protein expression (Fig. 2, A-C). To establish whether VMP1 is required for autophagy, we reduced the expression of VMP1 using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy. HeLa cells were transfected with VMP1-siRNA and then subjected to standard starvation protocol or rapamycin treatment. VMP1 expression was efficiently knocked down (Fig. 2, D and E). We found that autophagosome formation was almost completely inhibited in VMP1-siRNA cells under both treatments, as evidenced by the distribution of the RFP-LC3 fluorescence fusion protein (Fig. 2F). We analyzed three independent experiments per treatment, and we found that the percentage of RFP-LC3 cells with punctate staining in VMP1-siRNA transfected cells was highly reduced in comparison with those transfected with scramble siRNA (Fig. 2F). These findings show that VMP1 expression is required for extracellular stimuli-induced autophagy. VMP1 Remains as a Membrane Protein during Autophagy—VMP1 primary structure predicts a transmembrane protein (22Dusetti N.J. Jiang Y. Vaccaro M.I. Tomasini R. Samir Azizi A. Calvo E.L. Ropolo A.

GFP moiety folds properly and becomes fluorescent only if a membrane protein is stably inserted into the membrane (36Wagner S. Bader M.L. Drew D. de Gier J.W. Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To verify if VMP1 remains in membrane structure we transfected cells with pEGFP-VMP1 expression plasmid, and cells were cultured in nutrient and grown factor-replete conditions. After 24 h the GFP fluorescence of the fusion protein VMP1-EGFP was observed in vacuole membranes induced by its own expression (Fig. 3A). We then analyzed whether VMP1 co-localizes with endogenous LC3 in the VMP1-induced vacuoles. We performed immunofluorescence using the anti-LC3 and anti-V5 antibodies in HeLa cells transfected with VMP1-V5 expression plasmid. We found a remarkable co-localization between VMP1-V5 fusion protein and endogenous LC3 in VMP1-induced vacuoles (Fig. 3B). To know if the endogenous VMP1 also remains as a membrane protein during autophagy, we performed subcellular fractioning of HeLa cells undergoing rapamycin-induced autophagy and investigated VMP1 in membrane preparations by Western blot. Fig. 3C shows that, although the protein is not detectable in untreated cells, VMP1 is found in the membrane preparations from cells undergoing autophagy, and the signal persists when membrane fractions are treated with 1.5 m NaCl or exposed to pH 11.0. These results indicate that VMP1 functions as a membrane protein during autophagy. VMP1 Is a Beclin 1-binding Protein—To obtain a mechanistic insight as to how VMP1 triggers autophagy, we analyzed its function in the molecular pathway of the autophagosome formation. During autophagy Beclin 1-Class III PI3K complex (37Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) is thought to undergo subcellular distribution to a membrane structure, which eventually leads to the recruitment of autophagy proteins and the proper conjugation of LC3 to membrane phospholipids (19Kihara A.

Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). However, the transmembrane protein with which Beclin 1 complex interacts remains elusive. To investigate if VMP1 is a target membrane protein with which Beclin 1 interacts, we first analyzed if Beclin 1 localizes in the membrane of the VMP1-induced vacuoles. We concomitantly transfected 293T cells with pEGFP-VMP1, pRFP-LC3, and pECFP-Beclin 1 expression plasmids (results are shown in Fig. 4A). We found a remarkable co-localization between VMP1, LC3, and Beclin 1 fluorescent fusion proteins, suggesting that Beclin 1 could attach to VMP1-induced vacuole membranes. Then, we studied if VMP1 interacts with Beclin 1. We performed a pulldown assay using the VMP1-V5-His6 fusion protein. Lysates prepared from HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA4-VMP1 were treated with Triton X-100 and incubated with nickel-agarose beads. After extensively washed, retained proteins were eluted with imidazole and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by anti-Beclin 1 or anti-V5 antibody immunoblotting. VMP1-V5 and Beclin 1 were found in eluates (Fig. 4B). Control experiments showed that neither Beclin 1 nor VMP1-V5 was detected in the elution fraction of pcDNA4-empty-transfected cells. In another series of experiments, lysates from pcDNA4-VMP1-transfected cells were incubated with the anti-Beclin 1 antibody. Controls were incubated with control serum. Immunoprecipitates were separated and immunoblotted for VMP1-V5 with anti-V5 antibody. VMP1-V5 was detected in Beclin 1 antibody-treated lysates but not in the controls (Fig. 4C). To analyze the physiological relevance of the VMP1-Beclin 1 interaction, we investigated whether endogenous VMP1 interacts with endogenous Beclin 1 in cells developing rapamycin-induced autophagy by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

In search for proteins that interact with the set and ring-associated (SRA) domain of ICBP90, we used the two-hybrid system and screened a placental cDNA library. Several clones coding for a new domain of DNMT1 were found. The interaction, between the ICBP90 SRA domain and the DNMT1 domain, has been confirmed with purified proteins by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down experiments. We checked whether ICBP90 and DNMT1 are present in the same macro-molecular complexes in Jurkat cells and immortalized human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVTs-SM1). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ICBP90 and DNMT1 are present in the same molecular complex, which was further confirmed by co-localization experiments as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Downregulation of ICBP90 and DNMT1 decreased VEGF gene expression, a major pro-angiogenic factor, whereas those of p16INK4A gene and RB1 gene were significantly enhanced. Together, these results indicate that DNMT1 and ICBP90 are involved in VEGF gene expression, possibly via an interaction of the SRA domain of ICBP90 with a novel domain of DNMT1 and an upregulation of p16INK4A. They further suggest a new role of ICBP90 in the relationship between histone ubiquitination and DNA methylation in the context of tumoral angiogenesis and tumour suppressor genes silencing."

Division of a bacterial cell is accomplished by the divisome, which is a transient assembly of a ring-like multiprotein structure at mid-cell. The components of the Escherichia coli divisome known so far include 12 essential proteins, FtsZ, FtsA, ZipA, FtsE, FtsX, FtsK, FtsQ, FtsB, FtsL, FtsW, PBP3 (FtsI), and FtsN, and the non-essential PBP1B, AmiC, EnvC, Tol, and Pal, which all have been shown to localize at mid-cell. Although the molecular mechanisms of the assembly and functioning of this dynamic cell division machine are largely unknown, a number of studies have revealed the existence of a network of protein-protein interactions between cell division proteins (1Goehring N.W.

Pecora N.D. Niki H. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1008-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). FtsN has a single transmembrane helix close to the N terminus, followed by the periplasmic part (Fig. 1). NMR analysis of the soluble, periplasmic part revealed the existence of three short α-helices in the region between amino acids 62 and 123 (numbers of the full-length protein), followed by a long, glutamine-rich, unstructured region (amino acids 129 to 225) and a small, globular C-terminal domain (amino acids 243 to 319) (28Yang J.C. Van Den Ent F. Neuhaus D. Brevier J. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain binds to murein but its function is unknown as it is not essential for cell division (23Ursinus A. van den Ent F. Brechtel S. de Pedro M. Höltje J.-V. Löwe J. Vollmer W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6728-6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Instead, the region of the membrane anchor plus the first ∼80 periplasmic amino acids appears to be the part of FtsN that is essential for cell division (23Ursinus A. van den Ent F.

Moreover, FtsN can be deleted in E. coli ftsA suppressor mutants, indicating that FtsN might not be a core divisome component (29Bernard C.S. Sadasivam M. Shiomi D. Margolin W. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 1289-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FtsN might have a stabilizing function on the divisome, but the precise role of FtsN in cell division remains unknown. We report here that FtsN interacts with the murein synthase PBP1B in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FtsN stimulates the murein synthesis activities of PBP1B in vitro. Thus, FtsN might have a role in coordinating the murein synthases during cell division in E. coli. Strains, Growth Medium, and Growth Conditions—Table 1 lists the E. coli strains used in this study.

Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a level of β-galactosidase activity at least 4-fold higher than that of DHM1 control strain (60–100 units/mg) is indicative of an interaction (2Karimova G. Dautin N. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2233-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Purification of Proteins and Antisera—The His-tagged form of PBP1Bγ (His-PBP1B) was purified from BL21(DE3) pDML924 as described (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E.

For surface plasmon resonance experiments, His-PBP1B was purified as described (30Terrak M. Ghosh T.K. van Heijenoort J. Van Beeumen J. Lampilas M. Aszodi J. Ayala J.A. Ghuysen J.M.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 350-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and concentrated in buffer A (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.7% CHAPS) on Microcon YM-30 Millipore to a concentration of 1.9 mg/ml. FtsN-ht was purified from BL21(DE3) pFE42 after growth in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. All buffers used for purification contained a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of antipain, pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). The membrane fraction was prepared (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Disteche M. den Blaauwen T. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow beads for 2 h. Unbound proteins were washed out with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 6.0, and with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The fractions containing FtsN-ht were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. The soluble FtsN variants were purified from BL21 AI cells harboring the corresponding overproduction plasmids upon 3–4 h of growth in the presence of 0.2% arabinose (28Yang J.C. Van Den Ent F. Neuhaus D. Brevier J. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by metal affinity chromatography as described for FtsN-ht but without Triton X-100. Antisera against PBP1A, PBP1B, PBP3, and FtsN were purified as described (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Disteche M. den Blaauwen T.

Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) was digested for 18 h at 37 °C with a soluble form of the membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase A (32van Straaten K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Vollmer W. Thunnissen A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES/maleate, pH 5.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl to release the 1,6-anhydromuropeptides. After boiling for 10 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. A 50% suspension of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) (200 μl) washed three times with ice-cold water and two times with coupling buffer (10 mm HEPES/maleate, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) was incubated with the 1,6-anhydromuropeptide solution. A control Affi-Gel sample received coupling buffer without murein fragments but with 0.1 m ethanolamine. The samples were incubated for 12 h at 6 °C, and the excess coupling sites were blocked by incubation with buffer containing 0.1 m ethanolamine for 3 h. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer (see above). For the pulldown experiments, an FtsN variant (4 μg) and PBP1B (2 μg) were incubated with the beads carrying 1,6-anhydromuropeptides in a total volume of 220 μl for 1 h at 4 °C. Control samples contained either beads without 1,6-anhydromuropeptides or no FtsN. The beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer (25 mm Tris/maleate, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.25% Triton X-100) and eluted with 120 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.25% Triton X-100). The proteins in the eluate were analyzed semi-quantitatively by dot blot analysis. For this, the eluates were dried on a nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunodetection and visualization by staining with chloronaphthol. The amount of FtsN and PBP1B in the eluates was estimated by comparison to signals of standard protein preparations with known concentration. Values from three independent pulldown experiments were averaged. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—A Biacore X® (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) apparatus was used to analyze the interaction between PBP1B and FtsN. Protein dilutions were made in the HBS running buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). FtsN-ht or FtsN58–319-ht was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit as recommended by BIAcore. The amount of immobilized protein was between 1000 and 2000 resonance units (1000 resonance units corresponds to ∼1 ng of FtsN/mm2). A control surface was treated in the same way but did not contain immobilized protein. Differences between the association-dissociation curves observed on the two surfaces indicated a specific interaction. Interaction studies were performed at 25 °C in HBS running buffer at a flow rate of 7 μl/min. His-PBP1B was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip as described previously (14Vollmer W. von Rechenberg M. Höltje J.-V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, ampicillin was coupled to the surface via its primary amino group, followed by the binding of PBP1B to the immobilized ampicillin via its active site for transpeptidation. After protein coupling the excess of ampicillin was hydrolyzed by an injection of 100 μl of 0.78 μm TEM β-lactamase. In Vivo Cross-linking and Co-immunoprecipitation Procedure—Strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. For depletion of FtsN, strain JOE565 was grown for ∼3.5 mass doublings in LB containing antibiotics and 0.2% glucose to an A578 of 0.5, followed by a 23-fold dilution into the same medium and grown to an A578 of 0.530 (4.5 mass doublings). The other strains (MC1061, TG4, EC549, and EC850, see Table 1) were grown for ∼4–6 mass doublings to an A578 of ∼0.6. All strains depleted of an Fts protein showed filamentous growth. Cross-linking of the cells and solubilization of the membrane proteins were done as described (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M.

Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Disteche M. den Blaauwen T. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W.

A special secondary antibody (Rabbit IgG TrueBlot; eBiosciences) was used for detection of PBP3. For the detection of PBP1B and FtsN, we used goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem, Merck) as secondary antibody. Both secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) using a detection kit from GE Healthcare. In Vitro Murein Synthesis Assay—In vitro murein synthesis experiments were performed as described (9Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Born P. Breukink E. Vollmer W. J. Biol.

Lipid II (11 μm, 22000 dpm) was vacuum-dried and dissolved on ice in 10 μl of 2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Samples contained 11 μm (100 dpm/μl) lipid II and 38 or 730 nm PBP1B (low or high concentration). Some of the samples contained 690 nm FtsN variants. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Preparation of muropeptides and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis were done as described (9Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38096-38101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Born P. Breukink E. Vollmer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26985-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other Methods—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and detection of proteins on the blot membrane with specific antisera were done as described before (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Disteche M. den Blaauwen T. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Coupling of proteins to CNBr-activated Sepharose, preparation of control columns for affinity chromatography, preparation of membrane fraction from E. coli cells, and the affinity chromatography experiments were done essentially as described (5Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Disteche M. den Blaauwen T. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6726-6734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, a membrane fraction from E. coli cells was applied on a Sepharose column containing immobilized protein (FtsN variants or PBP1B). After washing, the bound proteins were eluted successively with buffers containing 150 mm and 1 m NaCl, respectively. Control samples were prepared from the control column (lacking bound protein). Proteins present in the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose, and immunodetected. Because the sensitivity of detection of proteins by ECL is subject to day-to-day variation, the control samples were always applied on the same polyacrylamide gel as the samples, ensuring that gel electrophoresis, blotting, immunodetection, and ECL reaction (see above) occurred at similar conditions. The different FtsN variants used in this study are indicated in Fig. 1. To detect interactions between FtsN and other membrane proteins we performed affinity chromatography experiments with FtsN-ht (FtsN with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag) immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. Sepharose without coupled protein served as a control. A membrane fraction from strain JOE565 grown in the presence of glucose (thus depleted of FtsN) was applied to both columns. After washing, bound proteins were eluted in two steps with buffers containing 150 mm and 1 m salt, respectively. The murein synthases PBP1A, PBP1B, and PBP3 bound in significantly higher amounts to the FtsN-ht-Sepharose than to the control Sepharose (Fig. 2). Both isoforms of PBP1B (α and γ) bound to immobilized FtsN. The murein hydrolase AmiC did not bind to either column. Affinity chromatography was then performed with different soluble FtsN variants (see Fig. 1) linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose. PBP1B (α and γ) and PBP3 showed an affinity to immobilized FtsN58–319-ht, FtsN166–319-ht, and FtsN58–125-ht (Fig. 3). PBP1A and AmiC were not detected in the eluates (not shown). However, both proteins could be detected in small quantities in the eluates from the FtsN58–319-ht and FtsN166–319-ht columns after a 10-fold concentration of the sample (Fig. 3). The next affinity chromatography experiment was performed with PBP1B immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose. FtsN was specifically retained by PBP1B-Sepharose (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in these experiments, we frequently detected a double (or triple) band with the α-FtsN antiserum indicating a possible cl"

A striking example is the biogenesis of the photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids) in plastids of plants. Lipid biosynthetic enzymes at the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner and outer plastid envelope membranes are involved. This compartmentalization requires extensive lipid trafficking. Mutants of Arabidopsis are available that are disrupted in the incorporation of endoplasmic reticulum-derived lipid precursors into thylakoid lipids. Two proteins affected in two of these mutants, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 1 (TGD1) and TGD2, encode the permease and substrate binding component, respectively, of a proposed lipid translocator at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Here we describe a third protein of Arabidopsis, TGD3, a small ATPase proposed to be part of this translocator. As in the tgd1 and tgd2 mutants, triacylglycerols and trigalactolipids accumulate in a tgd3 mutant carrying a T-DNA insertion just 5′ of the TGD3 coding region. The TGD3 protein shows basal ATPase activity and is localized inside the chloroplast beyond the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Proteins orthologous to TGD1, -2, and -3 are predicted to be present in Gram-bacteria, and the respective genes are organized in operons suggesting a common biochemical role for the gene products. Based on the current analysis, it is hypothesized that TGD3 is the missing ATPase component of a lipid transporter involving TGD1 and TGD2 required for the biosynthesis of ER-derived thylakoid lipids in Arabidopsis.

Interorganellar non-vesicular lipid trafficking in plant cells is required for the biogenesis of the characteristic plant cell organelle, the chloroplast (1Benning C. Xu C. Awai K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The predominant polar lipids found in the photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids) of chloroplasts are the galactoglycerolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) 3The abbreviations used are: Col-2, Columbia-2; NAP11, non-intrinsic ABC protein 11; TGDG, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; DGDG, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PtdOH, phosphatidic acid; ABC, ATP binding cassette; MS, mass spectrometry. and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) (2Dörmann P. Benning C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 112-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Their final assembly from diacylglycerol and UDP-galactose requires two lipid galactosyltransferases, which in the model plant Arabidopsis are designated MGD1 and DGD1 (3Benning C. Ohta H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2397-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Of these two enzymes MGD1 is associated with the outside of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the bulk of MGDG formation (5Jarvis P. Dörmann P. Peto C.A. Lutes J. Benning C. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8175-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whereas DGD1 is located on the outside of the outer chloroplast envelope membrane (6Froehlich J.E. Benning C. Dörmann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31806-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is required for the bulk of DGDG biosynthesis (7Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol moiety of the galactoglycerolipids is either synthesized de novo in the plastid or it is assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and needs to be imported into the plastid (8Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 97-132Crossref Google Scholar). Understanding this complexity of subcellular organization of glycerolipid biosynthesis in plants and the underlying lipid trafficking phenomena still poses some of the biggest challenges of modern plant biochemistry. The recent isolation and characterization of genetic suppressors of the DGDG-deficient dgd1 mutant of Arabidopsis has provided the first components, TGD1 and TGD2, of a potential lipid transport complex associated with the inner chloroplast envelope membrane in Arabidopsis (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Xu C. Fan J. Riekhof W. Froehlich J.E. Benning C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The TGD1 protein is similar to the permease component of bacterial ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and the Arabidopsis tgd1 mutant shows a complex lipid phenotype; that is, the accumulation of oligogalactolipids and triacylglycerols, a disruption of the assembly of galactolipids from ER-derived precursors, and the elevation of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) levels (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Xu C. Fan J. Riekhof W. Froehlich J.E. Benning C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The name of the mutants, tgd (trigalactosyldiacylglycerol), refers to the characteristic accumulation of oligogalactolipids. Presumably, this is a secondary phenotype due to the activation of a processive galactosyl transferase of unknown function, for which the gene has not yet been identified. The accumulation of PtdOH and reduced incorporation of labeled PtdOH into galactoglycerolipids by isolated tgd1 chloroplasts led to the suggestion that TGD1 is involved in the transport of PtdOH through the inner chloroplast envelope membrane (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The TGD2 protein is similar to membrane-tethered substrate-binding proteins associated with bacterial ABC transporters (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although not as extensively characterized as the tgd1 mutant, the Arabidopsis tgd1 and tgd2 mutants have a nearly identical lipid phenotype in all aspects tested. Moreover, the recombinant TGD2 protein lacking the single membrane-spanning domain specifically binds PtdOH (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The nearly identical phenotypes of the two mutants and the organization of bacterial orthologs of TGD1 and TGD2 in operons (Fig. 1A) strongly suggest that both are involved in a common biochemical or cell biological process. Moreover, the specific binding of PtdOH to TGD2 corroborates the hypothesis that the two proteins are components of a PtdOH transporter at the inner chloroplast envelope. Unlike other eukaryotic ABC transporters or the MsbA lipid transporter from Escherichia coli (11Doerrler W.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the TGD1 protein lacks an ATP binding domain. However, the Arabidopsis genome contains 26 genes encoding putative small ATPases with either one or two nucleotide binding domains (12Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that one of these could encode a small ATPase potentially associated with the TGD1 protein. Here we describe the identification and biochemical characterization of TGD3, the small ATPase protein proposed to be associated with TGD1 and TGD2. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and tgd1 and tgd2 mutant plants (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were of the ecotype Columbia-2 (Col-2). The following T-DNA insertion lines were made available by the Salk Institute Genome Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL) and were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University: SALK_027270 At4g33460, SALK_129048 At5g60790, SALK_029696 At5g09930, SALK_113472 At5g64840, SALK_116866 At5g14100, SALK_055996 At1g32500, and SALK_040335 At1g65410. Homozygous mutant lines were screened and used for all experiments. Seeds were surface-sterilized and grown on 0.8% (w/v) agar-solidified Murashige-Skoog medium (13Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53969) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose for 5 days. Wild-type and mutant seedlings of similar developmental stage were then transferred to a fresh Murashige-Skoog agar plate with 1% sucrose and grown for three additional weeks before lipid analysis. Genotyping and Complementation—The TGD3 open reading frame was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (standard conditions) from mRNA preparations using RNeasy and Omniscript kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the primers 5′-ACGGTACCATGCTTTCGTTATCATGCTC-3′ and 5′-CTGGTACCCTAGTATCTGATTGGTCCAT-3′. The PCR products were ligated into pGEM-Teasy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The resulting plasmids were digested with KpnI and inserted into pCAMBIA1300 (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) followed by transformation into Agrobacterium. Plants were transformed by the floraldip method (14Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and screened for resistance to hygromycin B (25 μg/ml) on agar-solidified Murashige-Skoog medium. For an estimation of TGD3 transcript levels by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, RNA was isolated from Col-2 wild-type and tgd3 mutant plants, and reverse transcription was done using oligo(dT)12-18 primers (Invitrogen). The TGD3-specific primers mentioned above were used for the PCR reaction. The abundance of ubiquitin (UBQ10) was tested for control purposes. The following UBQ10-specific primers were used: 5′-TCAATTCTCTCTACCGTGATCAAGATGCA-3′ and 5′-GTGTCAGAACTCTCCACCTCAAGAGTA-3′. For genotyping during the complementation analysis, DNA was prepared from 4-week-old plants, and the following primers were used: T-DNA left border primer (LB), 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAAC-3′; P1, 5′-AACTGATTGGGACGAGTATC-3′; P2, 5′-GCTATGCAACAGCAAGAGAC-3′. The PCR conditions were 94 °C 3 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, 54 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min followed by a final step of 5 min at 72 °C. Lipid Assays—Lipids were extracted from 4-week-old Col-2 wild-type and tgd3 mutant seedlings grown on Murashige-Skoog medium with 1% sucrose. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared as previously described (15Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and quantified by gas chromatography according to Rossak et al. (16Rossak M. Schäfer A. Xu N. Gage D.A. Benning C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Polar lipids were analyzed on activated ammonium sulfate-impregnated (15Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) silica gel TLC plates (Si250PA; Mallinckrodt Baker) developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (85/25/10/4, v/v). Neutral lipids were separated on untreated TLC plates developed with petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid (80/20/1, v/v). Lipids were visualized by brief exposure to iodine vapor or staining with α-naphthol to detect glycolipids (17Benning C. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The fatty acid compositions at the sn-2 position of individual lipids were determined using Rhizopus lipase (Sigma) digestion according to Siebertz and Heinz (18Siebertz H.P. Heinz E. Z. Naturforsch. 1977; 32: 193-205Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with modifications as described in Miquel et al. (19Miquel M. Cassagne C. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were formed from lyso-lipids, and the fatty acid methyl esters were quantified by gas chromatography. Mass Spectrometry—Lipid extracts were characterized using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) on a Waters LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with Shimadzu LC-20AD pumps and SIL-5000 autosampler. Extracts were analyzed using V-mode operation and electrospray ionization in both positive and negative ion modes similar to described protocols (20Houjou T. Yamatani K. Imagawa M. Shimizu T. Taguchi R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) except that, in place of MS/MS spectra, mass spectra were acquired in alternating acquisition functions at low (15 V) and high (75 V) potentials on aperture one to generate spectra with and without in-source collision-induced dissociation. The latter conditions allow for production of characteristic fragment ions that support structure assignments. High performance liquid chromatography separations were performed using a Restek Allure C18 column (1 × 150 mm) and a ternary gradient based on (a) 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate, (b) methanol, and (c) 2-propanol. Subcellular Localization Assays—For the generation of a green fluorescent protein fusion construct, the entire coding region of At1g65410 was inserted into the KpnI site of pCAMBIA1300GFP (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-ACGGTACCATGCTTTCGTTATCATGCTC-3′ and 5′-CTGGTACCGTATCTGATTGGTCCAT-3′. Transient expression of the construct in tobacco and microscopy of the resulting transgenic leaves was performed as previously described (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For the in vitro import experiments using pea chloroplasts the same conditions and treatments were used as published for the localization of the MGD1 protein (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recombinant MBP-ΔTGD3 Protein Production and Purification—The coding sequence for TGD3 leading to a truncated protein missing 46 N-terminal amino acids (designated as ΔTGD3) was PCR-amplified. As template, the pGEM-Teasy plasmid derivative mentioned above was used in combination with primers 5′-GGATCCTGCATAGCTCCACCTCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTAGTATCTGATTGGTCCATCG-3′. The fragment was inserted into pGEM-Teasy (Promega) and sequenced. This plasmid served as template for F94A mutagenesis by using the forward/reverse primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The forward and reverse primers for F94A are 5′-GTAGAGATGTCTATAAATCGGCGGGGGAGAAACATATCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGATATGTTTCTCCCCCGCCGATTTATAGACATCTCTAC-3′. The underlined sequences are codons for the mutated residue (alanine). After digestion with BamHI and SalI, either the wild type ΔTGD3 or the mutant ΔTGD3F94A fragment was inserted 3′ of the E. coli malE coding sequence into the pMalc2x vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to generate the maltose-binding protein fusion proteins MBP-ΔTGD3 or MBP-ΔTGD3F94A. For recombinant protein production, a 500-ml culture was grown at 37 °C, inoculated with 2 ml of an overnight culture. The protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.4-0.6 and incubated at 28 °C for 4 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Crude lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was loaded onto an amylose column (New England Biolabs). Fusion proteins were purified according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE. After purification, samples were stored at 4 °C for a few weeks without significant loss of activity. Assay for ATPase Activity—Purified MBP-ΔTGD3 protein was assayed for ATPase activity at a protein concentration of ∼0.5-8 μm in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). The MBP-ΔTGD3 protein was diluted in assay buffer to a final volume of 25 μl. To initiate the reaction, 25 μl of ATP in the assay buffer ranging from 0 to 2 mm (diluted from a 10 mm stock made in the same assay buffer) were added, giving a final ATP concentration of 0 to 1 mm. ATPase reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time and stopped by the addition of 50 μl 12% SDS. Released Pi was quantified by a colorimetric method, as described by Chifflet et al. (22Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) using potassium phosphate as the standard. After the addition of SDS, 100 μl of a solution containing equal volumes of 12% ascorbic acid in 1 m HCl and 2% ammonium molybdate were added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. This was followed by the addition of 150 μl of a solution composed of 2% sodium citrate, 2% sodium meta-arsenite, and 2% acetic acid. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, absorbance was measured at 850 nm. The assay was linear in the range of 0-25 nmol of Pi. The activity was corrected for nonenzymatic release of Pi from ATP and for Pi contamination by subtracting absorbance readings obtained in the absence of protein and ATP, respectively. A vector expressing only MBP was used to control for endogenous ATPase activity from E. coli. The kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation Vo = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]) using Microcal Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Identification of TGD3 by Genomics and Reverse Genetics—Bacterial genes involved in the same biochemical process are commonly linked in operons. This fact has been successfully exploited in genome annotation or the identification of individual genes (23Osterman A. Overbeek R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the location of TGD1 and TGD2 encoding homologs in bacterial operons (Fig. 1A) adjacent to putative ABC proteins suggests that these are the ABC components of the respective transport complex. Based on comparative genomics, it seemed likely that Arabidopsis has an ABC protein associated with the TGD1/2 transporter. An extensive and possibly complete inventory of transport ATPases and non-intrinsic ABC proteins potentially associated with membrane transporters in Arabidopsis has been published (12Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) listing 26 soluble nucleotide binding domain proteins. Because TGD1 and TGD2 are associated with the inner chloroplast membrane, which is homologous to the bacterial cell membrane, we expected that the respective ABC protein was localized on the inside of the inner chloroplast membrane requiring an N-terminal chloroplast targeting sequence. Nine of the above-mentioned ABC proteins were predicted to be targeted to the plastid using ChloroP (24Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar): At1g32500, At1g65410, At3g10670, At4g04770, At4g33460, At5g09930, At5g14100, At5g60790, At5g64840. For seven (listed under “Experimental Procedures”) of these candidate genes, T-DNA inactivation lines (25Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N. Deen H. Geralt M. Hazari N. Hom E. Karnes M. Mulholland C. Ndubaku R. Schmidt I.

Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar) were available at the time and were selfed and selected for homozygosity. The homozygous mutant lines were tested for the presence of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, which is diagnostic for mutants with impaired TGD1 or TGD2 function. Only one inactivation line (SALK_040335) carrying a T-DNA 5′ of the presumed ATG start codon of Arabidopsis gene At1g65410 (Fig. 2A) showed accumulation of the oligogalactolipid (Figs. 2D and 3B). This mutant was clearly leaky as the abundance of the respective mRNA estimated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was only partially reduced in the T-DNA line (Fig. 2B). A completely disrupted allele was not available (see also below).FIGURE 3Lipid phenotype of the tgd3 mutant compared with the tgd1, tgd2 mutant, and Col-2 wild type. Total lipids were extracted from 4-week-old seedlings grown on Murashige-Skoog agar plates containing 1% sucrose and separated by thin-layer chromatography. A, thin-layer chromatogram of neutral lipids. Lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. B, thin-layer chromatogram of polar lipids. Lipids were visualized by sugar-specific α-naphthol staining. O, origin; PIG, pigments; TAG, triacylglycerol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the mutant phenotype was not due to secondary mutations, a wild-type cDNA was expressed in the homozygous T-DNA line disrupted in At1g65410. Two transgenic homozygous T-DNA lines lacking the accumulation of the oligogalactolipid are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. The restoration of the wild-type phenotype in the homozygous T-DNA lines by the corresponding wild-type cDNA confirmed that the accumulation of oligogalactolipids in the T-DNA lines was due to the disruption of the At1g65410 locus. From here on, the SALK_040335 line will be referred to as tgd3 mutant line (carrying the here characterized tgd3-1 mutant allele). The At1g65410-encoded protein was previously designated Non-intrinsic ABC Protein 11 (NAP11) (12Sanchez-Fernandez R. Davies T.G. Coleman J.O. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30231-30244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and will be referred to here as trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 3 (TGD3) fitting more closely with its function. Comparing the amino acid sequence of TGD3 with proteins encoded by bacterial genomes using BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar), ABC protein-encoding open reading frames adjacent to putative TGD1/2 homologs provided some of the best hits, with putative TGD3 homologs from Cyanobacteria, e.g. Synechococcus (Fig. 1A), showing 52% identity and the E. coli homolog 32% identity. The tgd3 Mutant Shares a Complex Lipid Phenotype with Other tgd Mutants—It is important to note that all three tgd mutant alleles (tgd1-1, tgd2-1, tgd3-1) analyzed thus far and discussed here are leaky, leading to attenuated phenotypes. More severe impairment of the system as previously shown for TGD1 causes embryo-lethality (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) making fully gene-disrupted mutants currently inaccessible to analysis. If the TGD3 protein indeed is part of a lipid transport complex along with TGD1 and TGD2, mutant lipid phenotypes for all three loci should be similar. Therefore, leaf lipid extracts from the tgd1, tgd2, and the tgd3 lines were compared by thin-layer chromatography of neutral (Fig. 3A) and polar lipids (Fig. 3B). The tgd3 mutant extracts contained a lipid co-migrating with triacylglycerol (Fig. 3A), previously identified in the tgd1 mutant (4Xu C. Fan J. Froehlich J.E. Awai K. Benning C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3094-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and shown also to accumulate in tgd2 mutant extracts (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, polar lipid extracts of the tgd3 mutant contained a new lipid staining with α-naphthol, which is diagnostic for the presence of hexoses (Fig. 3B). This lipid co-chromatographed with authentic trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (TGDG) accumulating in tgd1 and tgd2. Further confirmation of the identities of TGDG and triacylglycerol lipids was provided by liquid chromatography/MS analyses of leaf extracts of Col-2 wild type and tgd3 mutants (Fig. 4, A-C). Extracted ion chromatograms generated in negative ion mode yielded a strong peak at m/z 1129.6 for the tgd3 mutant corresponding to [M+acetate]- for TGDG 34:6, which was the dominant TGDG lipid detected, but minimal amounts in the wild-type extracts. The in-source collision-induced dissociation spectra supported this assignment in the form of a fragment ion at m/z 277 corresponding to the C18:3 fatty acid anion. Triacylglycerols were characterized using positive ion electrospray ionization, displaying peaks at m/z 892.7 to 902.8 corresponding to [M+NH4]+ of triacylglycerols with 54 carbons and a total number of double bonds ranging from 3 to 8 (Fig. 4F). Extracted ion chromatograms for signals in the range of m/z 890-905 showed about 5-fold greater signal in the tgd3 mutant than the wild type (Fig. 4, D and E). Ion abundances for both TGDG and triacylglycerol lipid peaks were consistent with quantitative analysis of fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection. The overall lipid composition of the tgd3 mutant differed from that of the wild type as shown in Fig. 5A. Most notably, the relative amounts of the major chloroplast lipids MGDG and DGDG were decreased, whereas the presumed precursor of galactolipids derived from the ER pathway, phosphatidylcholine (8Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 97-132Crossref Google Scholar), was more abundant. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of MGDG and DGDG revealed distinct changes in the fatty acid profiles in tgd3 as compared with the wild type (Fig. 5, B and C). Most notably, fatty acids were generally more saturated, and 18:3 fatty acid content was reduced. Moreover, the tgd3 fatty acid profile changes were very similar to those observed for the tgd1 and tgd2 mutants (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In general, the tgd mutants impaired in the ER pathway have an increased 16-carbon-to-18-carbon fatty acid ratio (9Awai K. Xu C. Tamot B. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10817-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in their galactolipids. This is particularly visible for DGDG, which is to a large extent derived from the ER pathway (27Heinz E. Roughan G. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 273-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the 16-carbon-to-18-carbon ratio for the digalactolipid increased from 0.29 to 0.76 in the tgd3 mutant (Fig. 5C). This phenomenon is due to the substrate specificities of the different acyltransferases in the plastid and the ER leading to 18-carbon fatty acids at the sn-1 position and 16-carbon fatty acids at the sn-2 position of the diacylglycerol backbone for plas"

https://openalex.org/W2000045576,"The central pathogenic event of prion disease is the conformational conversion of a host protein, PrPC, into a pathogenic isoform, PrPSc. We previously showed that the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique can be used to form infectious prion molecules de novo from purified native PrPC molecules in an autocatalytic process requiring accessory polyanions (Deleault, N. R., Harris, B. T., Rees, J. R., and Supattapone, S. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 9741-9746). Here we investigated the molecular mechanism by which polyanionic molecules facilitate infectious prion formation in vitro. Ina PMCA reaction lacking PrPSc template seed, synthetic polyA RNA molecules induce hamster HaPrPC to adopt a protease-sensitive, detergent-insoluble conformation reactive against antibodies specific for PrPSc. During PMCA, labeled nucleic acids form nuclease-resistant complexes with HaPrP molecules. Strikingly, purified HaPrPC molecules subjected to PMCA selectively incorporate an approximately 1-2.5-kb subset of [32P]polyA RNA molecules from a heterogeneous mixture ranging in size from approximately 0.1 to >6 kb. Neuropathological analysis of scrapie-infected hamsters using the fluorescent dye acridine orange revealed that RNA molecules co-localize with large extracellular HaPrP aggregates. These findings suggest that polyanionic molecules such as RNA may become selectively incorporated into stable complexes with PrP molecules during the formation of native hamster prions."

Iron is a cofactor for many redox-dependent enzymes and thus essential for most living organisms including bacteria. But despite its abundance on earth, iron is not freely available to microorganisms under aerobic conditions, as it forms poorly soluble ferric hydroxides in the environment or is tightly bound to transport and storage proteins in mammalian hosts. To acquire iron, bacteria have evolved sophisticated strategies, the most common of which is the production of iron-chelating molecules termed siderophores (1Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 2Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Under iron-limiting growth conditions these molecules are secreted to the environment where they chelate ferric iron and deliver it to the bacterial cytoplasm via specific membrane-associated receptor proteins.The siderophore pyochelin, which is the focus of this study, was isolated in the late 1970s from iron-deficient cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (strain PAO1), and its chemical structure was established as 2-(2-o-hydroxyphenyl-2-thiazolin-4-yl)-3-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (3Cox C.D.

Microbiol. 2005; 58: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Pyochelin has also been isolated from other pseudomonads and closely related bacteria (25Budzikiewicz, H. (2003) in Progress in the Chemistry of Organic Natural Products (Herz, W., Falk, H., and Kirby, G. W., eds), Vol. 87, Springer, WienGoogle Scholar, 26Castignetti D. Curr.

Microbiol. 1986; 23: 560-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) although the configuration of the three chiral centers was not always determined. Interestingly, we discovered that the PchE peptide synthetase of the sequenced Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf-5 (30Paulsen I.T. Press C.M. Ravel J. Kobayashi D.Y. Myers G.S.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) lacks the epimerase domain required to generate the R configuration at the asymmetric center C4′, which prompted us to analyze the pyochelin cluster of the closely related P. fluorescens strain CHA0 and to elucidate the structure of the molecule that it specified. Here we report that CHA0 and Pf-5 synthesize the enantiomer of pyochelin for which we propose the name enantio-pyochelin (Fig. 1). We show that enantio-pyochelin promotes growth under iron-limiting conditions and induces the expression of its biosynthetic genes in CHA0, but is not recognized as a siderophore and signaling molecule by P. aeruginosa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Metal-free silica was obtained by gentle stirring of Merck Geduran Kieselgel Si 60 (40–63 μm) with 1 n HCl at 25 °C for 12 h. The resulting suspension was filtered and washed several times with MilliQ water until the pH of the filtrate was between 5 and 6. The silica was then dried, first under reduced pressure and afterward in an oven at 110 °C for 48 h.Media and Growth Conditions—Bacteria were routinely grown on nutrient agar and in nutrient yeast broth (31Stanisich V.A. Holloway B.W. Genet. Res. Camb. 1972; 19: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) at 37 °C (P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) or 30 °C(P. fluorescens). For (enantio-) pyochelin production and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 2The abbreviation used is: GFP, green fluorescent protein. reporter assays, strains were cultivated in the complex medium GGP (32Carmi R. Carmeli S. Levy E. Gough F.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in which iron is present but not immediately accessible (probably because it is bound to proteins and peptides), thus inducing the expression of (enantio-) pyochelin biosynthesis and uptake genes. As siderophore-negative mutants grow well in GGP, the minimal medium M9 (33Sambrook, J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) with 0.5% glycerol as a carbon source was used for siderophore utilization assays. Iron limitation was achieved in this medium by adding the iron chelator 2, 2′-dipyridyl at 500 μm. Antibiotics were added to the growth media at the following concentrations: tetracycline 25 μgml–1 for E. coli and 125 μgml–1 for Pseudomonas. To counterselect E. coli donor cells in gene replacement experiments, chloramphenicol was used at a concentration of 10 μgml–1; mutant enrichment was performed with tetracycline at a final concentration of 20 μgml–1 and carbenicillin (for P. aeruginosa) or cycloserine (for P. fluorescens) at final concentrations of 2 mg ml–1 and 50 mg ml–1, respectively.DNA Manipulation and Sequencing—Small- and large-scale preparations of plasmid DNA were made with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and Jetstar kit (Genomed GmbH), respectively. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels with the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA) or the MinElute and QIAquick Gel Extraction kits from Qiagen (Qiagen, Inc.). DNA manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (33Sambrook, J., and Russell, D. W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Transformation of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. fluorescens was carried out by electroporation (34Farinha M.A. Kropinski A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 221-225PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs involving PCR techniques were verified by sequence analysis. Sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI-PRISM 373 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or was carried out commercially. The DNA sequence of the P. fluorescens CHA0 pchR-pchDHIEFKCBA genomic region was deposited at GenBank™ under accession number EU088199. Sequences were compared with those from P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. fluorescens Pf-5. Data base searches were conducted at NCBI using BLAST algorithms.Mutant Construction—Deletion of the enantio-pyochelin biosynthesis operon pchDHIEFKCBA in P. fluorescens was achieved by gene replacement as described previously (35Laville J. Blumer C. von Schroetter C. Gaia V. Défago G. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schnider U. Keel C. Blumer C. Troxler J. Défago G. Haas D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5387-5392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suicide plasmid pME7535 was constructed as follows. Two PCR fragments were generated from chromosomal DNA of P. fluorescens CHA0 (37Voisard, C., Bull, C., Keel, C., Laville, J., Maurhofer, M., Schnider, U., Défago, G., and Haas, D. (1994) in Molecular Ecology of Rhizosphere Microorganisms (O'Gara, F., Dowling, D., and Boesten, eds), pp. 67–89, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar) using the primers pchD-1 (ACGTGGTACCATGTCCACTTTCGATGACC) together with primer pchD-3 (ACGTGGATCCGGTGGAGCCGCCGGAGGC) and pchA-1 (ACGTGGATCCGGCACCCTCAACACCGTGG) together with primer pchA-2 (ACGTAAGCTTCTACAGGGAGAGGCCGAGC). Fragment 1, cleaved with KpnI and BamHI, was ligated to BamHI- and HindIII-trimmed fragment 2 and cloned into the suicide vector pME3087 (37Voisard, C., Bull, C., Keel, C., Laville, J., Maurhofer, M., Schnider, U., Défago, G., and Haas, D. (1994) in Molecular Ecology of Rhizosphere Microorganisms (O'Gara, F., Dowling, D., and Boesten, eds), pp. 67–89, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, GermanyGoogle Scholar) between the KpnI and HindIII sites. Plasmid pME7535 was then introduced into the wild-type strain CHA0 and its pyoverdine-negative derivative CHA400 (38Keel C. Voisard C. Berling C.H. Kahr G. Défago G. Phytopathology. 1989; 79: 584-589Crossref Google Scholar) to generate the corresponding mutants CHA1084 and CHA1085, respectively.The pyoverdine and pyochelin-negative P. aeruginosa mutant PAO6399 was constructed with the previously described suicide plasmid pME7152 (39Michel L. Bachelard A. Reimmann C. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which was mobilized from E. coli S17-1 (40Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio-technology. 1983; 1: 784-790Crossref Scopus (5593) Google Scholar) to the pchE deletion mutant PAO6310 (14Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and chromosomally integrated with selection for tetracycline resistance. Excision of the vector was obtained by enrichment for tetracycline-sensitive cells (41Ye R.W. Haas D. Ka J.O. Krishnapillai V. Zimmermann A. Baird C. Tiedje J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3606-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All gene replacement mutants were checked by PCR. The absence of siderophore production by CHA1085 and PAO6399 was verified on CAS agar (42Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar).Construction of GFP Reporters—Translational fusions of pchD (CHA0) and pchE (PAO) to the gfp gene carried by the vector pPROBE-TT′ (43Miller W.G. Leveau J.H.J. Lindow S.E. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) were constructed by overlap extension PCR as follows. A 0.4-kb PCR fragment 1 was amplified from CHA0 chromosomal DNA using the primers PB1 (ACGTGAATTCATGGCGAACTCCCTGTGG) and PB9 (GCTGTCTCCTGATGTTTTTTACG) and a 0.23-kb PCR fragment 2 was amplified from pPROBE-TT′ using the primers PB11 (AAAAAACATCAGGAGACAGCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC) and PB4 (GCCGTTTCATATGATCTGGG). Fragments 1 and 2, which are complementary to each other over a length of 20 nucleotides, were mixed in equimolar amounts, elongated during 10 PCR cycles with Taq polymerase and dNTPs and subsequently amplified during 20 PCR cycles with primers PB1 and PB4. The resulting PCR fragment C was cleaved with EcoRI and NdeI and ligated to pPROBE-TT′ cut with the same enzymes. This yielded the pchDCHA0–gfp reporter construct pME7585. The pchEPAO–gfp reporter plasmid pME7588 was constructed in a similar way. PCR fragment 1 (0.34 kb) was amplified from chromosomal DNA of PAO1 using the primers pchEgfp1 (ACGTGAATTCCTGCAGGAATACCGCCTG) and pchEgfp2 (GGGGGCTCCCTAGGGCAAGC) and PCR fragment 2 (0.23 kb) was amplified from pPROBE-TT′ with primers pchEgfp3 (GCTTGCCCTAGGGAGCCCCCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC) and PB4. Subsequent overlap extension PCR yielded a 0.57-kb fragment, which was cleaved with EcoRI and NdeI and cloned into pPROBE-TT′.Extraction and Purification of (Enantio-) pyochelin—Enantio-pyochelin was extracted and purified from CHA400 as follows. The cell-free supernatant from a 2-day culture grown in GGP medium was acidified to pH 1–2 and extracted with 1 volume ethyl acetate. For thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometry, and polarimetric measurements, this extract was washed successively with 0.5 n HCl and MilliQ water. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. Solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting orange oily residue was purified by chromatography on a metal-free silica gel column eluted with a 90:10 CH2Cl2/acetone mixture. Enantio-pyochelin was obtained as a pale yellow powder after evaporation of solvents under reduced pressure.For use in NMR experiments, chiral HPLC, and bioassays, the crude ethyl acetate extract was dried by evaporation, dissolved in methanol and further purified by HPLC using a VP 250/10 Nucleosil 100-7 C18 preparative column (Macherey-Nagel) and a Waters™ HPLC system equipped with a 2487 Dual λ Absorbance Detector. Aliquots (300 μl) were injected into the HPLC system and separated at room temperature using an isocratic gradient consisting of 70% Solvent A (H2O + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 30% Solvent B (95% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two peaks with maximal absorbance at 235 and 260 nm (absorbance of the thiazoline ring) were collected and dried by evaporation. These peaks with retention times of 16 and 24 min, correspond to the two diastereoisomers of enantio-pyochelin as determined by NMR, chiral HPLC, and bioassays (see “Results”). Extraction and purification of pyochelin from P. aeruginosa was done in a similar way and has been previously described (14Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).GFP Reporter Assays—Pseudomonas strains carrying translational gfp fusions were grown in 96-well black microtiter plates (Greiner bio-one) with a flat transparent bottom. Each well contained 200 μl of GGP medium and was inoculated with 3 μl of a bacterial preculture grown overnight in the same medium. HPLC-purified pyochelin or enantio-pyochelin was dissolved in methanol to a concentration of 10 mm (determined by the CAS assay (42Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar)) and added to the growth medium at the concentrations indicated. Microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C (P. aeruginosa) or 30 °C(P. fluorescens) with orbital shaking at 500 rpm. At each given time point growth (A600) and green fluorescence (excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm) were measured from triplicate cultures using a Fluostar fluorescence microplate reader (BMG Lab Technologies). For each individual measurement the green fluorescence value was divided by the respective A600 value giving the specific fluorescence of cells expressed as relative fluorescence units. The green fluorescence of cells carrying the empty vector pPROBE-TT′ was determined for background fluorescence correction.Siderophore-mediated Growth Promotion—Utilization of pyochelin or enantio-pyochelin as a siderophore was measured with liquid growth assays. Microtiter wells containing 200 μlof M9-glycerol minimal medium with or without the iron chelator 2, 2′-dipyridyl at 500 μm were inoculated with 3 μl of precultures grown overnight in M9-glycerol medium. HPLC-purified pyochelin or enantio-pyochelin was added to the growth medium at 20 μm. Growth (A600) at 500 rpm was recorded by a microplate reader (BMG Lab Technologies).Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC)—Analytical TLC was performed with Merck TLC silica gel 60F254 on aluminum sheets using n-butyl alcohol/water/acetic acid 4:1:1 (v/v/v) as the mobile phase. Compounds were detected either by fluorescence at 365 nm or by spraying the TLC sheet with a solution of FeCl3 in MeOH. Pictures were recorded with a Kodak DX7590 digital camera and processed using the Kodak EasyShare Picture Editor.Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a microTOF LC from Brucker Daltonics.NMR Experiments—NMR experiments (NOESY, COSY, ROESY) were performed at 300, 400, or 500 MHz using Brucker Advance spectrometers on solutions of pyochelin, enantio-pyochelin, or neopyochelin in deuterated acetone.Polarimetry—Pyochelin and enantio-pyochelin samples were dissolved in acetone at a concentration of 10 mg ml–1 and optical activities were determined at 20 °C in a Hellma glass cell (100-mm length) using a Perkin Elmer Model 341 polarimeter.Separation of Pyochelin and Enantio-pyochelin by Chiral HPLC—Samples (10 μg in 20 μl methanol) of pyochelin or enantio-pyochelin were injected into a Merck Hitachi HPLC system equipped with a L-7450A Diode Array Detector, and separated on a Daicel Chiralcel® OD-H analytical column at room temperature using an isocratic gradient consisting of 95% Solvent A (heptane + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 5% Solvent B (ethanol + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Pyochelin and enantio-pyochelin were detected by their absorption at 254 nm.Synthesis and Purification of Pyochelin, Neopyochelin, and Enantio-pyochelin—Pyochelin and neopyochelin were synthesized using protocols published previously (44Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 249-256Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9397Crossref Google Scholar). The synthesis of enantio-pyochelin was inspired by the same protocol and started with the condensation of 2-hydroxybenzonitrile with l-cysteine in a buffered hydromethanolic medium (46Bergeron R.J. Wiegand J. Dionis J.B. Egli-Kamarkka M. Frei J. Huxley-Tencer A. Peter H. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2072-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting thiazoline, recrystallized from a mixture of ethanol and n-hexane, was then converted into the corresponding Weinreb amide, and the latter was reduced to an aldehyde with lithium aluminum hydride (44Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 249-256Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9397Crossref Google Scholar). The aldehyde was condensed with N-methyl-d-cysteine prepared from d-cysteine according to the procedure of Blondeau et al. (47Blondeau P. Berse C. Gravel D. Can. J. Chem. 1967; 45: 49-52Crossref Google Scholar). At this stage, the synthesis of enantio-pyochelin (and also that of pyochelin and neopyochelin), leads to a mixture of four stereoisomers (11Rinehart K.L. Staley A.L. Wilson S.R. Ankenbauer R.G. Cox C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2786-2791Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 249-256Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Zamri A. Abdallah M.A. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9397Crossref Google Scholar). Among them, the two naturally occuring diastereoisomers of pyochelin or enantio-pyochelin were separated from the two “neo” isomers by chromatography on a metal-free silica gel column eluted with a gradient of acetone in CH2Cl2 (from 5:95 to 30:70). The resulting yellow oily residue was converted into a pale yellow powder by precipitation in a mixture of acetone and n-hexane followed by evaporation under reduced pressure.RESULTSComparison of the Pyochelin Biosynthetic Genes from P. aeruginosa with Their Counterparts in P. fluorescens—Putative pyochelin biosynthetic (pch) genes have been located in the recently sequenced genome of P. fluorescens strain Pf-5 (30Paulsen I.T. Press C.M. Ravel J. Kobayashi D.Y. Myers G.S.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We sequenced the corresponding genes from the closely related strain CHA0. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed identities of 98 to 99% between the pch genes in the two strains (not shown). When these genes were compared with the well-characterized pch genes of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (14Reimmann C. Serino L. Beyeler M. Haas D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Reimmann C. Patel H.M. Serino L. Barone M. Walsh C.T. Haas D. J.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), three major differences were discovered. Firstly, the genomic organization of the pch genes is different (Fig. 2). In PAO1 the pch genes are organized in two operons flanking the regulatory gene pchR. In Pf-5 and CHA0 all pch genes seem to be contained within one operon. Second, an epimerization domain is absent from PchEPf-5/CHA0. Third, there is no homology between PchGPAO1 and its presumed counter-part in Pf-5 and CHA0 (named here PchK, see Fig. 2). A motif search indicated that PchK could have a reductase and/or epimerase function.FIGURE 2Organization of the pyochelin genes in P. aeruginosa and their counterparts in P. fluorescens Pf-5 and CHA0. The physical maps are based on total genome sequences of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (62Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar) and P. fluorescens Pf-5 (30Paulsen I.T. Press C.M. Ravel J. Kobayashi D.Y. Myers G.S.A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The sequence of the pchR-pchDHIEFKCBA region in CHA0 is available at GenBank™ under accession number EU088199. Deduced amino acid sequences of P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens pch genes (gray) are between 35 and 60% identical except for pchG (white) and its presumed counterpart pchK (black), which are not related. Note that pchE is smaller in the P. fluorescens strains than in P. aeruginosa PAO1 due to the absence of an epimerase coding region (boxed in pchEPAO).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biological Activity of the P. fluorescens Siderophore—To characterize the molecule specified by the pchDHIEFKCBA operon, a culture supernatant of the pyoverdine-negative strain CHA400 was extracted with ethyl acetate and the siderophore was purified by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first tested its biological activity as a siderophore in growth promotion assays. As shown in Fig. 3, unmodified M9-glycerol medium contained sufficient iron to support growth of the siderophore-negative mutants CHA1085 (Fig. 3A) and PAO6399 (Fig. 3B) but when the medium was amended with the iron chelator 2, 2′-dipyridyl, these mutants were no longer able to grow. Growth of CHA1085 was restored by the addition of 20 μm siderophore purified from P. fluorescens CHA400 whereas equal amounts of HPLC-purified pyochelin from PAO1 had no effect, indicating that pyochelin cannot be used as a siderophore by P. fluorescens (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in experiments performed with P. aeruginosa (Fig. 3B) where the endogenous siderophore pyochelin was able to promote growth of the pyoverdine- and pyochelin-negative mutant PAO6399, while no growth promotion was observed under iron limitation with the P. fluorescens siderophore.FIGURE 3Siderophore-dependent growth promotion under iron limitation. Siderophore-negative mutants of P. fluorescens (CHA1085; A) or P. aeruginosa (PAO6399; B) were grown in unmodified M9-glycerol medium (▪) or in M9-glycerol medium containing the iron chelator 2, 2′-dipyridyl (▴) and 20 μm HPLC-purified siderophore extracted from CHA400 (⋄) or PAO1 (i.e. pyochelin; ○). Growth was assessed over a period of 100 h. A600 values represent the means ± standard deviations from three parallel cultures.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2071788821,"Human autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis (ARIH) is an inherited disorder recently linked to homozygosity for a point mutation in the ST14 gene that causes a G827R mutation in the matriptase serine protease domain (G216 in chymotrypsin numbering). Here we show that human G827R matriptase has strongly reduced proteolytic activity toward small molecule substrates, as well as toward its candidate epidermal target, prostasin. To further investigate the possible contribution of low matriptase activity to ARIH, we generated an ST14 hypomorphic mouse strain that displays a 100-fold reduction in epidermal matriptase mRNA levels. Interestingly, unlike ST14 null mice, ST14 hypomorphic mice were viable and fertile but displayed a spectrum of abnormalities that strikingly resembled ARIH. Thus, ST14 hypomorphic mice developed hyperproliferative and retention ichthyosis with impaired desquamation, hypotrichosis with brittle, thin, uneven, and sparse hair, and tooth defects. Biochemical analysis of ST14 hypomorphic epidermis revealed reduced prostasin proteolytic activation and profilaggrin proteolytic processing, compatible with a primary role of matriptase in this process. This work strongly indicates that reduced activity of a matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade is the etiological origin of human ARIH and provides an important mouse model for the exploration of matriptase function in ARIH, as well as multiple other physiological and pathological processes.

The interfollicular epidermis provides a permeability barrier that prevents excessive water loss to the surrounding environment and noxious chemicals from entering the body. The follicular epidermis gives rise to epidermal appendages such as hair and feathers. The interfollicular epidermis is a stratified epithelium that is formed by proliferating basal cells that move outwards through a series of distinct differentiation events to form the stratum corneum: a two-compartment structure that consists of a lipid-enriched extracellular matrix in which an interlocking meshwork of dead corneocytes are embedded (7Segre J.A.

Epidermal differentiation culminates with the regulated shedding (desquamation) of the outermost layer of corneocytes to control the thickness of the stratum corneum (11Egelrud T. Acta Derm. Venereol. Suppl. (Stockh.). 2000; 208: 44-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The follicular epidermis is a complex, dynamic organ consisting of multiple keratinocyte populations. The outer root sheath of the hair follicle is continuous with the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis. Within the follicular matrix, a zone located at the proximal end of the hair surrounding the dermal papilla, rapidly proliferating undifferentiated transient amplifying cells give rise to the cortex, medulla, cuticle of the hair shaft, and the inner root sheath cells, which continuously move upward. The matrix transient-amplifying cells periodically withdraw from the cell cycle and commit to terminal differentiation, giving rise to repeated cycles of active hair growth (anagen), hair follicle regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) (12Rogers G.E.

Indeed, several recent studies have revealed that proper epidermal differentiation depends on a finely tuned interplay between specific serine proteases and their cognate serine protease inhibitors, and that perturbations of this proteolytic balance in either direction have serious pathophysiological consequences (15Zeeuwen P.L.

Generally speaking, the loss of serine protease proteolytic activity impairs terminal epidermal differentiation, whereas increased proteolytic activity accelerates the process. For example, genetic ablation of the membrane-associated serine proteases matriptase and prostasin impairs stratum corneum formation and causes follicular hypoplasia, whereas the genetic deficiency in the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor or targeted overexpression of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme is associated with accelerated stratum corneum formation (15Zeeuwen P.L.

The membrane protease is being extensively studied in the context of human carcinogenesis, due to its almost ubiquitous overexpression in human carcinomas and its potent tumor-promoting properties (25Bugge T.H.

This mutation results in a Gly → Arg substitution in residue 827 of the matriptase protein (henceforth G827R matriptase; G216 in chymotrypsin numbering) (29Basel-Vanagaite L. Attia R. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Rainshtein L. Ben Amitai D. Lurie R. Pasmanik-Chor M. Indelman M. Zvulunov A. Saban S. Magal N. Sprecher E. Shohat M. Am. J. Hum.

ARIH patients present with thickened, scaling, and grayish skin and curly, sparse, fragile, brittle, dry, lusterless, and slow growing hair. Other manifestations linked to homozygosity for the c.2672G → A ST14 allele included corneal opacity, photophobia, and abnormal deciduous and permanent teeth. Some uncertainties remain, however, regarding the interpretation of the reported findings, because the effect of the G827R substitution on matriptase proteolytic activity was determined; the three homozygously affected individuals analyzed in the report were all siblings from one consanguineous marriage, and one individual also was diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease.To further investigate the association between matriptase proteolytic activity and ARIH, we characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant human G827R matriptase and report here that the mutant protease has highly reduced proteolytic activity toward low molecular weight peptide substrates, fluorophosphonate probes, and α2-macroglobulin, as well as toward its candidate epidermal substrate, the zymogen form of prostasin. Furthermore, we generated mice with a hypomorphic ST14 allele with ∼100-fold reduced epidermal matriptase mRNA levels at birth and characterized the phenotypic consequences of reduced matriptase expression. Surprisingly, this very low epidermal matriptase mRNA level was compatible with postnatal development, long term survival, and reproduction. Importantly, these ST14 hypomorphic mice were virtual phenocopies of ARIH patients, displaying near identical epidermis, hair, and tooth abnormalities. This study strongly implicates impaired matriptase proteolytic activity as the underlying cause of ARIH, and it provides a valuable animal model for the study of ARIH, as well as for the exploration of matriptase proteolytic function in other physiological and pathological processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of G827R, S805A Matriptase, and Wild-type Matriptase in Pichia pastoris—The G → A and T → G mutations in nucleotides 2672 and 2606 of the human matriptase cDNA (GenBank™ NM021978), causing, respectively, G827R and S805A changes in the translated protein, were introduced using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Nucleotides 2036-2762 of the wild-type and mutated matriptase serine protease domains were introduced into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen), immediately downstream from the coding region of the Leu-Glu-Lys-Arg KEX2 signal peptide, leading to the synthesis and secretion of active matriptase. The recombinant serine protease domains were affinity-purified on benzamidine-Sepharose columns as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences), dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Matriptase Proteolytic Activity Assays—For prostasin zymogen activation, recombinant soluble prostasin was made as described previously (6Netzel-Arnett S.

Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the pCMV-SPORT6 expression vector containing full-length human prostasin cDNA. Transfected cells were collected mechanically and incubated with 1 unit/ml PI-PLC (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant containing the PI-PLC-released proteins was collected. The soluble prostasin was incubated with 1-10 nm wild-type or G827R matriptase serine protease domain for 2 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 nm NaCl. For complex formation with protease nexin-1 (PN-1)/SERPINE2, 700 nm PN-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the activation reaction, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient gels under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-prostasin antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen).Fluorogenic Peptide Assays—0.1-100 nm wild-type, G827R, and S805A matriptase serine protease domains were added to 200 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2 reaction buffer containing 10 μm t-butyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin HCl fluorogenic peptide substrate (R&D Systems). The assay was performed at 25 °C for 30 min, and fluorescence measurements with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm were obtained every minute using a SAFIRE2TM Microplate Reader (Tecan, Durham, NC). All measurements were performed in triplicates. Once measured, the reaction rate (kobs) was determined as kobs = -ln[S]/time. The kcat/Km ratio was then calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation as kcat/Km = kobs/E(total).Fluorophosphonate Labeling—4-400 nm wild-type, G827R, and S805A matriptase serine protease domains in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, were incubated with 0.5 μm rhodamine-coupled fluorophosphonate probe for 1 h at room temperature (30Jessani N.

The resultant mixture was then separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gels under reducing conditions, and the gels were photographed on a UV transilluminator 2040ev (Stratagene).α2-Macroglobulin Capture—α2-Macroglobulin capture assays were performed by incubation of 200 nm wild-type and G827R matriptase with 200 nm α2-macroglobulin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (31Hobson J.P.

ST14 hypomorphic mice were either bred for three generations into a C57BL/6J background or maintained in a 129/Black Swiss background. All experiments performed with ST14 hypomorphic mice were littermate and sibling controlled. Genotyping of ST14 wild-type, knockdown, and null alleles was performed as described (24List K.

The rate of epithelial fluid loss was estimated by measuring the reduction of body weight of the individual pups as a function of time over a period of 4 h.Scanning Electron Microscopy—Tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 days, rinsed in cacodylate buffer, and incubated overnight in 2% glycine, overnight in 2% tannic acid, pH 4.0, and 6 h in 2% OsO4. The fixed tissues were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, put under vacuum for 2 h, mounted onto stubs with Leit-C adhesive (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and examined with a Philips XL-20 scanning electron microscope.Analysis of Epidermal Prostasin and Profilaggrin/Filaggrin—Skins were removed from euthanized newborn mice, and dermis and epidermis were separated as described (24List K.

For prostasin analysis, the epidermis was immediately ground into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Homogenized lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble protein lysates were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of epidermal proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel under reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blots were performed with the anti-prostasin antibody as described (6Netzel-Arnett S. Currie B.M. Szabo R. Lin C.Y. Chen L.M. Chai K.X. Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. List K. J. Biol.

Fuentes-Prior P. Ong E. Coombs G. Hunter M. Oehler R. Pierson D. Gonzalez R. Huber R. Bode W. Madison E.L. J. Biol.

This glycine residue is highly conserved in trypsin-like serine proteases, although it is substituted by serine in the mouse hypothetical protease TESP2 and by aspartic acid in tryptase-α(2Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To test if the Gly to Arg substitution reported in human ARIH affected substrate accessibility and/or hydrolysis, the wild-type and G827R matriptase serine protease domains were expressed in P. pastoris and purified by benzamidine affinity chromatography as described (34Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Ong E. Coombs G. Hunter M. Oehler R. Pierson D. Gonzalez R. Huber R. Bode W. Madison E.L. J. Biol.

Wild-type and G827R matriptase displayed identical absorption and elution profiles using this purification procedure, suggesting that the benzamidine binding pocket is retained in the mutant matriptase (data not shown). We first performed a peptide cleavage assay using a fluorogenic t-butyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin peptide that is efficiently cleaved by matriptase. G827R matriptase hydrolyzed this model substrate poorly, displaying a catalytic activity that was ∼1000-fold lower than that of wild-type matriptase, and was similar to a matriptase mutant (S805A) in which the active site serine was changed to alanine (kcat/Km: wild-type matriptase, 1.7 × 106m-1 × s-1; G827R matriptase, 1.8. × 103m-1 × s-1; S805A matriptase, 2.4. × 103m-1 × s-1). We next incubated wild-type, G827R, and S805A matriptase with a rhodamine-labeled fluorophosphonate probe, which attaches covalently to the active site serine of serine proteases (and other serine hydrolases) after its cleavage (30Jessani N.

This analysis showed efficient cleavage and covalent attachment of the fluorogenic probe to wild-type matriptase (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), and much lower, but measurable, cleavage and covalent attachment of the fluorogenic probe to G827R matriptase (Fig. 1B, lane 5), when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ultraviolet light illumination. To further investigate the enzymatic activity of G827R matriptase, an α2-macroglobulin capture assay was employed. α2-Macroglobulin has four 180-kDa subunits, each with a thiolester bond. Upon cleavage of α2-macroglobulin by a protease, the thiolester will form a non-reducible covalent bond with an amine on the protease, which will manifest as a mobility shift of the activating protease when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. High molecular weight α2-macroglobulin: wild-type matriptase complexes were easily detected in Western blots using a matriptase antibody (Fig. 1C, lane 3). However, no α2-macroglobulin:G827R matriptase could be detected, even when combining a long incubation of the protease and the inhibitor with a sensitive Western blot procedure (Fig. 1C, lane 5, and data not shown).The above studies indicated that G827R matriptase would have impaired capacity to activate its candidate downstream epidermal substrate, the prostasin zymogen (6Netzel-Arnett S. Currie B.M. Szabo R. Lin C.Y. Chen L.M. Chai K.X. Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. List K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32941-32945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To verify this, the wild-type and mutant enzymes were incubated with an excess of recombinant soluble prostasin zymogen. Active two-chain prostasin can be distinguished from the prostasin zymogen by a small increase in electrophoretic mobility in Western blots of high percentage SDS-PAGE gels after reduction of the single disulfide bridge that links the two chains, as well as by the capacity to form SDS-stable complexes with the cognate serpin, PN-1 (36Chen L.M.

https://openalex.org/W2081916198,"Astrocytic, oligodendroglial and mixed gliomas are the commonest gliomas in adults. They have distinct phenotypes and clinical courses, but as they exist as a continuous histological spectrum, differentiating them can be difficult. Co-deletions of total 1p and 19q are found in the majority of oligodendrogliomas and considered as a diagnostic marker and a prognostic indicator. The 1p status of astrocytomas has not yet been thoroughly examined. Using a chromosome 1 tile path array, we investigated 108 adult astrocytic tumours for copy number alterations. Total 1p deletions were rare (2%), however partial deletions involving 1p36 were frequently identified in anaplastic astrocytomas (22%) and glioblastomas (34%). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with total 1p deletions had significantly longer survival (P=0.005). In nine glioblastomas homozygous deletions at 1p36 were identified. No somatic mutations were found among the five genes located in the homozygously deleted region. However, the CpG island of TNFRSF9 was hypermethylated in 19% of astrocytic tumours and 87% of glioma cell lines. TNFRSF9 expression was upregulated after demethylation of glioma cell lines. Akt3 amplifications were found in four glioblastomas. Our results indicate that 1p deletions are common anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas but are distinct from the 1p abnormalities in oligodendrogliomas."

Chloroplasts are also thought to possess a system for generating guanosine 5′-triphosphate ((p)ppGpp), which triggers the stringent response in eubacteria, with genes encoding chloroplastic (p)ppGpp synthetase having been identified. We now describe the identification and characterization of genes (OsCRSH1, OsCRSH2, and OsCRSH3) for a novel type of (p)ppGpp synthetase in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide at the NH2 terminus, a central RelA-SpoT-like domain, and two EF-hand motifs at the COOH terminus. The recombinant OsCRSH1 protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro, and genetic complementation analysis revealed that expression of OsCRSH1 suppressed the phenotype of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the RelA and SpoT enzymes. Biochemical analysis showed that the OsCRSH proteins possess (p)ppGpp synthetase activity that is dependent both on Ca2+ and on the EF-hand motifs. A data base search identified a CRSH homolog in the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that such genes are conserved among both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous land plants. CRSH proteins thus likely function as Ca2+-activated (p)ppGpp synthetases in plant chloroplasts, implicating both Ca2+ and (p)ppGpp signaling in regulation of the genetic system of these organelles.

Subsequently, carbon, fatty acid, or iron limitation was also found to trigger the accumulation of (p)ppGpp in E. coli (2Magnusson L.U. Farewell A. Nyström T.

Cell. 2007; 128: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Two enzymes, RelA and SpoT, are responsible for fluctuations in (p)ppGpp concentration in E. coli. RelA is a ribosome-associated protein and synthesizes (p)ppGpp in response to the increase in the proportion of uncharged tRNAs that results from amino acid starvation (10Wendrich T.M. Blaha G. Wilson D.N. Marahiel M.A. Nierhaus K.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 779-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, SpoT is a bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase and regulates (p)ppGpp levels in response to carbon source or fatty acid limitation (3Xiao H. Kalma M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Seyfzadeh M. Keener J. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many other bacteria possess only a single bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase, designated Rel (12Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar). Rel proteins have been shown to be essential for the long term survival or virulence of pathogenic bacteria (13Gogfrey H.P. Burgrysheva J.V. Cabello F.C.

Stringent factor and RelA-SpoT-like (p)ppGpp synthetases have also been identified in chloroplasts (14van der Biezen E.A. Sun J. Coleman M.J. Bibb M.J. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kanno T. Endo Y. Wakasa T. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5732-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Three RelA-SpoT homolog genes (RSH1, RSH2, and RSH3) have been identified in plants (14van der Biezen E.A. Sun J. Coleman M.J. Bibb M.J. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yamada T. Endo Y. Ochi K. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity and specific localization to chloroplasts have been demonstrated for plant RSH2 and RSH3 and for algal RSH (16Kasai K. Usami S. Yamada T. Endo Y. Ochi K. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Givens R.M. Lin M.-H. Taylor D.J. Mechold U. Berry J.O. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7495-7504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts of land plants and algae are thought to originate from ancient cyanobacteria-like prokaryotes. Indeed, the genetic system of chloroplasts, including the apparatuses for transcription, translation, and DNA replication, is highly similar to that of bacteria. A stringent control system similar to that of bacteria has therefore been suggested to operate in chloroplasts of photosynthetic eukaryotes (19Braeken K. Moris M. Daniels R. Vanderleyden J. Michiels J. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 45-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In a search for plant genes that encode RelA-SpoT-like proteins, we have now identified a previously unknown type of RSH gene for putative chloroplast-localizing proteins in rice (Oryza sativa). The deduced amino acid sequences of the novel RSH genes contain motifs similar to the EF-hand, a Ca2+-binding domain, at their COOH termini. We show that the (p)ppGpp synthetase activity of the gene products is regulated by Ca2+ via the EF-hand motifs, and we therefore named them CRSH (Ca2+-activated RelA-SpoT homolog) to distinguish their mechanism of regulation from that of other RSH proteins. Our findings thus have implications for Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-dependent (p)ppGpp accumulation in plant chloroplasts. Plant and Bacterial Materials—Rice (O. sativa cv. Nipponbare) plants were grown as described previously (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Pea (Pisum sativum cv. Toyonari; Sakata Seed Co., Yokohama, Japan) plants were grown at 25 °C under a 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle with artificial light. E. coli strains W3110 (wild type), CF1652 (relA–), and CF1678 (relA–, spoT–) were used for genetic complementation analysis (16Kasai K. Usami S. Yamada T. Endo Y. Ochi K. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation and Characterization of Rice CRSH Genes—Standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed basically as described (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The PCR was performed with a rice cDNA library (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotide primers (OsREL1F, 5′-CAGGAAGGACACAAAAAATTATGTCAC-3′; OsREL1R, 5′-CGTCGAGAAGATGCATGAG-3′) based on a rice expressed sequence tag that shows sequence similarity to bacterial relA and spoT (GenBank™ accession number D48993). The PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Amplified DNA fragments were also purified and used to prepare fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled probes with an ECL random prime labeling system (GE Healthcare). Screening of a Nipponbare cDNA library in phage λgt11 for OsCRSH1 cDNA clones and isolation of such clones were performed as previously described (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA for OsCRSH3 was constructed as follows. The cDNA clone AK110850, which encodes an NH2-terminal portion of OsCRSH3, was obtained from the National Institute of Agricultural Resources (NIAR, Tsukuba, Japan). The missing portion of the open reading frame (ORF) was predicted from the corresponding genomic sequence of rice chromosome 5 (accession number AC137614). The 1598-bp portion of the ORF contained in clone AK110850 was amplified by PCR with the forward primer CRSH3F (5′-ATAACTAGTATGGCGAACGCCGGTGTCAA-3′) and the reverse primer CR3MR (5′-ATGATGGCCTTGAGCCTCTT-3′). The portion of the ORF for the COOH-terminal region of OsCRSH3 was amplified by PCR with a template cDNA mixture (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) prepared from 20-day-old Nipponbare seedlings, the forward primer CR3MF (5′-GGTGATCAAGGCCATGTGGA-3′), and the reverse primer CR3RR (5′-TCTTGCGGTAGACGTGGATG-3′). The resulting products were then subjected to a further PCR amplification with the primers CR3MF and CR3R (5′-ATAAGATCTTCAAACGAGGACCAACTTGTCGCTGAGGTTCTTGCGGTAGACGT-3′). The new PCR products were then mixed with those obtained from clone AK110850 and subjected to PCR with the primers CRSH3F and CR3RR. The resulting product containing the full-length ORF was digested with SpeI and BglII and cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pEU3b (22Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Morishita R. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14652-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), generating pECRSH3. Northern Hybridization—Isolation of total RNA from 20-day-old Nipponbare seedlings and Northern hybridization were performed as previously described (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For preparation of an OsCRSH1 riboprobe, a 910-bp EcoRV-EcoRI fragment of OsCRSH1 cDNA was cloned into the HincII-EcoRI sites of pSPT19 (Roche Applied Science), and a digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobe was generated from the resulting plasmid by run-off in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Riboprobes specific for rice SIG1 (OsSIG1) and actin2 (Rac2) mRNAs (internal standards) were also synthesized and tested as described (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Rice cDNA was prepared from total RNA of 20-day-old Nipponbare seedlings by RT as described previously (20Tozawa Y. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Wakasa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with the resulting cDNA and primer sets for OsCRSH1 (CRSH1F, 5′-CATGTGGCCATCGATGTAAG-3′; CRSH1R, 5′-CCTCTCCACCAACAGCAAAT-3′), for OsCRSH2 (CRSH2F, 5′-GAGAGCCTCGACGTGAAGAA-3′; CRSH2R, 5′-ACGTCGTAGCCGGAGAGGAT-3′), or for OsCRSH3 (CRSH3F2, 5′-CATTGACGCACCTGGAGTT-3′; CRSH3R, 5′-CCGCTCCGTCAGTCCATTG-3′). As a control, PCR was also performed with plasmids containing OsCRSH1, OsCRSH2, or OsCRSH3 cDNAs as templates and with the corresponding primer sets. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1× ExTaq buffer, 1 μg of cDNA, 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 5 min followed by 25, 30, 35, or 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 s. A portion (5 μl) of the reaction mixture was then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 3% agarose gel and staining of DNA with ethidium bromide. Cell-free Protein Synthesis—A series of cDNAs encoding intact or NH2-terminally truncated forms of OsCRSH1 was constructed by PCR with a plasmid harboring the full-length cDNA as template, a gene-specific forward primer (FNF for the full-length protein, 5′-CCATGGCGACCGCCGCGA-3′; DN41F for a protein lacking the 41 NH2-terminal amino acids, 5′-CCATGGCCCAAGCAGCCGCCGCG-3′; DN65F for a protein lacking the 65 NH2-terminal residues, 5′-CCATGGCGGAGGGAGGAGGGCGG-3′), and the reverse primer FCR (5′-AAAGTCGACTTAGCTTACAAGCAGTTTGTCGCCC-3′). The amplified fragments were digested with NcoI and SalI and then cloned into the corresponding sites of pEU3b. The resulting plasmids were designated pECR1FL, pECR1ΔN41, and pECR1ΔN65, respectively. A pEU3b-based vector for an OsCRSH1 mutant lacking both the 41 NH2-terminal and 128 COOH-terminal residues was similarly constructed by PCR with the plasmid encoding the full-length protein, the forward primer DN41F, and the reverse primer DC128R (5′-AAAGTCGACTTAGCTGTCTCCTTGATCACTAGCTG-3′). The resulting vector was designated pECR1ΔN41ΔC128. After verification of the inserted sequences, the various plasmids for the truncated proteins were used as templates for in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase as described (23Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of OsCRSH1(ΔN41) or OsCRSH1(ΔN41ΔC128), a DNA fragment encoding GST followed by the amino acid sequence Leu-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro, which is the recognition site of Precision protease (GE Healthcare), was first prepared by PCR with the plasmid pKT7GST2 (24Kanno T. Kitano M. Kato R. Omori A. Endo Y. Tozawa Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as template, the forward primer GSTF-Sac (5′-GAGCTCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′), and the reverse primer GSTR-Sma (5′-CCCGGGCCCCTGGAACAGAACTTCCAGATCCGATTTT-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into the pCRII vector and sequenced, and the verified SacI-SmaI fragment was then cloned into the corresponding sites of pEU3b to yield pEGST. OsCRSH1 cDNAs were constructed by PCR with pECR1ΔN41 or pECR1ΔN41ΔC128 as the template, the gene-specific forward primer DN41FB (5′-GCCCAAGCAGCCGCCGCGG-3′), and the reverse primer FCR or DC128R, respectively, and the PCR products were digested with SalI and cloned into the SmaI-SalI sites of pEGST. The resulting plasmids were designated pGCR1ΔN41 and pGCR1ΔN41ΔC128, respectively. For construction of cell-free expression vectors for OsCRSH2 and OsCRSH3, cDNA fragments corresponding to the putative mature form of each protein were amplified by PCR with a plasmid containing the full-length ORF (clone AK058438 for OsCRSH2; pECRSH3 for OsCRSH3), the forward primer CR2DN14F (5′-ATAACTAGTATGGCGGCCGCGGTGGCGCCTGA-3′) for OsCRSH2 or CR3DN12F (5′-ATAACTAGTATGGCCGTCGCCATTGACGCACC-3′) for OsCRSH3, and the reverse primer CR2R (5′-ATAAGATCTTCAGCCGGAGACGAGCTTGT-3′) for OsCRSH2 or CR3R for OsCRSH3. The PCR products were digested with SpeI and BglII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEU3b, generating pECRSH2ΔN14 and pECRSH3ΔN12, respectively. Cell-free protein synthesis was performed with wheat embryo extracts (Cell-Free Sciences, Yokohama, Japan) according to two different methodologies. For the synthesis of 35S-labeled proteins, the “batch method” was performed as described (23Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (total of 14.8 mCi/ml) with the use of a Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell labeling kit (GE Healthcare). For preparation of protein for enzyme assays, the “bilayer method” (22Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Morishita R. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14652-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) was performed. GST-OsCRSH1 fusion proteins synthesized by the bilayer method were isolated on a glutathione affinity column (GE Healthcare) and treated with Precision protease on the column to yield the corresponding OsCRSH1 protein. The solubility of proteins synthesized in the presence of [14C]leucine (0.074 mCi/ml; GE Healthcare) was assessed by SDS-PAGE both of the total reaction mixture and of the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the mixture at 22,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to a BAS-III imaging plate (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and protein-associated radioactivity was detected with a BAS-2500 analyzer (Fujifilm) and quantitated with Image Gauge version 3.41 software (Fujifilm). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of OsCRSH1 was performed by in vitro overlap extension PCR as described (25Kanno T. Komatsu A. Kasai K. Dubouzet J.G. Sakurai M. Ikejiri-Kanno Y. Wakasa K. Tozawa Y. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The gene was mutated so that glutamate in the–Z position of either Ca2+ binding loop (see Fig. 1C) was replaced with glutamine. Two separate amplification reactions were performed to amplify the two halves of OsCRSH1 with the use of four primers. The outside-forward primer (DN41FB) was paired with a middle-reverse mutation primer (EF1R for the NH2-terminal Ca2+ binding loop, 5′-CCTCTGTGAGCTGCTCAATACTGAT-3′, with the substituted nucleotide underlined; EF2R for the COOH-terminal Ca2+ binding loop, 5′-GAATGCTTCGAATTGATCGGAGCTCAAGG-3′) to generate the first half of the gene; the outside-reverse primer (FCR) was paired with a middle-forward mutation primer (EF1F for the NH2-terminal Ca2+ binding loop, 5′-ATCAGTATTGAGCAGCTCACAGAGG-3′; EF2F for the COOH-terminal Ca2+ binding loop, 5′-CTTGAGCTCCGATCAATTCGAAGCATTCC-3′) to generate the second half. The reactions were performed with 5 ng of pECR1ΔN41 as the template in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1× Pyrobest Buffer II (TaKaRa), 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.025 unit of Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and 0.2 μm of each primer. The amplification protocol comprised 20 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 35 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 3 min, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The DNA fragments bearing overlapping sequences introduced by the two middle primers were then mixed together and subjected to three cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 3 min. The resulting products were further amplified by PCR with the outside-forward primer (DN41FB) and the outside-reverse primer (FCR); the protocol comprised 20 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 35 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 3 min, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The final products were digested with SalI and cloned into the SmaI-SalI sites of pGCR1ΔN41. The resulting plasmids for GST fusion proteins of OsCRSH1(ΔN41) with mutated NH2- and COOH-terminal Ca2+-binding loops were designated pGCR1ΔN41EF1 and pGCR1ΔN41EF2, respectively. Complementation Test of OsCRSH1 in E. coli—The E. coli strains W3110, CF1652 (relA–), and CF1678 (relA–, spoT–) were prepared as recipients of test plasmids by lysogenic introduction of λ-DE3 phage (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) into their chromosomal DNA to confer IPTG-inducible gene expression from the T7 promoter (16Kasai K. Usami S. Yamada T. Endo Y. Ochi K. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For construction of an expression vector for OsCRSH1(ΔN41), the full-length OsCRSH1 cDNA was subjected to PCR with the primers DN41F and CR1RB (5′-GGATCCTATTAGCTTACAAGCAGTTTGTCGCCC-3′). The resulting product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and substituted for the NcoI-BamHI region of pET11d (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), yielding pETCR1. The cells were transformed with pETCR1 or pET11d, transferred to MOPS agar medium (40 mm MOPS and 4 mm Tricine buffer (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm FeCl3, 1.6% agar) (16Kasai K.

Assay of (p)ppGpp Synthetase Activity—ATP:GTP 5′-pyro-phosphotransferase assays were performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 2 mm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP at 10 μCi/ml (3000 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare), 1.3 mm GTP, and synthesized protein in Buffer C (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and in the absence or presence of CaCl2. The reaction was performed for 1 h at 30°Candwas stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 88% formic acid. After the further addition of 12.5 μlof phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), the mixture was agitated and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to another tube, and a 3-μl portion was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer sheet (Merck). For one-dimensional analysis, 1.5 m KH2PO4 was used as the chromatographic solvent, as described (18Kasai K. Kanno T. Endo Y. Wakasa T. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5732-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional analysis was performed essentially as described previously (18Kasai K. Kanno T. Endo Y. Wakasa T. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5732-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with solvent Tb (0.75 m Tris, 0.45 m HCl, 0.5 m LiCl) for the first dimension and solvent Sb (prepared by dissolving 74 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 g of (NH4) HSO4, and 4 g of EDTA (disodium salt) in 100 ml of H2O) for the second dimension. Each chromatogram was exposed to a BAS-III imaging plate, and the associated radioactivity was detected with a BAS-2500 analyzer and quantitated with Image Gauge version 3.41 software. Assay of (p)ppGpp Hydrolase Activity—The 32P-labeled pppGpp was synthesized in vitro by using purified OsCRSH1(ΔN41) in the presence of 500 μm CaCl2 as described in the method for (p)ppGpp synthetase assay. Purification of the 32P-labeled pppGpp was carried out as described (18Kasai K. Kanno T. Endo Y. Wakasa T. Tozawa Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5732-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis mixtures (25 μl) contained 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 60 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of enzyme, and 3 μl of the purified pppGpp with or without the addition of 1 mm MnCl2. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 88% formic acid. After the further addition of 12.5 μl of phenol:chloroform: isoamylalcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), the mixture was agitated and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to another tube, and a 5-μl portion was subjected to the one-dimensional TLC analysis. Expression and Purification of SpoT Protein—A DNA segment of E. coli spoT gene coding for the NH2-terminal fragment (1–380 amino acids) of the SpoT protein was amplified by PCR using primers SPQEF (5′-GGATCCTTGTATCTGTTTGAAAGCCTGAA-3′) and SPQER (5′-AAGCTTTTAAAACGAACTACCGGCGCTCT-3′). The obtained DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pQE30 (Qiagen), yielding pQESPΔC. E. coli strain JM109 transformed with pQESPΔC was incubated in 100 ml of LB at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. When the optical density (600 nm) was reached at 0.5, IPTG was added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm and further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then resuspend in TALON buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was added to TALON Metal affinity resins (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, and the resin was then transferred to a column and washed with TALON wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 17 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). The SpoTΔC protein tagged with 6×His at its NH2 terminus was eluted from the column with TALON elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 180 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol). The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the fraction containing SpoTΔC was stored until use at –30 °C after the addition of equal volume of 100% glycerol. Isolation and Characterization of OsCRSH cDNAs—In a search for (p)ppGpp synthetase genes in land plants, we found a rice expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number D48993) that encodes part of a putative polypeptide with sequence similarity to RelA and SpoT of E. coli, and we subsequently isolated a cDNA containing the corresponding fulllength ORF from a rice cDNA library in λgt11 (20Tozawa Y.

https://openalex.org/W1992703563,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent AIDS-associated malignancy, etiologically linked to the infection with the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8/KSHV). This member of the γ-herpesviridae family encodes 81 open reading frames, several bearing oncogenic potential. A constitutively active virally encoded G protein–coupled receptor (vGPCR) readily induces KS-like lesions when expressed in endothelial cells in vivo, and unmasks the oncogenic potential of other HHV-8 genes in a paracrine fashion. How vGPCR causes endothelial cell transformation is still not fully understood. Using full-genome microarray analysis we show here that the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-regulated genes is a prominent feature triggered by vGPCR in cells expressing this viral oncogene and in cells exposed to vGPCR-induced secretions, thus mimicking its paracrine effect. Indeed, vGPCR activates the NF-κB pathway potently, and NF-κB activation is a hallmark of both human and experimental KS. Of interest, whereas constitutive NF-κB signaling is not sufficient to promote endothelial cells transformation, NF-κB function is strictly required for vGPCR-induced direct and paracrine neoplasia. Taken together, these results strongly support the role of NF-κB regulated genes in KS pathogenesis, thus providing the rationale for the development of novel mechanism-based therapies for this angioproliferative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033845954,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 Tat is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the vascular endothelium through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, although the signaling pathways leading to MAP kinase activation are incompletely understood. We focused on proximal pathways potentially governing downstream MAP kinase activity by Tat. Within 2 min, Tat activated both Ras and Rho GTPases in endothelial cells, leading to ERK phosphorylation by 10 min. Notably, Rac1 was necessary for downstream activation of RhoA and both Rac1 and RhoA acted upstream of the Ras/ERK cassette. Antioxidants and the oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium blocked ERK phosphorylation, but specific interference with the canonical Nox2 oxidase had no effect on ERK. Instead, knock down of the novel oxidase Nox4 completely suppressed Tat-dependent Ras and ERK activation downstream of Rac1 and RhoA. Conversely, interference with Rac1, PAK1, and Nox2 blocked JNK phosphorylation, whereas RhoA(N19) and Nox4 knock down did not. Further, knock down of Nox2, but not Nox4, blocked Tat-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement, whereas knock down of Nox4, but not Nox2, blocked Tat-dependent proliferation. Rac1, therefore, bifurcates Tat signaling, leading to concurrent but separate Nox4-dependent Ras/ERK activation, and Nox2-dependent JNK activation. Tat signaling, therefore, provides an example of Nox-specific differential control of MAP kinase pathways."

In mammals, nearly 30 TRP members have already been found, and are grouped into six subfamilies based on their amino acid sequences (TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, TRPP, and TRPML). TRP channels have common structural features with voltage-gated cation channels: six transmembrane (TM) segments, a pore-forming region between the fifth and sixth TM segments, cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions, and tetrameric subunit stoichiometry (2Harteneck C.

Outside of these commonalities, however, there are huge variations in amino acid sequence and sequence length, especially in the cytoplasmic regions. Corresponding to these variations, TRP channels can be activated by stimuli from various intracellular messengers, mechanical force, temperature change, tastes, hormones, and oxidative stress (2Harteneck C.

ADPR is the most intensively studied activator of the TRPM2 channel (10Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P.

ADPR binds to the motif named nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 9 homology (NUDT9-H) domain, which has 39% identity on the amino acid sequence with mitochondrial NUDT9 ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) (10Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The motif is located at the C-terminal end of the TRPM2 protein. Although the structure of the NUDT9-H domain is not clear yet, the crystal structure of the mitochondrial NUDT9 ADPRase was recently revealed (21Shen B.W. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This can be the structural basis for interpreting the mechanism of the homologous NUDT9-H domain, however, the relationship between ADPRase and the TRPM2 channel still remains to be discussed. Because the catalytic activity of the NUDT9-H domain is lower than that of mitochondrial NUDT9 (10Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), the gating mechanism of TRPM2 has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, especially in relation to the catalytic activity of the NUDT9-H domain (17Perraud A.L. Takanishi C.L. Shen B. Kang S. Smith M.K. Schmitz C. Knowles H.M. Ferraris D. Li W. Zhang J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol.

Because site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that gating persists in double mutation (at 1408 and 1409 residues in the NUDT9-H domain), which is critical for ADPRase activity of mitochondrial NUDT9, catalytic activity does not seem necessary for ADPR-dependent gating (17Perraud A.L. Takanishi C.L. Shen B. Kang S. Smith M.K. Schmitz C. Knowles H.M. Ferraris D. Li W. Zhang J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol.

To understand the gating mechanisms of TRPM2, the entire three-dimensional structure including the NUDT9-H domain should be analyzed. Notably, the three-dimensional structure of the TRP canonical type 3 (TRPC3) channel, recently revealed using single particle analysis in combination with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (22Mio K. Ogura T. Kiyonaka S. Hiroaki Y. Tanimura Y. Fujiyoshi Y. Mori Y. Sato C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), represents the first structural depiction of a member of the TRP superfamily. In this study, we have reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of TRPM2 from negatively stained EM images. The three-dimensional structure of TRPM2 was compared with that of the previously reconstructed TRPC3 to extract common structural features of the TRP superfamily, and detailed architecture specific to TRPM2. Recombinant Construction and Transfection of HEK293 Cells—The full-length human TRPM2 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number AB001535) was inserted into the pCMV-Tag4A vector (Stratagene) to introduce a FLAG tag sequence at the C terminus. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.18 μg/cm2 of the TRPM2 expression vector for 6 h using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (23Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar) or SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), harvested with a cell scraper, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were stored at -80 °C for further protein purification. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Change and Current Recording—HEK293 cells on coverslips were transfected similarly, and were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C for 40 min. The coverslips were then placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of the microscope. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with a video image analysis system (AQUACOSMOS, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wave-length of 510 nm (bandwidth: 20 nm) was observed at room temperature by exciting fura-2 alternately at 340 and 380 nm (bandwidth: 11 nm). The 340:380 nm ratio images were obtained on a pixel-by-pixel basis. These images were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by in vivo calibration (8Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M.

H2O2 was diluted to the final concentration (100 μm) in a buffer containing 107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and applied to the cells by perfusion. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature using the conventional whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique (24Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) with EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Pfalz, Germany). The pipette solution was 40 mm CsCl, 105 mm CsOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, 105 mm l-aspartate, and 5 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH). The 2 mm Ca2+-NaCl solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 11.5 mm HEPES, and 51 mm mannitol (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. Protein Purification—The transfected cells were homogenized with a Potter Teflon homogenizer in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 140 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Sigma), protease inhibitors (500 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 400 nm aprotinin, 25 μm bestatin, 7.5 μm E-64 protease inhibitor, 10 μm leupeptin hemisulfate, and 5 μm pepstatin A) (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), and 0.02% sodium azide. All procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cell debris was precipitated from the homogenate by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant containing FLAG-tagged TRPM2 was applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) column, equilibrated in advance. The column was washed with 12 column bed volumes of Tris-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm DDM, 750 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, protease inhibitors (100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 80 nm aprotinin, 5 μm bestatin, 1.5 μm E-64 protease inhibitor, 2 μm leupeptin hemisulfate, and 1 μm pepstatin A), and 0.02% sodium azide. The bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 125 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluate was concentrated 20 times with a Microcon centrifuge filter unit YM-100 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Further purification was performed using Superose 6 (3.2/30) gel filtration chromatography in a Smartsystem (GE Healthcare) with Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm DDM, 750 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide. The elution of protein was profiled at 280 nm, and subfractionated into 20-μl fractions. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA method (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

SDS-PAGE and Chemical Cross-linking—SDS-PAGE was carried out using the standard method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with a SDS-sample buffer (final concentrations of 62.8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0005% bromphenol blue), and heated at 60 °C for 15 min. 5–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel was used for electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (Wako Pure Chemicals) or Western blotting. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) or with two different kinds of rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize the N-terminal region between residues 650 and 700 and the C-terminal region between residues 1200 and 1250 of human TRPM2 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). For chemical cross-linking, the buffer components were substituted in advance with phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1 mm DDM, 750 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide. Glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 12.5 mm, and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of the SDS-sample buffer. Samples were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min, and analyzed in 2–15% polyacrylamide gel. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Native gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Davis (27Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15956) Google Scholar). Purified TRPM2 protein was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), and electrophoresed at 4 °C at 3.4 V/cm in 2–15% polyacrylamide gel with a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 192 mm glycine, and 0.5 mm DDM. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Purified proteins were adsorbed to thin carbon films rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in low-pressure air and supported by copper mesh grids. Samples were washed with 10 drops of double-distilled water, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution for 30 s twice, blotted, and dried in air. Micrographs of negatively stained particles were recorded using Kodak SO163 electron microscopy film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) using a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at ×41,000 magnification with 100 kV acceleration voltage. Micrographs were digitized with a Scitex Leafscan 45 scanner (Leaf system Inc., Westborough, MA) with a pixel size of 2.44 Å at the specimen level. Automated Particle Selection and Image Analysis—We developed a single particle image analysis method using neural network (28Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Ogura T. Iwasaki K. Sato C. J.

Ferrante C. Feng J. Mio K. Ogura T. Zhang M. Lin P.H. Pan Z. Komazaki S. Kato K. Nishi M. Zhao X. Weisleder N. Sato C. Ma J. Takeshima H. Nature. 2007; 448: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For three-dimensional reconstruction, image analysis was performed using SPINNS and the IMAGIC V algorithm (34van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). TRPM2 projections were first picked up using the auto-accumulation method with simulated annealing (SA) (31Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 344 particles in 240 × 240 pixel subframes were selected and used to train a three-layer pyramid-type neural network (28Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 145: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using the trained neural network, 3,832 particles were selected. After background subtraction, these 3,832 particles were aligned rotationally and translationally (35Frank J. Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies: Visualization of Biological Molecules in Their Native State. Oxford University Press, New York2006Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 36van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev.

The aligned images were sorted into 150 classes by the modified growing neural gas network method (30Ogura T. Iwasaki K. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Their class averages were adopted as new references, and this cycle from alignment to averaging was repeated 25 times. The Euler angles of the class averages were automatically determined by the echo-correlated three-dimensional reconstruction method with SA (32Ogura T. Sato C. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) assuming a C4 symmetry, and used to calculate a primary three-dimensional structure by the SIRT method (37Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The reprojections from the volume were employed as references for multi-reference alignment, and raw images in the library were aligned and further clustered, providing improved cluster averages. From the averages, a new three-dimensional map was generated by the reconstruction method using SA without a three-dimensional reference. The three-dimensional map was further refined by the projection matching method (38Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) followed by the echo-correlated reconstruction. This cycle was repeated 17 times. Particle images correlating poorly with the three-dimensional projections were automatically rejected using the cross-correlation function. The final reconstruction included 3,604 particles, 94.1% of all the selected images. The resolution of the final three-dimensional map was assessed using the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) function (39Harauz G. Van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar) at the intersecting point between signal and noise curves of 3σ, or at the threshold of 0.5. Formation of the Channel-Antibody Complex—Anti-FLAG antibodies were added to the purified TRPM2 protein in antibody binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm DDM, 350 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound antibodies were then separated from the TRPM2-antibody complex using Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography (40Sato C. Sato M. Iwasaki A. Doi T. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Samples were negatively stained and imaged as described above. Fab fragments of anti-FLAG antibodies were generated by papain digestion using a commercial kit (Pierce). Fab fragments were conjugated with colloidal gold (5 nm in diameter) (BB International), and non-reacted Fab fragments were removed using 10–30% glycerol gradient centrifugation. The Fab-gold conjugates were mixed with the purified TRPM2 in antibody binding buffer, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. TRPM2-Fab-gold complexes were separated from unbound Fab-gold conjugates by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography, then negatively stained and observed by EM. Expression and Purification of TRPM2 Protein—As endogenously produced TRPM2 is scarce and not sufficient for purification, we constructed recombinant FLAG-tagged TRPM2. Within the splice variants of TRPM2 reported in the human body, one is the full-length wild type, whereas the others contain different deletions in their sequences (7Nagamine K. Kudoh J. Minoshima S.

Commun. 2005; 328: 1232-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The full-length sequence was fused with FLAG tag at the C terminus and expressed in HEK293 cells. The function of the FLAG-tagged TRPM2 channel was measured by the intensity of fura-2 fluorescence and by the whole cell current, and compared with measurements from wild type TRPM2. The H2O2-induced intracellular Ca2+ rise was similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 1A), and the activation by ADPR was also demonstrated to be similar by whole cell patch clamp experiment (Fig. 1, B–D): FLAG-tagged TRPM2 displays a linear voltage-current relationship that is characteristic of the TRPM2 channel (Fig. 1C). These experiments confirmed that the FLAG-tagged TRPM2 protein forms a fully functional channel. For protein purification, FLAG-tagged TRPM2 proteins were transiently expressed in the HEK293 cells, and their membranes were solubilized with nonionic detergent DDM. The solubilized proteins were applied to an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column and competitively eluted by FLAG peptides. TRPM2 proteins before and after this chroma"

Several previous reports have indicated that Daxx is induced upon oxidative stress and is then subjected to phosphorylation-based functional modification. However, the precise molecular events underlying these phosphorylation events remain largely unknown. We report in our current study that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is highly overexpressed in malignant human gliomas and inhibits Daxx-mediated cellular apoptosis. The targeted inhibition of Pin1 by small interfering RNA in A172 glioblastoma cells significantly enhances the apoptotic response induced by hydrogen peroxide or stimulatory Fas antibodies. This is in turn accompanied by the increased induction of Daxx and the activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Furthermore, Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated Ser178-Pro motif in the Daxx protein, and Pin1 overexpression results in the rapid degradation of Daxx via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, a Daxx-S178A mutant, which cannot interact with Pin1, demonstrates higher proapoptotic activity and is refractory to Pin1-mediated antiapoptotic effects. We further found that the expression levels of Pin1 inversely correlate with the degree of Daxx nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma tissues. These results together indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization plays an important role in the negative regulation of Daxx and thereby inhibits the oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptotic response, particularly in malignant tumor cells where Pin1 is often overexpressed.

Oncogenesis comprises a complex series of multistep and multifactorial processes that result in uncontrolled cell proliferation, cell transformation, and cell death (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar). The resistance to apoptosis in malignant tumor cells is one of the most critical factors that directly contribute to tumor cell proliferation and expansion (2Bremer E. van Dam G. Kroesen B.J. de Leij L. Helfrich W. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 382-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this apoptotic evasion represents one of the true hallmarks of cancer and appears to be a vital component in chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic resistance that characterizes the aggressiveness of human malignant tumors (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21638) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic characteristics of tumor cells are often derived from the improper regulation of proapoptotic signaling pathways by various external and internal stimuli (3Rodriguez-Nieto S. Zhivotovsky B. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 4411-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of the pivotal signaling mechanisms that controls cellular apoptotic processes is the phosphorylation of proteins on serine or threonine residues preceding proline (Ser/Thr-Pro) (4Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Wulf G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The recent identification and characterization of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, which can recognize these phosphorylated moieties, has led to the elucidation of a number of novel postphosphorylation regulatory mechanisms (4Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Pin1 catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs within its specific target substrates (4Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Wulf G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization has also now been shown to function in several signaling pathways during tumorigenesis, including Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB (6Ryo A. Suizu F. Yoshida Y. Perrem K. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Rottapel R. Yamaoka S. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1413-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 7Ryo A. Nakamura M. Wulf G. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Pin1 is further implicated in many pivotal oncogenic cellular events, such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis (8Ryo A. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Saitoh T. Yamaguchi A. Perrem K. Kubota Y. Lu K.P. Aoki I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 7523-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, although some of the roles of Pin1 in several oncogenic signaling pathways have been addressed, there has been no direct evidence reported to date showing that Pin1 can inhibit cellular apoptosis in malignant tumor cells. The death-associated protein Daxx was originally identified as a Fas-interacting protein that specifically binds to the death domain of Fas and then facilitates Fas-mediated apoptosis independently of FADD (9Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence presented in recent studies have indicated that Daxx plays a crucial role in the cellular apoptotic response induced by UV, oxidative stress, and glucose deprivation, in addition to its function during Fasmediated apoptosis (10Salomoni P. Khelifi A.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 97-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Daxx has also been reported to localize at the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies in nonapoptotic cells (11Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Indeed, nuclear Daxx has been demonstrated to regulate transcription by acting as a transcriptional corepressor via its interaction with several transcription factors (12Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Several additional studies have also addressed the potential cytoplasmic versus nuclear roles of Daxx toward the triggering of apoptotic pathways (13Khelifi A.F. D'Alcontres M.S. Salomoni P. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Upon various stimuli, such as serum depletion or oxidative stress, Daxx is phosphorylated and retranslocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via the exportin-mediated nuclear transport system (14Song J.J. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30573-30578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Daxx can interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) 3The abbreviations used are:ASK1apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1TUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labelingJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePPIaseprolyl isomerase. 3The abbreviations used are:ASK1apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1TUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labelingJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePPIaseprolyl isomerase. and then activate the ASK1/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. In fact, Daxx-depleted cells have been shown to be resistant to cell death pathways induced by both UV irradiation and oxidative stress following impaired ASK1/JNK activation (13Khelifi A.F. D'Alcontres M.S. Salomoni P. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the phosphorylation of Daxx has also been shown to regulate its subcellular localization and function following proapoptotic stimuli, it is not known whether its protein stability is regulated by phosphorylation or by other posttranslational modifications. apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling c-Jun N-terminal kinase small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase prolyl isomerase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling c-Jun N-terminal kinase small interfering RNA green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase prolyl isomerase The aim of our present study was to clarify the regulation of Daxx by phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerization mediated by Pin1. The importance of both the physical and functional interactions between Daxx and Pin1 during the induction of cell death pathways following exposure to oxidative stress was also investigated, and the involvement of the ASK1/JNK pathway was also evaluated. We find from the results of these analyses that the targeted inhibition of Pin1 in human glioblastoma A172 cells significantly sensitizes these cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Pin1 can protect against the Daxx-mediated apoptotic response. We also find that Pin1 can bind Daxx via its phosphorylated Ser178-Pro motif and facilitate its prompt degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This results in the inhibition of the proapoptotic functions of Daxx. Our present results have thus uncovered a novel molecular mechanism underlying the posttranslational regulation of Daxx and demonstrate that Pin1 acts as a putative antiapoptotic molecule in malignant tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry—Human glioma tissue microarrays (US Biomax, Rockville, MD) were analyzed immunohistochemically using a Pin1 antibody as previously described (15Sasaki T. Ryo A. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Inayama Y. Yamanaka S. Kubota Y. Nagashima Y. Harada M. Aoki I. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2006; 202: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After microwave antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion in 0.3% H2O2. The sections were then treated with anti-Pin1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:200 dilution overnight at 4 °C, after blocking with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was then used as the secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were subsequently treated using a peroxidase-labeled Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), at a 1:200 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Labeled antigen was visualized via a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reaction, and each of the sections was counterstained with hematoxylin. The expression level of Pin1 was evaluated as described previously (15Sasaki T. Ryo A. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Inayama Y. Yamanaka S. Kubota Y. Nagashima Y. Harada M. Aoki I. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2006; 202: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Retroviral siRNA Infection—A Pin1-specific siRNA retroviral vector was prepared as previously described (8Ryo A. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Saitoh T. Yamaguchi A. Perrem K. Kubota Y. Lu K.P. Aoki I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 7523-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Target cell lines were treated with the indicated retrovirus and selected by continuous growth in puromycin (1.0-1.5 μg/ml) for 48 h to isolate stable clones. siRNA Oligonucleotides—Human Daxx siRNA and scrambled control siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The final concentration of siRNA oligonucleotides was 200 nmol/liter, and these molecules were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—A172, 293T, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin (100 mg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Transient transfections were carried out using either Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) or HilyMax (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan). Protein Degradation Assay—Protein degradation assays were performed as described previously (6Ryo A. Suizu F. Yoshida Y. Perrem K. Liou Y.C. Wulf G. Rottapel R. Yamaoka S. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1413-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-Daxx and either wild-type Pin1 or empty vector, with GFP used as a transfection control. Cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to the medium 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested at different time points. Total cell lysates in SDS sample buffer were boiled and then analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-Pin1 (R&D System) or GFP (Invitrogen) antibodies. GST Pull-down, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Analyses—293T cells was lysed with GST pull-down buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μm MG132, 10 μm MG115, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads containing either GST-Pin1 or GST at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitated proteins were then washed three times with GST pull-down buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7Ryo A. Nakamura M. Wulf G. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μm MG132, 10 μm MG115, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were then incubated for 1 h with protein A/G-Sepharose-nonimmunized IgG complexes. Supernatant fractions were recovered and immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody and 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. After washing three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, pellets were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. The antibodies used in this study were obtained from the following sources: mouse monoclonal anti-Daxx, mouse monoclonal anti-Fas (SH-11), and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (MBL International); rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ASK1 (Ser83) and cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) antibodies (Cell Signaling); mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-JNK (Thr(P)183/Tyr(P)185) antibody (BD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal anti-Pin1 (H-123) and rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK (C-17) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Pin1 monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody (Abcam); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2); and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies (Sigma). Fluorescence Imaging—HeLa cells on coverslips were co-transfected with pDs-Red-Daxx and pIRES-puro-GFP-Pin1 using HilyMax (DOJINDO), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde and treated with phosphate-buffered saline and were then stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were visualized under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (16Ryo A. Togo T. Nakai T. Hirai A. Nishi M.

Apoptosis Analysis—Apoptotic cells were detected by the in situ TUNEL method using a DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells with apoptotic nuclei were detected by Hoechst 33258 staining with fluorescent microscopy as described previously (17Tsuruta F. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14040-14047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cell viability was investigated with a trypan blue dye exclusion assay using 0.4% trypan blue dye (Sigma). The data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. from triplicate independent experiments. In Vitro Kinase Assay—For the measurement of JNK1 activity in vitro, A172 cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitor mixture, as described previously (18Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with the anti-JNK antibody C-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. The immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads and washed twice with the above lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). The immune complexes on the Sepharose beads were used in kinase assays with GST-c-Jun. The reaction was initiated by adding 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture (kinase buffer plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of a substrate). After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Pin1 Is Highly Expressed in Human Glioma—It has been previously reported that Pin1 is highly overexpressed in various human malignancies, including breast and prostate cancers, and plays a crucial role in oncogenesis (4Lu K.P. Liou Y.C. Zhou X.Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 5Ryo A. Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Wulf G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Since the relevance of Pin1 in the tumorigenesis of human glioma has not been well characterized, we investigated the correlation of Pin1 expression with the malignant properties of human gliomas. To this end, we first performed immunohistochemical analysis of a human glioma tissue panel, including normal brain tissue controls (n = 9), low grade astrocytomas (grade 2; n = 24), anaplastic astrocytomas (grade 3; n = 45), and glioblastomas (grade 4; n = 28), all classified according to World Health Organization criteria. We found that Pin1 expression was significantly enhanced in glioma tissues compared with normal brain (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Pin1 expression was found to be confined to the nuclei in both normal brain tissue and low grade astrocytoma at relatively low expression levels but exhibited enhanced expression in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (Fig. 1A), as previously found also in other malignant tumors (15Sasaki T. Ryo A. Uemura H. Ishiguro H. Inayama Y. Yamanaka S. Kubota Y. Nagashima Y. Harada M. Aoki I. Pathol. Res. Pract. 2006; 202: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These immunohistochemical analyses indicate that the higher expression of Pin1 correlates with a more highly malignant glioma (Fig. 1B). Our results thus suggest a potential role for Pin1 in the development of these tumors. Loss of Pin1 Function Sensitizes Human Glioblastoma Cells to Oxidative Stress-induced Cell Death—Our immunohistochemical analysis suggested that high levels of Pin1 expression in human gliomas could contribute to the acquisition of some of the malignant characteristics of these tumors. It has been reported that high grade gliomas are resistant to cellular apoptosis and that this could be important for tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance (20Guha A. Mukherjee J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2004; 17: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Pin1 contributes to apoptotic resistance in glioma cells, we attempted to create stable human glioma cell lines in which Pin1 is constitutively suppressed. To this end, we employed a representative human glioblastoma cell line, A172, since these cells have been reported to show antiapoptotic properties against oxidative stress stimuli and anti-tumor drugs (21Duan L. Aoyagi M. Tamaki M. Yoshino Y. Morimoto T. Wakimoto H. Nagasaka Y. Hirakawa K. Ohno K. Yamamoto K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The retrovirus-mediated siRNA targeting of Pin1 in A172 cells (A172-Pin1i) was found to cause a marked knockdown of Pin1 expression (<95%), whereas the control siRNA expressing cells (A172-conti) showed Pin1 expression levels that were similar to the noninfected cells (Fig. 2A). We next treated these stable cell lines with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or anti-Fas stimulatory antibodies to induce cellular apoptosis. We found that Pin1 depletion by siRNA significantly enhances the rate of cell death caused by both of these stimuli by ∼3-fold compared with the control siRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with these results, the A172-Pin1i cells exhibit a higher rate of TUNEL staining compared with A172-conti cells when treated with H2O2 (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, the forced expression of wild-type Pin1, but not its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase mutant (K63A), which was not subject to knockdown by siRNA, reverted the apoptotic response in cells harboring Pin1 siRNA molecules to control levels (Fig. 2, F and G). These results verify that there is a specific role of endogenous Pin1 in the suppression of H2O2- or Fas-induced cellular apoptosis and suggest that the targeted inhibition of Pin1 in glioma cells causes an increased susceptibility to cellular apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. The Suppression of Pin1 Enhances Daxx Induction and Subsequent ASK1/JNK Activation toward Oxidative Stress-induced Cellular Apoptosis—Our initial analysis indicated that the specific depletion of Pin1 enhances the apoptotic response to oxidative stress in human glioma cells. To delineate the molecular events underlying this phenomenon, we performed immunoblotting analysis to monitor the activity of the intracellular signaling pathways related to oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptosis. Since it has been reported that the activation of the Daxx-ASK1-JNK pathway is a critical event in the induction of cellular apoptosis by H2O2 (3Rodriguez-Nieto S. Zhivotovsky B. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 4411-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we evaluated the components of this pathway in our current experiments. A172-Pin1i cells demonstrate a more prominent induction of the Daxx protein upon H2O2 treatment, compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Following this enhanced Daxx induction, the phosphorylation of both ASK1 and JNK, indicating activation, was consistently increased in A172-Pin1i cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, indicating apoptosis, were observed to be significantly higher in Pin1-depleted cells (Fig. 3A), consistent with data from our TUNEL analysis (Fig. 2D). An in vitro kinase assay further demonstrated that JNK activity was significantly increased in A172-Pin1i cells following H2O2 treatment when compared with the control cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the inhibition of Pin1 may sensitize the cells to the apoptotic response induced by H2O2 by augmenting the induction and activation of the Daxx-ASK1-JNK pathway. To confirm this possibility, we transduced Daxx-specific siRNA oligonucleotides to block endogenous Daxx expression as well as treated the cells in parallel experiments with the JNK inhibitor II (SP600125). We found that either Daxx siRNA or SP600125 treatment could significantly reduce the susceptibility of A172-Pin1i cells to H2O2-induced cellular apoptosis (Fig. 3, C and D). This indicates that the targeted depletion of Pin1 enhances the induction of Daxx, thereby augmenting the apoptotic response via the ASK1/JNK pathway upon oxidative stress. Pin1 Facilitates the Degradation of Daxx via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—Since the depletion of Pin1 was found to enhance the expression of Daxx following oxidative stress, we speculated whether the corollary would be true, such that high levels of Pin1 might in fact inhibit the expression of Daxx. To test this possibility, we initially co-transfected A172 cells with FLAG-tagged Daxx and Pin1 and then examined the expression levels of Daxx. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that Pin1 reduces the exogenously transduced FLAG-Daxx levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the expression levels of endogenous Daxx were also found to be reduced in these Pin1-overexpressed cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of Daxx are not altered upon Pin1 overexpression (data not shown), indicating that Pin1 might affect the protein stability of Daxx. To address whether either the binding or the catalytic activity of Pin1 is required for the suppression of Daxx, we performed a parallel experiment using either a WW domain (binding domain) mutant (W34A) or PPIase domain (catalytic domain) mutant (K63A) of Pin1. Neither of these mutants fully down-regulate FLAG-Daxx expression (Fig. 4C), indicating that both the WW and PPIase domains are indeed required for this function of Pin1. We next performed parallel experiments with or without H2O2 treatment. Pin1 overexpression was found to suppress Daxx expression in both untreated and H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that Pin1 affects Daxx expression independently of H2O2 exposure. Cycloheximide analysis also revealed that the protein stability of both endogenously and exogenously expressed Daxx is significantly reduced when Pin1 is overexpressed (Fig. 4, E and F), further indicating that Pin1 enhances the degradation of Daxx. To address whether this is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we performed parallel experiments using the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and MG115. Treatment with these inhibitors significantly inhibited the degradation of Daxx following Pin1 overexpression (Fig. 4G). Moreover, immunoprecipitation analysis with cells co-transfected with FLAG-Daxx and Myc-ubiquitin, with or without Pin1 co-transfection, further revealed that Pin1 overexpression significantly enhances the polyubiquitination of the Daxx protein (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, the reciprocal ubiquitination analysis with or without H2O2 treatment further revealed that Pin1 enhances the polyubiquitination of Daxx irrespective of H2O2 exposure (Fig. 4I). These results together confirm that Pin1 enhances the degradation of the Daxx protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway independently of proapoptotic stimuli, such as H2O2treatment. Pin1 Interacts with Daxx Phosphorylated on Its Ser178-Pro Motif—Our previous results indicated that Pin1 could affect the protein stability of Daxx by mediating the ubiquitination status of this protein. We next examined whether Pin1 could directly interact with Daxx. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that this is indeed the case (Fig. 5A). GST pull-down analyses further demonstrated that wild-type Pin1 binds the Daxx protein but that the Pin1 WW domain mutant W34A does not (Fig. 5B). The association between Pin1 and Daxx was also found to be completely abolished by pretreatment of the cell lysates with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase prior to the GST pull-down analysis (Fig. 5C), indicating that Pin1 binds only phosphorylated Daxx. Interestingly, the interaction between Pin1 and Daxx"

Although Brm and Brg1 can compensate for each other, it is possible that Brm and Brg1 have their unique properties to differentially regulate gene expression in vivo. To explore this, we examined the requirement of Brm and Brg1 for p53-dependent transcription, especially p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2, using cell lines in which Brm or Brg1 could be inducibly knocked down. We found that Brg1, but not Brm, is required for p21 induction in MCF7 cells. However, in Brg1-deficient H1299 cells, Brm is also required for p21 induction. Likewise, Brm is necessary for induction of p21 in MCF7 cells in which Brg1 is stably knocked down. In contrast, Brg1 has little, if any, effect on p53-mediated induction of MDM2 in cells that have Brm and vice versa. In addition, we demonstrated that the impaired induction of p21 upon Brg1 knockdown is at least in part due to decreased p53 binding to the p21 promoter. Taken together, we provided evidence that Brg1 is preferentially recruited by p53 for inducing a subset of target genes through chromatin remodeling. Thus, we hypothesize that the potential tumor suppressor function for Brg1 is mediated in part through the p53 pathway.

The highly condensed chromatin packaged with genomic DNA forms a repressive structure that tends to restrict the access of transcription factors and co-factors to DNA, and relief from this repression by chromatin remodeling is critical for gene transcription (1Cosma M.P.

Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Generally, chromatin remodeling is achieved through two mechanisms: covalent modifications such as acetylation of histone tails and disruption or alteration of the local histone-DNA association by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (3Khorasanizadeh S.

Currently, four distinct classes of chromatin remodeling complexes, SWI/SNF, ISWI, Mi-2, and Ino80, have been identified (5Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 6Roberts C.W. Orkin S.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 7Mohrmann L.

Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes contain either Brahma (Brm) 3The abbreviations used are: BrmBrahmaBrg1Brahma-related gene 1siRNAsmall interfering RNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationHAhemagglutinin 3The abbreviations used are: BrmBrahmaBrg1Brahma-related gene 1siRNAsmall interfering RNAChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationHAhemagglutinin or Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) as an ATPase subunit (7Mohrmann L. Verrijzer C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1681: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Brm and Brg1 are evolutionarily conserved with a considerable degree of amino acid sequence identity, and their functions appear to be partially redundant. It has been well established that Brg1 and Brm are involved in transcriptional activation as well as transcriptional repression for a subset of genes (9Simone C. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, both Brm and Brg1 are required for activation of genes such as CD44 (10Strobeck M.W. DeCristofaro M.F.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and TopBP (13Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) for transcriptional repression. Moreover, Brg1 can functionally replace Brm and vice versa (14Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the presence of Brm and Brg1 in an SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is mutually exclusive, and functional differences between Brm and Brg1 have been implicated from in vitro and in vivo studies. First, knockout mice studies revealed that Brg1–/– is embryonically lethal, but heterozygous Brg1+/– is viable and cancer-prone (15Bultman S. Gebuhr T. Yee D. La Mantia C. Nicholson J. Gilliam A. Randazzo F. Metzger D. Chambon P. Crabtree G. Magnuson T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1287-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In contrast, Brm–/– develops normally with increased body weight and is not prone to cancer (16Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Second, Brm and Brg1 are differentially expressed in various normal tissues. For instance, Brg1 is predominantly expressed in cells that constantly undergo proliferation or self-renewal (17Reisman D.N. Sciarrotta J. Bouldin T.W. Weissman B.E. Funkhouser W.K. Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2005; 13: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Third, Brm and Brg1 display variable binding affinities to certain transcription factors in vitro. For example, Brg1 specifically associates with zinc finger proteins, whereas Brm preferentially interacts with ankyrin repeat family proteins (18Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These differences between Brm and Brg1 suggest that distinct target genes may be regulated by Brg1 and Brm.The tumor suppressor p53 functions as a potent transcription factor that activates or represses a plethora of target genes to regulate multiple cellular pathways, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair, and metabolism (19Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage and other stress signals, p53 is stabilized and activated. Upon binding to consensus p53-responsive elements present in the promoters, p53 trans activates many downstream targets including p21 and MDM2 (19Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because the accessibility of p53 to its target gene promoters is the first step for activating gene expression, it has been subject to extensive investigations (20Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol.

A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that p53-dependent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and targeted acetylation of histones at the promoters of p53 target genes correlate well with the ability of p53 to activate gene expression (23Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 24Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, when compared with histone acetylation, the role of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in p53-dependent transcription is less understood. Although the exogenous Brg1 was shown to interact with, and enhance, p53 to activate a reporter under the control of the p21 promoter (26Lee D. Kim J.W. Seo T. Hwang S.G. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22330-22337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whether endogenous Brg1 and Brm play a role in the p53 pathway remains unknown.In this study, we analyzed p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2 using cell lines in which Brm or Brg1 can be inducibly knocked down. We found that p21 induction is impaired by Brg1 but not Brm knockdown in MCF7 cells. However, in Brg1-deficient H1299 cells, p21 induction is also decreased by Brm knockdown. Likewise, Brm is necessary for induction of p21 in MCF7 cell in which Brg1 is stably knocked down. In contrast, Brm and Brg1 have little, if any, role in p53-mediated induction of MDM2. We also demonstrated that the impaired induction of p21 upon Brg1 knockdown is at least in part due to decreased p53 binding to the p21 promoter. Taken together, we provided evidence that Brm and Brg1 differentially regulate a subset of p53 target genes through chromatin remodeling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—To generate an inducible small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Brg1 or Brm, an siRNA was cloned into pBabe-H1 vector as described previously (28Liu G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—MCF7 and H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. To generate MCF7 cell lines in which Brg1 or Brm can be inducibly knocked down under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter, pBabe-H1-siBrg1 or pBabe-H1-siBrm was transfected into MCF7 cells in which a tetracycline repressor is expressed by pcDNA6 (28Liu G. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1398-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Brg1 and Brm knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin and confirmed by Western blot analysis. To generate cell lines in which p53 is stably knocked down and Brg1 is inducibly knocked down, pBabe-U6-sip53 was co-transfected with pcDNA4, which confers zeocin resistance, into inducible Brg1 knockdown MCF7 cells and then selected with zeocin. To generate cell lines in which Brg1 is stably knocked down and Brm is inducibly knocked down, pBabe-U6-siBrg1 was co-transfected with pcDNA4 into Brm-inducible knockdown MCF7 cells.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated from MCF7 cells, which were uninduced or induced to express Brg1 siRNA for 3 days along with or without treatment of 0.5 μm doxorubicin for 8 h. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by using iScript according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). A 160-bp cDNA fragment of p21 was amplified with forward primer 5′-CATGTGGACCTGTCACTGTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCTCTTGGAGAAGATCAGCC-3′.A 225-bp cDNA fragment of actin was measured as a loading control, which was amplified with forward primer 5′-CTGAAGTACCCCATCGAGCACGGCA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAACG-3′.Luciferase Assay—Dual luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The pGL2-p21A luciferase reporter under the control of the two p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter was used (29Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of pGL2-p21A luciferase reporter, 100 ng of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HA-p53, and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV (Promega) were co-transfected into H1299 or MCF7 cells. The -fold increase in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by p53 divided by that induced by an empty pcDNA3 vector.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (30Harms K.L. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2014-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After induction (+) or no induction (–) of Brg1 or Brm siRNA for 72 h, cells were treated with doxorubicin for the indicated time, cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and then sonicated to generate 500–1000-bp DNA fragments and immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 (DO-1) and control mouse IgG. After reverse cross-linking and phenol-chloroform extraction, the bound DNA fragments were purified by a Qiagen column. PCR was performed to visualize the enriched DNA fragments. Primers designed to amplify the region from nucleotide –2312 to –2131 in the p21 promoter were forward primer 5′-CAGGCTGTGGCTCTGATTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTCAGAGTAACAGGCTAAGG-3′. Primers designed to amplify the region from nucleotide +3779 to +3969 in the MDM2 intron 1 were forward primer 5′-GGATTGGGCCGGTTCAGTGG-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-GGTCTACCCTCCAATCGCCAC-3′.Colony Formation Assay—MCF7 and H1299 cells seeded at 500 per well in a 6-well plate were cultured in the absence or presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 12–14 days and then stained with crystal violet.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 7–10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies followed by ECL detection. Antibodies against Brg1 (G7), Brm (E1), p21 (C19), cyclin B, p130, and MDM2 (SMP14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against p53, HA epitope, and actin were described previously (31Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).RESULTSGeneration of MCF7 Cells Lines in Which Brm or Brg1 Can Be Inducibly Knocked Down—The SWI/SNF complex is a multisubunit complex with a total molecular mass of ∼2.0 MDa, and the ATPase activity conferred by Brm or Brg1 is essential for chromatin remodeling. To investigate the potential effect of endogenous SWI/SNF complex on p53 transcriptional activity, the mutually exclusive ATPases, Brm and Brg1, are inducibly knocked down in MCF7 cells. Two representative Brg1 knockdown cell lines, MCF7-Brg1-KD-5 and MCF7-Brg1-KD-35, are shown in Fig. 1A, whereas two representative Brm knockdown cell lines, MCF7-Brm-KD-9 and MCF7-Brm-KD-24, are shown in Fig. 1B. Upon induction of siRNA against Brg1 and Brm, the levels of Brg1 and Brm proteins were markedly decreased (Fig. 1, A and B). We would like to note that the extents of Brm and Brg1 knockdown were similar, which makes it reasonable to compare the potential effects caused by knockdown of Brg1 and Brm. Previously, it was reported that upon knock-out of Brm in mice, the level of Brg1 was elevated (16Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thus, knockdown of Brm might lead to increased expression of Brg1 and vice versa. To test this, the levels of Brg1 and Brm were measured in Brm and Brg1 knockdown cells, respectively. We found that knockdown of Brm had no effect on the level of Brg1 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, knockdown of Brg1 had no effect on the level of Brm (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, we found that knockdown of Brg1 or Brm had no significant effect on the level of SNF5, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Together, we confirmed that Brg1 and Brm can be inducibly knocked down, and Brg1 and Brm do not compensate for each other at the level of expression.Knockdown of Brg1 Impairs p53-mediated Induction of p21 in MCF Cells—Overexpression of Brg1 can promote p53 to activate the p21 promoter by luciferase assay (26Lee D. Kim J.W. Seo T. Hwang S.G. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22330-22337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether endogenous Brg1 is required for endogenous p53 to induce its target genes. To explore this, we examined induction of p21 and MDM2 in MCF7 cells in which Brg1 is inducibly knocked down. We found that upon treatment with Nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction (32Vassilev L.T. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or doxorubicin, p53 was stabilized and subsequently p21 was induced (Fig. 2A). However, the extent of p21 expression was markedly decreased when Brg1 was inducibly knocked down (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3, 5, 9, and 11 with lanes 4, 6, 10, and 12, respectively). Interestingly, the level of p53 stabilized by treatment with Nutlin-3 or doxorubicin were not changed significantly (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3, 5, 9, and 10 with lanes 4, 6, 10, and 12, respectively), suggesting that the decreased expression of p21 upon Brg1 knockdown was not due to alteration of p53 stabilization. To rule out the possibility that this was due to clonal variation, we examined the effect of Brg1 knockdown on p53 transcriptional activity in another cell line, MCF7-Brg1-KD-35, and found that DNA damage-mediated induction of p21 was also inhibited by Brg1 knockdown (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Next, we examined whether Brg1 knockdown has an effect on p53 induction of MDM2, another well-defined p53 target gene. Interestingly, we showed that Brg1 knockdown had little, if any, effect on p53 induction of MDM2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that Brg1 knockdown does not affect global p53-dependent transcription. Furthermore, to determine whether the impaired induction of p21 protein is due to decreased expression of p21 transcript, we performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis and found that the level of p21 transcript, although up-regulated upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4), was markedly decreased upon Brg1 knockdown (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 4).FIGURE 2Brg1 knockdown impairs p53-dependent induction of p21 in MCF7 cells. A, Western blots were prepared using extracts from MCF7-Brg-KD-5 cells that were uninduced (–) or induced (+) to express siRNA to knock down Brg1 for 72 h followed by mock treatment or treatment with 2.5 μm Nutlin-3 or 0.5 μm doxorubicin (Dox) for indicated time. The blots were analyzed with antibodies against p53, p21, and actin. B, the experiment was performed as in A except that cells were treated with 0.5 μm doxorubicin for 8 h. The blots were analyzed with antibodies against MDM2, p53, p21, and actin. C, reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed to measure the levels of p21 and actin transcripts from cells treated as described in B. D, Western blots were prepared using extracts from MCF7-Brg1-KD-5 and MCF7-Brg1-KD-p53-KD-13 cells that were uninduced (–) or induced (+) to knock down Brg1 for 72 h followed by mock treatment or treatment with 0.5 μm doxorubicin or 250 nm camptothecin for 6 h. The blots were analyzed with antibodies against Brg1, MDM2, p53, p21, and actin. ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although p21 is a bona fide target of p53, it can be regulated by other p53-independent mechanisms (33Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the effect of Brg1 knockdown on p21 induction is p53-dependent, we generated cell lines in which p53 is stably knocked down and Brg1 can be inducibly knocked down. One representative cell line, MCF7-Brg1-KD-p53-KD-13, was chosen for further studies. As shown in Fig. 2D, upon induction of Brg1 siRNA, the level of Brg1 was decreased significantly in both MCF7-Brg1-KD-5 (Fig. 2D, Brg1 panel, lanes 1–6) and MCF7-Brg1-KD-p53-KD-13 (Fig. 2D, Brg1 panel, lanes 7–12). In addition, p53 was undetectable upon treatment with doxorubicin or camptothecin in MCF7-Brg1-KD-p53-KD-13 cells, suggesting that p53 was efficiently knocked down (Fig. 2D, p53 panel, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 9–12). We found that induction of p21 by doxorubicin or camptothecin was completely abrogated in p53 knockdown MCF7 cells (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 9–12). Consistent with the data above, induction of p21, but not MDM2, was reproducibly decreased by Brg1 knockdown in MCF7 cells upon treatment with doxorubicin or camptothecin (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that in MCF7 cells, Brg1 is necessary for DNA damage-mediated induction of p21 in a p53-dependent manner.Knockdown of Brm Has No Significant Effect on p53-mediated Induction of p21 in MCF7 Cells—Unlike Brg1, little is known about the role of Brm in p53-mediated transcription. Thus, we examined p53 induction of p21 and MDM2 in MCF7 cells in which Brm is inducibly knocked down. We found that upon treatment with doxorubicin, p21 was induced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). However, the extent of p21 expression was not changed upon knockdown of Brm (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6, respectively). Likewise, Brm knockdown had no effect on p53 stabilization and induction of MDM2 (Fig. 3A). To confirm this, another cell line, MCF7-Brm-KD-24, was treated with doxorubicin for 4 and 8 h. We found that the extent of p21 induction was not affected upon Brm knockdown, although the extent of MDM2 induction was inhibited in the first 4 h following treatment with doxorubicin (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6, respectively). Because the phosphorylation status of p130 is known to be regulated upon Brm down-regulation, we examined the level of p130 in MCF7 cells with or without Brm knockdown in the presence or absence of doxorubicin treatment. The level of cyclin B protein was also examined as a control. We showed that the level of cyclin B was not affected by Brm knockdown (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, although the phosphorylation status of p130 in the absence of doxorubicin was not affected by Brm knockdown (Fig. 3C, p130 panel, compare lanes 1 and 2), the level of hyper-phosphorylated p130 was markedly increased upon Brm knockdown in the presence of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3C, p130 panel, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6, respectively). These data are consistent with previous reports (16Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 34Coisy-Quivy M. Disson O. Roure V. Muchardt C. Blanchard J.M. Dantonel J.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon treatment with Nutlin-3, the levels of p53, p21, and MDM2 remained unchanged by Brm knockdown (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 3 and 4). We would like to mention that upon treatment with Nutlin-3, the activity of p53 was substantially increased, whereas the level of p53 was only slightly increased, consistent with the earlier report (32Vassilev L.T. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that knockdown of Brm alone does not affect p53-dependent transcription in MCF7 cells.FIGURE 3Knockdown of Brm has no significant effect on p53-dependent induction of p21. A and B, Western blots were prepared using extracts from MCF7-Brm-KD-9 and MCF7-Brm-KD-24 that were uninduced (–) or induced (+) to express siRNA to knock down Brm for 72 h followed by mock treatment or treatment with 0.5 μm doxorubicin for 4 and 8 h. The blots were analyzed with antibodies against MDM2, p53, p21, and actin. C, cells were treated as described in A. The blots were analyzed with antibodies against cyclin B, p130, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). D, the experiment was performed as in A except that Nutlin-3 was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Brm Is Necessary for p53-mediated Induction of p21 in Brg1-deficient Cells—Although the extent of knockdown for Brg1 and Brm was comparable in MCF7 cells, knockdown of Brg1, but not Brm, diminished induction of p21-mediated by p53. However, most studies found that Brg1 and Brm have similar functions and, to some degree, can compensate for each other. Therefore, we reasoned that the lack of effect for Brm may be due to the possibility that Brg1 is preferentially utilized by p53 for chromatin remodeling, and the activity of Brm for p53 is compensated by Brg1. However, because Brg1 is frequently lost in cancers, Brm would become the only ATPase present in the SWI/SNF complex, which must be recruited by p53 for gene regulation. To address this, H1299 was chosen, which is a p53-null lung carcinoma cell line and lacks a functional Brg1 expression due to 69-nucleotide deletion in the coding region (35Reisman D.N. Sciarrotta J. Wang W. Funkhouser W.K. Weissman B.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wong A.K. Shanahan F. Chen Y. Lian L. Ha P. Hendricks K. Ghaffari S. Iliev D. Penn B. Woodland A.M.

As shown in Fig. 4A, Brm, but not Brg1, was detected in H1299 cells. Next, we generated several H1299 cell lines in which Brm can be inducibly knocked down. Two representative clones, H1299-Brm-KD-13 and H1299-Brm-KD-15, are shown in Fig. 4C. We showed that upon induction of siRNA against Brm, the level of Brm protein was markedly decreased. To examine whether Brm knockdown has an effect on p53 induction of p21, HA-tagged exogenous p53 was transiently transfected into H1299 cells along with or without Brm knockdown. We found that upon Brm knockdown, p21 induction was significantly decreased, whereas the levels of HA-p53 were not changed significantly (Fig. 4C, p21 and p53 panels, compare lanes 3 and 7 with lanes 4 and 8, respectively). We would like to note that MDM2 induction was also slightly decreased upon Brm knockdown (Fig. 4C, MDM2 panel, compare lanes 3 and 7 with lanes 4 and 8, respectively).FIGURE 4Brm is necessary for p53-mediated induction of p21 in Brg1-deficient cells.

Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although their physiological substrates are proline-rich cell-wall proteins, they can also hydroxylate collagenous X-Pro-Gly repeats. The plant P4Hs also resemble C-P4H-I in that they bind poly(l-proline) that acts as a substrate for them while it is an efficient C-P4H-I inhibitor (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol.

A striking difference between the plant P4Hs and C-P4Hs is their size, as the plant P4Hs are relatively small monomers. A small monomeric P4H has also been cloned and characterized from the Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (20Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This P4H can hydroxylate collagen-like peptides in addition to poly(l-proline) and various proline-rich viral sequences (20Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of all P4Hs contain four conserved residues; a histidine and an aspartate in a His-X-Asp motif, which together with a second, distal histidine bind the Fe2+ ion, and a basic residue that binds the 5-carboxylate group of the 2-oxoglutarate (21Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The structure of the catalytic domain of HIF-P4H-2 complexed with Fe2+ and a 2-oxoglutarate analogue, {[(4-hydroxy-8-iodoisoquinolin-3-yl)carbonyl]amino}acetic acid, was solved recently (15McDonough M.A. Li V.

Bruick R.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Clifton I.J. McDonough M.A. Ehrismann D. Kershaw N.J. Granatino N. Schofield C.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 644-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The structure of the C-P4H tetramer is currently unknown, but that of the peptide-substrate binding domain of the human C-P4H-I α subunit has been solved by NMR and x-ray crystallography (23Hieta R.

It consists of 2.5 tetratricopeptide repeats and contains solvent-exposed tyrosines that are likely involved in peptide-substrate binding. The catalytic domain is insoluble and, therefore, not suitable for crystallographic analysis. Detailed knowledge of the structure of the C-P4H catalytic domain would help in the rational design of potent inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. The catalytic domain of HIF-P4H-2 is not a suitable model for this purpose because of its low amino acid sequence identity (14%, starting from HIF-P4H-2 Thr-185, Fig. 2) and the remarkably different substrate specificity. We report here on the determination of several apo and liganded structures of an algal P4H of C. reinhardtii (Cr-P4H-1) (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which shows 26% sequence identity to the catalytic domain of C-P4H-I (starting from Cr-P4H-1 Val-29, Fig. 2), and which, like the C-P4Hs, uses proline-rich peptide-substrates (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cr-P4H-1 and the C-P4Hs are inhibited by both pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate and pyridine 2,5-dicarboxylate, whereas the latter compound does not inhibit the HIF-P4Hs (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 8Keskiaho K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure of Cr-P4H-1 seems important to gain a better understanding of the properties of the catalytic domain of the C-P4Hs. The Cr-P4H-1 structure identifies the residues involved in cosubstrate binding and reveals a groove formed by an extension after the second jellyroll β-strand. The catalytic site is in a pocket in the middle of this shallow groove. Mutagenesis studies and crystallographic data on the crystal contact interactions of loops of neighboring molecules in this groove also suggest that it is important for peptide-substrate binding. Expression, Purification, and Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant Recombinant Cr-P4H-1 Polypeptides—Because NMR analysis of full-length Cr-P4H-1 (lacking the signal peptide and, thus, starting from Ala-17) with an N-terminal histidine tag (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicated that the N terminus of the polypeptide was disordered (data not shown), a truncated construct starting from Val-29 and containing a Met-His6-Met sequence at the N terminus (referred to as His6-Cr-P4H-1-V29) was generated, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity as described previously (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SeMet-labeling of His6-Cr-P4H-1-V29 was performed by expressing it in a methionine-requiring auxotrophic E. coli strain B384 (DE3) using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 20 h at 20 °C. Mutations were introduced into the His6-Cr-P4H-1-V29 plasmid with a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenesis oligos were the following: Y134F, 5′-CTGCAGGTTCTGCACTTCCATGACGGTCAGAAG-3′+ 5′-CTTCTGACCGTCATGGAAGTGCAGAACCTGCAG-3′; Y168F, 5′-GTCACGATGCTCATGTTCCTGACCACGGTG-3′+ 5′-CACCGTGGTCAGGAACATGAGCATCGTGAC-3′; R93A, 5′-GACAGCGAGATCGCCACCAGCACCGGCAC-3′+ 5′-GTGCCGGTGCTGGTGGCGATCTCGCTGTC-3′; S95A, 5′-GAGATCCGCACCGCCACCGGCACCTGG-3′+ 5′-CCAGGTGCCGGTGGCGGTGCGGATCTC-3′; W99A, 5′-ACCAGCACCGGCACCGCGTTTGCTAAGGGCGAG-3′+ 5′-CTCGCCCTTAGCAAACGCGGTGCCGGTGCTGGT-3′; E127A, 5′-CTGGAGAACCATGCGGGGCTGCAGGTTC-3′+ 5′-GAACCTGCAGCCCCGCATGGTTCTCCAG-3′; Q130A, 5′-CCATGAGGGGCTGGCGGTTCTGCACTACC-3′+ 5′-GGTAGTGCAGAACCGCCAGCCCCTCATGG-3′; Y140A, 5′-CCATGACGGTCAGAAGGCTGAGCCACACTATGAC-3′+ 5′-GTCATAGTGTGGCTCAGCCTTCTGACCGTCATGG-3′; R161A, 5′-GAGCACGGCGGCCAGGCCGTGGTCACGATGCTC-3′+ 5′-GAGCATCGTGACCACGGCCTGGCCGCCGTGCTC-3′; W243F, 5′-TGGAGCGCCACCAAGTTCATCCACGTGGCCCCC-3′+ 5′-GGGGGCCACGTGGATGAACTTGGTGGCGCTCCA-3′; H245A, 5′-GCCACCAAGTGGATCGCCGTGGCCCCCATCGG-3′+ 5′-CCGATGGGGGCCACGGCGATCCACTTGGTGGC-3′. Because co-crystallization experiments of the His6-Cr-P4H-1-V29 with ligands failed, another construct having an N-terminal SUMO partner fused to the Gly-30 of Cr-P4H-1 (referred to as Cr-P4H-1-G30) was generated using the Champion™ pET SUMO protein expression system (Invitrogen). The fusion protein was expressed and purified as described (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), after which the SUMO partner was cleaved by digestion overnight with SUMO protease (Invitrogen or LifeSensors Inc.) at 4 °C in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8. The sample was reapplied to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column after which the cleaved Cr-P4H-1-G30 obtained in the flow-through was applied to a SuperDex HR75 column by which the buffer was changed into the storage buffer of 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.8. The catalytic properties of the purified Cr-P4H-1 polypeptides were determined using poly-L proline, Mr 5000, as a substrate, as described previously (8Keskiaho K. Hieta R. Sormunen R. Myllyharju J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals were grown using vapor diffusion methods with drops made by mixing equal volumes of protein (dissolved in storage buffer) and well solution (Table 1). The SeMet-labeled His6-Cr-P4H-1-V29 produced bipyramidal crystals (referred to as SeMet(apo) crystals). These crystals were used to solve the initial apo structure of Cr-P4H-1 (referred to as SeMet(apo) crystal form). Needle-like crystals, referred to as the needle(apo) crystals, were also obtained with the non-labeled construct by using 0.24 mm N-octanoylsucrose (Hampton Research) as an additive (Table 1). Subsequent co-crystallization experiments with Zn2+ and pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate (Sigma) were performed with the Cr-P4H-1-G30 construct, resulting in a third crystal form referred to as Zn(complex) (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallization, data collection and refinement statistics of the three crystal forms of Cr-P4H-1 Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.

A three-wave-length multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset to 2.8 Å resolution was collected from a SeMet(apo) crystal using synchrotron radiation at the BW7A beamline, EMBL, DESY, Hamburg. An additional high resolution dataset was collected from a second SeMet(apo) crystal to 1.93 Å resolution. The dataset for the needle(apo) crystal was collected at the high-throughput macromolecule beamline ID14-3, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble. In the case of the Zn(complex) crystal form, the cryo solution consisted of 20% glycerol, 2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm ZnSO4, and 2 mm pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate. An ∼20-s soak in the cryoprotectant before freezing the crystal in liquid nitrogen resulted in the optimal diffraction pattern and allowed data collection to 1.85 Å at the X12 beamline, EMBL, DESY, Hamburg. All the datasets were processed using XDS (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. The initial phaseset (2.8 Å resolution, average figure-of-merit being 0.69) was obtained from the SeMet(apo) multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion dataset using SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and the initial model was constructed using RESOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 59: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar). The data were subsequently processed with programs of the CCP4 package (29P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The model was further refined using the data to 1.93 Å resolution, with REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and the iterative model building programs O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The needle(apo) and Zn(complex) crystal forms were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (33McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) and molecule A of the SeMet(apo) as a model. Both structures were refined using REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), and the models were completed using COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). In most of the apo subunits there was a strong electron density in the 2-oxoglutarate pocket. This density could not be modeled as a water molecule, but a chloride ion placed at this position refined to normal B-values. The presence of a chloride ion also agrees with the geometry of this site, with distances to the surrounding atoms of Nz (Lys-237) and Og1 (Thr-178) being 3.1 and 3.0 Å, respectively. The final refinement statistics for all three crystal forms are shown in Table 1. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used in the refinement of the needle(apo) crystal form. The structures were validated using COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), WHATIF (34Vriend G. J.

Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared using ICM (MOLSOFT, LLC) (see Fig. 5, A and B) and SwissPDB-viewer (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). For the structure superimpositions with the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), the central residues Val-131—Leu-132, His-143—Asp-145, Leu-166—Met-167, Thr-178—Val-179, Leu-202—Ala-203, Leu-210—Met-211, His-227—Gly-228, and Lys-237—Trp-238 of the Cr-P4H-1 jelly roll β-strands were used. The superimpositions with HIF-P4H-2 (PDB code 1G19) and clavaminate synthase (CAS) (PDB codes 1GVG and 1DRY) resulted in root mean square differences for the corresponding Cα atoms of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.8 Å, respectively. Determination of the Cr-P4H-1 Structures—Four structures of N-terminal-truncated Cr-P4H-1 were obtained, two of the apoenzyme from two crystal forms referred to as the SeMet(apo) and needle(apo), one of a binary complex with the competitive inhibitor Zn2+, and one of a ternary complex with Zn2+ and pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate (Tables 1 and 2). These two complex structures were obtained from the third crystal form referred to as the Zn(complex) form (Tables 1 and 2). The SeMet(apo) structure was determined by the multiple-wave-length anomalous dispersion phasing method and was used to solve the needle(apo) and the Zn(complex) crystal forms by molecular replacement.TABLE 2The four conformational states of Cr-P4H-1 and their propertiesConformational stateCrystal formReference moleculeResidue rangeMetal-binding site2-Oxoglutarate-binding sitePeptide binding grooveβ3-β4 Hairpin loopTyr-140 of βIIβII-βIII loopSeMet(apo)SeMet(apo)D28–249EmptyChloride ion + watersEmptyDisorderedOutOpenNeedle(apo)Needle(apo)A28–251WaterChloride ionNeighboring βII-βIII loopaThese modes of binding are caused by crystal contacts; the bound loops belong to a neighboring moleculeDisorderedInOpenBinary complexZn(complex)B36–251Zn2+WatersNeighboring β3-β4 hairpin loopaThese modes of binding are caused by crystal contacts; the bound loops belong to a neighboring moleculeDisorderedOutOpenTernary complexZn(complex)A36–251Zn2+Pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylateOwn βII-βIII loopOrderedInCloseda These modes of binding are caused by crystal contacts; the bound loops belong to a neighboring molecule Open table in a new tab The SeMet(apo) crystal form was refined at 1.93 Å resolution, whereas the needle(apo) and Zn(complex) forms were refined at 2.90 and 1.85 Å, respectively (Table 1). Each crystal form has multiple copies per asymmetric unit, representing altogether four conformational states differing with respect to the presence of ligands and the conformation of some of the active site loops (Table 2). The cores of each conformational state superimpose well, with the root mean square deviations of Cα atoms in a pairwise comparison being 0.3–0.5Å. Analysis of each of the structures by means of Molprobity (35Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. II I de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar) shows that there are no Ramachandran outliers (Table 1). The SeMet(apo) form has four similar molecules per asymmetric unit, of which molecule D is best defined, whereas the needle(apo) form has three similar molecules per asymmetric unit, of which A is best defined (Table 2). The Zn(complex) form has two molecules of different conformation per asymmetric unit; molecule A (the ternary complex) has the competitive inhibitor pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate in the 2-oxoglutarate-binding pocket and a Zn2+ ion at the iron-binding site, whereas molecule B (the binary complex) has only the bound Zn2+ (Table 2). The ternary complex is the best defined structure in terms of its corresponding electron density map and will mainly be used for the subsequent description of the overall fold. The Overall Structure—Cr-P4H-1 consists of 13 β-strands and 3 α-helices, which form a compact one-domain molecule (Figs. 2 and 3A). The C-terminal part (about 120 residues) is formed by 8 β-strands (β6-β13) folded into the jellyroll fold typical of the 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases (22Clifton I.J. McDonough M.A. Ehrismann D. Kershaw N.J. Granatino N. Schofield C.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 644-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These eight β-strands are labeled as βI-βVIII for consistency in nomenclature (Figs. 2 and 3, A and B). The β-strands 1 and 2 of the N-terminal part extend the jellyroll β-sheet formed by β-strands I, VIII, III, and VI (the major sheet), whereas β-strands 3 and 4 form an elongated solvent-exposed loop (β3-β4 hairpin loop) followed by β5, which extends the other end of the major β-sheet (Fig. 3, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W2107319755,"Nude mice exhibit athymia and hairlessness by a loss-of-function mutation in the transcription factor Foxn1 gene. Although the immunological functions of Foxn1 have been studied intensively, there have been relatively few studies of its functions in skin. Foxn1 regulates expression of hair keratins, which is essential for normal hair structure; however, how Foxn1 regulates hair keratin expression and hair formation is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that mice lacking phospholipase C (PLC)-delta1, a key molecule in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, and nude mice show similar hair abnormalities, such as lack of cuticle and bending. We also found that expression of hair keratins was remarkably decreased in skin of PLC-delta1 knockout mice. Furthermore, expression of PLC-delta1 was induced in Foxn1-transfected U2OS cells. In addition, we showed that PLC-delta1 expression was remarkably decreased in skin of nude mice. In skin and keratinocytes of nude mice as well as PLC-delta1 KO mice, activation of PLC downstream effectors, such as PKC and nuclear factor of activated T cells, was impaired. These results indicate that PLC-delta1 is an essential molecule downstream of Foxn1 in normal hair formation, and strongly suggest that hairlessness in nude mice is caused by insufficient expression of PLC-delta1."

Here, we show that the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion from permeabilized platelets occurred concomitantly with the activation of small GTPase Ral. This secretion was inhibited by the addition of GTP-Ral-binding domain (RBD) of Sec5, which is a component of the exocyst complex known to function as a tethering factor at the plasma membrane for vesicles. We generated an antibody against Sec5-RBD, which abolished the interaction between GTP-Ral and the exocyst complex in vitro. The addition of this antibody inhibited the GppNHp-induced secretion. These data indicate that Ral mediates the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion from permeabilized platelets through interaction with its effector, the exocyst complex. Furthermore, GppNHp enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of dense granule secretion from permeabilized platelets, and this enhancement was inhibited by Sec5-RBD. In intact platelets, the association between Ral and the exocyst complex was induced by thrombin stimulation with a time course similar to that of dense granule secretion and Ral activation. Taken together, our results suggest that the Ral-exocyst pathway participates in the regulation of platelet dense granule secretion by enhancing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the secretion.

Platelet activation occurs in response to vascular injury and plays an essential role in thrombus formation and hemostasis. Several agonists, including thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and thromboxane A2, can activate platelets at sites of vascular injury (1Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The activation of platelets by these agonists involves the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which leads to cell shape change, granule secretion, and platelet aggregation (1Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Horiuchi H. Ann. Med. 2006; 38: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In activated platelets, however, it has been demonstrated that levels of intracellular Ca2+ vary considerably, ranging from 0.2 to 2 μm (3Nesbitt W.S. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Harper I.S. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Platelets store self-agonists, such as ADP and serotonin, in dense granules (2Horiuchi H. Ann.

Release of these contents plays an important role in further platelet activation and recruitment of circulating platelets to the site of vascular injury. Although an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is the trigger for regulated exocytosis in platelets (5Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Pharmacol.

Non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues have also been shown to shift the Ca2+ concentration-response curve for dense granule secretion to the left in electropermeabilized platelets, indicating that GTPγS and GppNHp increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of platelet secretion (7Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that some GTPases are involved in the process, although the molecular basis remains unclear. guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-(β, γ-imido)triphosphate guanosine diphosphate Ral-binding domain glutathione S-transferase streptolysin-O matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry glucose transporter 4 protein kinase Cα Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases are classified into several groups such as Ras subfamily that is implicated in cell proliferation, Rho subfamily involved in cytoskeletal regulation, and Rab subfamily involved in vesicle transport (12Takai Y.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Small GTPases cycle between inactive GDP-bound form and active GTP-bound form that exert their function through specific interaction with effector proteins. The activation process is performed by GDP/GTP exchange reaction that is mediated by GDP/GTP exchange factors. The inactivation process is performed by GTP hydrolysis that is mediated by GTPase-activating proteins. Ral GTPases are members of the Ras subfamily, consisting of RalA and RalB. Most of the Ral-GDP/GTP exchange factors so far identified, such as Ral-GDP dissociation stimulator, Rgl, and Rlf, are downstream effector molecules of Ras, indicating that Ras controls Ral activation (14Wolthuis R.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels also induces Ral activation independently of Ras activation (16Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ral GTPases have several effector molecules and exert multiple functions, including endocytosis through Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1), exocytosis through the exocyst complex, cytoskeletal organization through filamin, and tumorigenesis through yet unknown factors (18Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 19van Dam E.M. Robinson P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In platelets, both RalA and RalB are abundantly expressed (20Bhullar R.P. Chardin P. Haslam R.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Bhullar R.P. Yang S. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1996; 225: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ral is rapidly activated after stimulation with various agonists, and its activation is mediated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (17Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the function of Ral in platelets remains unclear. The exocyst complex is composed of eight proteins (Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) and has been implicated in tethering of vesicles to specific regions on the plasma membrane in some cell types (23Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exocyst complex is one of the Ral effectors, and Ral binds to Sec5 in a GTP-dependent manner (24Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R. Roufogalis B.D. Robinson P.J. J. Biol.

In budding yeast, the exocyst complex plays an essential role in vesicle transport required for the growth of daughter cells under control of the Rab family small GTPase Sec4p (29TerBush D.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In mammals, the exocyst complex is implicated in the formation of cell polarity by targeting vesicles to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells (31Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Exo70 has been reported to bind the Rho family GTPase TC10 and play a role in the targeting of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation in adipocytes (33Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 34Inoue M. Chiang S.H. Chang L. Chen X.W. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of Ral GTPase and its effector, the exocyst complex, in platelet dense granule secretion. We demonstrate that Ral regulates the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion through interaction with the exocyst complex, by showing that the addition of a Ral-binding domain (RBD) of Sec5 or anti-Sec5-RBD antibody inhibits the GppNHp-induced secretion from permeabilized platelets. We further show that GTP-Ral enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of dense granule secretion from permeabilized platelets and propose that the Ral-exocyst pathway could play a role in dense granule secretion in intact platelets. Constructs, Antibodies, Materials, and Other Methods—cDNA encoding full-length RalA, RalB, and Sec5-RBD (amino acids 1–120) were cloned from the Marathon-Ready human brain cDNA (Clontech) by PCR. Truncated RalA (amino acids 9–183) was prepared as described (35Fukai S. Matern H.T. Jagath J.R. Scheller R.H. Brunger A.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sec5-RBD T11A mutant was produced by PCR mutagenesis. All of the sequences of PCR products were confirmed by sequencing using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). These cDNAs were subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pRSET A (Invitrogen) to produce His6-tagged proteins and pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. These His6-tagged and GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the purified recombinant proteins were extensively dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (Bio-Rad) or from the intensities of the bands on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Anti-Sec5-N terminus and anti-Sec8-C terminus polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the N-terminal peptide of human Sec5 (MSRSRQPPLVTGISPNEGIP, corresponding to amino acids 1–20) and the C-terminal peptide of human Sec8 (EQAAIKQATKDKKITTV, corresponding to amino acids 958–974), respectively. Anti-Sec5-RBD and anti-GST antibodies were raised in rabbits by injecting GST-Sec5-RBD (amino acids 1–120) as an antigen and were affinity-purified from the antiserum. Anti-RalA, anti-Sec8, and anti-protein kinase Cα (PKCα) mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-RalB mouse monoclonal antibody was from Millipore. Anti-His6 mouse monoclonal antibody and rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies were from GE Healthcare; these were used as secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE Healthcare). Streptolysin-O (SLO) was provided by Dr. S. Bhakdi (Mainz University, Mainz, Germany) (36Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S.

Unless otherwise specified, all of the other chemicals including nucleotides and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Platelet Dense Granule Secretion Assays—The assay method for the Ca2+-induced dense granule secretion using permeabilized platelets was described previously (37Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H.

Briefly, [3H]serotonin-loaded platelets (∼20,000 cpm/assay, 1 × 108 platelets/assay) were permeabilized with SLO in Buffer A, where the calculated free Ca2+ concentration was ∼20 nm (42Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The permeabilized platelets were incubated with the ATP regeneration system, 100 μm GppNHp, and various tested materials at 4 °C for 15 to 30 min. Then, unless otherwise specified, permeabilized platelets were stimulated at 30 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold Buffer A (1:4, v/v). Finally, released [3H]serotonin was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman) after removing platelets by centrifugation. The secretion levels of [3H]serotonin were expressed as percentages of the total [3H]serotonin in the platelets before the final incubation. In the secretion assay using intact platelets, [3H]serotonin-loaded platelets were stimulated with 0.5 unit/ml thrombin at 30 °C for the indicated periods in modified Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose), and released [3H]serotonin was measured as described above. Assay Analyzing Specific Binding of GST-Sec5-RBD with Active Ral—GDP- or GppNHp-bound His6-RalA and RalB (10 μg each), prepared as described (40Shirakawa R. Higashi T. Kondo H. Yoshioka A. Kita T.

After washing the beads, bead-associated His6-Ral proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody. GTP (GppNHp)-Ral Pulldown Assay Using GST-Sec5-RBD—Platelet samples were lysed (1:4, v/v) in ice-cold Buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease-inhibitor mixture at 4 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 5 min. Then, the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with 10 μg of GST-Sec5-RBD at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing the beads, bead-associated Ral proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RalA and RalB monoclonal antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed on the blots using Image J 1.38x software (National Institutes of Health). Identification of the Exocyst Complex in Platelets—Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST alone or GDP- or GTPγS-bound GST-RalA (amino acids 9–183) (30 μg each) were incubated with platelet cytosol (30 mg of proteins) (39Shirakawa R.

The bead-associated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and staining with Coomassie Blue followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis (44Nishi E. Hiraoka Y. Yoshida K. Okawa K. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31164-31172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To evaluate the subcellular distribution of the exocyst complex in platelets, isolated platelets were resuspended in Buffer A containing protease inhibitors, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was regarded as cytosolic fraction and the pellet as membrane-bound fraction. SLO-permeabilized platelets were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min to allow the cytosol to leak out and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was regarded as the fraction leaked out from the cells and the pellet as the fraction retained in the cells. Comparable amounts of the supernatants and the pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RalA, anti-Sec5-N terminus, anti-Sec8, and anti-PKCα antibodies. Analysis of the Effect of Anti-Sec5-RBD Antibody on the Ral-Exocyst Interaction—Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST alone, GDP- or GppNHp-bound GST-RalA (amino acids 9–183) (8 μg each) were incubated with platelet cytosol (0.8 mg of proteins) in the presence of indicated concentration of anti-GST or anti-Sec5-RBD antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the beads, bead-associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Sec5-N terminus polyclonal antibody and anti-Sec8 monoclonal antibody. Analysis of the Ral-Exocyst Interaction in Intact Platelets—Platelets (6 × 108 platelets/assay) isolated from freshly obtained whole blood were stimulated with 0.5 unit/ml thrombin for various periods at 30 °C. Samples were lysed (1:4, v/v) in ice-cold Buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease-inhibitor mixture at 4 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) coated with anti-Sec8-C terminus polyclonal antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the beads, bead-associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RalA and anti-Sec8 monoclonal antibodies.

In this assay, the secretion is dependent on the exogenous addition of ATP and cytosol, and more than 50% of the serotonin stored in dense granules is released within 1 min upon stimulation with 20 μm Ca2+. By modification of this method, we first confirmed the previous finding that dense granules were secreted by stimulation with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue in permeabilized platelets (7Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Padfield P.J. Panesar N. Henderson P. Baldassare J.J. Biochem.

GppNHp induced the dense granule secretion in time- and concentration-dependent manners (Fig. 1, A and B) in a condition where the calculated free Ca2+ concentration was ∼20 nm (42Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GTP did not induce the secretion of dense granules at 100 μm (data not shown) or even at 1 mm (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, although the addition of ATP was required for the GppNHp-induced secretion (data not shown), exogenous addition of platelet cytosol was not required, unlike for the Ca2+-induced secretion (38Yoshioka A.

These results indicated that GppNHp and Ca2+ stimuli utilized distinct pathways in permeabilized platelets. Involvement of Ral in the GppNHp-induced Dense Granule Secretion from Permeabilized Platelets—The GppNHp dependence in the secretion suggested that some GTPases were involved in the process. Among numerous GTP-binding proteins, we focused on Ral because Ral preferentially localizes on dense granules in platelets (22Mark B.L. Jilkina O. Bhullar R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is rapidly activated in response to agonist stimulations (17Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test whether Ral is involved in the regulation of the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion from permeabilized platelets, we first characterized the RBD of Sec5, a Ral-binding component of the exocyst complex (24Brymora A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The interaction between Sec5-RBD and Ral is specific because it has been demonstrated that Sec5 does not bind to other small GTPases, such as RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, Rab8, K-Ras, or H-Ras (26Sugihara K. Asano S. Tanaka K. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Ohta Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We produced and purified wild-type Sec5-RBD and the Sec5-RBD T11A mutant lacking the Ral binding activity (35Fukai S. Matern H.T. Jagath J.R. Scheller R.H. Brunger A.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as GST fusion proteins. Sec5-RBD interacted with the GppNHp-bound forms of RalA and RalB but not with GDP-bound forms (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, Sec5-RBD T11A did not bind either the GppNHp- or GDP-bound forms (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined the state of activation of Ral in permeabilized platelets by a GTP-Ral pulldown assay using GST-Sec5-RBD. When permeabilized platelets were incubated with 100 μm GppNHp, both RalA and RalB were converted to the active forms in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). About 17% of total RalA or RalB were activated after a 15-min incubation with GppNHp (Fig. 2C). In contrast, incubation of permeabilized platelets with 1 mm GTP did not activate RalA (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the time course of the Ral activation was well correlated with that of the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion (compare Figs. 1A and 2C). We then analyzed the effects of Sec5-RBD on the GppNHp-induced secretion. The addition of Sec5-RBD in permeabilized platelets inhibited the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion (Fig. 3A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). This inhibition was presumably due to the blocking of endogenous active Ral by Sec5-RBD. On the other hand, the addition of Sec5-RBD T11A or GST did not inhibit the secretion (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that Ral was involved in the regulation of the GppNHp-induced dense granule secretion. Involvement of the Exocyst Complex in the GppNHp-induced Dense Granule Secretion from Permeabilized Platelets—Among the effector molecules of Ral, exocyst complex could be a candidate for mediating the GppNHp-induced secretion from permeabilized platelets. To examine this possibility, we first confirmed the existence of the exocyst complex in platelet extracts by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4A, seven protein bands ranging in molecular mass from 70 to 110 kDa were specifically detected in the GTPγS-RalA lane (lane 3). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of these proteins identified all the eight components of the human exocyst complex and another Ral effector, Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1). Human Sec15 protein is composed of two isoforms that share 66% identity and 75% similarity (24Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R. Roufogalis B.D. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29792-29797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); we detected both Sec15-like 1 and -like 2 isoforms in human platelets. Subcellular distribution analysis revealed that RalA was exclusively membrane-bound, whereas the exocyst complex was equally distributed in both cytosol and membrane fractions of intact platelets ("

Understanding the activation process of MT1-MMP is essential for designing novel and effective cancer therapies. Like all of the other MMPs, MT1-MMP is synthesized as a zymogen, the latency of which is maintained by its inhibitory prodomain. Proteolytic processing of the prodomain transforms the zymogen into a catalytically active enzyme. A sequential, two-step activation process is normally required for MMPs. Our in silico modeling suggests that the prodomain of MT1-MMP exhibits a conserved three helix-bundled structure and a “bait” loop region linking helixes 1 and 2. We hypothesized and then confirmed that in addition to furin cleavage there is also a cleavage at the bait region in the activation process of MT1-MMP. A two-step sequential activation of MT1-MMP is likely to include the MMP-dependent cleavage at either P47GD↓L50 or P58QS↓L61 or at both sites of the bait region. This event results in the activation intermediate. The activation process is then completed by a proprotein convertase cleaving the inhibitory prodomain at the R108RKR111↓Y112 site, where Tyr112 is the N-terminal residue of the mature MT1-MMP enzyme. Our findings suggest that the most efficient activation results from a two-step mechanism that eventually is required for the degradation of the inhibitory prodomain and the release of the activated, mature MT1-MMP enzyme. These findings shed more light on the functional role of the inhibitory prodomain and on the proteolytic control of MT1-MMP activation, a crucial process that may be differentially regulated in normal and cancer cells.

The latter exhibit the presence of either a transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (1Visse R. Nagase H. Circ.

MMPs are especially important to the aberrant proteolysis associated with pathologies including cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases (3Mott J.D. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). All individual members of the MMP family are synthesized as latent zymogens. The active site zinc of the MMP catalytic domain is coordinated with the three histidines of the active site and with the cysteine of the “cysteine switch” motif of the N-terminal prodomain (4Van Wart H.E.

Hydrophobic interactions between the helixes maintain the stability of the three-helix bundle of the prodomain. In the course of the two-step activation, the external active protease initially cleaves the susceptible bond at the “bait” region of the prodomain of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9. This event destroys the helix bundle and leads to the generation of the activation intermediate. The activation intermediate is processed further by either an external proteinase or autocatalytically resulting in the complete removal of the residual prodomain sequence (9Maskos K. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The activation process involves proprotein convertases, autocatalysis. and other activated MMPs and it may occur either intracellularly or extracellularly (10Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G.

The two-step proteolytic removal of the prodomain results in the activation of the latent MMP zymogen and the generation of a mature enzyme with full proteolytic activity. Invasion-promoting MT1-MMP (MMP-14) is expressed in many cancer types in which the protease functions as one of the main mediators of proteolytic events on the cell surface (12Itoh Y. Seiki M. J.

Multiple cleavage targets of MT1-MMP include the extracellular matrix components (types 1, 2, and 3 collagens, laminin 1 and 5, fibrin, fibronectin, and vitronectin) and cell-surface receptors including CD44, integrin αvβ3, transglutaminase, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (15Seiki M.

Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Like all of the other members of the MMP family, MT1-MMP is synthesized as a proteolytically inert zymogen. Evidence suggests that the processing of the zymogen into the catalytically active MT1-MMP enzyme involves proprotein convertases including furin, PACE4, PC6, and PC7 (23Remacle A.G. Rozanov D.V. Fugere M. Day R. Strongin A.Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J.

The requirement for furin activity in the activation of the cellular MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP zymogens was convincingly demonstrated (26Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We, however, hypothesized that similar to the other MMPs, the activation pathway of MT1-MMP, in addition to the known proprotein convertase cleavage, involves a previously uncharacterized cleavage step that leads to the activation intermediate. The intermediate is then processed by proprotein convertases with the generation of the mature and fully active enzyme of MT1-MMP. To determine whether this hypothesis is correct, we performed an extensive biochemical analysis of the cleavage events that target the prodomain of MT1-MMP. As a result of these studies, we suggest that the activation of MT1-MMP involves a two-step mechanism in which the processing of the prodomain sequence at the P47GD↓L50 and P58QS↓L61 cleavage sites generates the intermediate form. The activation intermediate is then processed by a proprotein convertase cleaving at the R108RKR↓Y112 site and generating the fully activated enzyme of MT1-MMP. Antibodies, Reagents, and Cells—Rabbit polyclonal antibody (AB815) against the hinge region of MT1-MMP and the murine monoclonal antibody (clone 3G4) against the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP and the hydroxamate inhibitor GM6001 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody against a V5 epitope was from Invitrogen. Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-Long Chain(LC)-biotin) was from Pierce. Human glioma U251 cells were originally from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. As a control, we used U251 cells stably transfected with the two original pcDNA3.1-zeo and-neo plasmids (mock cells). For MT1-MMP overexpression, U251 cells were transfected with the wild-type MT1-MMP (MT1-WT cells) and the MT1-MMP mutant constructs including the R89A mutant with the inactivated R89RPR92 putative furin cleavage motif (R89A cells), the ARAA mutant with the inactivated furin R108RKR111 cleavage site (ARAA cells), and the R89A/ARAA double mutant (R89A/ARAA cells). In addition, we used WT cells that stably co-expressed MT1-MMP with the α1-antitrypsin Portland furin inhibitor (PDX) (MT1/PDX cells). The MT1/PDX cells were initially transfected with MT1-MMP and then with PDX. All these cell lines were constructed and have been extensively characterized in our earlier works (23Remacle A.G.

MT1-MMP Constructs Expressed in Breast Carcinoma MCF-7 Cells—The double L50D/L61D MT1-MMP mutant (MT1-L50D/L61D) was generated by PCR mutagenesis using the wild-type MT1-MMP template. The following oligonucleotide primers were used for mutagenesis: 5′-TGGCTACCTGCCTCCCGGGGACGATCGTACCCACACACAGCGCTC-3′ (MT1-L50D-forward) and 5′-GAGCGCTGTGTGTGGGTACGATCGTCCCCGGGAGGCAGGTAGCCA-3′ (MT1-L50D-reverse), and 5′-AGCGCTCACCCCAGTCAGACTCAGCTGCCATCGCTGCCATG-3′ (MT1-L61D-forward) and 5′-CATGGCAGCGATGGCAGCTGAGTCTGACTGGGGTGAGCGCT-3′ (MT1-L61D-reverse) (mutant positions are underlined). The mutant sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type and the constructed L50D/L61D MT1-MMP mutant were cloned into the pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZ lentiviral plasmid vector. The lentiviral constructs were used to transfect breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The stable transfectants were selected with 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Blasticidin-resistant clones expressing the wild-type MT1-MMP (MT1-V5 cells) and the L50D/L61D mutant construct (MT1-L50D/L61D cells) were selected by Western blotting with the V5 antibody. Several independent clones of MT1-L50D/L61D were randomly selected (numbers 5, 7, and 8) and then used for further analysis. MCF-7 cells stably expressing the wild-type MT1-MMP (MT1-WT cells) and the catalytically inert E240A mutant as well as the mock cells stably transfected with the original pcDNA3.1-zeo plasmid were constructed and described earlier (29Rozanov D.V.

The MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX construct included the propeptide sequence (PRO), the inert (E240) catalytic domain (CAT), and the hemopexin (PEX) domains. To facilitate the isolation and detection in the samples, MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX was tagged with a His6 tag both C- and N-terminal. In addition, a V5 epitope sequence was linked to the C-terminal His6 tag sequence. Specifically, the forward (5′-CACCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATCACGCGCTCGCCTCCCTCGGCTC-3′) and the reverse (5′-TTAGCGCTTCCTTCGAACATTGG-3′) primers were used to obtain the MT1-PRO construct (the His6 tag sequence is underlined) in the PCR. The forward (5′-CACCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGCTCGGCCCAAAGCAGCAGCTTC-3′) and the reverse (5′-GCTCACCGCCCCGCCGCCCTCCTCGTC-3) primers were used in the cloning of MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX. After confirming their authenticity by sequencing, the constructs were then re-cloned into the pET101 expression vector. Competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the recombinant vectors. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 6 h at 37 °C. E. coli cells (6 g/liter of E. coli culture) were then collected by centrifugation (5,000 × g; 15 min), re-suspended in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme (5 mg/ml), and disrupted on ice by sonication (30 s pulse, 30-s intervals; 8 pulses total). The MT1-PRO was purified from the supernatant fraction using a 1.6 × 10-cm Co2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS supplemented with 1 m NaCl. MT1-PRO was eluted with an imidazole gradient (10–100 mm; 100 ml) in PBS, 1 m NaCl. The MT1-PRO fractions were concentrated using a 5-kDa cutoff concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and dialyzed against PBS containing 0.005% Brij35. A polyclonal antibody to the purified individual MT1-PRO was then raised in rabbits. The MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX inert construct was purified from the inclusion bodies and then refolded to restore its native conformation. The inclusion bodies (10 mg of total protein) were washed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and then dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The soluble material was then refolded by a 50-fold dilution in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 500 mml-arginine monohydrochloride, and 20% glycerol. The refolded MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX was next concentrated using a 30-kDa cutoff concentrator (Millipore) and purified on a 1.6 × 10-cm Co2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, 1 m NaCl. The construct was eluted with an imidazole gradient (10–500 mm gradient; 100 ml) in PBS, 1 m NaCl, concentrated using a 30-kDa cutoff concentrator and dialyzed against PBS, containing 0.005% Brij35.

The peptides, MT1-PRO and MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX (1 μg each), were co-incubated with MT1-CAT or MMP-2 (20 nm each) for the indicated time at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm ZnCl2. MMP-2 was isolated and activated by 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate as described earlier (20Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

The digest samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer to determine the mass of the cleavage products and, consequently, the location of the scissile bonds. To identify the N-terminal sequence of the cleavage fragments, the catalytically inert MT1-PRO-CAT-PEX E240A construct (5 μg) was co-incubated with MT1-CAT and furin (50 ng each) for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.8. Recombinant human furin was prepared in the S2 Drosophila expression system (Invitrogen) and purified to homogeneity (33Fugere M. Limperis P.C. Beaulieu-Audy V. Gagnon F. Lavigne P. Klarskov K.

The reactions were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by the transfer of the protein bands on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and N-terminal microsequencing of the resulting bands. Microsequencing was performed at ProSeq (Boxford, MA). For the subsequent cleavage experiments, cellular MT1-MMP was immunoprecipitated, using AB815 antibody (1 μg) and Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl of a 50% slurry), for 12 h at 4 °C from the cell lysate aliquots (1 mg of total protein each) of the confluent MT1/PDX cells. The lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, pH 7.4) was supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture set III (Sigma) (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm EDTA). The beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with MT1-CAT (20 ng) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2. The digest samples were analyzed by Western blotting with 3G4 antibody and a TMB/E substrate (Chemicon) to identify the cleavage products. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface-associated MT1-MMP was biotinylated by incubating cells (80–90% confluence) for 30 min on ice in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml EZ-Link NHS-LC-biotin. Excess biotin was removed by washing cells in ice-cold PBS and then quenched by incubating cells for 10 min in PBS containing 100 mm glycine. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture set III. MT1-MMP was precipitated from cell lysates using streptavidin-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blotting with the MT1-MMP antibody (3G4) followed by the goat secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG and a TMB/M substrate (Chemicon). Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was used to determine the efficiency of MMP-2 activation by cellular MT1-MMP. Cells were plated in the wells of a 48-well plate (Costar/Corning) in serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown to reach a 90% confluence. The medium was then replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with the purified MMP-2 proenzyme (100 ng/ml). After incubation for 12 h, the medium aliquots were analyzed by gelatin zymography on 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Novex) to detect the proenzyme and the activated species of MMP-2.

The sequence identity of the MMP-1 template with MT1-MMP is 40% (E-value = 1e–117). The predicted structure of the MT1-MMP propeptide is in a good agreement with all structurally investigated MMP propeptides (root mean square deviation = 0.9 Å). Structural Modeling of the Three Helix-bundled MT1-MMP Prodomain—The multiple sequence alignment of the prodomain peptide sequences of several MMPs is shown in Fig. 1. There is a significant sequence homology of the helical regions and loops 2 and 3 in the peptide sequence of MMPs. In contrast, loop 1, which is the bait region in MMP-1, -2, and -9 (9Maskos K. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), displays the least homology thus providing structural evidence of a unique means of the first proteolytic step of a two-step activation mechanism for each MMP. The second and the final activation step of MMPs including MT1-MMP involves cleavage at the C-terminal part of loop 3 (Fig. 1). Because the crystal structure of the MT1-MMP proenzyme is not currently available, we used in silico modeling to model the spatial structure of the MT1-MMP prodomain. The available structures of the sequence homologous MMP-1, -2, -3, and 9 were used as a template. We also built the model of MT1-MMP using the structure of the MT1-MMP catalytic domain and the structures of the prodomain and the PEX domain of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 (Fig. 1). Computer modeling suggests that the triple helix bundle is highly conserved in MMPs including the MT1-MMP prodomain. In our model, in agreement with the solved structures for proMMP-1, proMMP-2, proMMP-3, and proMMP-9, the proMT1-MMP prodomain has a conserved 3-helix structure. Consistent with the exposure of the bait region in loop 1 in MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and other MMPs, the loop 1 peptide sequence also appears highly accessible to the proteolytic attack in MT1-MMP. It has also been established that the MMP cleavage motifs predominantly exhibit the presence of the P3 Pro and a hydrophobic residue (especially Leu) at the P1′ position. There are two potential cleavage motifs, P47GD↓L50 and P58QS↓L61, in the loop 1 sequence of the prodomain of MT1-MMP. Because the furin cleavage of the R108RKR111 loop 3 sequence represents the final step of MT1-MMP proenzyme processing, we hypothesized that the loop 1 bait sequence is the target of either the autolytic cleavage or this processing is performed by an external protease with an MMP cleavage specificity. MT1-MMP Proteolysis of the Prodomain in Vitro—To determine whether the loop 1 sequence is susceptible to MT1-MMP autoproteolysis, we synthesized the peptides (Y44LPPGD↓ L50RTHTQRSPQ59 and H53TQRSPQS↓L61SAAIAAM68) that overlap the putative cleavage sites. We also synthesized the mutant peptides in which the cleavage sites were inactivated by the L50D and L61D mutations, respectively. The peptides were subjected to proteolysis by MT1-CAT and MMP-2. The MS analysis of the digest reactions were followed to determine the molecular mass and, consequently, the sequence of the cleavage products (Fig. 2). We determined that both MT1-CAT and MMP-2 efficiently cleaved the original peptides and generated the cleavage fragments of the expected size and the peptide sequence. Thus, the cleavage of the Y44LPPGD↓ L50RTHTQRSPQ59 resulted in peptides 44–49 (YLPPGD) and 50–59 (LRTHTQRSPQ). Similarly, peptides 53–60 (HTQR-SPQS) and 61–68 (LSAAIAAM) were detected following the cleavage of H53TQRSPQS↓L61SAAIAAM68 by MT1-CAT and MMP-2. In sharp contrast, the mutant L50D and L61D peptides exhibiting the inactivated MMP cleavage sites were completely resistant to proteolysis. GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs, totally blocked the cleavage reactions (not shown). To additionally confirm these results, we isolated the recombinant MT1-PRO and then subjected the construct to MT1-CAT proteolysis and MMP-2 proteolysis (Fig. 3). The digest reactions were analyzed by SDS electrophoresis in 10–20% polyacrylamide gels in the Tris-Tricine system (Invitrogen) and also by MS. One major 6-kDa and several minor cleavage products were detected in the reactions. MS iden"

In this study, we exploited the intrinsic property of PrP to polymerize spontaneously into disease-related amyloid conformations in the absence of a strain-specified template and analyzed polymerization of mouse and hamster full-length recombinant PrPs. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence of species specificity in cross-seeding polymerization assays. Even when both recombinant PrP variants were present in mixtures, preformed mouse or hamster fibrils displayed no selectivity in elongation reactions and consumed equally well both homologous and heterologous substrates. Analysis of individual fibrils revealed that fibrils can elongate in a bidirectional or unidirectional manner. Our work revealed that, in the absence of a cellular environment, post-translational modifications, or strain-specified conformational constraints, PrP fibrils are intrinsically promiscuous and capable of utilizing heterologous PrP variants as a substrate in a highly efficient manner.

This study suggests that amyloid structures are capable of accommodating local perturbations arising because of a mismatch in amino acid sequences and highlights the promiscuous nature of the self-propagating activity of amyloid fibrils. Previous studies revealed that the transmission of mammalian prions between different species is limited because of a phenomenon referred to as the “species barrier” (1Pattison I.H. Jones K.M. Res. Vet. Sci. 1968; 9: 408-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The species barrier is typically seen as an increase in mean incubation time to disease, an increase in the range of incubation periods within a given host species, an abnormal neuropathological profile, and a drop in the percentage of animals succumbing to disease. The magnitude of the species barrier is thought to depend primarily on the differences in the amino acid sequence of the two PrP 3The abbreviations used are:PrPprion proteinPrPCnormal cellular isoform of the prion proteinPrPScabnormal, disease-associated isoform of the prion proteinrPrPrecombinant PrPMomouseHahamsterAFFMatomic force fluorescence microscopyPKproteinase KThTthioflavine TCJDCreutzfeld-Jakob diseaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideAbantibodyAFMatomic force microscopyTSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathy. 3The abbreviations used are:PrPprion proteinPrPCnormal cellular isoform of the prion proteinPrPScabnormal, disease-associated isoform of the prion proteinrPrPrecombinant PrPMomouseHahamsterAFFMatomic force fluorescence microscopyPKproteinase KThTthioflavine TCJDCreutzfeld-Jakob diseaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideAbantibodyAFMatomic force microscopyTSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathy. isoforms, PrPSc of the donor species and PrPC of the host (2Prusiner S.B.

A. 2004; 101: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Formation of amyloid cross-β-structures was shown to be a common property of a polypeptide backbone regardless of its specific amino acid sequence (10Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). As such, fibril formation by proteins and peptides, even those not involved in the prion phenomenon, was found to exhibit strong species specificity (11Rochet J.C. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10619-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In vitro, the species specificity of amyloid formation was studied using cross-seeding reactions, where polymerization of a specific protein or peptide was seeded by fibrils made up of homologous or heterologous proteins or peptides. The efficacy of cross-seeding reactions was found to depend strongly on the extent to which the primary structure of seeds was similar to that of a substrate (12O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Whereas the studies of the cross-seeded amyloid formation supported the idea that sequence differences account for the species specificity of prion propagation, the similar studies on mammalian prions were mostly limited to short peptide or unstructured protein fragments (13Lee L.Y.L. Chen R.P.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 1644-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the efficiency of cross-seeding in the polymerization reactions that utilized PrP-derived peptides was found to be opposite to the efficacy of prion transmission observed in animals (14Vanik D.L. Surewicz K.A. Surewicz W.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such a result is not surprising, considering that the amyloid cross-β-sheet structure formed by short PrP-derived peptides is likely to be fundamentally different from that of PrPSc. These findings, however, raise important questions as to whether the differences in PrP primary structures do indeed regulate the species barrier and, if so, whether the magnitude of the species barrier can be predicted solely based on such differences. In this work, we used full-length PrP to investigate the role of PrP primary structure in regulating the efficiency of prion transmission between different species. Using an in vitro polymerization reaction that utilizes recombinant prion proteins (rPrP), we tested whether the polymerization of full-length rPrP mimics the species specificity of prion replication in the absence of a cellular environment, PrP glycosylation, or strain-specified conformational constraints. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of species specificity in cross-seeding polymerization assays that utilized mouse (Mo) and Syrian hamster (Ha) rPrPs. Even when Mo and Ha PrPs were present together in mixtures, rPrPs showed no selectivity in supporting elongation of fibrils made up of homologous or heterologous seeds. Our data strongly indicate that amyloid structures are intrinsically promiscuous, that the differences in PrP primary structure are not sufficient to block fibril growth in cross-seeded reactions, and that other factors such as strain-specified conformational constraints, species-specific glycosylation status, or host-encoded factors should be involved in regulating the species barrier. Mo and Ha full-length recombinant PrPs encompassing residues 23-230 and 23-231, respectively, were expressed and purified as described earlier (15Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15534-15543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To form amyloid fibrils, stock solutions of rPrP were prepared immediately before use by resuspending lyophilized rPrP powder in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Formation of Amyloid Fibrils in 96-Well Plates—Stock solutions of Mo or Ha rPrPs were diluted with MES (pH 6.0) and GdnHCl to final concentrations of 50 mm and 2 m, respectively, and a final protein concentration of 2 μm. ThT was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 μm. The polymerization reactions were carried out in 96-well plates with a total reaction volume of 0.2 ml per well. To prepare fibrillar seeds for the seeded reactions, fibrils were formed in manual format as described below, then sonicated for 10 s using a Bransonic-2510 bath sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics), and added to the reaction mixtures to the final amount of 0.1% as calculated per total amount of rPrP substrate. 96-Well plates were incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking at 900 rpm in a Fluoroskan Ascent CF microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems) as described earlier (17Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6776-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Multiple experiments were performed using Mo and Ha rPrPs purified in separate batches. Calculation of the Lag Phase of Polymerization Kinetics—To estimate the lag phase of polymerization, the kinetic curves were fitted by quadratic and exponential functions that describe nucleation and elongation stages of fibril formation, respectively. These functions are limiting forms of hyperbolic cosine solution (Equation 1) of the first-order approximation of the reaction equation developed by Bishop and Ferrone (18Bishop M.F. Ferrone F.A. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 631-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) for analysis of the nucleation-controlled polymerization. F=A(cosh Bt−1), F→12B2At2 at Bt→0, F→12AeBt at Bt≫1(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, F is the observable parameter (ThT fluorescence); t is polymerization time, and A and B are fitting coefficients. This approximation proved to be relevant as fitting coefficients for both stages corresponded to each other with less than 10% error. The lag phases were defined as time from the beginning of the polymerization reaction to the intersection of the fitting curves described by the quadratic and exponential functions. In the case of all seeded reactions, the fitting procedure gave the negative values for the intersection points, indicating the elimination of the nucleation stage. Formation of Fibrils in Manual Format—Stock solutions of Mo or Ha rPrPs were diluted with MES (pH 6.0) and GdnHCl to final concentrations of 50 mm and 2 m, respectively, and to a final protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. The polymerization reaction was carried out in 1.5-ml conical plastic tubes (Fisher) at a total reaction volume of 0.42-0.6 ml at 37 °C with continuous rotation at 24 rpm using a Nutator (model 1105, Clay Adams). For the seeded reactions, preformed fibrils were sonicated for 10 s using Bransonic-2510 bath sonicator and added to the reaction mixture to a final amount of 1% as calculated per total amount of rPrP substrate. For the experiments where composition of individual fibrils was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy or atomic force fluorescence microscopy, the seeding reactions in (Ha)Mo and (Mo)Ha reaction formats were carried out in the presence of 30% preformed fibrillar seeds. However, seeds were not subjected to sonication prior to seeding. SDS-PAGE in Denaturing and Nondenaturing Conditions—To estimate the yield of amyloid formation, the aliquots were taken at the end points of the polymerization reactions and treated with two sample buffers as follows: denaturing (the final 60 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.25 m urea, heating for 15 min at 90 °C), and nondenaturing (no SDS, β-mercaptoethanol or urea, no heating). 12% SDS-PAGE (precast NuPAGE gels, Invitrogen) were used for analysis of samples treated with both denaturing and nondenaturing sample buffers. Maturation of Amyloid Fibrils and PK Digestion Assay—In previous studies, we described that rPrP fibrils acquired 16-kDa PK-resistant core similar to that of PrPSc upon brief heating at 80 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, the procedure referred to as maturation (19Bocharova O.V.

For maturation, rPrP fibrils were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and then Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 100 mm and 0.1%, respectively. Aliquots (20-40 μl, 0.1 mg/ml of rPrP) were placed into 0.5-ml conical plastic tubes, incubated at 80 °C for 5 min, and cooled down. Fibrils were treated with PK for 1 h at 37 °C at a PKto rPrP ratio of 1:100. Digestion was stopped by adding denaturing sample buffer. Samples were heated for 15 min at 90 °C and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (precast NuPAGE gels, Invitrogen) followed by silver staining or Western blotting. Immunostaining and Fluorescence Microscopy—rPrP fibrils (1 μg/ml) were deposited onto Permanox 8-well Lab-Teks chamber slides and stained with antibody as described previously (20Novitskaya V. Makarava N. Bellon A. Bocharova O.V. Bronstein I.B. Williamson R.A. Baskakov I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15536-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Formaldehyde fixation was omitted, and the staining was performed in the following order: 1) anti-PrP human Ab D13 (1:6000, recognizes epitope 96-104); 2) mouse Ab 3F4 (1:3000, hamster-specific and recognizes epitope 109-112); 3) the mixture of secondary Abs, goat anti-human and goat anti-mouse labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 546, respectively (Invitrogen, 1:1000 for both Abs). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) using 1.3 aperture Plan Fluor ×100 numerical aperture objective. The exposure times were 300 ms for Fab D13 and 900 ms for Ab 3F4. Collected images were processed with WCIF ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) as described previously (20Novitskaya V. Makarava N. Bellon A. Bocharova O.V. Bronstein I.B. Williamson R.A. Baskakov I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15536-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging (AFFM)—The AFFM imaging was achieved using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) co-assembled with PicoSPM LE AFM (Molecular Imaging, Phoenix, AZ). The glass coverslips (25 × 25 mm; Fisher) were incubated overnight in 30% HNO3 and rinsed extensively with H2O. The (Ha)Mo fibrils at concentration of 1 μg/ml were deposited on the glass surface for 1 h and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min, and then coverslips were washed with 50 mm Tris saline buffer (TBS). The coverslips were incubated with Ab 3F4 (dilution 1:1000) for 1 h in TBS buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (TBST) and 5% horse serum, and then with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa 546 (Invitrogen) for 1 h in the TBST buffer containing 1% of bovine serum albumin at room temperature. After rinsing two times with TBST and three times with H2O, the samples were incubated with 10 μm ThT in water. To achieve AFM imaging of the same field of view after fluorescence imaging, the samples were dried directly on the fluorescence microscope stage with nitrogen. The imaging field of view for AFM and fluorescence microscopy was overlapped by the alignment of the laser emitted from the AFM scanner. AFM images were collected by PicoSPM LE AFM operated in acoustic alternated current mode with a silicon cantilever PPP-NCH (Nanosensors, Switzerland) with a tip radius <7 nm and a spring constant of ∼42 n/m. Lack of Species Specificity in Mo and Ha Fibril Formation—The species barrier for prion transmission between Syrian hamster and mouse has been well established in previous studies. The species specificity was primarily attributed to differences in the primary structure of Ha and Mo PrP variants (Mo and Ha PrPs are different at eight residues within the amyloidogenic region 90-231). To test whether the species specificity of prion conversion persists in the absence of strain-specified conformational constraints, a cellular environment, or PrP glycosylation, we examined the seeding specificity for fibrillation of full-length Mo and Ha rPrP. The spontaneous polymerization of Ha or Mo rPrPs showed a lag phase of 16 and 18 h, respectively (Fig. 1). The lag phases were calculated using a fitting procedure developed for analysis of nucleation-controlled polymerization described by Bishop and Ferrone (18Bishop M.F. Ferrone F.A. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 631-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the lag phase was eliminated upon seeding with homologous rPrP seeds (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the lag phase was also eliminated when fibrils produced from heterologous rPrPs were used for seeding (Fig. 1). This experiment illustrates that the efficiency of seeding was similar regardless of whether homologous or heterologous seeds were used for cell-free conversion. Cross-seeding Resulted in Formation of “Hybrid” Mo-Ha Fibrils—To test whether the heterologous substrate was involved in elongation of preformed fibrils, we performed cross-seeding experiments, where 30% of freshly formed Mo or Ha fibrils were added to the polymerization reactions containing heterologous substrate. The composition of individual fibrils was analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (20Novitskaya V. Makarava N. Bellon A. Bocharova O.V. Bronstein I.B. Williamson R.A. Baskakov I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15536-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine the species of rPrP within individual fibrils, we used double staining with Ab 3F4, which detects Ha but not Mo PrP, and Fab D13, which detects both Ha and Mo PrP. Because the secondary antibody to Ab 3F4 was labeled with Alexa 546 (red), and the secondary antibody to Fab D13 with Alexa 488 (green), fibrillar parts composed of Mo rPrP were expected to be green, whereas parts made of Ha rPrP were expected to be orange. We found that fibrils formed in both cross-seeded reactions as follows: Mo-seeded Ha (referred to as (Ha)Mo) or Ha-seeded Mo (referred to as (Mo)Ha) consisted of heterogeneous (green and orange) fragments containing Mo or Ha rPrPs (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, the fibrils formed in nonseeded reactions from Mo rPrP were entirely green (Fig. 2C), whereas the fibrils formed from Ha rPrP were orange confirming that both Ab 3F4 and Fab D13 bind to Ha rPrP (Fig. 2D). Using an alternative staining procedure, in which Ab 3F4 was utilized in combination with the amyloid-specific dye ThT, we confirmed that the individual fibrils formed in the cross-seeded reactions consisted of both Mo and Ha parts (supplemental Fig. S1). Fluorescence intensity profiles recorded in both the green and red channels along individual fibrils indicated that fibrils can grow in a bidirectional or unidirectional manner (Fig. 2 A and B, and Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Atomic force fluorescence microscopy imaging of individual (Ha)Mo fibrils. Fibrils were formed from Ha rPrP in the presence of 30% Mo rPrP seeds, stained with Ab 3F4 (red fluorescence) and ThT (green fluorescence), and observed by atomic force fluorescence microscopy. A, fluorescence microscopy images of individual (Ha)Mo fibrils show that fibrillar assembly proceeds either in a monodirectional or bidirectional manner. B, fluorescence microscopy (inset) and atomic force microscopy image of a single (Ha)Mo fibril. This fibril consists of two sections as follows: the section made of Mo rPrP binds ThT only and displays green fluorescence, the section made of Ha rPrP is decorated by Ab 3F4 and is therefore thicker and displays a red fluorescence. C, fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy image of a single (Ha)Mo fibril. This fibril consists of three sections: the section made of Mo rPrP binds ThT only (green) and the sections made of Ha rPrP are decorated by Ab 3F4 (red).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To make sure that hybrid Mo-Ha fibrils were indeed produced as a result of elongation and not because of lateral association of preformed individual Mo and Ha fibrils or filaments, we implemented a technique referred to as AFFM. AFFM consisted of simultaneous measurement of the topological profile of individual fibrils by AFM and fibril composition by dual color staining with Ab 3F4 and ThT. As judged by AFFM, individual fibrils consisted of red and green sections, where the red sections were substantially thicker than the green sections (Fig. 3B). The differences in thickness observed within individual fibrils were because of the binding of Ab 3F4 and secondary Alexa 546-labeled Ab to the fibrillar parts made of Ha rPrP. Because only ThT bound to the parts made up of Mo rPrP, they were substantially thinner. AFFM confirmed that the hybrid Mo-Ha fibrils were not artifacts of lateral aggregation of individual Mo and Ha fibrils. Taken together, our data provide direct evidence that monomeric rPrP supported equally well the elongation of fibrils produced from both homologous and heterologous rPrP seeds. Fibrils Displayed Poor Selectivity in Converting Homologous Versus Heterologous rPrP—Next we were interested in knowing whether the preformed fibrils displayed any species selectivity with respect to binding and converting homologous versus heterologous monomeric rPrP. To test the selectivity, Mo or Ha seeds were added to the reactions containing mixtures of Mo and Ha rPrPs (these reaction formats are abbreviated as (Mo+Ha)Mo and (Mo+Ha)Ha, respectively). In such a format, the cell-free conversion assay mimicked the experiments where the replication of Mo and Ha prions was studied using transonic mice that co-expressed Mo and Ha PrPC (2Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D. Pan K.-M. Groth D. Mirenda C. Torchia M. Yang S.-L. Serban D. Carlson G.A. Hoppe P.C. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 673-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). First, we examined the amount of monomeric rPrP that remained soluble at the very late stages of the reactions by comparing the amounts of rPrP that enter PAGE under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions. In our preliminary studies, we found that the fibrillar rPrP enters PAGE only after being denatured, whereas monomeric rPrP enters PAGE regardless of its denaturation status. Surprisingly, we found that monomeric rPrPs were consumed almost entirely in both (Mo+Ha)Mo and (Mo+Ha)Ha conversion reactions (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). When the conversion reactions were carried out in the Mo+Ha mixtures in the absence of seeds, the yield of amyloid formation was very poor, as judged by large amounts of nonconverted monomeric rPrP seen in the nondenaturing gel (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4 and 6). Therefore, seeding substantially improved the yield of fibrillation in Mo+Ha mixtures. The almost complete depletion of substrate in seeded reactions suggested that both homologous and heterologous monomeric rPrP supported elongation of preformed fibrils. Second, to investigate the selectivity of elongation in more detail, we examined the composition of the fibrils using two assays. Double staining fluorescence microscopy was employed for testing the composition of individual fibrils (Fig. 5), whereas a PK digestion assay followed by Western blotting examined the relative level of newly converted Mo and Ha rPrP across the entire fibrillar population (Fig. 4B). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Ha rPrP participated in the elongation of Mo fibrils in the (Mo+Ha)Mo reaction format (Fig. 5A). Vice versa, Mo rPrP was recruited by Ha seeds in the (Mo+Ha)Ha reaction format (Fig. 5B). Fluorescence intensity profiles indicated that individual fibrils were composed of both Mo and Ha rPrPs. Because of limitations in spatial resolution of the light microscopy technique, it was difficult to determine without doubt whether both Mo and Ha rPrPs were uniformly recruited into growing fibrils or were incorporated as alternating segments. Analysis of the fluorescence microscopy profiles did not exclude the second scenario. However, this question needs to be examined in future experiments using a more advanced approach. The PK digestion assay followed by Western blotting with Ab 3F4 (recognizes Ha rPrP) and Ab P (recognizes both Ha and Mo PrP) showed that both (Mo+Ha)Mo and (Mo+Ha)Ha reactions produced the same amount of PK-resistant material and that the portion of PK-resistant Ha rPrP was similar regardless of whether Ha or Mo seeds were used (Fig. 4B). Vice versa, Mo rPrP was recruited equally well in both reaction formats, as judged from the comparison of the relative band intensities in the blots developed with Ab 3F4 and Ab P, and from comparison of band intensities in the (Mo+Ha)Mo and (Mo+Ha)Ha reaction formats (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results demonstrated that, when used in a mixture, both Mo and Ha rPrPs were recruited with similar efficiency by Mo or Ha seeds. Mixing of Ha and Mo rPrP Interferes with Spontaneous Polymerization—Although seeds appeared to show no preferences in recruiting homologous versus heterologous substrate, we were next interested in determining whether Mo and Ha rPrPs were capable of polymerizing in a mixture in the absence of seeds (this reaction format is referred to as Mo+Ha). Surprisingly, we found that Mo+Ha mixtures displayed longer lag phase than that observed for individual conversion reactions of Mo or Ha rPrPs, a sign of mutual interference (Fig. 6A). As judged by the amounts of rPrP in PAGE carried out under nondenaturing versus denaturing conditions, the yield of nonseeded polymerization was very low in Mo+Ha reactions (Fig. 3A). Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of amyloid fibrils; however, the morphology of fibrils produced in the Mo+Ha mixtures was strikingly different from that observed in Mo or Ha reactions or in (Mo+Ha)Mo or (Mo+Ha)Ha reactions. Mo+Ha fibrils displayed dichotomous branching, an indication of a deficiency in lateral assembly of filaments into high order fibrils (supplemental Fig. S2). The double-staining fluore"

ZBP-89 shares with other members of the Sp-like family an overlapping sequence specificity for GC-rich sequences in the regulatory regions of multiple genes. Defining the mechanisms that govern the intrinsic function of ZBP-89 as well as its competitive and non-competitive functional interactions with other regulators is central to understand how ZBP-89 exerts its biological functions.

At promoters bearing multiple response elements, however, this modification inhibited the functional cooperation between ZBP-89 and Sp1. Analysis of the properties of ZBP-89 in cellular contexts devoid of competing factors indicated that although on its own it behaves as a modest activator it potently synergizes with heterologous activators such as the glucocorticoid receptor.

(also known as BERF-1, BFCOL1, or ZNF148) is a widely expressed Krüppel-type transcription factor that harbors an N-terminal cluster of four (three canonical C2H2 and a variant C2H2) zinc finger motifs. In vivo experiments indicate that ZBP-89 plays important roles in the generation and maintenance of specific cell lineages because haploinsufficiency causes infertility in mice due to apoptosis of germ cells (1Takeuchi A. Mishina Y. Miyaishi O. Kojima E. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas knockdown of ZBP-89 in zebrafish disrupts early steps in hematopoiesis (2Li X. Xiong J.-W. Shelley C.S. Park H. Arnaout M.A. Development. 2006; 133: 3641-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ZBP-89 also appears to play important roles in the gastrointestinal tract because mice exclusively expressing a splice variant lacking the first 127 residues display increased sensitivity to colitis (3Law D.J. Labut E.M. Adams R.D. Merchant J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas intestinal overexpression of ZBP-89 activates apoptosis and mitigates neoplasia burden in ApcMin/+ mice (4Law D.J. Labut E.M. Merchant J.L. Mamm. Genome. 2006; 17: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Functionally, ZBP-89 has been most often linked to transcriptional inhibition of genes such as those for gastrin, vimentin, or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (5Wieczorek E. Lin Z. Perkins E.B.

ZBP-89 shares with Sp1 and other Sp-like factors the ability to recognize GC-rich sequences in target genes. This overlapping DNA recognition has led to a competitive model of inhibition in which ZBP-89 represses gene transcription by displacing proteins such as Sp1 or Sp3 (8Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Cheng P.Y. Kagawa N. Takahashi Y. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4347-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, an analysis of the proximal ODC gene promoter revealed that Sp1 and ZBP-89 bind to GC elements in a mutually exclusive manner (6Law G.L. Itoh H. Law D.J. Mize G.J. Merchant J.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19955-19964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In other cases, ZBP-89 appears to inhibit by binding to DNA independently of Sp1 (12Zhang X. Diab I.H. Zehner Z.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2900-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in transcriptional inhibition, ZBP-89 has been implicated as a modest positive regulator of a set of genes including p21, lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (lck), and stromelysin (13Malo M.S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the case of the p21Waf1 promoter, recruitment of the coactivator p300 appears to contribute to activation of this gene (16Bai L. Merchant J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30725-30733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The overlap in DNA binding specificity with widely expressed Sp-like factors, however, makes the mechanistic analysis of ZBP-89 function particularly challenging. Broad dissection of ZBP-89 suggests that distinct regions are involved in negative and positive regulation with repressive and transactivating functions in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively (17Hasegawa T.

How these still poorly defined functions are selectively utilized in different contexts and how ZBP-89 engages in competitive and non-competitive functional interactions with other factors remain poorly understood.An emerging mechanism to regulate higher order interactions among transcription factors involves the function of synergy control (SC) motifs (19Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These short regulatory sequences, which we first identified in the glucocorticoid receptor (19Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), are present in multiple factors across a wide range of families. SC motifs are distinct from transcriptional activation functions and often map to negative regulatory regions. Functionally SC motifs limit the synergistic transcriptional output from complexes assembled at multiple response elements without altering the activity of a regulator from a single site (19Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. J. Biol.

Kikuchi A. Morohashi K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we and others have demonstrated that SC motifs operate in an autonomous manner by serving as sites for reversible post-translational modification by members of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins (20Subramanian L.

A. 2003; 100: 15758-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The mammalian SUMO family consists of four genes designated SUMO1–4. SUMO2 and -3 are closely related, whereas SUMO1 shares ∼48% identity to either SUMO2 or -3 (24Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 25Su H.L. Li S.S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A more recently identified gene encodes a fourth isoform very similar to SUMO2/3 (26Bohren K.M. Nadkarni V. Song J.H. Gabbay K.H. Owerbach D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27233-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). SUMO proteins are structurally related to ubiquitin, and the analogous SUMO modification pathway is carried out by a distinct, SUMO-specific set of enzymes. Following translation, processing by SUMO proteases removes C-terminal residues in SUMO to expose a conserved diglycine motif (27Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Notably SUMO4 harbors a Pro residue at position 90 that prevents initial processing by known SUMO protease enzymes and subsequent conjugation (28Owerbach D. McKay E.M. Yeh E.T.H. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Whether this member functions through non-covalent interactions only remains to be determined. After this initial cleavage, SUMO is then activated in an ATP-dependent manner by the heterodimeric E1-activating enzyme SAE1/SAE2. The thioester-linked SUMO is then transferred to the SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which in turn recognizes specific substrates and catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between SUMO and the target lysine. This step is facilitated by SUMO E3 ligases such as RanBP2 and members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family (29Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 30Chun T.H. Itoh H. Subramanian L. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Nakao K. Circ.

Finally, SUMO, conjugation is reversed through the isopeptide activity of SUMO-specific proteases (32Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Recent functional and structural analysis by our group (33Chupreta S. Holmstrom S. Subramanian L. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4272-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) indicates that once conjugated, individual SUMO isoforms mediate their distinct effects through a conserved surface that interacts with Val/Leu-rich motifs in target proteins (34Song J.

Although the role of SC motifs and sumoylation in the regulation of the synergistic effect of potent transcriptional regulators such as the glucocorticoid receptor is becoming better understood (23Holmstrom S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4272-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the impact of this regulatory mechanism on factors that are generally viewed as dominant-negative or “decoy” relatives of other factors remains largely unexplored.In the present study, we identified and characterized two synergy control motifs that flank the zinc finger cluster DNA binding domain of ZBP-89. We found that the conserved lysines (Lys-115 and Lys-356) within these SC motifs serve as the main sites for conjugation by members of the SUMO family. By taking advantage of cellular contexts that harbor or are devoid of Sp-like factors, we demonstrated that the SC motifs do not alter the ability of ZBP-89 to displace Sp-like factors. Rather we found that by recruiting SUMO to ZBP-89, the SC motifs potently limit the intrinsic ability of ZBP-89 to synergistically activate transcription from reiterated binding sites (homotypic synergy) and to cooperate with nearby bound heterologous factors (heterotypic synergy).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids—An N-terminal, hexahistidine-tagged, cytomegalovirus-driven human ZBP-89 expression plasmid was generated in two steps. Oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCGGCACCATGGAGCATCACCACCATCATCATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATGATGATGGTGGTGATGCTCCATGGTGCCG-3′, which contain a starting ATG codon within a consensus Kozak sequence followed by a hexahistidine tag, were annealed and ligated into the BamHI and NheI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) to yield pcDNA3.1(+) His. Human ZBP-89 cDNA was then PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GATGGATCCATGAACATTGACGACAAACTGGAAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CATCTCGAGTTAGCCAAACGTCTGGCCAGTTGTG-3′. The resulting fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the same sites of pcDNA3.1(+) His to yield pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89. Single and double point mutations that replaced Lys-115 and -356 with Arg were prepared using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis approach using pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89 as a template. N-terminal HA-tagged ZBP-89 expression plasmids were generated by ligating the 3092-bp BamHI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89 into the same sites of pcDNA3.1(+) HA (23Holmstrom S.

The expression vector for the noncleavable fusion of HA-SUMO1 at the N terminus of ZBP-89 K115R/K356R was generated through excision of the HA-SUMO portion from pcDNA3 HA-SUMO1(–Gly) Gal4 (23Holmstrom S.

Fusions to HA-SUMO2, HA-SUMO2 K33E/K42E, and HA-SUMO3 were generated the same way using the corresponding pcDNA3 HA-SUMO(–Gly) Gal4 vectors (23Holmstrom S. Van Antwerp M.E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Proc.

NheI/XbaI fragments containing His-tagged WT or mutant ZBP-89 were excised from the corresponding pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89 plasmids and ligated into the same sites of pA5C* to yield pA5C His-ZBP-89 and pA5C His-ZBP-89 K115R/K356R, respectively. Non-cleavable fusions of HA-SUMO isoforms at the N terminus of ZBP-89 K115R/K356R were generated by insertion of NheI/BamHI fragments exactly as described above for the mammalian vectors. The Drosophila vector for expression of rat GR (pA5C GR) was generated by transferring the GR coding region (as a BamHI fragment) from p6RGR into the BamHI site of pA5C. pPac Sp1 (40Courey A.J.

Reporter plasmids containing multiple ZBP-89 or GR binding sites were generated as follows. Ligation of independent BseRI/BglII and BamHI/BseRI fragments of pΔ(ODC)1-Luc yielded pΔ(ODC)2-Luc. The same operation applied to pΔ(ODC)2-Luc and pΔ(TAT)1-Luc yielded pΔ(ODC)4-Luc and pΔ(TAT)2-Luc. Ligation of BseRI/BglII and BamHI/BseRI fragments of pΔ(ODC)1-Luc and pΔ(ODC)2-Luc, respectively, yielded pΔ(ODC)3-Luc. The reporter plasmid bearing one ZBP-89 site upstream of a single glucocorticoid response element (pΔ(ODC)1(TAT)1-Luc) was generated by ligation of BseRI/BglII and BamHI/BseRI fragments from pΔ(ODC)1-Luc and pΔ(TAT)1-Luc, respectively. The same strategy using pΔ(ODC)2-Luc and pΔ(TAT)2-Luc yielded pΔ(ODC)2(TAT)2-Luc. The pODC-Luc reporter plasmid harbors the region from –400 to +79 of the human ornithine decarboxylase gene in the pGL2 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI).Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Human AGS gastric carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum at 25 °C. Except for data in Fig. 2B, all cell lines were transfected by using Lipofectamine™ and plus™ reagent (Invitrogen). For in vivo sumoylation experiments, 293T cells (2 × 106) were seeded onto 10-cm plates. After 24 h, cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of His-tagged ZBP-89 expression plasmids and 7 μg of HA-SUMO expression plasmids or empty vector as indicated in Fig. 3. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in 0.75 ml of urea lysis buffer (8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 45 mm Na2HPO4, 5mm NaH2PO4, 10mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and sonicated. Lysates were incubated with 0.1 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The resin was then washed three times with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer 1 (8 m urea, 0.4 m NaCl, 17.6 mm Na2HPO4, 32.4 mm NaH2PO4, 10mm imidazole, pH 6.75) and two times with wash buffer 2 (buffer 1 with 150 mm NaCl and no urea). Proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting as described below.FIGURE 3In vivo modification of ZBP-89 by different SUMO isoforms requires intact SC motifs. Human 293T cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with either control pcDNA3.1(+) vector (–), pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89 WT, or pcDNA3.1(+) His-ZBP-89 single (K115R and K356R) and double (K115R/K356R) mutants along with pcDNA3 HA-SUMO1, -2, or -3 as indicated.

After 5 min, N-ethylmaleimide was quenched by addition of dithiothreitol to 40 μm final concentration and a further 2-min incubation. 5% of the sample was reserved for further analysis, and the remaining cell extracts were incubated with monoclonal HA-11 antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in low salt lysis buffer (high salt lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl) and eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described below.For functional assays, AGS cells (2 × 104) were seeded (0.5 ml) onto 24-well plates. Cells were transfected 24 h later with the indicated amounts of ZBP-89 expression plasmids. To control for promoter dosage effects, cells treated with submaximal amounts of ZBP-89 expression vector also received the required amount of empty expression vector to maintain equimolar doses of expression plasmid. Cells also received 25 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid and 25 ng of pCMV β-gal. For Fig. 5D, cells also received 20 ng of p6RGR expression plasmid. In all cases, the total amount of DNA was supplemented to 0.3 μg/well with pBSKS(+). For experiments including GR, medium was supplemented 16 h post-transfection with 10 nm dexamethasone (Dex) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). Cells were lysed 36 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (39Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol.

All conditions contained equimolar amounts of each type of expression vector to control for promoter dosage effects. Cells also received 50 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid and 50 ng of pActin β-gal. For the GR experiments, transfections included 100 ng of pA5C GR, and cells were stimulated with 100 nm Dex for the last 24 h. The total amount of DNA was supplemented to 0.3 μg/well with pBSKS(+). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and processed as described above.FIGURE 5In mammalian cells, sumoylation of the SC motifs in ZBP-89 influences its inhibitory activity in a promoter-dependent manner. AGS cells were co-transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for HA-WT ZBP-89 (open circles), the K115R/K356R double mutant that disrupts both SC motifs (open diamonds), or an N-terminal fusion of SUMO1 to the double mutant ZBP-89 (shaded diamonds). Cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids driven by one (A) or three (B) ZBP-89 binding sites from the ODC gene or by the proximal ODC promoter (C).

This is the first study to compare aggrecan loss with aggrecan processing in mice with single and double deletions of ADAMTS-4 and -5 activity (Δcat). Cartilage explants harvested from single and double ADAMTS-4 and -5 Δcat mice were cultured with or without interleukin (IL)-1α or retinoic acid and analyzed for (i) the kinetics of 35S-labeled aggrecan loss, (ii) the pattern of 35S-labeled aggrecan fragments released into the media and retained in the matrix, (iii) the pattern of total aggrecan fragments released into the media and retained in the matrix, and (iv) specific cleavage sites within the interglobular and chondroitin sulfate-2 domains. The loss of radiolabeled aggrecan from ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage was less than that from ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, or wild-type cartilage under nonstimulated conditions. IL-1α and retinoic acid stimulated radiolabeled aggrecan loss from wild-type and ADAMTS-4 Δcat cartilage, but there was little effect on ADAMTS-5 cartilage. Proteolysis of aggrecan contributed most to its loss in wild-type, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5 Δcat cartilage explants. The pattern of proteolytic processing of aggrecan in these cultures was consistent with that occurring in cartilage pathologies. Retinoic acid, but not IL-1α, stimulated radiolabeled aggrecan loss from ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage explants. Even though there was a 300% increase in aggrecan loss from ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage stimulated with retinoic acid, the loss was not associated with aggrecanase cleavage but with the release of predominantly intact aggrecan consistent with the phenotype of the ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat mouse. Our results show that chondrocytes have additional mechanism for the turnover of aggrecan and that when proteolytic mechanisms are blocked by ablation of aggrecanase activity, nonproteolytic mechanisms compensate to maintain cartilage homeostasis.

In pathology, the increased loss of aggrecan from the matrix is associated with aggrecanase cleavage resulting in the loss of fragments lacking the G1 domain from the matrix (36Lohmander L.S. Neame P.J. Sandy J.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The use of wild type and ADAMTS-4-, -5-, and -4/-5-deficient mice together for the first time has allowed us to investigate the contribution of aggrecanase activity to aggrecan loss. This was done by determining the relationship between the kinetics of loss of newly synthesized 35S-labeled aggrecan from the matrix and the pattern and degree of proteolytic processing of radiolabeled and total aggrecan core protein in cartilage explant cultures maintained in the presence or absence of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) or retinoic acid. The radiolabeling techniques in conjunction with the use of anti-CS, anti-G3, and neoepitope antibodies have been used to overcome the limitations that arise from the low amounts of tissue available from mouse joints. This has also made it possible to obtain an overall picture of aggrecan degradation not restricted to the immunoanalysis of specific cleavage sites.

The tissue was then incubated with [35S]sulfate (200 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the same conditions for 6 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period the tissue was washed with DMEM to remove unincorporated radiolabeled sulfate and cultured (2–4 femoral heads/ml medium) in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml human recombinant IL-1α (Peprotech) or 1 μm retinoic acid (Sigma) for 6 days with a change of medium every two days. The spent medium was stored at –20 °C in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (38Oegema Jr., T.R. Hascall V.C. Eisenstein R. J. Biol.

Measurement of Loss of 35S-Labeled Aggrecan from Cartilage Explants—The rate of loss of 35S-labeled aggrecan from the matrix of explant cultures was calculated from the amount of radiolabeled macromolecules appearing in the medium and remaining in the matrix at the end of the culture period (3Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated twice using duplicate cultures. The variation in the rate of aggrecan loss from the two experiments for ADAMTS-4, -5, and -4/-5 Δcat mice was ≤5%. The wild-type control cultures were analyzed in parallel with ADAMTS-4-, -5-, and -4/-5-deficient cartilage, and the kinetic data show the outcome from three experiments. Wild-type cultures showed greater variation in the rate of aggrecan loss and represent the natural variation between individual animals on a mixed Ser-129/C57BL6 background. Analysis of Aggrecan Core Proteins—Aggrecan was isolated from pooled spent medium and guanidinium chloride tissue extracts by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (3Ilic M.Z.

The primary antibody was detected with mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Chemicon International) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Chemicon International). All Western blot membranes were probed first by aggrecanase-specific neoepitope antibodies. The membranes were then stripped using mild antibody stripping solution (Re-Blot Plus, Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer's instructions and reprobed with the antibody 2B6. Rate of Loss of 35S-Labeled Aggrecan from Cartilage Explant Cultures—The kinetics of loss of 35S-labeled aggrecan in cartilage explant cultures examined in the presence or absence of IL-1α or retinoic acid is shown in Fig. 1. Approximately 18% of radiolabeled aggrecan was lost from the matrix of ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage cultured with or without IL-1α after a 6-day culture period (Fig. 1A). In contrast, retinoic acid stimulated the loss of radiolabeled aggrecan to 56% from ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage (Fig. 1B). Compared with ADAMTS-4/-5-deficient cartilage, a higher rate of loss of radiolabeled aggrecan was observed in unstimulated wild-type cartilage (41%) and in wild-type cartilage stimulated with IL-1α (65%) and retinoic acid (77%) (Fig. 1, A and B) after a 6-day culture period. The loss of radiolabeled aggrecan from unstimulated ADAMTS-4 Δcat and ADAMTS-5 Δcat cartilage cultures was similar to that in the wild type (Fig. 1, C and D, open symbols). In ADAMTS-4 Δcat cartilage, the loss of radiolabeled aggrecan was increased to 75% with Il-1α and to 73% with retinoic acid (Fig. 1, C and D). IL-1α did not promote loss of radiolabeled aggrecan from ADAMTS-5 Δcat cartilage, but there was a small stimulation to 53% by retinoic acid (Fig. 1, C and D). These results reporting the loss of newly synthesized (radiolabeled) aggrecan agree with those reported previously for the loss of total aggrecan from ADAMTS-4/-5 Δcat cartilage (35Rogerson F.

Previous studies showed that protein kinase A (PKA) potentiates and phosphorylates the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PMCA) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner in parotid acinar cells (Bruce, J. I. E., Yule, D. I., and Shuttleworth, T. J. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 277, 48172–48181). The aim of this study was to further investigate the spatial regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> clearance in parotid acinar cells. Par-C10 cells were used to functionally isolate the apical and basolateral PMCA activity by applying La<sup>3+</sup> to the opposite side to inhibit the PMCA. Activation of PKA (using forskolin) differentially potentiated apical [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> clearance in mouse parotid acinar cells and apical PMCA activity in Par-C10 cells. Immunofluorescence of parotid tissue slices revealed that PMCA1 was distributed throughout the plasma membrane, PMCA2 was localized to the basolateral membrane, and PMCA4 was localized to the apical membrane of parotid acinar cells. However, <i>in situ</i> phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PMCA1 was the only isoform phosphorylated by PKA following stimulation. Similarly, immunofluorescence of acutely isolated parotid acinar cells showed that the regulatory subunit of PKA (RIIβ) translocated to the apical region following stimulation. These data suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PMCA1 differentially regulates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>i</sub></i> clearance in the apical region of parotid acinar cells because of a dynamic translocation of PKA. Such tight spatial regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux is likely important for the fine-tuning of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent effectors close to the apical membrane important for the regulation of fluid secretion and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2060935970,"Atp6p (subunit 6) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ATPase is synthesized with an N-terminal 10-amino acid presequence that is cleaved during assembly of the complex. This study has examined the role of the Atp6p presequence in the function and assembly of the ATPase complex. Two mutants were constructed in which the codons for amino acids 2-9 or 2-10 of the Atp6p precursor were deleted from the mitochondrial ATP6 gene. The concentration of Atp6p and ATPase complex was approximately 2 times less in the mutants. The lower concentration of ATPase complex in the leaderless mutants correlated with less Atp6p complexed with the Atp9p ring of the F0 sector and with accumulation of an Atp6p-Atp8p complex that aggregated into polymers destined for eventual proteolytic elimination. We propose that the presequence either targets Atp6p to the Atp9p or signals insertion of the Atp6p precursor into a microcompartment of the membrane for more efficient interaction with the Atp9p ring. Despite the ATPase deficiency, growth of the leaderless atp6 mutants on respiratory substrates and the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation were similar to that of wild type, indicating that the mutations did not affect the proton permeability of mitochondria."

In mammals, the cardiac calsequestrin gene (casq2) mainly expresses in cardiac muscle and to a minor extent in slow-twitch skeletal muscle and it is not expressed in non-muscle tissues. This work is the first study on the transcriptional regulation of the casq2 gene in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The sequence of the casq2 genes proximal promoter (180 bp) of mammals and avians is highly conserved and contains one TATA box, one CArG box, one E-box, and one myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) site. We cloned the human casq2 gene 5′-regulatory region into a luciferase reporter expression vector. By functional assays we showed that a construct containing the first 288 bp of promoter was up-regulated during myogenic differentiation of Sol8 cells and had higher transcriptional activity compared with longer constructs. In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, the larger construct containing 3.2 kb showed the highest transcriptional activity, demonstrating that the first 288 bp are sufficient to confer muscle specificity, whereas distal sequences may act as a cardiac-specific enhancer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies demonstrated that the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sequences were capable of binding MEF-2 and serum response factor, respectively, whereas the E-box did not show binding properties. Functional studies demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sites significantly decreased the transcription of the gene in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, indicating that they are important to drive cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription of the casq2 gene.

In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, the larger construct containing 3.2 kb showed the highest transcriptional activity, demonstrating that the first 288 bp are sufficient to confer muscle specificity, whereas distal sequences may act as a cardiac-specific enhancer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies demonstrated that the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sequences were capable of binding MEF-2 and serum response factor, respectively, whereas the E-box did not show binding properties. Functional studies demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis of the proximal MEF-2 and CArG box sites significantly decreased the transcription of the gene in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, indicating that they are important to drive cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription of the casq2 gene. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 2The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SRF, serum response factor; NFAT, nuclear factor-activated T cells; Luc, luciferase; CaM, calmodulin; MEF-2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcriptase; CASQ, calsequestrin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogense; HS, horse serum; CMV, cytomegalovirus. is an intracellular organelle present in striated muscle cells, which has a key role on the regulation of the calcium concentrations during muscle contraction and relaxation (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Ramesh V. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1528-1539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The SR is the main storage site of intracellular calcium, storing Ca2+ up to 20 mm while maintaining the free SR Ca2+ concentration at ∼ 1 mm (2MacLennan D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Beard N.A. Laver D.R. Dulhunty A.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 85: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The SR storage capacity enables the muscle cell to continuously contract without diminishing the Ca2+ available for each contraction-relaxation cycle. Calsequestrin (CASQ) is the most abundant protein in the lumen of the SR; it has a high capacity to bind Ca2+ (40–50 mol of Ca2+/mol of CASQ) with a moderate affinity (Kd ∼ 1 mm) and prevents the precipitation of Ca2+ inside the SR. It is a highly acidic protein with over 50 Ca2+ binding sites, which are formed by the clustering of two or more negatively charged residues. The molecular weight of the CASQ monomer is 40 kDa; and is capable of polymerizing in response to increasing Ca2+ concentrations (>1 mm) (3Beard N.A. Laver D.R. Dulhunty A.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 85: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). CASQ locates near the ryanodine receptor and attaches to it, via direct interaction or through anchoring by triadin and junctin. It has been suggested that CASQ has a regulatory role in SR Ca2+ release, by inhibiting the ryanodine receptor through interactions via triadin/junctin at high luminal Ca2+ concentrations (1–2 mm) (4Beard N.A. Sakowska M.M. Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 310-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism and physiological role of this inhibition has not been established. Thus, in recent years it has become clearer that CASQ has a role beyond its capability to buffer Ca2+. In mammals two CASQ isoforms have been described, each one encoded by a different gene. In humans, the casq1 gene is located in chromosome 1q21, and encodes for the CASQ1 isoform; and the casq2 gene, located in chromosome 1p23, which encodes for the CASQ2 isoform. The adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle expresses exclusively the casq1 gene, whereas slowtwitch skeletal muscle expresses mainly the casq1 gene (∼75% of total) and to a minor extent the casq2 gene (∼25% of total). Cardiac muscle expresses exclusively the casq2 gene. Neither of the CASQ isoforms are present in non-muscle tissues nor in smooth muscle (5Yang A. Sonin D. Jones L. Barry W.H. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1096-H1103Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both human isoforms share a high nucleotide and amino acid homology, 84 and 80%, respectively (5Yang A. Sonin D. Jones L. Barry W.H. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1096-H1103Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At this time there are no studies that point to differences in the physiological role of both CASQ isoforms, thus their roles shall be considered equivalent. The rabbit CASQ1 and the dog CASQ2 have been crystallized (6Park H. Park I.Y. Kim E. Youn B. Fields K. Dunker A.K. Kang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18026-18033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Wang S. Trumble W.R. Liao H. Wesson C.R. Dunker A.K. Kang C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); results of crystallization studies shown that the casq monomer was found to be constituted by three almost identical domains (I, II, and III) similar to that of Escherichia coli thioredoxin domain. It was found that CASQ polymerizes in response to rising concentrations of Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR, to form a homotetrameric complex (10 μm to 1 mm) and at higher concentrations of polymers, in concentrations higher than 10 mm the CASQ polymer dissociates from the Ca2+ releasing channel (8Park H. Wu S. Dunker A.K. Kang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16176-16182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the heart, the casq2 gene expresses during fetal development and continues to adult life. In fast-twitch skeletal muscle, CASQ2 is the predominant isoform during the fetal period, and during neonatal life. Afterward, there is a switch to CASQ1 gene expression, making the CASQ1 isoform the only one found in adult muscle. Although, in slow-twitch skeletal muscle there is also a switch on CASQ isoform expression during development, in the adult life the casq2 gene is still expressed (9Park K.W. Goo J.H. Chung H.S. Kim H. Kim D.H. Park W.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The CASQ2 mRNA levels have been measured in several heart pathological states such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure, showing no changes on its expression level (10Lehnart S.E. Schillinger W. Pieske B. Prestle J. Just H. Hasenfuss G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in transgenic mice that overexpress CASQ2, it was observed that the mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, with a typical fetal phenotype, associated with a higher Ca2+ storage capacity of the SR, as well as an impaired Ca2+ release, which leads to a diminished contractility (11Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another pathological state where CASQ2 is involved is the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), where several mutations in the casq2 gene are present, inserting stop codons in the first exon of the gene, thus nullifying the expression of the casq2 gene. These patients have a morphologically normal heart but are susceptible to develop ventricular arrhythmias when exercise or another stressing event are present (12Kontula K. Laitinen P.J. Lehtonen A.

Taken together, these findings are suggestive that the transcription of the casq2 gene is finely controlled during skeletal and cardiac muscle development, as well as in cardiac pathologies. Although the casq2 gene of rabbit and mouse have already been cloned (16Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Frank K.F.

Cardiol. 2001; 96: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), there are no studies regarding transcriptional regulation of the casq2 gene. The identification of cardiac-specific transcriptional regulatory elements and transcription factors controlling gene expression have been studied in vitro using the 5′-regulatory regions from contractile genes (α-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin I, ventricular myosin light chain 2), atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic peptide (18LaPointe M.C.

The studies have shown that GATA4, MEF-2, Nkx2.5, HAND1, HAND2, and serum response factor (SRF) are major regulatory factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of cardiac genes (23Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

However, the relative contribution of the transcription factors mentioned above varies in different gene promoters. This has made it difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac-specific gene expression. In this work, we report the first attempt to understand the molecular basis of tissue specificity of the casq2 gene. We cloned 3.2 kb of 5′-regulatory region of the human casq2 gene, generated deletion constructs and performed functional analyses. We performed targeted mutagenesis and DNA-protein binding analysis in cardiac myocytes and in the skeletal muscle cell line Sol8. We identified proximal and distal regulatory elements important for the expression of skeletal myotubes and neonatal cardiac myocytes. Our efforts were directed to a highly conserved region among species located in the first 180 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the casq2 gene, which contains one MEF-2, one E-box, and one CArG box putative binding sites. The results obtained in this work suggest that the proximal promoter is necessary and sufficient for cardiac and skeletal muscle expression, and that MEF-2 and SRF transcription factors participate for the tissue-specific expression of the casq2 gene. Materials—All restriction enzymes were acquired from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs. [γ-32P]ATP and[α-32P]dCTPwere acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Molecular Biology Unit from the Instituto de Fisiología Celular, UNAM, México. Human heart total RNA was acquired from BD Biosciences. DNA Cloning—A 3276-bp Stu1-Stu1 human genomic fragment from clone RP11-485H8 (BACPAC Resources), which contains 3102 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the human casq2 gene and 176 bp of the 5′-nontranslated sequence of exon 1, was subcloned into a pGL3-basic plasmid previously cut with Stu1, using standard techniques. Five more constructs were generated by digestion with restriction enzymes NcoI, AflII, PvuII, XhoI, and BlpI generating fragments of 2322, 1169, 754, 462, and 254 bp, respectively. Primer Extension Analysis—A synthetic DNA oligonucleotide (300 ng) complementary to the coding sequence of exon 1 (5′-GGAAAGACTTACCACTCGGTC-3′) was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Reverse transcription was performed using poly(A)+ RNA from human adult heart (BD Biosciences). A sequencing reaction of a known template was used as a ladder for determining the molecular size of the extended DNA fragments. Cell Culture—Sol8 myoblasts (obtained from ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), designated as growth media, until they reached a 70% confluence then, were induced to differentiate to myotubes by switching the media to DMEM supplemented with 3% horse serum (HS) (Invitrogen), designated as differentiation media. The C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in growth media. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were maintained with growth media. All the media were supplemented with kanamycin (60 mg/liter), penicillin G (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml), amphotericin B (0.025 mg/ml), and nystatin (10 units/ml). Transfection and Reporter Assays—The pGL3-hcasq2 constructs (0.8 μg) and the pRL-CMV (0.05 μg) were co-transfected into cells grown in 12-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 2 h the transfection mixture was replaced by DMEM with 3% HS to induce differentiation of Sol8 cells to myotubes; or by DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum to maintain the myoblast phenotype, as well for C3H10T1/2 and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The positive control in all experiments was the pGL3-promoter, which contains the proximal 202 bp of the SV40 promoter. Following 48 h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase, using the dual luciferase assay reagent kit (Promega) in a multiwell plate counter Wallac Victor2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The results were normalized with the Renilla luciferase activity. Stably transfected Sol8 cell lines were generated by co-transfecting the pGL3-hcasq2 constructs containing 288 and 3102 bp of the 5′-regulatory region of the human casq2 gene with pCDNA3.1, containing the resistance gene to the selecting antibiotic G418. The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml G418, and selected after 1 week of growth. Afterward, colonies selected were tested for luciferase activity. The number of copies of the hcasq2/Luc fragment integrated into genomic DNA was verified by dot-blot analysis using a DNA probe for luciferase. The colonies selected were grown on 24-well plates until they reached 70% confluence; at that time the cells were induced to differentiate by replacing the media with differentiation media. Cells were lysed on a time course from myoblasts to 5-day myotubes; cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. The results were normalized dividing the luciferase activity by the protein concentration. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes daily up to day 5 of muscle differentiation, with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, cDNA was diluted 15 times, and 9.2μl/reaction were used for qPCR with SYBR Green ER qPCR Supermix for iCycler (Invitrogen). Resultswereanalyzed according to the method suggested by Pfaffl (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25857) Google Scholar), using GAPDH as loading control.

Mutation of the above elements was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmids obtained. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Studies—Nuclear extracts from Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes, and from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared as previously described (21Molkentin J.D. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1211-1225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The sequence of the double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were the same ones that were used for site-directed mutagenesis; consensus oligonucleotides for MEF-2 and CArG box used as specific competitors were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (see Table 1). Binding reactions were performed by preincubating at room temperature in 1 × Binding Buffer (Tris-HCl, 50 mm; glycerol, 20%; NaCl, 250 mm; MgCl2, 5 mm; EDTA, 2.5 mm; dithiothreitol, 1 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm), 10 μg of nuclear extract, and 1 mg of poly(dI-dC), 100-fold molar excess unlabeled competitor when needed, and γ-32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. Supershift antibodies for MEF-2 (sc-313x) and SRF (sc-335x) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was performed with MacVector 6.5.3 (Accelrys), BLAST (NCBI), and MathInspector (Genomatix). Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means of at least 3 independent experiments ± S.E. Mean values were compared by analysis of variance (SPSS 11) applying the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Characterization of the Human casq2 Gene 5′-Regulatory Region—The human genomic clones (RP11-485H8 and RP5-929G5) were analyzed in silico with DNA analysis software (NCBI Blast, Genomatix suite and MacVector) to determine the complete human casq2 gene structure and its 5′-regulatory region. The analyses revealed that both clones overlap and contain the complete casq2 gene, integrated with 11 exons and interrupted by 10 introns that span over 68 kb of the genome (Fig. 1A). To determine the transcription initiation site of the human casq2 gene, primer extension analysis of human CASQ2 mRNA was performed using human heart poly(A)+ RNA. Two main extension products (358 and 348 bp) were obtained, mapping two transcription initiation sites at positions 241 and 251 bp upstream from the ATG translation initiation codon (Fig. 1B). The 5′-regulatory region was analyzed with the MacVector program and Genomatix suite, to identify possible binding sites for transcription factors. In this analysis we identified a highly conserved DNA homology region among several species including the chimp (100%), mouse (95%), rat (98%), dog (98%), cow (93%), and chicken (87%), located between –30 to –140 bp that contains one imperfect TATA box, one MEF-2 site, one E-box, and one CArG box (Fig. 2). Transcriptional Activity of the hcasq2 Gene 5′-Regulatory Region in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle Cells—Six deletion constructs in pGL3-basic containing 3102, 2148, 1095, 580, 288, and 71 bp of the human casq2 gene 5′-regulatory region and 176 bp of 5′-nontranslated sequence of exon 1 were generated and used for transfection experiments, to identify the basal promoter region and upstream 5′-regulatory sequences of the human casq2 gene in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and Sol8 skeletal muscle cells. The transcriptional activity of the different constructs was determined by transiently transfecting them into neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the skeletal muscle cell line Sol8, and C3H10T1/2 cells. The results obtained by transient transfection in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes showed that the –288-bp construct had a transcriptional activity similar to the one observed with the pGL3-promoter construct (202 bp of the SV40 proximal promoter), which has been described as a strong promoter in muscle. The transcriptional activity observed with the –288-bp construct was 2-fold higher of that observed with the –71-bp construct, which contains only a TATA box, but no other regulatory elements. The –580 and –1095-bp constructs exhibited ∼2-fold higher activity compared with the –288-bp construct, the –2148 bp was 3.5-fold higher and the –3102-bp construct had the highest activity, increasing over 3.7-fold relative to the –288-bp construct (Fig. 3A). The promoter-less pGL3-basic plasmid showed only background firefly luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). In 2-day Sol8 myotubes, the highest transcriptional activity was observed with the –288-bp construct, showed 12-fold more activity than the –71-bp construct, and was similar to that observed with the SV40 promoter construct. The –3102-bp construct had 65% less activity compared with the –288-bp construct. The other intermediate length constructs showed similar activity than the –3102-bp construct. The –71-bp construct activity in myotubes was almost equal to the activity observed on undifferentiated myoblasts with all of the constructs, reflecting basal promoter activity. The pGL3-basic construct had only background activity. (Fig. 3B). In C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, all the casq2 gene constructs showed only basal transcriptional activity, similar to the activity of the promoter less construct, whereas the SV40 promoter showed strong transcriptional activity (Fig. 3C). To analyze the transcriptional activity of the casq2 gene regulatory region constructs during the course of myogenic differentiation, we generated stable transfectant Sol8 cell lines, which integrated into two cell genome of the chimeric casq2/Luc constructs, of which, one contains –288 bp and the other contains –3.1 kb of the 5′-regulatory region. The resulting stable transfectant cell lines were induced to differentiate by serum withdrawal, and the luciferase activity was determined daily during 5 days of myogenic differentiation. The results indicated that both constructs have a very similar pattern of activation, showing increases in the activity level since day 1 of differentiation (Fig. 4A). The pattern of activation of the casq2 gene constructs was very similar to the pattern of increase of the endogenous level of casq2 mRNA expression determined by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). The myogenin, MEF2C, and SRF mRNA levels were also quantified by real time RT-PCR. Myogenin mRNA increased since day 1, whereas MEF2C and SRF mRNA increased after 3 days of myogenic differentiation (Fig. 4C). The Proximal MEF-2 and CArG Box Sites Are Functional in Cardiac Myocytes—Due to the results obtained by transcriptional activation of the chimeric casq2 gene constructs, which suggest an important role played by the first 288 bp of the 5′-regulatory region in cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, we determined the DNA-protein binding capabilities of the putative binding sites (MEF-2, E-box, and CArG box) present in this region. Because MEF-2, basic helix-loop-helix, and SRF transcription factors are present in Sol8 myotubes and have been demonstrated to participate in the regulation of several muscle genes, we decided to perform electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies using synthetic double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides and specific antibodies for MEF2 and SRF for supershift assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results showed that the proximal casq2 gene MEF-2 site was capable of specifically binding a protein present in nuclear extracts of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, which was of the same size to the one observed with a previously tested MEF-2 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 5A). The complex was not competed by the addition of 50–100-fold molar excess of the mutated casq2 MEF-2 oligonucleotide or the mutated consensus MEF-2 oligonucleotide. The protein contained in the complex was supershifted using a MEF-2 antibody (Fig. 5A). Nuclear extracts of Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes were also tested; both were capable of binding specifically the casq2 gene MEF-2 oligonucleotide, the signal obtained with myoblasts had a lesser intensity than the one observed with myotubes (Fig. 5B). The complex formed was of similar apparent size to the one observed in cardiac cells. The complex observed with Sol8 nuclear extracts was also supershifted in the presence of the MEF-2 antibody (Fig. 5B). The proximal casq2 gene CArG box was also assayed to test its capabilities of binding the transcription factors present in nuclear extracts of cardiomyocytes as well as Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes. The CArG box oligonucleotide formed a complex when incubated with cardiomyocytes nuclear extracts (Fig. 5C). This complex was specifically competed with the addition of the wild type CArG box casq2 (50–100-fold molar excess) unlabeled probe, or a previously tested consensus CArG box oligonucleotide, whereas it did not change by the addition of the mutated casq2 gene CArG box oligonucleotide. The protein present in this complex was identified by supershift assay, using a SRF-specific antibody (Fig. 5C). We also assayed the binding capabilities with Sol8 myoblasts and myotube nuclear extracts. The results showed a complex of similar apparent size to the one observed in cardiomyocytes; it also was a specific complex and was supershifted with a SRF antibody. The complex produced by myoblast nuclear extracts was of lesser intensity than the one observed with myotubes (Fig. 5D). The proximal casq2 E-box site was also assayed to determine its binding properties. When incubated with cardiomyocytes or Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes nuclear extracts, no DNA-protein complex was observed. The same nuclear extracts were assayed with a consensus E-box sequence (5′-CANNTG-3′) and a specific complex was observed (data not shown). Functional Properties of the MEF-2 and CArG Box Sites—To further understand the role of the MEF-2, E-box, and CArG box sites in the regulation of the human casq2 gene, we performed site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures” of the sites p"
https://openalex.org/W2001178553,"DNA cleavage is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. In humans, apoptotic DNA cleavage is executed by DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) 40. In proliferating cells DFF40 is expressed in the presence of its chaperone and inhibitor DFF45, which results in the formation of the DFF complex. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the nuclear import of the DFF complex. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the importin α/β-heterodimer mediates the translocation of the DFF complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Both DFF subunits interact directly with the importin α/β-heterodimer. However, importin α/β binds more tightly to the DFF complex compared with the individual subunits. Additionally, the isolated C-terminal regions of both DFF subunits together bind importin α/β more strongly than the individual C termini. Our results from in vivo studies reveal that the C-terminal regions of both DFF subunits harbor nuclear localization signals. Furthermore, nuclear import of the DFF complex requires the C-terminal regions of both subunits. In more detail, one basic cluster in the C-terminal region of each subunit, DFF40 (RLKRK) and DFF45 (KRAR), is essential for nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex. Based on these findings two alternative models for the interaction of importin α/β with the DFF complex are presented. DNA cleavage is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. In humans, apoptotic DNA cleavage is executed by DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) 40. In proliferating cells DFF40 is expressed in the presence of its chaperone and inhibitor DFF45, which results in the formation of the DFF complex. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the nuclear import of the DFF complex. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that the importin α/β-heterodimer mediates the translocation of the DFF complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Both DFF subunits interact directly with the importin α/β-heterodimer. However, importin α/β binds more tightly to the DFF complex compared with the individual subunits. Additionally, the isolated C-terminal regions of both DFF subunits together bind importin α/β more strongly than the individual C termini. Our results from in vivo studies reveal that the C-terminal regions of both DFF subunits harbor nuclear localization signals. Furthermore, nuclear import of the DFF complex requires the C-terminal regions of both subunits. In more detail, one basic cluster in the C-terminal region of each subunit, DFF40 (RLKRK) and DFF45 (KRAR), is essential for nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex. Based on these findings two alternative models for the interaction of importin α/β with the DFF complex are presented. Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays an important role in development and tissue homeostasis (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Apoptotic signaling is ultimately transduced by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases, which are the central executioners of apoptosis (2Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). One of the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis is nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (3Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar) mainly caused by the DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40, 2The abbreviations used are: DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; CAD, caspase-activated DNase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; IBB, importin β-binding domain; HEAT, huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, TOR1; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; cNLS, classic NLS; ncNLS, non-classic. also known as caspase-activated DNase, CAD) (reviewed in Ref. 4Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells DFF40 is expressed in the presence of DFF45 (inhibitor of CAD), which has a dual role as chaperone and as inhibitor of DFF40 (5Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K.

During apoptosis active DFF40 is released from the DFF complex due to cleavage of DFF45 executed by caspase-3 and caspase-7 (7Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S.

A structural feature of both DFF40 and DFF45 is the N-terminal cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector domain that mediates the interaction between DFF40 and DFF45 (9Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S.

Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40216-40225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The tetrameric DFF complex is located in the nucleus (13Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and sequence analysis revealed two putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs). According to this prediction, the C-terminal portion of murine DFF40 contains a monopartite NLS, and the C-terminal sequences of murine and human DFF45 exhibit a bipartite NLS (5Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar, 14Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although previous studies showed that both C-terminal regions are involved in nuclear translocation of the DFF complex (13Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the nuclear transport mechanism has not been characterized so far. The nuclear transport of proteins harboring a NLS in their amino acid sequence is mediated by soluble nuclear import receptors also known as importins or karyopherins. NLSs can be generally categorized in classic (cNLS) and non-classic (ncNLS) signals. Although ncNLSs are directly recognized by members of the importin β-family receptors, binding of importin β to cNLS requires an importin α adapter protein (15Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Strom, A. C., and Weis, K. (2001) Genome Biol. 2001, 2(6): reviews 3008.1-3008.9Google Scholar). In humans there are six importin α variants, which can be assigned to three subclasses: NPI-1, Rch1, and Qip1 (17Kohler M. Ansieau S. Prehn S. Leutz A. Haller H. Hartmann E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All importin α subtypes share a large NLS binding domain and a flexible N-terminal importin β-binding (IBB) domain (19Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The NLS binding domain comprises ten tandem armadillo repeats (21Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) that form an array of binding pockets (22Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 23Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

Armadillo repeats 2–4 create a larger N-terminal major binding site, whereas armadillo repeats 7 and 8 form a smaller C-terminal minor binding site. cNLSs are generally characterized as short stretches enriched in positively charged amino acids (25Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) and can be classified as monopartite and bipartite cNLSs. Monopartite cNLSs contain one cluster of basic amino acids, as in the case of the SV40 large T antigen (26Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), whereas bipartite cNLSs like that of nucleoplasmin are composed of two basic regions connected by a 10- to 12-amino acid spacer (27Dingwall C. Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Roberts B. Richardson W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Monopartite cNLSs and the larger downstream basic cluster of bipartite cNLSs bind to the major binding site of importin α, whereas the smaller upstream basic cluster of bipartite cNLSs binds to the minor binding site (reviewed in Refs. 29Madrid A.S. Weis K. Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 30Conti E. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2002; 35: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Importin β is a superhelical molecule composed of 19 HEAT repeats (31Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). HEAT repeats 7–19 (cargo binding site I) associate with the IBB domain of importin α (32Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas HEAT repeats 2–11 comprise a second cargo binding site (33Cingolani G. Bednenko J. Gillespie M.T. Gerace L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation of cargo-import receptor complexes relies on the asymmetric distribution of RanGTP with a high concentration in the nucleus and a very low concentration in the cytoplasm (34Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 35Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65 (table of contents): 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). This RanGTP gradient across the nuclear membrane is maintained by the chromatin-bound exchange factor RanGEF (RCC1) and the GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP), which is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Importins bind their cargoes in the absence of RanGTP in the cytoplasm, whereas dissociation of the cargo-receptor complex occurs upon RanGTP binding in the nucleus (36Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 37Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism underlying the nuclear transport of the DFF complex. Our results show that the DFF complex is imported into the nucleus via the classic importin α/β-pathway. We determined that at least one basic stretch in the C-terminal region of each subunit, DFF40 (RLKRK) and DFF45 (KRAR), is required for nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex. Moreover, the basic patch KRAR in the C-terminal region of DFF45 was also identified as key element for nuclear transport of monomeric DFF45. Additional experiments strongly suggest that DFF45 exhibits a classic monopartite cNLS recognized by importin α/β. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ no. ACC57) and were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom). HeLa P4 cells (38Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Amersham Biosciences). Both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) and antibiotics. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfection into HeLa P4 cells was performed with the Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.3 μg of plasmid DNA for each construct. The cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. The nuclei were visualized with Hoechst33258 (Molecular Probes). Expression Constructs—The coding regions of the respective genes were amplified from plasmid DNA using specific primer pairs with appropriate restriction sites (for details see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Nucleotide exchanges in DFF40mutA, DFF40mutB, and DFF45mutB were inserted using the antisense amplification primers: 5′-AATAGTCGACTCACTGGCGTTTCCGCACAGGCTGCGCTGCAGCCAAAGCTGTCTGGGGTT-3′ for DFF40mutA, 5′-AATAGTCGACTCACTGGGCTGCCGCCACAGGCTGCTTCCG-3′ for DFF40mutB, and 5′-AATAGTCGACCTATGTGGGATCCTGTGCGGCTGCCGCAGGATTCTGCAGG-3′ for DFF45mutB. To generate DFF45mutA and importin αE388R, site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AGCTTGCATTCTCTCGCGAGCATCTCAGCAAGCGCGGCCTCACCACCTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGAACGTAAGAGAGCGCTCGTAGAGTCGTTCGCGCCGGAGTGGTGGACC-3′ (antisense) for DFF45mutA and 5′-TTCAAGGCCCAGAAACGAGCAGTTTGGGCTGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGTTCCGGGTCTTTGCTCGTCAAACCCGACAT-3′ (antisense) for importin αE388R. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Epitope-tagged DFF complexes were generated as follows: DFF40 and DFF45 were coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.9 at 600 nm. After shifting the temperature to 18 °C bacterial protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown for 18 h. The collected bacteria were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, and the recombinant DFF40·DFF45 complexes were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). In the case of the GST-DFF40·His-DFF45 complexes a second purification step on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) followed. The following proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as indicated and subsequently purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions: GST-DFF45, GST-DFF45-(296–331), and GST-DFF40-(314–338) at 30 °C for 2 h with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GST-nucleoplasmin at 25 °C for 3 h; GST-SV40-(94–135) at 30 °C for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. c-Jun and c-Fos complexes were generated by coexpression of the respective subunits in E. coli for 3 h at 25 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The collected bacteria were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, and the recombinant complexes were tandem-purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and glutathione-Sepharose 4B. His-tagged caspase-3 was expressed as described in Goebel et al. (39Goebel W. Obermeyer N. Bleicher N. Kratzmeier M. Eibl H.J. Doenecke D. Albig W. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and affinity purification was performed on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following import factors were expressed in E. coli JM109 as described: Xenopus importin α1 (40Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), transportin (37Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), Xenopus importin 7 and human importin 5 (42Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), human importin 9 (43Muhlhausser P. Muller E.C. Otto A. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and human importin 13 (44Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Importin α and importin β used in GST pulldown assays were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by chromatography on Superdex 200. Recombinant human importin α and importin β used in nuclear import assays in vitro were purchased from Calbiochem. Expression and purification of the following proteins was performed as described: NTF2 (41Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). DNA Cleavage Assay—Increasing amounts of recombinant, purified epitope-tagged DFF40·DFF45 complexes were incubated with recombinant purified His-caspase-3, 1 μg of circular plasmid DNA, 5 μm MgCl2, and 4.4 μm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were stopped on ice, and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the DNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. GST Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were used as affinity matrix for binding experiments. Appropriate amounts of affinity matrix were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with either bacterial lysates containing expressed import receptors or the corresponding purified recombinant import factor in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The binding experiments were performed in the absence or presence of 2 μm RanGTP. After washing three times with ice-cold buffer D, the affinity matrix was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the matrix-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Import receptor-binding intensities were quantified using the program 1Dscan EX (Scanalytics). The amount of bound import receptor was normalized over the amount of immobilized protein. The amount of import receptor bound to DFF complexes was normalized to the amount of either DFF40 or DFF45 depending on the individual DFF subunit to which it was compared. In Vitro Nuclear Import Assays—Import reactions were performed as described previously (42Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) based on the method established by Adam et al. (46Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Briefly, digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min with 20 μl of a transport reaction mix consisting of 0.35 μm substrate, either 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) or 0.5 μm recombinant import receptor and an energy-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase) in buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose). For performing reconstitution experiments with recombinant transport factors, a Ran mix (3 μm Ran(GDP), 0.5 μm NTF2) was added to the transport reaction mix. For negative controls the assay was done in the absence of any transport factors, i.e. without reticulocyte lysate and without recombinant transport factors. Import reactions under inhibitory conditions were carried out either after pretreating the cells with 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin in buffer E or by replacing the energy-regenerating system with apyrase (100 units/ml). HeLa cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and were mounted by using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Import reactions were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop 20). The Nuclear Import of the DFF Complex Is Energy-dependent and Requires Access to Nuclear Pore Proteins—To characterize the nuclear import of the DFF complex in vitro, we generated a recombinant fluorescently labeled DFF complex by fusing EGFP to the N terminus of DFF40. For purification of the DFF complex DFF45 was N-terminally His-tagged. Because DFF45 is necessary for correct folding and activity of DFF40, both subunits were coexpressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. A plasmid DNA cleavage assay was performed to examine whether the N-terminal tags of DFF40 and DFF45 interfere with proper folding and complex formation. The plasmid DNA was efficiently cleaved upon incubation with EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 and purified caspase-3 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–7). This demonstrates that the EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 complex can be activated by caspase-3 leading to the release of nucleolytically active EGFP-DFF40. In contrast, the plasmid DNA was not cleaved in the presence of caspase-3 or fluorescently labeled DFF complex alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 8). For technical reasons, we had to clone His-tagged DFF45 lacking the amino acid residues 1–7. The DNA cleavage assay showed that the deletion of amino acids 1–7 in DFF45 did not interfere with its function as chaperone and inhibitor of DFF40. The nuclear uptake of the EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 complex was examined using in vitro nuclear import assays (46Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). For that purpose, HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips, and the plasma membranes were selectively permeabilized with digitonin. EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 was only imported into nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a source of import receptors and an energy-regenerating system (Fig. 1B). The lack of reticulocyte lysate (buffer) and the addition of wheat germ agglutinin or apyrase to the transport system strongly inhibited nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex. Wheat germ agglutinin binds to glycosylated residues of nucleoporins, thereby inhibiting receptor-mediated transport processes through the nuclear pore complexes while passive diffusion remains unaffected (47Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hence, nuclear import of the DFF complex requires access to nucleoporins. In addition, the loss of nuclear uptake under conditions where the energy-regenerating system was replaced by apyrase underlines the energy dependence of the nuclear transport and excludes passive diffusion. These results demonstrate that the DFF complex, as the majority of nuclear proteins, traverses the nuclear membrane in a receptor-mediated fashion. The Importin α/β-Heterodimer Is Responsible for Nuclear Transport of the DFF Complex—To identify potential nuclear transport receptors that mediate nuclear import of the DFF complex, in vitro binding studies were performed. GST-tagged DFF40 and His-tagged DFF45 were coexpressed in E. coli and tandem affinity-purified. The proper folding of the subunits and complex formation was again analyzed in a plasmid DNA cleavage assay. Upon activation of the purified GST-DFF40·His-DFF45 complex by caspase-3, GST-DFF40 was able to cleave plasmid DNA (supplemental Fig. S1A). This demonstrated that the GST-DFF40·His-DFF45 complex is functional. GST-DFF40·His-DFF45 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with importin α, importin α/β-heterodimer, importin β, transportin, importin 5, importin 7, and importin 13, all from bacterial lysates (Fig. 2A). After washing, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Only the importin α/β-heterodimer was efficiently bound to the DFF complex (Fig. 2A). The binding of importin β and transportin was very weak, and none of the other import receptors was bound. In the nucleus direct binding of RanGTP to β-family import receptors disintegrates the receptor-substrate interaction. The binding of importin α/β to the DFF complex was abolished in the presence of RanGTP, demonstrating its specificity (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the importin α/β-heterodimer is a functional import receptor for the DFF complex, we reconstituted nuclear import in vitro by using purified recombinant importin α and importin β (Fig. 2C). The EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 complex was carried into the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of importin α/β, although the nuclear uptake was not as efficient as with reticulocyte lysate. Because the DFF complex can be recognized by different importin α variants (supplemental Fig. S2), the better nuclear uptake in the presence of reticulocyte lysate may be explained by the broader range of suitable importin α molecules. In addition, weak nuclear import of EGFP-DFF40·His-DFF45 was also observed when just importin α was added (Fig. 2C). That is probably due to formation of an α/β-heterodimer with not completely washed out endogenous importin β. According to the results of the in vitro binding studies, import receptors that did not bind to the immobilized DFF complex were also not able to translocate the fluorescently labeled DFF complex into the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). Basic Amino Acids in Both Subunits Are Essential for Nuclear Import of the DFF Complex—For the initial characterization of sequence elements necessary for nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex the subcellular localization of coexpressed, fluorescently tagged DFF subunits was examined in HeLa P4 cells (Fig. 3). Because EGFP- or RFP-tagged DFF40 and DFF45 tend to diffuse into the nucleus, one subunit was expressed as an EGFP-GST fusion to further increase the size of the protein. In doing so, passive diffusion of the DFF complex was excluded. Fusion of tags to the DFF subunits did not interfere with DFF complex formation as analyzed by coprecipitation of the subunits from transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Firstly, C-terminal deletions of both DFF subunits were coexpressed with the corresponding wild-type subunit to test whether the two C termini contribute to nuclear targeting of the DFF complex (Fig. 3B) as previously shown by Lechardeur et al. (14Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to the nuclear accumulation of cotransfected wild-type EGFP-GST-DFF40·RFP-DFF45 (Fig. 3B, top panel), deletion of either amino acids 324–338 of DFF40 or amino acids 306–331 of DFF45 led to a dominant cytoplasmic colocalization of both subunits (Fig. 3B, middle and bottom panels). However, red fluorescent staining of uncomplexed RFP-tagged DFF45 was also visible in the nucleus. This is probably caused by nuclear uptake of full-length RFP-DFF45 (see below, Fig. 4) and passive diffusion of C-terminally truncated RFP-DFF45. C-terminal truncations of the two DFF subunits had similar effects on the nuclear transport of the DFF complex when the fluorescence tags were exchanged among the DFF subunits (supplemental Fig. S3). This clearly confirmed the importance of both C termini for nuclear accumulation of the DFF complex. To further delimit the amino acid sequences responsible for importin α/β-mediated nuclear import of the DFF complex, we generated mutants substituting basic amino acids in the C-terminal regions of DFF40 and DFF45 (Fig. 3A). The EGFP-GST-tagged mutant subunit was coexpressed with the corresponding RFP-tagged wild-type subunit. The results of these in vivo transfection studies are summarized in Fig. 3 (C and D). Nuclear accumulation of the DFF40·DFF45 complex was blocked when either the basic cluster RLKRK in DFF40 (DFF40mutA, Fig. 3C, top panel) or the basic cluster KRAR in DFF45 (DFF45mutB, Fig. 3D, bottom panel) was mutated. In contrast, mutation of the basic cluster RKR of DFF40 (DFF40mutB, Fig. 3C, bottom panel) or substitution of the two positively charged amino acids at positions 307 and 313 of DFF45 (DFF45mutA, Fig. 3D, top panel) had no effect on the nuclear localization. Similar results were obtained"
https://openalex.org/W2005093450,"The human T-cell leukemia virus transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) is a typical class 1 membrane fusion protein and a subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein complex. Following activation, the TM undergoes conformational transitions from a native nonfusogenic state to a fusion-active pre-hairpin intermediate that subsequently resolves to a compact trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle. Disruption of these structural transitions inhibits membrane fusion and viral entry and validates TM as an anti-viral and vaccine target. To investigate the immunological properties of fusion-active TM, we have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize the coiled-coil domain of the pre-hairpin intermediate. Antibody reactivity is highly sensitive to the conformation of the coiled coil as binding is dramatically reduced or lost on denatured antigen. Moreover, a unique group of antibodies are 100-1000-fold more reactive with the coiled coil than the trimer-of-hairpins form of TM. The antibodies recognize virally expressed envelope, and significantly, some selectively bind to envelope only under conditions that promote membrane fusion. Most importantly, many of the antibodies potently block six-helix bundle formation in vitro. Nevertheless, viral envelope was remarkably resistant to neutralization by antibodies directed to the coiled coil. The data imply that the coiled coil of viral envelope is poorly exposed to antibody during membrane fusion. We suggest that resistance to neutralization by antibodies directed to fusion-associated structures is a common property of retroviral TM and perhaps of other viral class I fusion proteins.

These observations have significant implications for vaccine design. Enveloped viruses gain entry into cells by fusion of the viral and cell membranes. For many viruses membrane fusion is carried out by viral class I fusion proteins (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In response to an activation trigger, the fusion protein inserts an N-terminal hydrophobic peptide into the target cell membrane, which results in the formation of a rod-like fusion-active pre-hairpin intermediate (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 2Sodroski J.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The pre-hairpin intermediate is stabilized by a triple-stranded coiled-coil that is assembled from the N-terminal α-helices (N-helices) of adjacent fusion protein monomers. Subsequently, a C-terminal α-helical (C-helix) segment of each monomer docks into grooves on the surface of the coiled coil to yield a six-helix bundle or trimer-of-hairpins structure. Resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins brings the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity, destabilizes the lipid bilayers, and ultimately promotes membrane fusion (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S.

The fusogenic properties of TM are activated following binding of SU to the relevant cellular receptor. For human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the structure of the TM-derived trimer-of-hairpins has been particularly well resolved (7Kobe B. Center R.J. Kemp B.E. Poumbourios P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For each monomer of TM, an N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide is connected via a glycine-rich linker to an α-helical motif that interacts with the equivalent helix of adjacent TM monomers to form a central triple-stranded coiled coil. At the base of the core coiled-coil, the peptide backbone folds back in a disulfide-bonded 180° loop referred to as the chain reversal region. The C-terminal segment, which includes a short α-helix, runs in an anti-parallel manner along the grooves formed on the surface of the core coiled-coil. surface glycoprotein transmembrane glycoprotein maltose-binding protein monoclonal antibody of human immunodeficiency virus HIV type 1 human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline fetal bovine serum enhanced green fluorescent protein tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate fluorescein isothiocyanate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Importantly, synthetic peptides that mimic the C-terminal α-helix of the trimer-of-hairpins motif of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (2Sodroski J.G.

The ability of C-helix-based mimetic peptides to inhibit viral infection of cells has prompted speculation that antibodies targeting the coiled-coil motif of fusion-active envelope may also display inhibitory activity. Furthermore, immunogens that elicit neutralizing antibodies targeting the coiled coil are likely to be of value as antiviral vaccine candidates. Despite the use of a variety of immunogens, and immunization strategies, potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the fusion-active coiled-coil or six-helix bundle structures of HIV envelope have remained elusive (16Jiang S.

These observations suggest that neutralizing antibodies to pre-hairpin structures can be obtained and that resistance to neutralization by such antibodies may be an attribute that is peculiar to HIV-1. The conserved nature of the viral fusion process implies that immunization strategies that elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the coiled coil of viral fusion proteins will be of general utility to diverse viral pathogens. Given the potential importance of the pre-hairpin intermediate to vaccine design, we sought to generate antibodies with reactivity to a recombinant trimeric form of the HTLV-1 coiled coil and to determine the specificity and neutralizing properties of such antibodies. We demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting the trimeric α-helical coiled coil of the HTLV-1 envelope can be generated. Many of the MAbs are highly conformation-specific and recognize the coiled coil but fail to recognize denatured antigen. Significantly some of the MAbs exhibit a marked specificity for the exposed coiled coil but recognize poorly the trimer-of-hairpins form of TM. Nevertheless, such antibodies fail to block HTLV-1 envelope-mediated membrane fusion and viral entry. The significance of our observations for vaccine design and viral pathogenesis is discussed. Animal Immunization, Hybridoma Production, and Cell Culture—Six- to eight-week-old CD1 mice were immunized with the recombinant antigen MBP-fishhook emulsified in adjuvant (TiterMax® Gold; CytRx Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, equal volumes of adjuvant and antigen were mixed to a final antigen concentration of 1.25 mg/ml. Mice were immunized subcutaneously with 50 μg of antigen, and immunization was repeated at 3-week intervals (three times). Seven days after the last boost, samples of serum from each animal were collected for determination of antibody titer. The animals were given a final boost by intravenous injection of soluble antigen (10 μg) without adjuvant 5 days prior to fusion. The mice were euthanized and the spleens removed, washed, minced, and gently agitated to release splenocytes. The splenocytes were fused to myeloma cells (SP2/0-Ag14, European Collection of Cell Cultures) using polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000, Sigma) and plated out in 96-well plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% FBS and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (Sigma) to select for hybridomas. Two weeks later, hybridomas were transferred to HT-supplemented media, and the culture supernatants were tested by ELISA for antibodies with reactivity to the immunogen. Antibody isotype and IgG subclass was determined using the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagents kit (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Myeloma SP2/0 cells, the HTLV-1 infected cell line MT-2, and uninfected Sup-T1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Plasmids—The plasmids pHTE-1 (22Dokhelar M.C.

Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ELISA—Microtiter 96-well plates (NUNC, MAXI-Sorp) were coated overnight at 4 °C with the chimeric MBP-TM fusion proteins, (MBP-Fishhook, MBP-Hairpin, MBP-N-helix, or control MBP; all at 10 μg/ml) in PBS, pH 7.2. Plates were blocked (5% Marvel, PBS, 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and washed (five times), and antibodies at the concentrations indicated were added and incubated with the immobilized target antigen for 2 h at room temperature. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) (Sigma) was added, and the bound antibody was detected using fresh 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) substrate at 15 μg/ml (in 0.1 m citric acid, 0.06% H2O2). After 10-20 min, color development was stopped and absorbance read at 415 nm. For assays comparing antibody reactivity with native versus denatured antigen (23Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Woof J.M. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6019-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Moore J.P. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 863-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), microtiter 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-MBP sheep polyclonal antibody at 10 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.2. Plates were washed twice with Wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with Blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. After further washing, native MBP-Hairpin (10 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% FBS was added to the wells (100 μl). For comparison, denatured MBP-Hairpin was prepared as above but also mixed with 50 mm dithiothreitol with 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Nine volumes of TBS/FBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (TBS/Nonidet P-40) were then added, and the solution was cooled to room temperature before addition to the plates. Monoclonal antibodies at the concentrations indicated were added and incubated with the native or denatured target antigen for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed five times to remove unbound antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) was added and incubated for 1 h, and the bound antibody detected as described above. Peptide Binding in the Presence of Anti-coiled Coil Antibodies—The peptide Bio-Pcr-400 (24Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was prepared as a stock solution in Wash buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. Bio-Pcr-400 (2.0 μg/ml) was incubated with immobilized MBP-fishhook in the presence or absence of the test antibody at the indicated concentrations, at room temperature, for 1 h. Preliminary binding assays indicated that a peptide concentration of 2.0 μg/ml is within the upper linear range of the concentration curve for binding of the peptide to the coiled coil (24Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Subsequently, plates were washed (five times) to remove unbound peptide, and bound complexes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) (1:10,000 dilution). Plates were washed five times to remove unbound streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase and two times with PBS to remove residual detergent. Finally, bound streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase and therefore bound Bio-Pcr-400 were detected using 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate, and the absorbance at 415 nm was read (Bio-Rad Plate reader). Expression and Purification of MBP-TM Proteins—The expression of recombinant MBP-TM proteins in Escherichia coli and purification by affinity chromatography on amylose-Sepharose were carried out as described (12Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of the eluted fusion proteins was estimated by the Bradford assay, and the recombinant proteins were stored at -80 °C in column buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol. The oligomerization status of each MBP-TM chimera was assessed by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Gel filtration analyses were calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa; Amersham Biosciences). Syncytium Interference Assay—Syncytium interference assays were performed by standard methods (26Jassal S.R. Pohler R.G. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8317-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Jassal S.R. Lairmore M.D. Leigh-Brown A.J. Brighty D.W. Virus Res. 2001; 78: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (3 × 105) transfected with the envelope expression vector pHTE-1 were added to untransfected HeLa target cells (7.0 × 105). The effector and target cells were co-cultured in the absence or presence of the MAbs at the concentrations specified. The cells were incubated for 12-15 h at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in PBS, 3% paraformaldehyde. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the number of syncytia from five low power fields per replicate was scored by light microscopy. Pseudotyping Assay—Pseudotyped virus was prepared as described (27Jassal S.R. Lairmore M.D. Leigh-Brown A.J. Brighty D.W. Virus Res. 2001; 78: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected using FuGENE 6 with 10 μg of the Env-defective, luciferase-encoding HIV proviral clone pNL4-3.LUC.R-.E- in the presence or absence of 10 μg of pHTE-1. Sodium butyrate (20 mm) was added after 18 h, and 48-72 h later the viral supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 400 × g and filtration through a 0.45-μm micropore filter. For transduction of HeLa or HOS cells, triplicate samples of 7 × 105 target cells in 1 ml were incubated with 1 ml of undiluted or serially diluted virus stock and plated into wells of a 6-well tissue culture dish. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity following the manufacturer's instructions using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA). For antibody inhibition experiments, 1 ml of HTLV-1 Env-pseudotyped virus was incubated with 1 ml HeLa or HOS cells (4 × 105 cells) in the presence or absence of serial dilutions of purified MAb. After overnight culture, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. FACS Analysis—HTLV-1-infected MT-2 and noninfected (control) Sup-T1 cells at a density of 106 cells per ml were mixed with 0.1 ml of hybridoma culture supernatant or 1 μg/ml purified MAbs and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rotation. The cells were pelleted (1000 rpm for 5 min, in an Eppendorf C5415C microcentrifuge), washed, and incubated with anti-mouse FITC antibody (1:1000 dilution) in RPMI medium at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The cells were washed (PBS, 0.1% sodium azide) and fixed (0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4), and the cells were kept in the dark at 4 °C until subjected to FACScan (BD Biosciences) analysis as directed by the manufacturer. Microscopy—HTLV-1-infected MT2 cells were labeled by transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) allowing the identification of the virally infected cells. The eGFP-MT2 cells (0.5 × 106) were co-cultured with the unlabeled Sup-T1 (0.5 × 106) in the presence of 1 μg/ml of the purified MAbs. The cell population was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min and plated onto collagen (5 mg/cm2)-coated glass coverslips (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 on the coverslips for 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min at room temperature, and then blocked (PBS, containing 1% FBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). The cell-bearing coverslips were carefully washed twice in Blocking buffer and incubated in the dark with anti-mouse IgG/TRITC (1:500) (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), sealed with nail varnish, and left to dry in the dark before the examination by fluorescence microscopy and differential interference contrast imaging using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with Open-lab (Improvision) data acquisition software. Production of Anti-TM MAbs—We have expressed a fragment of HTLV-1 TM that spans the N-terminal α-helical leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat as a fusion to maltose-binding protein (MBP) (12Pinon J.D.

Virol. 2007; 81: 6019-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This recombinant TM-derived fusion protein, referred to as MBP-fishhook, is trimeric as revealed by size exclusion chromatography and by native PAGE (12Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and specifically binds to synthetic peptides that mimic the C-helical region of the HTLV-1 trimer-of-hairpins (12Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus the recombinant TM fragment faithfully mimics the critical features of the exposed core coiled coil of fusion-active TM. In an effort to obtain monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the HTLV-1 coiled coil, the recombinant trimeric antigen was used to immunize CD1 mice. Booster immunizations were given at 4-week intervals; and the mice were subsequently euthanized, the spleens recovered, and the splenocytes fused with the myeloma cell line SP2/0-Ag14. Thereafter, hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies were selected using standard methods. From a bank of 600 hybridomas, a panel of nine independent clones secreting MAbs reactive with the immunogen were selected for detailed analysis. Each of the MAbs demonstrated strong binding to the immobilized coiledcoil fusion protein, MBP-fishhook (Fig. 2), but exhibited little or no reactivity with the carrier protein MBP. Thus, each of the selected MAbs exhibits specific reactivity with the coiled-coil fragment of HTLV-1 TM. Analysis of antibody subclass and isotype indicated that the panel of MAbs consist of six IgG1, two IgG2a, and one IgG2b antibodies (Table 1). Moreover, nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad, Prism) of the dose-dependent binding curves for each antibody indicated that there is a 35-fold range in relative binding affinity of the MAbs against the coiled coil of HTLV-1 TM (Fig. 3; Table 1).TABLE 1MAb isotype and concentration required to give half-maximal bindingHybridomaIsotype and subclass[MAb] at 50% bindingμg/mlN4-4IgG10.104N7-12IgG10.715N9-7IgG1>2.50aSaturation was not achieved for N9-7.N9-8IgG10.096N15-4IgG10.055N18-1IgG12.283N10-4IgG2a0.041N16-1IgG2a0.149N13-3IgG2b0.061a Saturation was not achieved for N9-7.

Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that some antibodies would exhibit a degree of conformational specificity to the epitopes recognized. Indeed, we have found previously that MAbs reactive with the post-fusion trimer-of-hairpins structure of HTLV-1 TM are highly conformation-specific (23Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Woof J.M. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6019-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the panel of MAbs for reactivity to native and denatured forms of the coiled coil. An established ELISA methodology (23Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Woof J.M. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6019-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Moore J.P. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 863-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to examine MAb binding to native or denatured antigen. Briefly, the antigen MBP-fishhook was denatured by heating in SDS-Tris buffer containing irrelevant carrier protein, and thereafter the antigen was diluted 10-fold in SDS-free buffer. Denatured or native antigen was subsequently captured on the surface of microtiter plates pre-coated with anti-MBP polyclonal rabbit sera. Murine MAbs were then examined for the ability to bind to the immobilized native or denatured antigen. Importantly, the MAb M20-1 known to bind to a linear epitope of the carrier protein MBP was used as a control to monitor antigen capture (Fig. 4). The control MAb, M20-1, displayed highly efficient binding to both native and denatured MBP-fishhook. By contrast, whereas the anti-coiled-coil MAbs bound efficiently to native antigen, there was a dramatic loss in binding to denatured coiled coil (Fig. 4). Moreover, these MAbs failed to bind to a set of overlapping but monomeric 27-35 amino acid synthetic peptides (23Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Woof J.M. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6019-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that cover the entire core coiled coil of envelope (data not shown). Thus binding of each of the MAbs to the coiled coil is highly dependent on appropriate presentation of epitopes that are sensitive to the conformational status of the coiled coil.

Bcr is a phosphoprotein with a novel serine/threonine kinase activity encoded by its first exon. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, Bcr-Abl phosphorylates Bcr on tyrosine residues reducing its kinase activity. Overexpression of BCR in BCR-ABL+ cells produces a phosphoserine form of Bcr, which inhibits the oncogenic effects of BCR-ABL. To investigate the inhibitory effects of Bcr on Bcr-Abl, we expressed BCR/GFP in TonB210 cells, which contain a tetracycline-inducible BCR-ABL. In nude mice injected with cell clones of TonB210/BCR/GFP, tumor formation was delayed, and tumors were 50% smaller compared with the TonB210/GFP. In addition, TonB210/ BCR/GFP cells had little colony-forming ability in soft agar compared with TonB210/GFP cells. In contrast, a point mutant of BCR (Y360F), which disrupts its kinase activity, not only blocked Bcr's inhibitory effects but also enhanced the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl in a solid tumor model and in soft agar colony assays. Similar effects were observed with a second BCR kinase domain mutant, S354A. These results indicate that the inhibitory function of Bcr directed toward Bcr-Abl requires its kinase function."
