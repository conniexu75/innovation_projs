https://openalex.org/W2077943840,"Fire scars in giant sequoia [Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindley) Buchholz] were used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal pattern of surface fires that burned episodically through five groves during the past 2000 years. Comparisons with independent dendroclimatic reconstructions indicate that regionally synchronous fire occurrence was inversely related to yearly fluctuations in precipitation and directly related to decadal-to-centennial variations in temperature. Frequent small fires occurred during a warm period from about A.D. 1000 to 1300, and less frequent but more widespread fires occurred during cooler periods from about A.D. 500 to 1000 and after A.D. 1300. Regionally synchronous fire histories demonstrate the importance of climate in maintaining nonequilibrium conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2013555861,"Ionically conducting polymers (polymer electrolytes) are under intensive investigation because they form the basis of all solid-state lithium batteries, fuel cells, and electrochromic display devices, as well as being highly novel electrolytes. Little is known about the structures of the many crystalline complexes that form between poly(ethylene oxide) and a wide range of salts. The crystal structure is reported of the archetypal polymer electrolyte poly(ethylene oxide)(3):LiCF(3)SO(3), which has been determined from powder x-ray diffraction data. The poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain adopts a helical conformation parallel to the crystallographic b axis. The Li(+) cation is coordinated by five oxygen atoms-three ether oxygens and one from each of two adjacent CF(3)SO(3)(-) groups. Each CF(3)SO(3)(-) in turn bridges two Li(+) ions to form chains running parallel to and intertwined with the PEO chain. There are no interchain links between PEO chains, and the electrolyte can be regarded as an infinite columnar coordination complex."
https://openalex.org/W2028512433,"The Wairakei plant discharges approximately 6.5 times as much heat, 5.5 times as much water vapor, and 0.5 times as much sulfur, per unit of power produced, as would a modern coal plant in New Zealand. It also contaminates the Waikato River with H(2)S, CO(2), arsenic, and mercury at concentrations that have adverse but not calamitous effects. Designed and built at a time when environmental sensibilities were less acute and geothermal technology was less developed, Wairakei produces an overall environmental impact that would be neither acceptable nor necessary in a new plant. Despite its imperfections, however, the Wairakei plant has been under development or in operation for more than 20 years without presenting any serious environmental problems for the local population. Reinjection of the hot waste water, an as yet unproven procedure for liquid-dominated fields, would reduce the plant's environmental impact sharply. Ground subsidence is not a severe problem at Wairakei but may prove to be one at the nearby Broadlands field. There are several environmental characteristics that are unique to geothermal power: (i) pollutant formation may be independent of the power productionc rate; (ii) effluent pathways may change abruptly; (iii) preoperational testing and wild bores contribute significantly to the overall impact; and (iv) waste water may be discharged at temperatures high enough so that utilization of the waste heat becomes both practical and imperative."
https://openalex.org/W2087916479,"Geyser eruption frequency is not constant over time and has been shown to vary with small (</=10(-6)) strains induced by seismic events, atmospheric loading, and Earth tides. The geyser system is approximated as a permeable conduit of intensely fractured rock surrounded by a less permeable rock matrix. Numerical simulation of this conceptual model yields a set of parameters that controls geyser existence and periodicity. Much of the responsiveness to remote seismicity and other small strains in the Earth can be explained in terms of variations in permeability and lateral recharge rates."

https://openalex.org/W2012657903,"Isotopic data for the Stillwater Complex, Montana, which formed about 2700 Ma (million years ago), were obtained to evaluate the role of magma mixing in the formation of strategic platinum-group element (PGE) ore deposits. Neodymium and osmium isotopic data indicate that the intrusion formed from at least two geochemically distinct magmas. Ultramafic affinity (U-type) magmas had initial epsilon(Nd) of -0.8 to -3.2 and a chondritic initial (187)Os/(186)Os ratio of approximately 0.88, whereas anorthositic affinity (A-type) magmas had epsilon(Nd) of -0.7 to +1.7 and an initial (187)Os/(186)Os ratio of approximately -1.13. These data suggest that U-type magmas were derived from a lithospheric mantle source containing recycled crustal materials whereas A-type magmas originated either by crustal contamination of basaltic magmas or by partial melting of basalt in the lower crust. The Nd and Os isotopic data also suggest that Os, and probably the other PGEs in ore horizons such as the J-M Reef, was derived from A-type magmas. The Nd and Os isotopic heterogeneity observed in rocks below the J-M Reef also suggests that A-type magmas were injected into the Stillwater U-type magma chamber at several stages during the development of the Ultramafic series."
https://openalex.org/W2092623276,Digital images of Neptune showing cloud structure at visible wavelengths were obtained in July 1988. A discrete bright feature was detected both at 6190 Å (a weak methane absorption band in the visible) and at 8900 Å (a stronger methane band in the near infrared). The images also revealed that Neptune's southern pole was bright relative to planetary mid-latitudes at 6190 Å but not 8900 Å. The implications of these findings for atmospheric rotation and structure are discussed. The detection of discrete features at visible wavelengths is of special importance to the upcoming Voyager encounter with Neptune: the wide-angle camera has a 6190 Å filter similar to that used for these observations.

https://openalex.org/W2028517465,Deep sounding seismic reflection data show undeformed reflectors at depths down to 11 kilometers beneath the continental rise and abyssal plain and 7 kilometers in basins of the lower slope. Weak reflectors are visible beneath the salt of the Sigsbee Scarp and within salt ridges separating the lower slope basins.
