This adult neurogenesis has been proposed as a novel mechanism that mediates spatial memory. However, data showing a causal relationship between neurogenesis and spatial memory are controversial. Here, we developed an inducible transgenic strategy allowing specific ablation of adult-born hippocampal neurons. This resulted in an impairment of spatial relational memory, which supports a capacity for flexible, inferential memory expression. In contrast, less complex forms of spatial knowledge were unaltered. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons are necessary for complex forms of hippocampus-mediated learning."

In order to prevent the diffusion of damaging degradation products, dying neurons are quickly digested by microglia. Despite the importance of microglia in several neuronal pathologies, the mechanism underlying their degradation of neurons remains elusive. Here, we exploit a microglial population in the zebrafish to study this process in intact living brains. In vivo imaging reveals that digestion of neurons occurs in compartments arising from the progressive fusion of vesicles. We demonstrate that this fusion is mediated by the v0-ATPase a1 subunit. By applying live pH indicators, we show that the a1 subunit mediates fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes during phagocytosis, a function that is independent of its proton pump activity. As a real-time description of microglial phagocytosis in vivo, this work advances our understanding of microglial-mediated neuronal degeneration, a hallmark of many neuronal diseases.

Apoptosis plays a central role in sculpting tissues and regulating cell numbers. This is very well documented in the Central Nervous System (CNS) where a significant proportion of neurons undergo programmed cell death (Kuan et al., 2000Kuan C.Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P.

To prevent the diffusion of damaging degradation products into the surrounding tissue it is essential that the dying neurons are quickly recognized and phagocytosed (Lauber et al., 2004Lauber K.

Recognizing death: the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 365-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the brain, this task is performed by a resident population of phagocytes, known as the microglia (Barron, 1995Barron K. The microglial cell. A historical review.J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 134: 57-68Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Kettenmann, 2007Kettenmann H. Neuroscience: the brain's garbage men.Nature. 2007; 446: 987-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS. As such, they can protect the brain from infection by engulfing microorganisms, however, it is their ability to recognize, engulf and digest apoptotic neurons under physiological conditions that makes them important players in the formation and integrity of the nervous system. It is unclear how microglia detect apoptotic neurons in the healthy brain, but recent work has identified the P2Y12 purinergic receptor as the trigger of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis in response to neuronal injury in the brain (Koizumi et al., 2007Koizumi S. Shigemoto-Mogami Y. Nasu-Tada K. Shinozaki Y. Ohsawa K. Tsuda M. Joshi B.V. Jacobson K.A. Kohsaka S. Inoue K.

P2X4 receptors induced in spinal microglia gate tactile allodynia after nerve injury.Nature. 2003; 424: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). While many different stimuli may activate microglia, it is likely that the internal cellular machinery that is in place to efficiently digest neurons is the same whether these cells are engulfed during normal physiology or in response to pathological conditions. Phagocytosis has long been studied at the cell biological level thanks to many elegant in vitro assays (Desjardins and Griffiths, 2003Desjardins M. Griffiths G. Phagocytosis: latex leads the way.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These studies have establish that phagocytosis can be divided into several distinct steps: binding of the pray, formation of the phagosome and maturation of the latter to digest the ingested material. Importantly, the phagosome progressively fuses with other vesicles types, such as lysososmes, to acquire enzymes that are necessary for digestion. One important feature of phagosomal maturation is its acidification via the activity of proton pumps. This is a crucial step in the digestion process as the activity of digestive enzymes increases in a low-pH environment (Mellman et al., 1986Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius R. Acidification of the endocytic and exocytic pathways.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). v-ATPases, the major cellular proton pumps, are multisubunit protein complexes consisting of the V0 and V1 sectors (Kawasaki-Nishi et al., 2003Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Proton translocation driven by ATP hydrolysis in V-ATPases.FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Nishi and Forgac, 2002Nishi T. Forgac M. The vacuolar (H+) ATPases nature's most versatile proton pumps.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Via ATP hydrolysis, the complex translocates protons into the vesicular lumen. While this is a well-established function for v-ATPases, it is now clear that the a1 subunit part of the v0 sector mediates membrane fusion events downstream of the t-SNARE docking of vesicles in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner (Bayer et al., 2003Bayer M.J. Reese C. Buhler S. Peters C. Mayer A. Vacuole membrane fusion: V0 functions after trans-SNARE pairing and is coupled to the Ca2+-releasing channel.J.

The Vtc proteins in vacuole fusion: coupling NSF activity to V(0) trans-complex formation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 259-269Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In recent years, these data have been supported by in vivo evidence as it has been shown that in D. melanogaster and C. elegans neurons lacking the a1 subunit accumulate vesicles in their synaptic terminals suggesting that the V0 subunit may be involved in mediating vesicle fusion during exocytosis (Hiesinger et al., 2005Hiesinger P.R. Fayyazuddin A. Mehta S.Q. Rosenmund T. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Verstreken P. Cao Y. Zhou Y. Kunz J. Bellen H.J.

Benedetto A. Garnier J.M. Schwab Y. Labouesse M. The V0-ATPase mediates apical secretion of exosomes containing Hedgehog-related proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Neuronal disposal by microglia is essential for normal brain development and physiology however, when uncontrolled, it characterizes several neurodegenerative disorders (Block et al., 2007Block M.L. Zecca L. Hong J.S. Microglia-mediated neurotoxicity: uncovering the molecular mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). It is important to comprehend how under normal circumstances microglia interact with dying neuron in order to understand, prevent and cure the aberrations. We have developed tools to capture the behavior of microglia and their phagocytic organelles in living zebrafish brains. Here, we investigate how microglia act to phagocytose and digest neurons during brain development in vivo. Time-lapse confocal microscopy shows that this process is characterised by the fusion of vesicles. Blocking vesicular fusion leads to the accumulation of the apoptotic material inside the cell, with the cell being transformed into a bag of vesicles, unable to process collected material. As a first step toward understanding how microglia digest dying neurons, we have addressed the role of the v0-ATPase a1 subunit in this process in vivo. This has revealed a role in mediating vesicle fusion events during the process of phagocytosis. By applying pH indicators to living zebrafish embryos, we show that this requirement for the a1 subunit is independent of the acidifying role of the v0-ATPase complex. In order to facilitate imaging of microglia we generated transgenic lines in which the GFP marker is expressed under the control of the apolipoprotein-E locus (Apo-E-GFP, Figure 1B), a previously described marker for zebrafish microglia (Figure 1A; Herbomel et al., 1999Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Ontogeny and behaviour of early macrophages in the zebrafish embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Herbomel et al., 2001Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Zebrafish early macrophages colonize cephalic mesenchyme and developing brain, retina, and epidermis through a M-CSF receptor-dependent invasive process.Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To this aim, we introduced a membrane-bound GFP into the apolipoprotein-E locus. Transgenic lines recapitulate the Apo-E expression pattern and allow the in vivo morphology of these cells to be observed for the first time in the zebrafish (Figures 1B and 1D–1G). The APO-E-GFP cells are around 40 μm in size and display several features that are characteristic of mouse microglia (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005Nimmerjahn A. Kirchhoff F. Helmchen F. Resting Microglial Cells Are Highly Dynamic Surveillants of Brain Parenchyma in Vivo.Science. 2005; 308: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar; Figures 1B and 1G). Mammalian microglia are highly branched cells characterised by filopodia and bulbous-tipped protrusions that undergo rapid cycles of formation, extension and withdrawal on a time scale of minutes. Likewise, the APO-E-GFP positive cells in the zebrafish brain show a similar branched morphology, with processes that extend and retract at a speed of 2.5 μm/min (Figure 1G and Movies S1 and S2 available online). Previous work has shown that zebrafish microglia derives from a subset of macrophages, expressing the myeloid markers spi/pU1 and L-plastin (Herbomel et al., 1999Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Ontogeny and behaviour of early macrophages in the zebrafish embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This macrophage pool can be depleted using an antisense morpholino shown to block translation of the spi/pU1 transcription factor required to promote the differentiation of macrophages from their myeloid precursors (Rhodes et al., 2005Rhodes J. Hagen A. Hsu K. Deng M. Liu T.X. Look A.T. Kanki J.P. Interplay of pu.1 and gata1 determines myelo-erythroid progenitor cell fate in zebrafish.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We directly tested whether these are the progenitors of the APO-E-GFP positive cells by depleting the macrophage population in the APO-E-GFP line. Injection of the pU1 morpholino leads to the complete absence of Apo-E-GFP positive cells from the brain of the transgenic embryos, confirming the myeloid origin of these cells (Figures 4A and 4B). We next asked whether APO-E-GFP positive cells are able to phagocytose pathogens, a characteristic function of microglial cells in the brain (Streit and Kincaid-Colton, 1995Streit W.J. Kincaid-Colton C.A. The brain's immune system.Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 58-61Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We therefore injected red-labeled Gram-negative E.coli bacteria (DsRed Express, Clontech) into the ventricles of APO-E-GFP brains. Time-lapse imaging revealed that soon after injection, red bacterial inclusions are transported along cell extensions to the cell bodies of APO-E-GFP positive cells (Figures 2A–2C, white arrowhead and Figure 2D). Thus, the APO-E-GFP positive cells in the brain phagocytose invading microorganisms such as bacteria. Another hallmark of microglia is that they can detect and phagocytose apoptotic neurons (Kuan et al., 2000Kuan C.Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Mechanisms of programmed cell death in the developing brain.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To observe such interactions between APO-E-GFP cells and surrounding neurons, we labeled all neurons in vivo by driving the DsRed Express marker under the control of a neuronal specific promoter (Figure 4I, NBT-DsRed). Crossing of the two transgenic lines reveals that bulbous-tipped protrusions on APO-E-GFP cells are phagocytic cups (around 5 μm in size, Movies S1 and S2), whose function is to phagocytose neurons transporting them to the cell body (Figures 2E and 2F and Movie S2). Collectively, these data strongly support our conclusion that the APO-E-GFP are the zebrafish equivalent of the mammalian microglia. We turned our attention to the dynamics of neuronal phagocytosis by microglia. We observed that microglial cells repeatedly send out branches to collect NBT-DsRed labeled neurons, which accumulate as red clusters of different intensity (Figure 2F white arrowhead and dotted circle). These clusters are also strongly labeled with several markers for apoptosis such as AnnexinV-Cy5, CaspGLOW, acridine orange and TUNEL (Figures 4C and 4D and S3A–S3L, white arrowheads). Importantly, there is a tight correlation between the apoptotic clusters, whether marked with NBT-DsRed or the apoptosis indicators, and microglia, showing that APO-E-GFP labels all phagocytes that are active at this point in the fish brain (Figures 4H–4K). Finally, time-lapse imaging reveals that NBT-DsRed clusters are turned over showing that APO-E-GFP microglia engulf and digest neurons (Figures 2G and 2H and Movie S3). One crucial event during phagocytosis is the progressive acidification of phagosomes. The vacuolar (V-type) ATPases, consisting of a V1 and V0 complexes, are the major proton pumps involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments. By analyzing the zebrafish genome we identified one zebrafish homolog of the a1 subunit (atp6v0a1; NP 997837). In order to pinpoint its in vivo expression we performed in situ hybridization against the atp6v0a1 transcript in embryos in which myeloid cells and microglia are labeled by GFP expression. To label the myeloid precursors of microglia, we have generated a pU1-Gal4-UAS-GFP transgenic line in which GFP is expressed under the control of pU1, an early macrophage marker. Indeed, the pU1-Gal4-UAS-GFP positive cells that localize along the trunk and move toward the brain to become microglia express atp6v0a1 (Figures 3A–3F). At 3 days post fertilization, once the microglial population is established, APO-E-GFP cells show atp6v0a1 expression (Figures 3G–3I). This shows that the a1 subunit is present in both microglia and in myeloid cells. We next addressed the function of the atp6v0a1 during the turnover of neurons by microglia by knocking-down its translation via the injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (atp6v0a1-MO, a1-MO; Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000Nasevicius A. Ekker S. Effective targeted gene ‘knockdown’ in zebrafish.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Morpholino efficacy was assayed by western blot analysis and this shows that the expected 116kDa band, presents in extracts of 3 dpf uninjected embryos, is absent in embryonic extracts obtained from atp6v0a1 3 dpf knockdown embryos, confirming the efficacy of the morpholino mediated knockdown (Figure 4G). Furthermore, to test the specificity of the a1-MO we have fused its target sequence to GFP and a 5 base mismatch control sequence to dtTomato. Coinjection of these fusion mRNAs into one-cell stage embryos gave strong green and red fluorescence after 6 hr (Figures S1A–S1D). Whenever the coinjection of both mRNAs was followed by the injection of the a1-MO, the embryos were red but not green, showing the specific binding of the a1-MO to its target sequence (Figures S1E and S1F). Moreover, the injection of the control morpholino does not block the translation of either of the two reporter constructs (Figures S1G and S1H). In APO-E-GFP/NBT-DsRed embryos phagocytosed neurons appear as a strong red cluster with low power objectives (Figure 4I, white arrowhead). Closer inspection reveals that each cluster comprises 4-to-12 smaller vesicles of neuronal material (Figures 2F, 4I and 4J, and 4F). In morphant APO-E-GFP/NBT-DsRed embryos, the total number of clusters per embryo is comparable to the wild-type, however each cluster is considerably larger and is formed by 10 to 20 smaller spots (Figure 4, compare 4I and 4J with 4M and 4N, white arrowheads, quantified in Figure 4E and 4F). Finally, we have used a second morpholino that blocks the splicing of the first intron from the v-ATPase transcript and we have confirmed the specificity and efficacy of the knockdown by monitoring a size-shift in the transcript produced from the vAtpase gene. This shows an identical phenotype to the ATG morpholino, albeit with lower penetrance (Figure S2). An increase in the amount of apoptotic material inside morphant microglia can be caused by augmented neuronal apoptosis. However, by performing time-course experiments with several markers and vital dyes for apoptosis, such as Annexin-Cy5, Acridine orange, TUNEL and CaspGLOW, we did not detect a difference in the levels of apoptosis within the CNS between wild-type and atp6v0a1-MO embryos (Figure 4 compare 4C and 4J with 4D and 4N and Figures S3A–SF, SG–SK, and SL). In both wild-type and morphant embryos, the apoptotic staining is detectable almost exclusively inside microglia. Interestingly, in embryos where neuronal apoptosis increases significantly, dying neurons are found throughout the brain, a phenotype that is clearly distinct from the increased cluster size observed here (Liu et al., 2003Liu T.X. Howlett N.G. Deng M. Langenau D.M. Hsu K. Rhodes J. Kanki J.P. D'Andrea A.D. Look T.A. Knockdown of Zebrafish Fancd2 Causes Developmental Abnormalities via p53-Dependent Apoptosis.Dev.

Xia W. Zebrafish lacking Alzheimer presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2) demonstrate excessive p53-dependent apoptosis and neuronal loss.J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1423-1440Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increase in neuronal apoptosis or neuronal degeneration causes a dramatic expansion in microglial number, a phenomenon that is called microgliosis (Nijhawan et al., 2000Nijhawan D. Honarpour N. Wang X. Apoptosis in Neural Development and Disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar; F.P., unpublished data). These data raise the possibility that the large amount of apoptotic material within atp6v0a1-MO microglia is caused by the inability of these cells to digest what they have engulfed. To test this hypothesis we have conducted an Annexin-Cy5 ‘pulse-chase’ experiment to compare the dynamics of neuronal degradation within wild-type and morphant microglia. Time-lapse imaging allowed us to compare how efficiently wild-type and morphant microglia turnover these bulk-labeled neurons by monitoring the shift in Annexin-V-Cy5 fluorescence intensity at 30 min intervals. While there is a progressive decrease in the amount of AnnexinV-Cy5 fluorescence, present in wild-type cells, in morphant microglia emission stale (Figure 5 compare 5A and 5B, 5A′ and 5B′, with 5C and 5D, 5C′ and 5D′, and 5E). Thus, microglia with reduced atp6v0a1 activity are phagocytic but display a specific block in the digestion of apoptotic neurons. Given that v-ATPases are the major intracellular proton pumps, one possible explanation for the lack of neuronal digestion in atp6v0a1-MO microglia is a block in phagosomal acidification. The fluorophore LysoSensor GREEN-DND-189 (LysoSensor) is a reliable indicator of vesicular acidification, used in cell cultures to label acidic organelles and to monitor pH gradients (Harris and Cardelli, 2002Harris E. Cardelli J. RabD, a Dictyostelium Rab14-related GTPase, regulates phagocytosis and homotypic phagosome and lysosome fusion.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3703-3713Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The LysoSensor dye labels microglia with remarkable specificity after a quick 5 min incubation. Surprisingly, LysoSensor also labels acidic compartments inside morphant microglia with an intensity emission that is indistinguishable from wild-type (Figures 5G–5I and 5J–5L, compare 5P with 5Q and 5F), This indicates that acidification of vesicles occurs also in the absence of a1 v0-ATPase activity in morphant microglia. Thus, failure in digesting apoptotic neurons in atp6v0a1-MO embryos is not caused by a block in vesicular acidification. In order to confirm that LysoSensor labeling is a reliable read-out of v-ATPase acidification in this context, we took advantage of a widely used small molecule inhibitor of v-ATPase proton pump, Bafilomycin A1 (Bowman et al., 2004Bowman E.J. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. Bowman B.J. The bafilomycin/concanamycin binding site in subunit c of the V-ATPases from Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33131-33138Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5, adding Bafilomycin A1 to the fish medium completely abolishes LysoSensor labeling within microglia, indicating that this dye can indeed be used as a bone fide indicator of v-ATPase organelle acidification in living animals (Figure 5M–5O). To understand how wild-type and morphant phagosomes become acidified, we have tracked their behavior by time-lapse imaging (Figures 7A and 7B and Movies S4 and S5). Two-color time-lapse imaging reveals that in both wild-type and morphant microglia, phagosomes turn acidic approximately 10 min after their formation. (Figures 7A and 7B and Movies S4 and S5; yellow arrowheads). Importantly, this event occurs autonomously and is independent from fusion with neighboring acidic vesicles. Early phagosomal acidification that is independent from fusion has been previously documented and is suggested to be mediated by vacuolar ATPases present on the plasma membrane of granulocytes and macrophages (Bouvier et al., 1994Bouvier G. Benoliel A.M. Foa C. Bongrand P. Relationship between phagosome acidification, phagosome-lysosome fusion, and mechanism of particle ingestion.J. Leukoc.

In wild-type cells after acidification phagosomes start fusing (Figure 7A and Movie S4). These events are also visible during time-lapse imaging of NBT-DsRed phagosomes. Here, when vesicles of different intensity merge we can observe a spreading of the dye from one compartment to the other resulting in an equilibration of intensity that renders fusion events more conspicuous (Figure 6E, Movie S7, white arrowheads). However, in morphant microglia, even although phagosomes are acidic, we never see them fuse (Figure 7B, Movie S5, white asterisks). To quantify fusion events we counted the number of GFP labeled vesicles over 4 hr time-course. In wild-type, the number of vesicles per cell fluctuates, due to vesicle formation and fusion. By contrast, in the morphant microglia vesicle number either remains constantly high or increases during the same period of time (Figure S4). Therefore knock-down of the a1 subunit does not block the acidification of organelles but rather prevents their fusion.Figure 7Phagolysosomal Fusion Defects in atp6v0a1 Morpholino Knock-DownShow full caption(A) Confocal time-lapse analysis of wild-type (A) and atp6v0a1-MO microglia (B) microglia in 3 dpf brains.

A key event during phagocytosis is the heterotypic fusion between phagosomes, that carry the material to digest, and lysosomes, that provide the enzymes required for digestion. To determine if during phagocytosis the v0-Atpase a1 subunit mediates the fusion between these two different vesicle types, we have addressed the behavior of these organelles in living fish brains. To this aim, we have first labeled the lysosomes using MR-Cathepsin, whose red fluorescence is quenched until cleaved by enzymes found only in lysosomes (Figure 6L). We confirmed that MR-Cathepsin localizes specifically to lysosomes using a genetically encoded lysosomal marker, CD63/Lysosomal-Membrane-Associated-Protein-3-GFP (Figures 6A and 6B; de Saint-Vis et al., 2000de Saint-Vis B.

As shown in Figure 6, phagosomes forming at the plasma membrane of APO-GFP microglia (green) fuse with MR-Cathepsin lysosomes (red). This fusion event is marked by the spreading of the red dye from one vesicle type into the other (Figure 6L and movie 8).

To clarify molecular differences underlying these diseases, we determined crystal structures of the XPD catalytic core from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and measured mutant enzyme activities. Substrate-binding grooves separate adjacent Rad51/RecA-like helicase domains (HD1, HD2) and an arch formed by 4FeS and Arch domains. XP mutations map along the HD1 ATP-binding edge and HD2 DNA-binding channel and impair helicase activity essential for NER. XP/CS mutations both impair helicase activity and likely affect HD2 functional movement. TTD mutants lose or retain helicase activity but map to sites in all four domains expected to cause framework defects impacting TFIIH integrity. These results provide a foundation for understanding disease consequences of mutations in XPD and related 4Fe-4S helicases including FancJ.

Mutations in the human XPD helicase gene (ERCC2) are mainly single residue changes and sometimes at adjacent residues; yet, they cause three strikingly different genetic disorders: XP, CS combined with XP (XP/CS), and TTD (Lehmann, 2001Lehmann A.R.

Although all three diseases share a photosensitivity phenotype, they differ greatly in their predispositions to cancer or accelerated aging. XP patients show several 1000-fold increase in skin cancer, whereas neither CS nor TTD patients show an increase in the cancer incidence despite sun sensitivity. Furthermore, both CS and TTD are premature aging diseases plus developmental disorders, with CS patients being more severely affected and exhibiting severe mental retardation from birth. Despite extensive biochemical and cell biological analysis, key questions remain concerning how point mutations in adjacent residues in a single enzyme can give rise to such different disease phenotypes (Lehmann, 2001Lehmann A.R. The xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) gene: one gene, two functions, three diseases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). XPD helicase activity is essential for NER but dispensable for transcription (Coin et al., 2007Coin F. Oksenych V. Egly J.M.

TFIIH enzymatic activities in transcription and nucleotide excision repair.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 246-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). XPD protein-protein interactions are critical for both helicase activity and stability of the TFIIH complex (Dubaele et al., 2003Dubaele S. Proietti D. Santis L. Bienstock R.J. Keriel A. Stefanini M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1635-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutations in the XPD C terminus that cause TTD weaken binding to TFIIH subunit p44 and reduce DNA repair activity (Coin et al., 2007Coin F. Oksenych V. Egly J.M.

Cell. 2007; 26: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). XPD also interacts with XPG, and loss of XPG destabilizes TFIIH and its association with XPD (Ito et al., 2007Ito S. Kuraoka I. Chymkowitch P. Compe E. Takedachi A. Ishigami C. Coin F. Egly J.M.

Cell. 2007; 26: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor transactivations are inhibited by XPD mutations that reduce p44 interactions (Dubaele et al., 2003Dubaele S. Proietti D. Santis L. Bienstock R.J. Keriel A. Stefanini M. Van Houten B.

Cell. 2007; 26: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) probably due to decreased TFIIH stability. TFIIH from TTD, but not from XP patients, has basal transcription defects in vitro as well as reduced in vivo TFIIH concentrations (Dubaele et al., 2003Dubaele S. Proietti D. Santis L. Bienstock R.J. Keriel A. Stefanini M. Van Houten B. Egly J.M. Basal transcription defect discriminates between xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy in XPD patients.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1635-1646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting XPD's role in TFIIH stability is impacted by TTD-causing mutations. Cellular and biochemical analyses provide detailed information on XPD activities, patient mutations, and TFIIH stability (Bootsma and Hoeijmakers, 1993Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. DNA repair.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, an understanding of the molecular basis for these effects has proven elusive without combined structural and biochemical analyses of the XPD helicase. Recent biochemical characterization of the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius XPD homolog (SaXPD) and yeast genetic analyses uncovered a unique Fe-S cluster domain conserved among related SF2 helicases important for genomic stability including Chl1, Rtel1, and FancJ (also known as BACH1 and BRIP1), which is defective in Fanconi anemia (Rudolf et al., 2006Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. The DNA repair helicases XPD and FancJ have essential iron-sulfur domains.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These studies showed that these XPD-like helicases require a novel Fe-S cluster region inserted between the Walker A and Walker B motifs, suggesting that the Fe-S region conformation may be controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis, as an analogously placed insertion is coupled to the ATP binding state in the Rad50 ABC ATPase (Hopfner et al., 2000Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Furthermore, recent studies on the Ferroplasma acidarmanus XPD protein revealed that the intact cluster acts in the correct orientation of the XPD protein at the ssDNA-dsDNA junction (Pugh et al., 2008Pugh R.A. Honda M. Leesley H. Thomas A. Lin Y. Nilges M.J. Cann I.K. Spies M. The iron-containing domain is essential in Rad3 helicases for coupling of ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation and for targeting the helicase to the single-stranded DNA-double-stranded DNA junction.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1732-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This Fe-S region is biologically critical as a mutation in the XPD Fe-S region causes TTD (Schumacher et al., 2008Schumacher B. Garinis G.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Age to survive: DNA damage and aging.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and a FancJ mutation in this region causes severe clinical symptoms of Fanconi anemia and a predisposition to early-onset breast cancer (Cantor et al., 2004Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. The BRCA1-associated protein BACH1 is a DNA helicase targeted by clinically relevant inactivating mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Barral S. et al.The BRCA1-interacting helicase BRIP1 is deficient in Fanconi anemia.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although unusual in nuclear proteins, Fe-S clusters were discovered to act in DNA binding for DNA repair glycosylases, as originally shown for endonuclease III (Thayer et al., 1995Thayer M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Novel DNA binding motifs in the DNA-repair enzyme endonuclease III structure.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters may also act as electron- and oxygen-responsive molecular switches on DNA (Boal et al., 2005Boal A.K. Yavin E. Lukianova O.A. O'Shea V.L. David S.S. Barton J.K. DNA-bound redox activity of DNA repair glycosylases containing [4Fe-4S] clusters.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8397-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Outten, 2007Outten F.W. Iron-sulfur clusters as oxygen-responsive molecular switches.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 206-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To provide a molecular foundation to address current paradoxes regarding XPD activities and the role of XPD mutations in causing distinct human diseases, we determined structures of SaXPD with and without the Fe-S cluster and analyzed the activities of mutations at conserved sites that cause XP, XP/CS, and TTD diseases. The XPD four-domain fold and architecture, which is substantially different than expected (Bienstock et al., 2003Bienstock R.J. Skorvaga M. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Structural and functional characterization of the human DNA repair helicase XPD by comparative molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of the bacterial repair protein UvrB.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), reveal functional roles for the 4Fe-4S cluster and XPD mutation sites relevant to disease-causing defects in XPD as well as the related 4Fe-4S helicase FancJ. More generally, the relationships of XPD structures and activities characterized here support a unified understanding of XPD activities and interactions in cell biology. To understand the XPD structure, we expressed, purified, and analyzed SaXPD. Sequence alignments show SaXPD represents the XPD catalytic core (XPDcc) with a 4Fe-4S cluster and all the helicase motifs conserved with the human XPD (Figures 1A and S1). The human XPD C-terminal extension, missing in SaXPD, is predicted to be disordered by PONDR (Romero et al., 2001Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Sequence complexity of disordered protein.Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), and may act in TFIIH interactions (Figure 1A). To determine the XPDcc structure and 4Fe-4S cluster role unique to XPD and related helicases such as FancJ (Rudolf et al., 2006Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. The DNA repair helicases XPD and FancJ have essential iron-sulfur domains.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), we therefore crystallized SaXPD and solved crystal structures with and without the bound 4Fe-4S cluster. SaXPD crystallized in space group P212121 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). We solved the SaXPD crystal structure by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) with Se-Met substituted protein expressed in bacteria, and refined the structure to 2 Å resolution (R = 22.3%, Rfree = 26.0%). The high-quality composite omit electron density maps allowed us to fit and refine all amino acid residues (1–551). The structure extends results on SaXPD sequence and mutagenesis (Rudolf et al., 2006Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F.

Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 10% of reflections that were not used for structure refinement, and R factor is calculated for the remaining reflections. The SaXPD structure shows that the XPD catalytic core is comprised of four domains: two Rad51/RecA-like domains (HD1 and HD2) with two additional domains (the 4FeS and Arch domains) inserted into HD1 (Figures 1, S1, and S2). These four XPDcc domains contain 22 out of the 26 known disease-causing point mutation sites; only 4 of the XPD sites are positioned in the C-terminal extension from HD2 (Figure 1A). HD1 (175 residues: 1–81, 149–192, and 304–353) and HD2 (198 residues: 354–551) share the α-β fold with a central seven-stranded parallel β sheet flanked by α helices (Figure S2) that resemble the ATPase domain in Rad51 and RecA (Shin et al., 2003Shin D.S. Pellegrini L. Daniels D.S. Yelent B. Craig L. Bates D. Yu D.S. Shivji M.K. Hitomi C. Arvai A.S. et al.Full-length archaeal Rad51 structure and mutants: mechanisms for RAD51 assembly and control by BRCA2.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4566-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The 4FeS (67 residues: 82–148) and Arch (111 residues: 193–303) domains are inserted between adjacent β strands of the central β sheet of HD1, making them closely connected to HD1, but relatively independent of HD2 (Figure S2). In contrast, known helicase structures typically have domains inserted into HD2 (Singleton et al., 2007Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Alignment of the human XPD sequence with the SaXPD sequence, secondary structure, and helicase motifs validates and informs the conserved nature of the XPD fold and domain structure (Figure S1). The helicase motifs are conserved from SaXPD to human XPD. HD1 helicase motif I (residues 31–36) and 1a (50–60) occur before the 4FeS domain insertion followed by HD1 helicase motif II (177–186). The four Cys residues (88, 102, 105, and 137), which act as ligands to the 4Fe-4S cluster, are invariant with human XPD (Figure S1). The Arch domain insertion into HD1 occurs between helicase motifs II and III (317–327) (Figures S1 and S2). The placement of the four HD1 helicase motifs results in intimate connections between the ATP-binding and hydrolysis state of HD1 and the conformations of the 4FeS and Arch domains. The C-terminal HD2 contains the remaining three conserved helicase motifs IV (394–408), V (439–455), and VI (501–517). The composite ATP-binding site (motifs I, II, V, and VI) comes together at the HD1-HD2 interface cleft, as expected for the inchworm helicase mechanism whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis drives ssDNA translocation responsible for helicase activity (Singleton et al., 2007Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The SaXPD C terminus ends at the outside edge of HD2, suggesting the C-terminal region is an extension protruding from the XPDcc (Figures 1B and 1C), consistent with its role in protein interactions in other SF2 family helicases (Singleton et al., 2007Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Structure and mechanism of helicases and nucleic acid translocases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The HD1, 4FeS, and Arch domains lie in the same plane and thereby form a shallow pentagonal box shape (60 × 60 × 25 Å). The ellipsoidal HD2 is covalently connected to HD1 (Figures 1B, 1C, and S2) and packs primarily against HD1 (over a 30 × 25 Å interface) and against the Arch domain (15 × 15 Å interface) on one side of this box to create long deep grooves between HD2 and the remaining three domains. HD2 protrudes about 30 Å from the box to form prominent channels 25 Å long for ATP binding between HD2 and HD1, and 50 Å long for ssDNA binding between HD2 and the Arch and 4FeS domains (Figure 1B). In contrast, the side of the box facing away from HD2 is relatively flat except for a 20 Å diameter depression at the junction of the Arch and 4FeS domains suitable for binding one end of a dsDNA bubble. The 50-Å-long channel extending along the helicase motifs in HD2 is gated at both ends by the arch and HD2 gateways. The arch gateway is located under the arch formed between the Arch and 4FeS domains. The HD2 gateway lies between the Arch and HD2, and is formed partly by an HD2 helix-loop-helix insertion that extends outward to pack around the Arch domain. Each gateway has dimensions of about 10 × 10 × 10 Å, providing a possible means to sense bulky DNA damage. The SaXPD four-domain fold, domain insertions, relative domain orientations, and overall architecture are different from known helicase structures. The most similar existing helicase structure is UvrD, a helicase acting in the bacterial NER pathway (Lee and Yang, 2006Lee J.Y. Yang W. UvrD helicase unwinds DNA one base pair at a time by a two-part power stroke.Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The previously reported XPD structural model, which was built with rigorous comparative molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of the bacterial repair protein UvrB (Bienstock et al., 2003Bienstock R.J. Skorvaga M. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Structural and functional characterization of the human DNA repair helicase XPD by comparative molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of the bacterial repair protein UvrB.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is substantially different from the experimentally defined XPDcc (Figure S3). The Arch domain, named by its arch-shaped conformation, is a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet with two α helix pairs, one of which has an extended loop interacting with a loop from the 4FeS domain. The Arch domain inserts into the HD1 sequence immediately after helicase motif II and rejoins HD1 in the α helix preceding helicase motif III (Figures S1 and S2). The β sheet bridges between the HD1 fold and the Arch domain α helices, which give the domain its arched shape. The Arch domain is strategically positioned via its covalent connections to HD1 to join the ATP-binding helicase domain to the far edge of the HD2 motor helicase domain and also to form a small interface (about 15 × 15 Å) with the 4FeS domain to make an enclosed tunnel. This tunnel juxtaposes functionally conserved, charged residues from the Arch domain (R194, R259, and R278) with functionally conserved, charged, and aromatic side chains positioned by the 4FeS domain (K84, K103, Y139, and Y140), consistent with a ssDNA-binding role for the tunnel and Arch-4FeS domain interface. At the opposite face, the junction of the Arch domain with the 4FeS domain forms half of the 20 Å diameter depression on the otherwise relatively flat back face of the box. One consequence of the narrow depth and flat back of the arch is that only about six ssDNA bases would be buried from access to the approaching NER nuclease XPG, assuming XPG interactions with DNA resemble those for Fen-1 (Chapados et al., 2004Chapados B.R. Hosfield D.J. Han S. Qiu J. Yelent B. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Structural basis for FEN-1 substrate specificity and PCNA-mediated activation in DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2004; 116: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In such a situation, the DNA damage could still be accessible for XPA binding. Thus, this architecture could be relevant to damage access during NER. To characterize the native XPD 4Fe-4S cluster without oxidation, we grew crystals anaerobically and cryocooled them in liquid nitrogen for X-ray diffraction data collection. The experimental electron density for the SaXPD crystals grown anaerobically shows that the 67-residue 4FeS domain contains an 4Fe-4S cluster coordinated by four cysteine ligands (Cys88, Cys102, Cys105, and Cys137) (Figures 1D and S4). All four Fe ions are present based upon their five sigma peaks in unbiased omit maps (Figure S4), so we name this domain the 4FeS domain and the cluster the 4Fe-4S cluster. This 4Fe-4S cluster is sensitive to oxidation, and this redox sensitivity is increased by DNA substrates (data not shown), explaining the previous characterization of SaXPD with a 3Fe cluster (Rudolf et al., 2006Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. The DNA repair helicases XPD and FancJ have essential iron-sulfur domains.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and supporting a potential functional role for cluster oxidation in XPD functions. The existence of an oxygen-sensitive 4Fe-4S cluster also implies that previous biochemical XPD characterizations may reflect a combination of direct mutation effects and indirect effects complicated by the instability of the 4Fe-4S cluster and its associated domain. The 4FeS domain is composed of four helices connected by loops and stabilized by the interactions of four Cys ligands to the Fe ions. The first cysteine ligand (SaXPD Cys88) is located at the C terminus of a one-turn helix connected to HD1. The 13 residues between Fe ion ligands Cys88 and Cys102 form a loop (here named the Fe cluster loop [FCL]) with a one-turn helix near the middle. Fe ion ligands Cys102 and Cys105 reside at the N and C termini of another one-turn helix, respectively. Cys105 is connected by an extended loop and a helix to Cys137, which is located at the N terminus of a long helix connected back to HD1. The 4FeS domain structure characterized here appears characteristic of a helicase damage response family including FancJ. In our structure, two disease-causing mutation sites both cause similar defects in the 4Fe-4S cluster reinforcing its functional significance. The A349P mutation in FancJ, which can cause severe Fanconi anemia clinical symptoms (Levran et al., 2005Levran O. Attwooll C. Henry R.T. Milton K.L. Neveling K. Rio P. Batish S.D. Kalb R.

Genet. 2005; 37: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), would disrupt the hydrogen bond between the main-chain nitrogen and Fe ion ligand Cys137. Similarly, the XPD TTD mutation R112H (SaXPD K84) disrupts the charged side-chain hydrogen bond to Fe ion ligand Cys102 (Figure 1D). To test the structural importance of the 4Fe-4S cluster, we removed the cluster by soaking crystals in a cyrosolution containing ferricyanide under aerobic conditions. Although apo-XPD crystals diffracted to lower resolutions, we were able to solve and refine the apo-SaXPD structure to 3.0 Å resolution (Table 1). Loss of the Fe-S cluster induced four significant structural changes (Figure 1C). First, the average overall B factor increased from 41 to 107 Å2 (Table 1), suggesting the 4Fe-4S cluster has a role in maintaining the overall stability of the enzyme. Second, the 4FeS domain is disordered except for parts directly connected to HD1. Third, the Arch domain loop (residues 265–270) that forms an interface with the FCL is disordered showing the importance of the 4FeS domain in maintaining the arch and arch gateway. Fourth, the first eight residues at the N terminus also become dis"

In the Drosophila CNS, individual progenitors called neuroblasts are known to express a series of transcription factors endowing daughter neurons with different temporal identities. Here we show that Castor and Seven-Up, members of this temporal series, regulate key events in many different neuroblast lineages during late neurogenesis. First, they schedule a switch in the cell size and identity of neurons involving the targets Chinmo and Broad Complex. Second, they regulate the time at which neuroblasts undergo Prospero-dependent cell-cycle exit or Reaper/Hid/Grim-dependent apoptosis. Both types of progenitor termination require the combined action of a late phase of the temporal series and indirect feedforward via Castor targets such as Grainyhead and Dichaete. These studies identify the timing mechanism ending CNS proliferation and reveal how aging progenitors transduce bursts of transcription factors into long-lasting changes in cell proliferation and cell identity."

The stress-inducible p53 protein acts as a central signal transduction node in the apoptotic response to DNA damage, mainly through its ability to transactivate intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death-receptor) pathway genes (Vousden and Lu, 2002Vousden K.H. Lu X. Live or let die: the cell's response to p53.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). However, ample evidence supports the existence of p53-independent apoptotic responses to DNA damage. In Drosophila and mouse p53 null embryos, for example, several cell types undergo apoptosis in response to irradiation (IR), but with slower kinetics than p53+/+ cells (Frenkel et al., 1999Frenkel J.

Whether the p53-independent pathways identified in vitro operate in vivo remains an active field of investigation. Radio/chemoresistant p53 mutant human cancer cell lines can be induced to die after genotoxic stress by pharmacologic or RNAi targeting of DNA damage-response (DDR) kinases involved in intra-S and/or G2/M checkpoint control, including ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, Polo-like kinases (Plks) (reviewed in Castedo et al., 2004aCastedo M.

Cell death by mitotic catastrophe: a molecular definition.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2825-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), and most recently, the p38/MAPK-activated kinase MAPKAPK2 (MK-2) (Reinhardt et al., 2007Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. p53-deficient cells rely on ATM- and ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling through the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway for survival after DNA damage.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Such treatments might spare cells endowed with wild-type p53, presumably because their intact G1 checkpoint enables them to repair and thus survive DNA damage (Zhou and Bartek, 2004Zhou B.B.

Although the sensitization of—and selectivity for—p53 mutant cells is at the root of anticancer strategies that target DDR kinases, none of these concepts have been rigorously tested in an animal model, and the underlying cell death mechanism is unclear. To accelerate the discovery of physiologic p53-independent DDRs, we generated p53 mutant zebrafish lines for use in whole organism-based modifier genetic screens (Berghmans et al., 2005Berghmans S. Murphey R.D. Wienholds E. Neuberg D. Kutok J.L. Fletcher C.D. Morris J.P. Liu T.X. Schulte-Merker S. Kanki J.P. et al.tp53 mutant zebrafish develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.Proc.

Zebrafish faithfully recapitulate mammalian intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling (reviewed in Pyati et al., 2007Pyati U.J. Look A.T. Hammerschmidt M.

The zebrafish p53M214K allele (or p53e7, for mutation in exon 7) affects a conserved amino acid residue within a region of the DNA-binding domain corresponding to a mutational hotspot in human cancer, producing a transactivation-dead p53 variant. Homozygosity for p53e7 recapitulates key traits associated with p53 deficiency in mammalian systems, including a strong tumor-prone phenotype, lack of G1-checkpoint function, and widespread cellular radioresistance (Berghmans et al., 2005Berghmans S. Murphey R.D. Wienholds E. Neuberg D. Kutok J.L. Fletcher C.D. Morris J.P. Liu T.X. Schulte-Merker S. Kanki J.P. et al.tp53 mutant zebrafish develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Here we identify chk1 as a gene whose loss restores IR-induced apoptosis in live p53 mutant zebrafish embryos, and then use in vivo epistasis analyses to dissect the underlying mechanism. Unlike previously identified p53-independent apoptotic pathways, which restore caspase-3 activation downstream of defective p53, Chk1 depletion activates an ATM/ATR-caspase-2 axis that bypasses the mitochondrial and death-receptor pathways. We show that this “Chk1-suppressed” pathway can be triggered in p53-deficient or BCL2-overexpressing human tumor cells, providing a mechanistic rationale for the use of Chk1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. p53e7/e7 mutant zebrafish embryos are refractory to DNA damage-induced cell death, as demonstrated by a nearly complete lack of acridine orange (AO) labeling in the brain and spinal chord of live embryos examined 7.5 hr after whole-body IR delivered at 18 hr postfertilization (hpf) (Figures 1A and 2A). We used morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) to knock down eight zebrafish S- and G2-checkpoint kinases and two nonkinase checkpoint regulators (p21waf1/cip1 and smc1) in p53e7/e7 mutant embryos. We assessed the ability of each knockdown to restore cell death (AO reactivity) at 7.5 hr post-IR (hpIR). Single knockdowns of all genes tested, excluding plk2, plk3, and aurkb, radiosensitized p53 mutants with variable efficiency (Figures 1B and 1C). Whereas atm, atr, smg-1/atx, and chk2 deficiencies restored only minor AO reactivity averaging 1%–5% of the p53+/+ response, chk1 knockdown resulted in a staining pattern that closely resembled wild-type (87.7% of the p53+/+ response, p < 0.0001; see also Figures 2A and 2B). Enhanced IR-induced cytotoxicity resulted specifically from chk1 knockdown because (1) injections of a chk1 mismatch MO failed to radiosensitize p53 mutants (Figure 2A, bottom panels); (2) the chk1 MO resulted in a robust reduction of the endogenous Chk1 protein pool, correlating with impaired Chk1 activity (Figure 2C); and (3) a specific inhibitor of human Chk1, but not inhibitors of ATM or Chk2, phenocopied the effects of chk1 MO (see Figure 7). As would be expected from Chk1 loss, p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos lacked the IR-induced G2/M checkpoint (Figures S1A–S1D). chk1 MO also fully radiosensitized p53e6 (p53N168K) homozygotes (Berghmans et al., 2005Berghmans S.

Together, these results provide in vivo evidence that Chk1 depletion is sufficient to restore IR sensitivity to p53 mutant cells. Chk1 is essential for fly and mouse development, with homozygous null mutants succumbing to major cell cycle defects (Fogarty et al., 1997Fogarty P. Campbell S.D. Abu-Shumays R. Phalle B.S. Yu K.R.

We therefore tested whether the cytotoxicity of chk1 knockdown in zebrafish p53 mutants was strictly IR dependent. Indeed, chk1 depletion had no apparent effect on normal zebrafish development and viability, in either the p53+/+ or p53e7/e7 background (Figures 2A and 2D; compare bars 1 and 2 in Figure 2B). Western blots performed with an antizebrafish Chk1 antibody revealed a substantial knockdown of the protein (Figure 2C). Yet chk1 morphants harbored residual levels of Chk1 activity, as shown by weak but persistent levels of phosphorylated Cdc2 (Figure 2C). These results demonstrate that transient depletion, as opposed to persistent total loss (Liu et al., 2000Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. et al.Chk1 is an essential kinase that is regulated by Atr and required for the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), of Chk1 function, is tolerable by vertebrate cells in vivo and compatible with long-term organismal viability. Crucially, however (as already shown above), such transient downregulation is sufficient to restore the IR-induced cell-death response in p53 mutants (Figures 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B). Chk1 knockdown might restore a wild-type response to IR (that is, classical intrinsic apoptosis) (Kratz et al., 2006Kratz E. Eimon P.M. Mukhyala K. Stern H. Zha J. Strasser A. Hart R. Ashkenazi A. Functional characterization of the Bcl-2 gene family in the zebrafish.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or trigger a different cell-death program in p53 mutants. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first analyzed two hallmarks of apoptosis: TUNEL-positive DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3 (as well as electron micrographs) in embryos fixed at 7.5 hpIR. AO labeling of irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (Figures 1C and 2A) correlated with high levels of TUNEL labeling throughout the CNS, similar to findings in irradiated p53+/+ embryos (Figure 3A). Multiple cells in the irradiated CNS of p53+/+ and Chk1-depleted p53e7/e7 embryos also showed similar ultrastructural manifestations of apoptosis (e.g., chromatin compaction/segregation and cytoplasmic condensation; Figures 3C and S2). Surprisingly, however, while irradiated p53+/+ embryos exhibited strong immunostaining for active caspase-3, irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos did not and showed no increase in active caspase-3 levels compared to p53 single mutants, which were devoid of both TUNEL and active caspase-3 (Figures 3A and 3B). Thus, the p53-independent cell death-inducing DDR triggered by Chk1 depletion is a caspase-3-independent apoptotic pathway (see also Figure S2F). To determine the cell autonomy of the Chk1-antagonized pathway, we generated genetic chimeras (Figures 3D and S3). While p53e7/e7;chk1MO cells grafted into p53e7/e7 hosts often stained TUNEL-positive after IR (39%, n = 102), neighboring host cells did not (Figure 3E, upper panels). In the reciprocal experiment, p53e7/e7 cells transplanted into p53e7/e7;chk1MO hosts remained TUNEL negative within an otherwise TUNEL-positive environment (Figure 3E, lower panels). Therefore, IR-induced TUNEL reactivity of transplanted cells strictly depends on Chk1 dosage, occurs irrespective of the cellular environment, and has very little (if any) influence on neighboring cells. The Chk1-suppressed apoptotic DDR pathway thus functions in a cell-autonomous manner. To molecularly characterize the newly identified apoptotic pathway, we capitalized on the unique advantages of zebrafish embryos for in vivo epistasis analyses. Specifically, we knocked down or forced the expression of candidate pathway contributors in p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos and assessed the effects on IR-induced cell death using the AO assay. atm and atr single knockdowns severely impaired chk1 knockdown-mediated radiosensitization of zebrafish p53 mutants, indicating that ATM and ATR are nonredundantly required to activate the pathway after DNA damage (Figures 4A and 4B; 60% and 90% reductions in cell death levels, respectively). In contrast, single or combined knockdowns of p63 and/or p73 led to (at best) a ∼30% reduction in AO staining compared to control p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (Figure 4A). This attenuation was reminiscent of the effects of chk2 knockdown (Figure S4A, compare bars 3 and 5) and may reflect a role for p53-independent Chk2-p63/p73 apoptotic pathways (Bernassola et al., 2005Bernassola F. Oberst A. Melino G. Pandolfi P.P.

Prives C. p73 induction after DNA damage is regulated by checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in a subset of cell deaths in irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos. It is unlikely that these effects result from weaker MO efficiencies, because the chk2, p63, and p73 MOs lead to stronger gene knockdowns than the atm and atr MOs (Figures 2C and S5A–S5C; also see Rentzsch et al., 2003Rentzsch F. Kramer C. Hammerschmidt M. Specific and conserved roles of TAp73 during zebrafish development.Gene. 2003; 323: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inability of Chk2, p63, and p73 to account for the majority of cell death events in irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos implies that ATM and ATR operate predominantly within a novel apoptotic pathway, which we have designated “Chk1-suppressed pathway” (CS in Figure 7D). To test whether the mitochondrial apoptotic axis contributes to the Chk1-suppressed pathway, we first knocked down the proapoptotic BH3-only family member Puma. puma depletion did not significantly affect AO labeling of irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (Figures 4A and 4B) at a puma MO concentration that is otherwise sufficient to completely block IR-induced apoptosis in p53+/+ zebrafish embryos (Figure S6) (Kratz et al., 2006Kratz E. Eimon P.M. Mukhyala K. Stern H. Zha J. Strasser A. Hart R. Ashkenazi A. Functional characterization of the Bcl-2 gene family in the zebrafish.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, a dose of bcl-xl mRNA that completely blocked cell death 7.5 hpIR in wild-type embryos failed to affect the AO reactivity of irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (Figures 4D and 4E; p53+/+ + bcl-xl, 0.035% of the mean p53+/+ response; p53e7/e7;chk1MO + bcl-xl, ∼95% of the mean p53e7/e7;chk1MO response). casp9 knockdown also lacked an effect (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5E). Thus, two major regulators of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (Puma and Bcl-xL), as well as the main initiator and executioner caspases acting downstream of mitochondria (caspase-9 and caspase-3, see Figure 3), are dispensable for the Chk1-suppressed apoptotic pathway. The death-receptor axis bypasses the requirement for mitochondria and caspase-9, suggesting that it could contribute to the Chk1-suppressed pathway. In addition, a link between Chk1 loss and caspase-8 activation has recently been observed (Xiao et al., 2005Xiao Z. Xue J. Sowin T.J. Rosenberg S.H. Zhang H. A novel mechanism of checkpoint abrogation conferred by Chk1 downregulation.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Even so, the death-receptor pathway converges on caspase-3 activation via caspase-8 (Hengartner, 2000Hengartner M.O. The biochemistry of apoptosis.Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar). This caspase-3 recruitment contrasts with the caspase-3 independence of the pathway we identified, which, together with the established cell autonomy of the new pathway (Figure 3E), argues against a role for DNA damage-induced extrinsic signaling downstream of chk1 depletion. Indeed, the AO reactivity of p53e7/e7;chk1MO;casp8MO zebrafish embryos did not differ from that of p53e7/e7;chk1MO specimens (Figures 4A and S5D). Blocking death-receptor signaling with a fadd (Fas Associated protein with Death Domain) MO (Eimon et al., 2006Eimon P.M. Kratz E. Varfolomeev E. Hymowitz S.G. Stern H. Zha J. Ashkenazi A. Delineation of the cell-extrinsic apoptosis pathway in the zebrafish.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1619-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) also failed to affect AO staining (Figure 4A). Thus, extrinsic signaling—like mitochondrial signaling—does not appear to play an important role downstream of chk1 loss. The sole caspase whose depletion blocked the Chk1-suppressed pathway was caspase-2, a poorly characterized yet highly conserved caspase with features of both initiator and executioner caspases (Zhivotovsky and Orrenius, 2005Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Caspase-2 function in response to DNA damage.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In three separate experiments, p53e7/e7;chk1MO;casp2MO1 embryos consistently showed a mean 6-fold decrease in AO labeling compared with p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (∼16% of the mean p53e7/e7;chk1MO response, p < 0.0001; Figures 4A and 4B). casp2 MO1, which targets the splice donor site of intron 4, led to marked reductions in casp2 mRNA levels and to aberrant residual transcripts lacking exon 4 (Figure 4C). A second casp2 MO reduced IR-induced death in p53e7/e7;chk1MO embryos (Figure S5F and S5G), and a mismatch version of casp2 MO1 had no effect (data not shown). Altogether, these epistasis analyses identify a novel atm/atr-casp2 apoptotic program as a key mechanism through which Chk1 depletion radiosensitizes p53 mutant zebrafish embryos without recruiting the classical mitochondrial and death-receptor pathways (Figure 7D). We next investigated whether the DNA damage-induced apoptotic pathway suppressed by Chk1 in zebrafish is conserved in human cancer cells defective in p53 signaling. To inhibit Chk1 in these cells, we used the indolocarbazole small molecule Gö6976 (Kohn et al., 2003Kohn E.A. Yoo C.J. Eastman A. The protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976 is a potent inhibitor of DNA damage-induced S and G2 cell cycle checkpoints.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar), which has greater specificity than the commonly used Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 (reviewed in Kawabe, 2004Kawabe T. G2 checkpoint abrogators as anticancer drugs.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 513-519PubMed Google Scholar and see below). In HeLa cells (in which the p53 protein pool is depleted by HPV-18 E6), caspase-2 cleavage was readily apparent at 24 hpIR in the presence of Gö6976 (Figure 5A). This effect was synergistic because neither IR nor Gö6976 alone caused substantial increases in cleaved caspase-2 levels compared to basal levels observed in control cells. In addition, caspase-2 cleavage tightly correlated with a strong radiosensitizing effect (∼50% increase in cell death; Figure 5B, compare bars 5 and 6; see also Figures 5J, 5K, and 6C). By contrast, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 in Gö6976-treated cells at 24 hpIR were negligible and did not differ from those observed in irradiated cells not exposed to the inhibitor (Figure 5A). Furthermore, both caspase-2 cleavage and concomitant cellular radiosensitization were insensitive to overexpression of human BCL2, whereas caspase-3 cleavage was completely removed in this context (Figures 5A and 5B, compare bars 7 and 8). Synergistic activation of caspase-2 by Gö6976 and IR did not elicit or involve cytochrome c release from the mitochondria at 24 hpIR (Figure 5C). Together, these findings demonstrate that Chk1 inhibition and IR synergize to activate caspase-2 and trigger BCL2- and mitochondria-independent cell death in p53-defective human cells, consistent with our zebrafish data. Before testing whether caspase-2 is required for cell-death induction, we verified the specificity of Gö6976 as an inhibitor of Chk1. CHK1 siRNA, but not a LACZ control siRNA, induced caspase-2 cleavage in concert with IR at 24 hr posttreatment but did not stimulate caspase-3 processing at this stage, in accord with the effects of Gö6976 (Figure 5D). Furthermore, while Gö6976 inhibited Chk1 in a dose-dependent manner, it did not impair MK-2 activity (Figure 5E), in contrast with UCN-01 (Reinhardt et al., 2007Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A. Yaffe M.B. p53-deficient cells rely on ATM- and ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling through the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway for survival after DNA damage.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 175-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To test whether caspase-2 is required for Gö6976-mediated HeLa cell killing after IR, we used three independent CASP2 shRNAs that produced strong and specific knockdowns (Figure 5G). Each shRNA significantly reduced apoptosis induction at 48 hr after IR + Gö6976 treatment, but not after IR treatment alone (Figure 5H; see also Figures 5J and 5K). In contrast, the reduction in apoptosis observed upon CASP3 knockdown at 48 hr (stage at which caspase-3 is eventually cleaved) was independent of Gö6976, as CASP3 shRNA led to a similar attenuation after IR treatment alone (Figure 5H). The severity of the apoptotic blockades caused by the CASP2 shRNAs (20%–45% reductions, p < 0.01 for each) correlated with their respective knockdown efficiencies (Figures 5G and 5H). Altogether, these results demonstrate that caspase-2—but not caspase-3—is specifically required for the increase in IR-induced apoptosis observed in Chk1-inhibited human cancer cells, similar to its requirement in irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO zebrafish embryos. If the ATM/ATR-caspase-2 apoptotic axis in zebrafish is well conserved in human cells, ATM and ATR should be activated after Chk1 inhibition in irradiated HeLa cells, similar to caspase-2. Indeed, IR + Gö6976 treatment led to synergistic increases in phosphorylated Chk2 at Thr68 (readout for ATM activity) and phosphorylated Chk1 at Ser317 (readout for ATR activity) (Figure 5I). Elevated ATM and ATR activities correlated with increased levels of DNA damage in the IR + Gö6976-treated cells, as indicated by an increased abundance of phosphorylated H2A.X (Figure 5I). Even though Chk2 was strongly activated in this context (Figure 5I), a specific CHK2 siRNA failed to block caspase-2 activation (Figures S4B and S4C). This result substantiates our prediction (based on epistasis analyses in zebrafish) that the Chk1-suppressed pathway is Chk2 independent. Taken together, our experiments in HeLa cells show that apoptosis after IR + Gö6976 treatment of human cells involves ATM and ATR activation, is independent of Chk2, Bcl-2, mitochondria, and caspase-3, but requires caspase-2 activation and function (Figure 7D). Thus, the zebrafish Chk1-suppressed pathway is evolutionarily conserved in human cancer cells. MK-2 depleted Tp53−/− MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) undergo DNA damage-induced apoptosis exclusively during mitosis (Reinhardt et al., 2007Reinhardt H.C. Aslanian A.S. Lees J.A.

In contrast, pH3/TUNEL double-labeling of irradiated p53e7/e7;chk1MO zebrafish embryos indicates that Chk1-suppressed apoptosis operates pre"

XPD has a 5′ to 3′ polarity and the helicase activity is dependent on an iron-sulfur cluster binding domain, a feature that is conserved in related helicases such as FancJ. The xpd gene is the target of mutation in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne's syndrome, characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from cancer susceptibility to neurological and developmental defects. The 2.25 Å crystal structure of XPD from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii, presented here together with detailed biochemical analyses, allows a molecular understanding of the structural basis for helicase activity and explains the phenotypes of xpd mutations in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2103447376,"Capping protein (CP) is an integral component of Arp2/3-nucleated actin networks that drive amoeboid motility. Increasing the concentration of capping protein, which caps barbed ends of actin filaments and prevents elongation, increases the rate of actin-based motility in vivo and in vitro. We studied the synergy between CP and Arp2/3 using an in vitro actin-based motility system reconstituted from purified proteins. We find that capping protein increases the rate of motility by promoting more frequent filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex and not by increasing the rate of filament elongation as previously suggested. One consequence of this coupling between capping and nucleation is that, while the rate of motility depends strongly on the concentration of CP and Arp2/3, the net rate of actin assembly is insensitive to changes in either factor. By reorganizing their architecture, dendritic actin networks harness the same assembly kinetics to drive different rates of motility."
https://openalex.org/W2164219864,"Developmental mechanisms that yield multicellular diversity are proving to be well conserved within lineages, generating interest in their origins in unicellular ancestors. We report that molecular regulation of the haploid-diploid transition in Chlamydomonas, a unicellular green soil alga, shares common ancestry with differentiation pathways in land plants. Two homeoproteins, Gsp1 and Gsm1, contributed by gametes of plus and minus mating types respectively, physically interact and translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus upon gametic fusion, initiating zygote development. Their ectopic expression activates zygote development in vegetative cells and, in a diploid background, the resulting zygotes undergo a normal meiosis. Gsm1/Gsp1 dyads share sequence homology with and are functionally related to KNOX/BELL dyads regulating stem-cell (meristem) specification in land plants. We propose that combinatorial homeoprotein-based transcriptional control, a core feature of the fungal/animal radiation, may have originated in a sexual context and enabled the evolution of land-plant body plans."
https://openalex.org/W1979565277,"We show that miR-1, a conserved muscle-specific microRNA, regulates aspects of both pre- and postsynaptic function at C. elegans neuromuscular junctions. miR-1 regulates the expression level of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits (UNC-29 and UNC-63), thereby altering muscle sensitivity to acetylcholine (ACh). miR-1 also regulates the muscle transcription factor MEF-2, which results in altered presynaptic ACh secretion, suggesting that MEF-2 activity in muscles controls a retrograde signal. The effect of the MEF-2-dependent retrograde signal on secretion is mediated by the synaptic vesicle protein RAB-3. Finally, acute activation of levamisole-sensitive nAChRs stimulates MEF-2-dependent transcriptional responses and induces the MEF-2-dependent retrograde signal. We propose that miR-1 refines synaptic function by coupling changes in muscle activity to changes in presynaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2161074428,"Dosage compensation, mediated by the MSL complex, regulates X-chromosomal gene expression in Drosophila. Here we report that the histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) specific histone acetyltransferase MOF displays differential binding behavior depending on whether the target gene is located on the X chromosome versus the autosomes. More specifically, on the male X chromosome, where MSL1 and MSL3 are preferentially associated with the 3' end of dosage compensated genes, MOF displays a bimodal distribution binding to promoters and the 3' ends of genes. In contrast, on MSL1/MSL3 independent X-linked genes and autosomal genes in males and females, MOF binds primarily to promoters. Binding of MOF to autosomes is functional, as H4K16 acetylation and the transcription levels of a number of genes are affected upon MOF depletion. Therefore, MOF is not only involved in the onset of dosage compensation, but also acts as a regulator of gene expression in the Drosophila genome."
https://openalex.org/W1972836029,"Background and Aims Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to gluten prolamins from wheat, barley, rye and, in some patients, oats. Partially digested gluten peptides produced in the digestive tract cause inflammation of the small intestine. High throughput, immune-based assays using monoclonal antibodies specific for these immunotoxic peptides would facilitate their detection in food and enable monitoring of their enzymatic detoxification. Two monoclonal antibodies, G12 and A1, were developed against a highly immunotoxic 33-mer peptide. The potential of each antibody for quantifying food toxicity for celiac patients was studied. Methods Epitope preferences of G12 and A1 antibodies were determined by ELISA with gluten-derived peptide variants of recombinant, synthetic or enzymatic origin. Results The recognition sequences of G12 and A1 antibodies were hexameric and heptameric epitopes, respectively. Although G12 affinity for the 33-mer was superior to A1, the sensitivity for gluten detection was higher for A1. This observation correlated to the higher number of A1 epitopes found in prolamins than G12 epitopes. Activation of T cell from gluten digested by glutenases decreased equivalently to the detection of intact peptides by A1 antibody. Peptide recognition of A1 included gliadin peptides involved in the both the adaptive and innate immunological response in celiac disease. Conclusions The sensitivity and epitope preferences of the A1 antibody resulted to be useful to detect gluten relevant peptides to infer the potential toxicity of food for celiac patients as well as to monitor peptide modifications by transglutaminase 2 or glutenases."
https://openalex.org/W1977393886,"Since p53 was cloned and subsequently characterized as a tumor suppressor more the 20 years ago, more than 40,000 publications have been published relating to this protein. A great majority of this scientific literature focuses on the intricate details of p53 regulation by posttranslational modifications. Phosphorylation, the first posttranslational modification of p53 identified, was established as a positive regulator of p53 via modification at multiple sites by an ever-growing number of kinases activated by numerous stress signals. Subsequently, acetylation and ubiquitination have been established as major regulators of p53 by regulating p53 transcriptional activity and stability, respectively. More recently, other modifications, such as sumoylation, neddylation, methylation, and glycosylation, have been reported. Although the cellular effects of many modifications are established, mouse models using site-specific knockin approaches imply that some of these modifications are to some degree redundant. These findings raise the possibility that aspects of the p53 posttranslational regulatory network are redundant yet indispensable for exact and precise control of p53 activity upon stress-induced stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2166003347,"Background The HLA genes, located in the MHC region on chromosome 6p21.3, play an important role in many autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease (CD), type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and others. Known HLA variants that confer risk to CD, for example, include DQA1*05/DQB1*02 (DQ2.5) and DQA1*03/DQB1*0302 (DQ8). To diagnose the majority of CD patients and to study disease susceptibility and progression, typing these strongly associated HLA risk factors is of utmost importance. However, current genotyping methods for HLA risk factors involve many reactions, and are complicated and expensive. We sought a simple experimental approach using tagging SNPs that predict the CD-associated HLA risk factors. Methodology Our tagging approach exploits linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the CD-associated HLA risk factors DQ2.5 and DQ8 that indicate direct risk, and DQA1*0201/DQB1*0202 (DQ2.2) and DQA1*0505/DQB1*0301 (DQ7) that attribute to the risk of DQ2.5 to CD. To evaluate the predictive power of this approach, we performed an empirical comparison of the predicted DQ types, based on these six tag SNPs, with those executed with current validated laboratory typing methods of the HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1 genes in three large cohorts. The results were validated in three European celiac populations. Conclusion Using this method, only six SNPs were needed to predict the risk types carried by >95% of CD patients. We determined that for this tagging approach the sensitivity was >0.991, specificity >0.996 and the predictive value >0.948. Our results show that this tag SNP method is very accurate and provides an excellent basis for population screening for CD. This method is broadly applicable in European populations."
https://openalex.org/W2032339964,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is an extremely malignant neoplasm in the central nervous system (CNS) which occurs in infancy and childhood. Recent studies suggested that CD133 could be considered a marker for brain cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). However, the role of CD133 in AT/RT has never been investigated. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (CD133(+)), found to have the potential to differentiate into three germ layer tissues, from tissues of nine AT/RT patients. The migration/invasion/malignancy and radioresistant capabilities of CD133(+) were significantly augmented when compared to CD133(-). The clinical data showed that the amount of CD133(+) in AT/RTs correlated positively with the degree of resistance to radiation therapy. Using cDNA microarray analysis, the genotoxic-response profiles of CD133(+) and CD133(-) irradiated with 10 Gy ionizing radiation (IR) were analyzed 0.5, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h post-IR. We then validated these microarray data and showed increased phosphorylation after IR of p-ATM, p-RAD17, and p-CHX2 as well as increased expression of BCL-2 protein in CD133(+) compared to CD133(-). Furthermore, we found that CD133(+) can effectively resist IR with cisplatin- and/or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the up-regulated expression of p-ATM and BCL-2 proteins in IR-treated CD133(+) xenotransgrafts in SCID mice but not in IR-treated CD133(-). Importantly, the effect of IR in CD133(+) transplanted mice can be significantly improved by a combination of BCL-2 siRNA with debromohymenialdisine, an inhibitor of checkpoint kinases. In sum, this is the first report indicating that CD133(+) AT/RT cells demonstrate the characteristics of CSCs. The IR-resistant and anti-apoptotic properties in CD133(+) may reflect the clinical refractory malignancy of AT/RTs and thus the activated p-ATM pathway and BCL-2 expression in CD133(+) could be possible targets to improve future treatment of deadly diseases like AT/RT."
https://openalex.org/W1997022064,"Azhdarchid pterosaurs were among the most widespread and successful of pterosaur clades, but their paleoecology remains controversial. Morphological features common to all azhdarchids include a long, shallow rostrum; elongate, cylindrical cervical vertebrae that formed a long and unusually inflexible neck; and proportionally short wings with an abbreviated fourth phalanx. While azhdarchids have been imagined as vulture-like scavengers, sediment probers, swimmers, waders, aerial predators, or stork-like generalists, most recent authors have regarded them as skim-feeders, trawling their lower jaws through water during flight and seizing aquatic prey from the water's surface. Although apparently widely accepted, the skim-feeding model lacks critical support from anatomy and functional morphology. Azhdarchids lack the many cranial specialisations exhibited by extant skim-feeding birds, most notably the laterally compressed lower jaw and shock absorbing apparatus required for this feeding style. Well-preserved azhdarchid skulls are rare, but their rostra and lower jaws appear to have been sub-triangular in cross-section, and thus dissimilar to those of skim-feeders and sediment probers. Taphonomic data indicates that azhdarchids predominately inhabited inland settings, and azhdarchid morphology indicates that they were poorly suited for all proposed lifestyles bar wading and terrestrial foraging. However, azhdarchid footprints show that their feet were relatively small, padded and slender, and thus not well suited for wading. We argue that azhdarchids were stork- or ground hornbill-like generalists, foraging in diverse environments for small animals and carrion. Proficient terrestrial abilities and a relatively inflexible neck are in agreement with this interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2010104992,"Background In mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, a lysosomal storage disease causing early onset mental retardation in children, the production of abnormal oligosaccharidic fragments of heparan sulfate is associated with severe neuropathology and chronic brain inflammation. We addressed causative links between the biochemical, pathological and inflammatory disorders in a mouse model of this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings In cell culture, heparan sulfate oligosaccharides activated microglial cells by signaling through the Toll-like receptor 4 and the adaptor protein MyD88. CD11b positive microglial cells and three-fold increased expression of mRNAs coding for the chemokine MIP1α were observed at 10 days in the brain cortex of MPSIIIB mice, but not in MPSIIIB mice deleted for the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 or the adaptor protein MyD88, indicating early priming of microglial cells by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides in the MPSIIIB mouse brain. Whereas the onset of brain inflammation was delayed for several months in doubly mutant versus MPSIIIB mice, the onset of disease markers expression was unchanged, indicating similar progression of the neurodegenerative process in the absence of microglial cell priming by heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. In contrast to younger mice, inflammation in aged MPSIIIB mice was not affected by TLR4/MyD88 deficiency. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate priming of microglia by HS oligosaccharides through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Although intrinsic to the disease, this phenomenon is not a major determinant of the neurodegenerative process. Inflammation may still contribute to neurodegeneration in late stages of the disease, albeit independent of TLR4/MyD88. The results support the view that neurodegeneration is primarily cell autonomous in this pediatric disease."

However, for inventories to be immediately relevant, the taxonomic process must reduce the time to describe and identify specimens. To address these concerns for the inventory of arthropods across the Malagasy region, we present here a collaborative approach to taxonomy where collectors, morphologists and DNA barcoders using cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) participate collectively in a team-driven taxonomic process. We evaluate the role of DNA barcoding as a tool to accelerate species identification and description. This revision is primarily based on arthropod surveys throughout the Malagasy region from 1992 to 2006. The revision is based on morphological and CO1 DNA barcode analysis of 500 individuals. In the region, five species of Anochetus (A. boltonisp. nov., A. goodmanisp. nov., A. grandidieri, and A. madagascarensis from Madagascar, and A. pattersonisp. nov. from Seychelles) and three species of Odontomachus (O. coquereli, O. troglodytes and O. simillimus) are recognized. DNA barcoding (using cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1)) facilitated caste association and type designation, and highlighted population structure associated with reproductive strategy, biogeographic and evolutionary patterns for future exploration. This study provides an example of collaborative taxonomy, where morphology is combined with DNA barcoding. We demonstrate that CO1 DNA barcoding is a practical tool that allows formalized alpha-taxonomy at a speed, detail, precision, and scale unattainable by employing morphology alone."

OtV5 is a lytic phycodnavirus which unexpectedly does not degrade its host chromosomes before the host cell bursts. Analysis of its complete genome sequence confirmed that it lacks expected site-specific endonucleases, and revealed the presence of 16 genes whose predicted functions are novel to this group of viruses. OtV5 carries at least one predicted gene whose protein closely resembles its host counterpart and several other host-like sequences, suggesting that horizontal gene transfers between host and viral genomes may occur frequently on an evolutionary scale. Fifty seven percent of the 268 predicted proteins present no similarities with any known protein in Genbank, underlining the wealth of undiscovered biological diversity present in oceanic viruses, which are estimated to harbour 200Mt of carbon."

A distinctive feature of NPM1 mutants in AML is their aberrant localization to the cytoplasm of leukemic cells (NPMc+ AML) (25Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R. Pasqualucci L. La Starza R. Diverio D. Colombo E. Santucci A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Pucciarini A. Liso A. Vignetti M. Fazi P. Meani N. Pettirossi V. Saglio G. Mandelli F. Lo-Coco F. Pelicci P.G. Martelli M.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Two consequences of mutation-related sequence changes at the C terminus of NPM1 promote aberrant cytoplasmic localization of mutant NPM1 proteins in NPMc+ AML. First, generation of an additional leucine-rich nuclear export motif reinforces Crm1 (XpoI)-dependent nuclear export of NPM1 leukemic mutants (26Nakagawa M. Kameoka Y. Suzuki R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1819-1820PubMed Google Scholar). Second, there is loss of tryptophan residues Trp288 and Trp290 (or Trp290 alone) that determine NPM1 nucleolar localization (25Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R. Pasqualucci L. La Starza R. Diverio D. Colombo E. Santucci A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Pucciarini A. Liso A. Vignetti M. Fazi P. Meani N. Pettirossi V. Saglio G.

Biochem. 2002; 66: 2239-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the steady state distribution of NPM1 are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NPM1 tryptophans Trp288 and Trp290 are critical structural components of an independently folded domain that is essential for nucleolar targeting of NPM1. These studies provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying NPMc+ AML. Reagents—Mutants NPM1 W288A/W290A and NPM1 F268A/F276A were made by site-directed mutagenesis and mutants A and E by PCR using appropriate primers. NPM1 C-terminal domain variants, with the exception of mutant A, were cloned into a modified pRSETA vector (Invitrogen) expressing the protein fused to a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable His6-tagged lipoyl domain from Bacillus stearothermophilus. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain C41 and purified using Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography. Fusion proteins were cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease digestion and removed in a second affinity step before concentration and final purification by size exclusion chromatography on a GF30 column (Amersham Biosciences). For isotopic labeling, K-MOPS minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and/or [13C]glucose was used. Mutant A C-terminal domain was made using a Liberty CEM microwave peptide synthesizer (Matthews, NC) and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) /t-butyl chemistry and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. All C-terminal constructs have an additional two glycine residues at the N terminus as a result of the cloning and purification strategy; residue numbering is in context of the full-length protein and omits these glycines. SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to confirm proteins were of the expected mass and to assess their purity. Protein concentration was determined spectroscopically using a Varian Cary 500 spectrometer (Varian, NC), and extinction coefficients were calculated for 280 nm (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar, 30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). All reagents were purchased from Sigma and were Anal-R grade or higher, except for isotopically enriched reagents, which were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Cambridge, UK). Spectroscopic Measurements—The NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance-800, Advance-II+ 700, and Advance-600 spectrometers. Two-dimensional NOESY, TOCSY, DQF-COSY, 15N-HSQC, constant time 13C-HSQC and 13C-TOCSY were recorded at 298 K. The mixing times chosen were 80 ms for TOCSY and 120 ms for NOESY. Spectra were referenced relative to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate for signals of proton and carbon, or liquid ammonium for that of nitrogen. Approximately half the Hb resonances were assigned stereospecifically using a combination of HNHB and DQF-COSY spectra. All the Val(Hγ) and Leu(Hδ) resonances were assigned stereospecifically using a 10% 13C-labeled sample of NPM1 C-terminal domain (31Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). All the NMR spectra were analyzed with Sparky (32Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2007Google Scholar). All samples used for structure determination were 1.2 mm and prepared in 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, and 5% D2O (homonuclear samples were in a deuterated version of this buffer). For hydrogen exchange experiments, the 15N-labeled NPM1 C-terminal domain was exchanged into NMR buffer containing 100% D2O using a NAP-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and a series of 1H-15N-FHSQC spectra (33Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar) were recorded over the course of 6 h. All one-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were conducted in biophysics buffer (10 mm KPi, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% D2O). Structure Determination—The distance constraints derived from the NOESY spectra were classified into four categories corresponding to inter-proton distance constraints of 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.5, 1.8-4.75, and 1.8-6.0 Å, respectively. Hydrogen bond constraints of 1.8-2.1 Å were imposed on the distance between the hydrogen and the acceptor oxygen, whereas another constraint of 2.7-3.1 Å was imposed on the distance between the donor nitrogen and the acceptor oxygen. Torsion angle constraints were obtained from stereospecific assignment of residue side chains and incorporated in the structure calculation, along with the backbone φ and ψ angle constraints determined with the program TALOS (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The structures were calculated using a standard torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol with the program CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). 150 structures were accepted out of 150, produced with no distance violations greater than 0.25 Å, and no angle violations greater than 5°. Of these the 20 lowest energy structures were selected for presentation and statistical representation. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of NPM1 were recorded between 260 and 190 nm at 30-60 μm in the biophysics buffer using a Jasco-J815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) and a 1-mm path length cuvette. The base line due to the buffer only was recorded and subtracted prior to normalizing the data for concentration. Thermal denaturation was followed at 222 nm with heating from 277 to 371 K at a rate of 1 K·min-1. Data were fit to a standard two-state denaturation as described elsewhere (36Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Spectral Methods of Characterizing Protein Conformation and Conformational Changes. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989: 251-285Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Full-length NPM1 variants were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). NPM1 variants were thus expressed in vivo with an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag. NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium GlutaMAX™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A day before transfection a confluent flask of cells was subcultured at a 1:8 dilution in 6-well plates containing glass coverslips. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h coverslips were removed, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to blocking for 30 min with 20% fetal calf serum, 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS (FATS). Cells were stained with mouse anti-fibrillarin (ab4566, AbCam, UK) at 1:500 in FATS for 1 h. After three washes with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated in the dark for 1 h with Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) at 1:200 in FATS. The coverslips were dried in air and mounted using Fluoromount-G™ (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Images were collected using an MRC-2000 plus confocal apparatus (Bio-Rad) mounted on a Nikon eclipse E800 microscope using the ×60 oil objective lens. The Structure of the NPM1 C-terminal Domain—Manual inspection of the sequence of NPM1, with assistance from the secondary structure prediction tool Jpred (37Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), indicated the potential for three short helices separated by short loops within the last 50 residues. This potential domain is separated from the N-terminal oligomerization domain by an ∼120-residue acid-rich region that is predicted to be disordered. The DNA sequence corresponding to residues 243-294 of NPM1 was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Inspection by SDS-PAGE and electrospray-mass spectrometry following purification identified a pure protein of the expected mass. Both one-dimensional 1H NMR and 15N-HSQC experiments produced well dispersed spectra that are characteristic of a folded protein (Fig. 3A). The NMR spectra of residues Ser243 to Leu294 of NPM1 were assigned, and the solution structure was determined using standard techniques (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acid. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 39Bax A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 738-744Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Residues 244-294 adopt a well defined tertiary structure with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for backbone atoms (Fig. 1A). Experimental restraints and structural statistics for the 20 accepted lowest energy structures are summarized in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab The C-terminal domain of NPM1 forms a well defined right-handed 3-helix bundle (Fig. 1B). Helix 1 is formed of residues Val244 to Glu256, with Lys257 and Gly258 then forming an H-bonded turn into the first loop Gly259-Pro264. Helix 2 runs from Glu265 to Phe276 until the second loop of Arg277-Asp280, and helix 3 is composed of residues Gln281 to Lys292. The core of the protein is formed largely by aromatic residues (Tyr271, Phe268, Phe276, Trp288, and Trp290) with further contribution from residues Met251, Ile255, Leu261, Val272, and Leu287. Sequence alignment of homologous proteins (Fig. 2D) reveals the hydrophobic core is largely conserved, with Trp288, Trp290, and Phe268 and Phe276 strictly conserved. Deletions, seen in the more distantly related proteins from Lytechinus pictus and Asterina pectinifera, are confined solely to loop 1, and it is highly likely that the fold is conserved throughout these species. Other residues strictly conserved are Pro262, which ends loop 1, and three lysines as follows: Lys263 and Lys267 cluster on the surface of the protein, whereas Lys248 appears to form a salt bridge with Asp286 (Fig. 2C) and may be structurally important. The NPM1 C-terminal domain has no significant sequence similarity to any protein or domain, but a search for structurally similar proteins using the program DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) returned several matches, among which the most significant single domain protein was the recently published archaeal ribosomal protein S17e (41Wu B. Yee A. Huang Y.J. Ramelot T.A. Cort J.R. Semesi A. Jung J.W. Lee W. Montelione G.T. Kennedy M.A. Arrowsmith C.H. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Effect of the Leukemia Mutations on the Structure of the NPM1 C-terminal Domain—NPMc+ mutations alter the sequence of the C terminus of the third helix in the structure. In the most common mutation, mutant A, the wild-type sequence WQWRKSL is replaced by the sequence CLAVEEVSLRK, whereas in the less common mutant E it is replaced with WQS-LAQVSLRK (Fig. 3C). Several of the altered residues are at the interface between helix 3 and helices 2 and 1 and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the domain. In the NPMc+ mutants, these residues are replaced by smaller amino acids, and this would be predicted to greatly destabilize the domain. To test this hypothesis, we used NMR spectroscopy. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of both mutants A and E show a decrease in dispersion compared with NPM1wt (Fig. 3A), indicative of a loss of tertiary structure. Fig. 3B shows the CD spectra of NPM1wt and mutants A and E as a function of temperature. NPM1wt describes a sigmoidal unfolding transition typical of a folded protein, whereas mutant A shows no evidence of any such transition and yields a trace similar to that expected from an unstructured protein. Mutant E shows an intermediate response; there is evidence of a transition, but the protein never appears to fully occupy the folded state of the wild type. These results suggest that the mutations found in AML lead to the destabilization of the C-terminal globular domain of NPM1. Mutant A, which lacks both Trp288 and Trp290, has no residual regular secondary structure. Interestingly, mutant E (in which Trp288 is retained), although largely destabilized, is clearly not completely unstructured. This mutant may retain some ability to localize NPM1 to the nucleolus, and this could explain why it has a stronger nuclear export signal than mutant A (42Bolli N. Nicoletti I. De Marco M.F. Bigerna B. Pucciarini A. Mannucci R. Martelli M.P. Liso A. Mecucci C. Fabbiano F. Martelli M.F. Henderson B.R. Falini B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6230-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which itself is completely unfolded. A Folded C-terminal Domain Is Required for Nucleolar Targeting—Expressing NPM1 as an eGFP fusion in mammalian cells allows for the direct observation of its subcellular localization (43Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this manner the mutation of Trp288 and Trp290 to alanine in NPM1 has been shown to lead to loss of nucleolar localization and the accumulation of the protein in the nucleus (27Falini B. Bolli N. Shan J. Martelli M.P. Liso A. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Pasqualucci L. Mannucci R. Rosati R. Gorello P. Diverio D. Roti G. Tiacci E. Cazzaniga G. Biondi A. Schnittger S. Haferlach T. Hiddemann W. Martelli M.F. Gu W. Mecucci C. Nicoletti I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4514-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Nishimura Y. Ohkubo T. Furuichi Y. Umekawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 2239-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date it has not been clear how these residues contributed to the direction of NPM1 to the nucleolus. We have shown that Trp288 and Trp290 are part of the hydrophobic core of a folded domain (Fig. 2A), and it would be expected that their mutation would lead to a loss of structure. Indeed, the NPM1 C-terminal domain with Trp288 and Trp290 mutated to alanine lacks any distinct tertiary structure (as judged by one-dimensional 1H NMR; see Fig. 3A) and does not undergo a cooperative unfolding transition when heated (Fig. 3B). This would suggest that mutation of these residues prevents nucleolar localization simply by preventing the correct folding of the C-terminal domain of NPM1. To test this hypothesis, we decided to make other mutations in the C-terminal domain that would be expected to disrupt its structure while retaining the tryptophans. To this end we chose to mutate phenylalanines 268 and 276 to alanine (F268A and F276A) as these residues are also strictly conserved, large hydrophobic residues that pack at the interfaces of the helices and make many contacts within the core (Fig. 2B, and compared with Fig. 2A). As expected the NPM1 domain containing the F268A/F276A mutations lacks any distinct tertiary structure (Fig. 3A). We next examined the effects of these mutations on subcellular localization by transfecting full-length green fluorescent protein-tagged NPM1 F268A/F276A into NIH-3T3 cells. The mutant eGFP-NPM1 F268A/F276A is nuclear and excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 4), thus proving that nucleolar localization is a property of the C-terminal domain as a whole. It has been reported by Falini et al. (27Falini B. Bolli N. Shan J. Martelli M.P. Liso A. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Pasqualucci L. Mannucci R. Rosati R. Gorello P. Diverio D. Roti G. Tiacci E. Cazzaniga G. Biondi A. Schnittger S. Haferlach T. Hiddemann W. Martelli M.F. Gu W. Mecucci C. Nicoletti I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4514-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that re-inserting Trp288 and Trp290 into mutant A leads to complete relocalization to the nucleolus. We investigated the C terminus of this mutant A C288W/A290W construct and found it to be folded, as judged by CD and NMR. Presumably, refolding the C terminus of mutant A allows it carry on its normal function within the nucleolus while making the nuclear export signal unavailable to the export machinery. Hence, to better distinguish the role of the NES from nucleolar targeting, we added the nuclear export signal from mutant A (LAVEEVSLRK) to the end of wild-type C-terminal domain with a GGS linker and found the full-length construct to be nucleolar. This indicates that a loss of structure and the addition of a nuclear export signal are necessary to cause the aberrant cytoplasmic localization observed in NPMc+ AML. Functionally Important Residues in the C-terminal Domain of NPM1—Within the C-terminal domain of NPM1 lysine residues 248, 263, and 267 are strictly conserved and surface-exposed (Fig. 5), thus indicating their potential as functionally important residues. To examine this, these residues were mutated to alanine, and the effects on domain stability and nucleolar localization were monitored. Although Lys248 is surface-exposed, it appears to form a long range salt bridge with Asp286. Indeed the mutation K248A significantly destabilizes the domain and as such leads to Lys248 being classified as structurally important as opposed to being directly functional (data not shown). Lysines 263 and 267 cluster and orientate freely on the surface of the domain (Fig. 5, and as judged by a lack of side chain nuclear Overhauser effects), and mutation of either Lys263 or Lys267, or both, increases the stability of the domain in line with the previously described effects of removing unpaired surface charges (44Serrano L. Horovitz A. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9343-9352Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Once established as not structurally detrimental, the nucleolar localization of the full-length NPM1 mutants K263A, K267A, and the double mutant K263A/K267A was studied in vivo. Mutant K263A was partially delocalized to the nucleoplasm, and K267A and the double mutant were completely delocalized (Fig. 6). As a control, the freely orienting surface lysine Lys250 was also mutated. The C-terminal mutant K250A was, predictably, more stable than the wild-type domain yet had no significant effect on nucleolar localization (Fig. 6). This important result emphasizes the specific functional requirement of residues Lys263 and Lys267 for nucleolar localization over any nonspecific charge effects. Nucleophosmin is a member of the nucleoplasmin family of molecular chaperones and shares the N-terminal pentamerization domain and central acidic region characteristic of these proteins. In this study we have shown that NPM1 has an additional folded domain at its C terminus, which is unique to this subfamily. Although nucleoplasmin is found throughout the nucleus, NPM1 is one of the most abundant proteins in the nucleolus, and this C-terminal domain is necessary for its nucleolar localization. How it directs the protein to the nucleolus is not clear. It seems likely that it binds to a protein or nucleic acid ligand that is abundant in the nucleolus, and it is possible that the structural similarity to ribosomal protein S17e is functionally significant. The natural product avrainvillamide has been shown to bind to the C-terminal domain of NPM1 via Cys275 (45Wulff J.E. Siegrist R. Myers A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 14444-14451Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and sensitizes cells to apoptosis. It seems likely that avrainvillamide competes with the natural binding partner of this domain. Interestingly, Cys275 is on the same face as the two lysine residues that we have shown to be important for nucleolar localization (Fig. 5) suggesting that this region of the domain is involved in ligand binding. Ribosome biogenesis is metabolically expensive and a rate-limiting step in cell division and growth. Consequently, ribosomal integrity is closely monitored by a variety of pathways (46Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Free ribosomal proteins, for example, activate the tumor suppressor p53 by inhibiting its negative regulator MDM2. There is growing evidence that defects in these pathways can lead to disease. Several blood disorders, for example, are caused by mutations in ribosomal proteins or in ribosome assembly factors (47Cmejla R. Cmejlova J. Handrkova H. Petrak J. Pospisilova D. Hum.

It seems likely that misdirection of p19ARF, or another key regulatory molecule that binds NPM1, to the cytoplasm may play a key role in AML. The results of this study show that the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of NPM1 in NPMc+ AML results from both the gain of a nuclear export signal and the disruption of the structure of its C-terminal domain. Molecules that target the C-terminal domain of NPM1 interfere with this mislocalization could therefore have potential applications in leukemia therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2004278446,The androgen receptor (AR) is required for prostate cancer development and contributes to tumor progression after remission in response to androgen deprivation therapy. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases AR transcriptional activity at low levels of androgen in the CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line derived from the castration-recurrent CWR22 prostate cancer xenograft. Here we report that knockdown of AR decreases EGF stimulation of prostate cancer cell growth and demonstrate a mechanistic link between EGF and AR signaling. The EGF-induced increase in AR transcriptional activity is dependent on phosphorylation at mitogen-activated protein kinase consensus site Ser-515 in the AR NH(2)-terminal region and at protein kinase C consensus site Ser-578 in the AR DNA binding domain. Phosphorylation at these sites alters the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of AR and AR interaction with the Ku-70/80 regulatory subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase. Abolishing AR Ser-578 phosphorylation by introducing an S578A mutation eliminates the AR transcriptional response to EGF and increases both AR binding of Ku-70/80 and nuclear retention of AR in association with hyperphosphorylation of AR Ser-515. The results support a model in which AR transcriptional activity increases castration-recurrent prostate cancer cell growth in response to EGF by site-specific serine phosphorylation that regulates nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling through interactions with the Ku-70/80 regulatory complex.
https://openalex.org/W2013152693,"Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is transmitted directly between cells via an organized cell-cell contact called a virological synapse (VS). The VS has been studied by light microscopy, but the ultrastructure of the VS and the nature of the transmitted viral particle have remained unknown. Cell-free enveloped virions of HTLV-1 are undetectable in the serum of individuals infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and during in vitro culture of naturally infected lymphocytes. However, the viral envelope protein is required for infectivity of HTLV-1, suggesting that complete, enveloped HTLV-1 virions are transferred across the synapse. Here, we use electron tomography combined with immunostaining of viral protein to demonstrate the presence of enveloped HTLV-1 particles within the VS formed between naturally infected lymphocytes. We show in 3D that HTLV-1 particles can be detected in multiple synaptic clefts at different locations simultaneously within the same VS. The synaptic clefts are surrounded by the tightly apposed plasma membranes of the two cells. HTLV-1 virions can contact the recipient cell membrane before detaching from the infected cell. The results show that the HTLV-1 virological synapse that forms spontaneously between lymphocytes of HTLV-1 infected individuals allows direct cell-cell transmission of the virus by triggered, directional release of enveloped HTLV-1 particles into confined intercellular spaces."
https://openalex.org/W2019822789,"Protein interaction networks shed light on the global organization of proteomes but can also place individual proteins into a functional context. If we know the function of bacterial proteins we will be able to understand how these species have adapted to diverse environments including many extreme habitats. Here we present the protein interaction network for the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum which encodes 1,039 proteins, 726 (or 70%) of which interact via 3,649 interactions as revealed by systematic yeast two-hybrid screens. A high-confidence subset of 991 interactions links 576 proteins. To derive further biological insights from our data, we constructed an integrated network of proteins involved in DNA metabolism. Combining our data with additional evidences, we provide improved annotations for at least 18 proteins (including TP0004, TP0050, and TP0183 which are suggested to be involved in DNA metabolism). We estimate that this “minimal” bacterium contains on the order of 3,000 protein interactions. Profiles of functional interconnections indicate that bacterial proteins interact more promiscuously than eukaryotic proteins, reflecting the non-compartmentalized structure of the bacterial cell. Using our high-confidence interactions, we also predict 417,329 homologous interactions (“interologs”) for 372 completely sequenced genomes and provide evidence that at least one third of them can be experimentally confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2150908348,"Background The asexual blood stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum produce highly immunogenic polymorphic antigens that are expressed on the surface of the host cell. In contrast, few studies have examined the surface of the gametocyte-infected erythrocyte. Methodology/Principal Findings We used flow cytometry to detect antibodies recognising the surface of live cultured erythrocytes infected with gametocytes of P. falciparum strain 3D7 in the plasma of 200 Gambian children. The majority of children had been identified as carrying gametocytes after treatment for malaria, and each donated blood for mosquito-feeding experiments. None of the plasma recognised the surface of erythrocytes infected with developmental stages of gametocytes (I–IV), but 66 of 194 (34.0%) plasma contained IgG that recognised the surface of erythrocytes infected with mature (stage V) gametocytes. Thirty-four (17.0%) of 200 plasma tested recognised erythrocytes infected with trophozoites and schizonts, but there was no association with recognition of the surface of gametocyte-infected erythrocytes (odds ratio 1.08, 95% C.I. 0.434–2.57; P = 0.851). Plasma antibodies with the ability to recognise gametocyte surface antigens (GSA) were associated with the presence of antibodies that recognise the gamete antigen Pfs 230, but not Pfs48/45. Antibodies recognising GSA were associated with donors having lower gametocyte densities 4 weeks after antimalarial treatment. Conclusions/Significance We provide evidence that GSA are distinct from antigens detected on the surface of asexual 3D7 parasites. Our findings suggest a novel strategy for the development of transmission-blocking vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2149804875,"Secreted phospholipase A2 group X (sPLA2-X) is one of the most potent enzymes of the phospholipase A2 lipolytic enzyme superfamily. Its high catalytic activity toward phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of cell membranes and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), has implicated sPLA2-X in chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherogenesis. We studied the role of sPLA2-X enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo, by generating sPLA2-X-overexpressing macrophages and transgenic macrophage-specific sPLA2-X mice. Our results show that sPLA2-X expression inhibits macrophage activation and inflammatory responses upon stimulation, characterized by reduced cell adhesion and nitric oxide production, a decrease in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and an increase in interleukin (IL)-10. These effects were mediated by an increase in IL-6, and enhanced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2). Moreover, we found that overexpression of active sPLA2-X in macrophages strongly increases foam cell formation upon incubation with native LDL but also oxidized LDL (oxLDL), which is mediated by enhanced expression of scavenger receptor CD36. Transgenic sPLA2-X mice died neonatally because of severe lung pathology characterized by interstitial pneumonia with massive granulocyte and surfactant-laden macrophage infiltration. We conclude that overexpression of the active sPLA2-X enzyme results in enhanced foam cell formation but reduced activation and inflammatory responses in macrophages in vitro. Interestingly, enhanced sPLA2-X activity in macrophages in vivo leads to fatal pulmonary defects, suggesting a crucial role for sPLA2-X in inflammatory lung disease.

Among the different sPLA2, the group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) is the most potent in hydrolyzing phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acids (1Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Dennis E.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 2Ghesquiere S.A. Hofker M.H. de Winther M.P. Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 2005; 5: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Phospholipases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lipid-mediated inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, a slow progressing inflammation of the large arteries, is characterized by the build up of lipid-rich material in the inner vessel wall. The macrophage is the most prominent cell type of an atherosclerotic plaque and crucial in lipid accumulation and the concomitant inflammatory process. Because the hydrolysis products of sPLA2 enzymes lead to the generation of atherogenic lipoprotein particles and the production of various inflammatory lipid mediators subtypes, several of these enzymes (e.g. human group IIA, V, and X) have been implicated in atherosclerosis development (2Ghesquiere S.A. Hofker M.H. de Winther M.P. Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 2005; 5: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). More specifically, for both sPLA2-IIA and sPLA2-V, functional studies in mice showed that overexpression results in enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation(3Bostrom M.A. Boyanovsky B.B. Jordan C.T.

The potent group X sPLA2 was discovered in 1997 by Cupillard et al. (7Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and is expressed in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and in low quantities in lung, pancreas, and colon cells. Under inflammatory conditions, the prepropeptide is cleaved to yield the fully active enzyme. sPLA2-X is structurally related to both sPLA2-IB and -IIA, and once active, it displays potent activity on both anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids, and hydrolyzes PC (8Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although comparable with group V in terms of cell binding, the hydrophobic nature of sPLA2-X makes the enzyme far more potent. Immunohistochemical staining of atherosclerotic plaques revealed marked sPLA2-X expression of sPLA2-X in foam cell lesions in the arterial intima and in smooth muscle cells of the arterial media in both mice and humans (9Hanasaki K.

The present study was performed to investigate in vitro and in vivo the function of the active sPLA2-X enzyme in atherogenic macrophage features like foam cell formation and inflammation. To this end, we generated a macrophage-specific sPLA2-X construct to create macrophages overexpressing active group X, as well as transgenic mice overexpressing the active sPLA2-X enzyme in their macrophages. Our results show that overexpression of the sPLA2-X enzyme in macrophages in vitro reduces macrophage activation and inflammatory responses and mediates enhanced foam cell formation. In vivo experiments show that enhanced sPLA2-X activity in macrophages leads to neonatal death due to severe lung pathology characterized by an interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of surfactant-laden alveolar macrophages and edema. Generation of a Macrophage-specific sPLA2-X Construct—A macrophage-specific sPLA2-X construct was generated by cloning the active human sPLA2-X cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Lambeau) starting at the second methionine initiator site (Met-32 construct) (7Cupillard L.

Greaves D.R. Immunology. 2001; 103: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) into the pcDNA 3 vector (Invitrogen) using convenient restriction sites (Fig. 1A). Verification was performed by sequencing start and end of the Met-32 construct and boundaries of the CD68 promoter region (data not shown). Generation of RAW264.7 Cells Overexpressing hu-sPLA2-X—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Experiments were performed in medium without β-mercaptoethanol. To establish sPLA2-X-overexpressing RAW 264.7 cells, 10 μg of CD68-sPLA2-X plasmid DNA and 2 μg of neomycin resistance plasmid DNA were added to 10 × 106 RAW264.7 cells resuspended in 500 μl of Optimem (Invitrogen) and electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 1070 μF and 280 V in 4-mm cuvettes. Following electroporation, the cells were replated in pre-warmed RAW medium. Two days after transfection, cells were placed on culture medium containing 0.1 mg/ml geneticin for 1 week. Surviving cells were replated in 96-well plates for clonal selection, and individual colonies were selected and screened with PCR for the presence of the human sPLA2-X construct. At least three PCR sPLA2-X-positive and -negative RAW264.7 clones were used for all analyses. Northern Blotting—To verify expression of sPLA2-X in transfected RAW264.7 cells, RNA was isolated from positive and negative sPLA2-X clones using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts (7.5 μg) of RNA were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing agarose gel (1% w/v) containing 7.5% formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond N, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Hybridization was performed on the blots with a 32P-labeled sPLA2-X fragment at 54 °C in hybridization mixture (50% formamide, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's, 0.2 m NA2PO4, 50 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Phospholipase Activity—Phospholipase activity was measured in culture medium from sPLA2-X and control RAW264.7 cells using a sPLA2 assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR—For quantitative PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from hu-sPLA2-X and control cells using Tri-Reagent (Sigma). Quantity and quality of the RNA were checked on the nanodrop (Witec AG) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (500 ng) was converted into cDNA using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MyIQ analysis was performed on 10 ng of cDNA using the qPCR iQ™ Custom SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 300 nm primer. Analysis was performed on an iCycler® thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). Relative expression levels were determined by correction with the housekeeping gene GAPDH for RNA concentration differences. Primer sequences are available upon request. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 10 min at 13.2 krpm, protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were boiled in Laemmli buffer and loaded on 10-12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking with 10% nonfat dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against hu-sPLA2-X (1 μg/ml, ab47111 Abcam), CD36 (1:1000, MAB1258 Chemicon), and SR-A (1 μg/ml, 2F8). After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). β-Actin was used as a loading control. ELISA and Nitric Oxide (NO) Quantification—sPLA2-X and control RAW264.7 cells were activated with 250 ng/ml LPS. ELISA was performed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukins (IL) 6 and 10 according to the manufacturer's protocol (BIOSOURCE Inc., Camarillo, CA). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) were measured with competitive immunoassay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Production of nitric oxide was assessed by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the cell culture supernatants by the Griess reaction as described (12Schmidt H.H.H.W. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley, Chichester1996: 491-498Google Scholar). Cell Activation—To quantify the cellular response to LPS stimulation, sPLA2-X and control RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 250 ng/ml LPS for 24 h. Activated macrophages, defined as flattened cells with extensions of pseudopodia, were determined based on an average count of three fields along a vertical cross-section (top, middle, bottom) of each well on an inverted microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon) using a 20× objective lens. LDL Loading and High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC)—Normal low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were isolated from the serum of healthy blood donors (obtained from De Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening, the Netherlands). LDL isolation and CuSO4 oxidation of LDL were performed as described previously (13Hendriks W.L. Van der Boom H. van Vark L.C. Havekes L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). LDL and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were stored under N2 at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks after isolation/modification. sPLA2-X and control RAW264.7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells in 6-well plates in serum-free medium (Optimem, Invitrogen) constituted with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine. After a 4-h adherence period, 25 μg/ml LDL or oxLDL was added to the medium. The cells were incubated for 24 h after which they were washed, lifted, and processed for HPTLC as described previously (14Groeneweg M. Kanters E. Vergouwe M.N. Duerink H. Kraal G.

Generation of sPLA2-X Transgenic Mice—The same macrophage-specific hu-sPLA2-X construct as described above was also used to generate transgenic mice. Oocyte injection was performed according to standard procedures in C57BL/6J mice (15Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The local Committee for Animal Welfare approved all experiments. The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions, and microbiological status was checked regularly. Histology—Whole mice were formalin-fixed and transversal sections either of a whole mouse or of the different tissues were embedded in paraffin. 3-micron sections were cut and used for general histological examination based on hematoxylin and eosin staining. To determine the presence of human sPLA2-X, lung sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-human sPLA2-X antisera (1:50), a generous gift from Dr. Gelb (University of Washington). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and periodic acid-Schiff after diastase digestion (PAS/D) were performed on lung sections to determine and discriminate the presence of glycogen and mucus. For the detection of surfactant phospholipids (SP), lung sections were stained with a polyclonal rabbit anti-SP-B antibody (1:100), a generous gift from Dr. van Iwaarden (University Maastricht). An experienced animal pathologist (M. G.) performed all pathology and histology of the mice. Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of duplicate or triplicate measurements as indicated for each measurement. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test using GraphPad PRISM software. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Generation of a CD68 hu-sPLA2-X Construct and Establishment of Stable hu-sPLA2-X-overexpressing RAW264.7 Cells—A macrophage-specific human sPLA2-X construct was generated to study the function of sPLA2-X in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. The human CD68 promoter was selected for its ability to deliver high expression in murine macrophages specifically (11Gough P.J. Gordon S. Greaves D.R. Immunology. 2001; 103: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Met-32 construct of the human sPLA2-X gene has proven to deliver potent sPLA2-X activity without necessary processing to activate the enzyme (8Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M.

The Met-32 construct was cloned behind the CD68 promoter (Fig. 1A). Additional verification was performed using various restriction enzymes and subsequent gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The expression of human sPLA2-X in stably transfected RAW264.7 cell lines was confirmed at the RNA and protein level (Fig. 1, B and C). At least three independent clones overexpressing sPLA2-X and three negative clones (controls) were selected for subsequent experiments. For transparency purposes, results presented are of a representative negative (ctrl) and positive (grX) clone. First, phospholipase activity was measured in the medium of transfected and control cells. As expected, overexpression of the Met-32 construct of hu-sPLA2-X resulted in enhanced phospholipase activity (∼5-fold) compared with control cells (Fig. 1D). sPLA2-X Overexpression Inhibits Macrophage Activation—The grX macrophages already revealed differences in culturing. Upon incubation with LPS, grX cells showed increased cellular activation characteristics such as cell flattening, increased adherence, and extension of pseudopodia (Fig. 2, A and B). Further elaborating on the morphological differences between activated control and grX cells, we measured NO production (Fig. 2C). In agreement with the morphological features of the cells, grX macrophages produced ∼50% less NO after 24 h of LPS stimulation. The inhibition in NO production resulted from a reduced inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in sPLA2-X cells (Fig. 2D). The LPS treatment did not alter sPLA2-X activity (data not shown). sPLA2-X Overexpression Enhances the Anti-inflammatory Response of Macrophages—To investigate the effects of sPLA2-X overexpression on macrophage function further, we measured expression and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-10, and IL-6 upon LPS exposure. Differences in mRNA expression and protein secretion between ctrl and grX cells were observed at all time points. In Fig. 3, both expression and secretion of TNF, IL-10, and IL-6 are shown at their peak based on protein secretion. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF was strongly induced after 4 h of LPS, but grX cells showed a marked reduction in TNF expression and subsequent release compared with ctrl cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition to TNF, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also measured. IL-10 mRNA levels in grX cells were already higher at basal conditions, and this difference increased upon LPS exposure (Fig. 3C). IL-10 secretion was highest after 24 h of LPS, and a 2-fold increase was observed in the grX cells compared with ctrl cells (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that overexpression of sPLA2-X leads to a more antiinflammatory macrophage phenotype. Finally, IL-6 expression and secretion was measured. IL-6 is a key cytokine in activation and regulation of the immune system during infections and inflammation. grX cells were more responsive in LPS-induced IL-6 expression and secretion (Fig. 3, E and F). Interestingly, overexpression of another secretory phospholipase, sPLA2-IIa (4Ghesquiere S.A. Gijbels M.J. Anthonsen M. van Gorp P.J. Van der Made I. Johansen B. Hofker M.H. de Winther M.P. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 201-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in macrophages did not affect cytokine production (supplemental data).FIGURE 3Cytokine profiles after activation of RAW264.7 cells expressing hu-sPLA2-X. Graphs depicted on the left side (A, C, E) show the respective gene expression levels (corrected for GAPDH) of TNF, IL-10, and IL-6 in unstimulated and LPS (250 ng/ml)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells expressing hu-sPLA2-X. On the right side (B, D, F) are the corresponding protein levels of the cytokines as measured by ELISA. The results shown are of control cells (ctrl), which are negative for hu-sPLA2-X expression, and hu-sPLA2-X-expressing macrophages (grX). These results are representative of two independent experiments with n = 3; *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enhanced Release of PGE2 and 15d-PGJ2 in sPLA2-X Macrophages during Activation—One of the mechanisms by which the inflammatory process is controlled is via the regulatory interaction of prostaglandin E2 and IL-6. sPLA2-X activity leads to the generation of arachidonic acid (AA), an essential substrate in the production of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins like PGE2 and 15d-PGJ2 through the action of cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2. Therefore, we investigated the effects of sPLA2-X overexpression on Cox-2 expression and secretion of PGE2 and 15d-PGJ2 upon activation with LPS. Cox-2 expression was induced upon LPS stimulation, and this induction was significantly higher in grX cells (Fig. 4A). PGE2 and 15d-PGJ2 levels in non LPS-treated macrophages were mildly but significantly higher in the overexpressing cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4, B and C). After 4 h of LPS activation, PGE2 levels increased, with more PGE2 being produced by the grX cells. At 24 h of activation, PGE2 levels in sPLA2-X-overexpressing macrophages increased more than 8-fold compared with the control macrophages. A similar pattern was seen for 15d-PGJ2, but this prostaglandin was induced later. These results show that sPLA2-X activity in macrophages leads to elevated PGE2 and 15d-PGJ2 levels under basal conditions and that the difference with control cells increases even more dramatically upon LPS stimulation. sPLA2-X Overexpression Enhances Foam Cell Formation—sPLA2-X is potentially proatherogenic because of its capacity to modify lipoproteins. To study the effects of sPLA2-X overexpression on cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation, sPLA2-X-overexpressing macrophages were incubated with normal or oxidative-modified LDL for 24 h. Results show enhanced cholesterol ester accumulation of group X-overexpressing macrophages (Fig. 5A). Even without addition of (ox)LDL, the grX macrophages accumulated low levels of cholesterol esters, probably derived from the serum present in the culture medium. Incubation with LDL, which can be modified by sPLA2, led to a ∼3-fold increase in cholesterol ester accumulation in the sPLA2-X cells. The difference was even more pronounced upon incubation with oxLDL. Gene expression and protein analyses showed that this difference is most likely due to up-regulation of scavenger receptor CD36 (Fig. 5, B and D), but not SR-A (Fig. 5, C and D) in sPLA2-X macrophages. These data suggest that sPLA2-X enhances lipid accumulation not only via lipid modification, but also through up-regulation of CD36 in macrophages. Generation of Macrophage-specific sPLA2-X Transgenic Mice—After studying the role of sPLA2-X overexpression in macrophages in vitro, we proceeded to an in vivo model to study the role of macrophage-specific overexpression of sPLA2-X. To establish sPLA2-X transgenic mice, three oocyte injection rounds were performed using the same CD68 sPLA2-X construct as used to generate the cell lines described above. Only three founder mice, of 55 born, were tested positive for hu-sPLA2-X by PCR (data not shown). The success rate of this construct (5.5%) was compared with two other macrophage-specific constructs used to generate transgenic mice (x1 and x2, Table 1) at the same time, and in the same facility under the same conditions. These other two macrophage-specific constructs yielded 18.6 and 8.9% transgenic founder mice, respectively. Moreover, the founder mice from these latter constructs mostly transmitted their transgene over two generations (7/8 and 4/4, respectively). For the sPLA2-X transgenic mice, the first founder (female, no. 1) died within the first 3 weeks after birth. The second founder mouse (male, no. 2) showed very poor growth and died at 3 weeks of age. The third founder mouse (male, no. 3) exhibited no external signs of pathology and reached adulthood. Breeding of this mouse resulted in a total offspring of 62 mice, of which only one animal tested positive for the transgene. Breeding of this F1 mouse resulted in 16 pups of which none tested positive for the sPLA2-X construct.TABLE 1Comparison of three macrophage-specific constructs used to produce transgenic miceConstructMice born[Nest size]PCR-positive miceTransgenesis success rateTransmission efficiency over 2 generations#%CD68 hu-sPLA2 X554.135.50/3x1435.1818.67/8x2455.048.94/4 Open table in a new tab Macrophage-specific sPLA2-X Transgenic Mice Die Because of Severe Lung Pathology—s PLA2-X founder no. 1 and no. 2 died within the first 3 weeks after birth. Pathological examination revealed severe lung pathology (Fig. 6). The cause of death was an interstitial pneumonia with severe infiltration of alveolar macrophages and edema (Fig. 6, A and B). The presence of macrophage-secreted human PLA2-X in lung sections of the transgenic sPLA2-X mice was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6, C and D). Other tissues like liver and bone marrow also showed positive staining for hu-sPLA2-X in monocytes/macrophages (data not shown). Further histological examination of the lungs was performed, and lung sections were stained with PAS and PAS/D. PAS staining detects glycogen stores, which are abundantly present in immature epithelial cells before conversion of glycogen into surfactant, and as such PAS can be used as a marker for immature lung development. However, PAS staining will also detect mucus, of which the presence in lungs often coincides with inflammation. Therefore, we also performed a PAS/D staining, which only stains cytoplasmic neutral mucin droplets, by digesting the glycogen. Whereas lungs of wild-type (Wt) mice were negative for both PAS and PAS/D staining, lungs of the sPLA2-X mice showed strong colocalized equally distributed staining for both PAS (Fig. 6, E and F) and PAS/D (Fig. 6, G and H) showing that the lungs of the sPLA2-X-overexpressing mice were filled with mucus. Several reports have shown that sPLA2s are involved in the hydrolysis of surfactant phospholipids, thereby leading to malfunction of the lung surfactant and subsequent lung failure. The pulmonary surfactant system is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins required for maintenance of the lung alveoli and minimization of the work of breathing during regular volume changes (16Daniels C.B. Orgeig S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 129: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic SP-B is an important component of pulmonary surfactant, and a deficiency of active SP-B results in fatal respiratory failure (17Nogee L.M. Garnier G. Dietz H.C. Singer L. Murphy A.M. deMello D.E. Colten H.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, we stained lung sections of the sPLA2-X mice for the presence of SP-B.

We compare these results with its chiral counterpart L-form, l-EAK16. Circular dichroism was used to follow the structural dynamics under various temperature and pH conditions. At 25°C the d-EAK16 peptide displayed a typical beta-sheet spectrum. Upon increasing the temperature above 70°C, there was a spectrum shift as the 218 nm valley widens toward 210 nm. Above 80°C, the d-EAK16 peptide transformed into a typical alpha-helix CD spectrum without going through a detectable random-coil intermediate. When increasing the temperature from 4°C to 110°C then cooling back from 110°C to 4°C, there was a hysteresis: the secondary structure from beta-sheet to alpha-helix and then from alpha-helix to beta-sheet occurred. d-EAK16 formed an alpha-helical conformation at pH0.76 and pH12 but formed a beta-sheet at neutral pH. The effects of various pH conditions, ionic strength and denaturing agents were also noted. Since D-form peptides are resistant to natural enzyme degradation, such drastic structural changes may be exploited for fabricating molecular sensors to detect minute environmental changes. This provides insight into the behaviors of self-assembling peptides made of D-amino acids and points the way to designing new peptide materials for biomedical engineering and nanobiotechnology."

When considering preschool teachers only, we observed a significant correlation between the number of years of experience with children faces and the differential face composite effect between children and adults faces. Participants with at least 10 years of qualitative experience with children faces had a larger composite face effect for children than adult faces.Overall, these observations indicate that even in adulthood face processes can be reshaped qualitatively, presumably to facilitate efficient processing of the differential morphological features of the frequently encountered population of faces."
https://openalex.org/W2143872601,"The three subspecies of Spotted Owl (Northern, Strix occidentalis caurina; California, S. o. occidentalis; and Mexican, S. o. lucida) are all threatened by habitat loss and range expansion of the Barred Owl (S. varia). An unaddressed threat is whether Barred Owls could be a source of novel strains of disease such as avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) or other blood parasites potentially harmful for Spotted Owls. Although Barred Owls commonly harbor Plasmodium infections, these parasites have not been documented in the Spotted Owl. We screened 111 Spotted Owls, 44 Barred Owls, and 387 owls of nine other species for haemosporidian parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus spp.). California Spotted Owls had the greatest number of simultaneous multi-species infections (44%). Additionally, sequencing results revealed that the Northern and California Spotted Owl subspecies together had the highest number of Leucocytozoon parasite lineages (n = 17) and unique lineages (n = 12). This high level of sequence diversity is significant because only one Leucocytozoon species (L. danilewskyi) has been accepted as valid among all owls, suggesting that L. danilewskyi is a cryptic species. Furthermore, a Plasmodium parasite was documented in a Northern Spotted Owl for the first time. West Coast Barred Owls had a lower prevalence of infection (15%) when compared to sympatric Spotted Owls (S. o. caurina 52%, S. o. occidentalis 79%) and Barred Owls from the historic range (61%). Consequently, Barred Owls on the West Coast may have a competitive advantage over the potentially immune compromised Spotted Owls."
https://openalex.org/W2001707924,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT; serotypes A-G) and tetanus neurotoxin elicit flaccid and spastic paralysis, respectively. These neurotoxins are zinc proteases that cleave SNARE proteins to inhibit synaptic vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane. Although BoNT/B and tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) cleave VAMP-2 at the same scissile bond, their mechanism(s) of VAMP-2 recognition is not clear. Mapping experiments showed that residues 60-87 of VAMP-2 were sufficient for efficient cleavage by BoNT/B and that residues 40-87 of VAMP-2 were sufficient for efficient TeNT cleavage. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and kinetic analysis identified three regions within VAMP-2 that were recognized by BoNT/B and TeNT: residues adjacent to the site of scissile bond cleavage (cleavage region) and residues located within N-terminal and C-terminal regions relative to the cleavage region. Analysis of residues within the cleavage region showed that mutations at the P7, P4, P2, and P1' residues of VAMP-2 had the greatest inhibition of LC/B cleavage (> or =32-fold), whereas mutations at P7, P4, P1', and P2' residues of VAMP-2 had the greatest inhibition of LC/TeNT cleavage (> or =64-fold). Residues within the cleavage region influenced catalysis, whereas residues N-terminal and C-terminal to the cleavage region influenced binding affinity. Thus, BoNT/B and TeNT possess similar organization but have unique residues to recognize and cleave VAMP-2. These studies provide new insights into how the clostridial neurotoxins recognize their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1975654803,"A common mammalian defense mechanism employed to prevent systemic dissemination of invasive bacteria involves occlusion of local microvasculature and encapsulation of bacteria within fibrin networks. Acquisition of plasmin activity at the bacterial cell surface circumvents this defense mechanism, allowing invasive disease initiation. To facilitate this process, S. pyogenes secretes streptokinase, a plasminogen-activating protein. Streptokinase polymorphism exhibited by S. pyogenes isolates is well characterized. However, the functional differences displayed by these variants and the biological significance of this variation has not been elucidated. Phylogenetic analysis of ska sequences from 28 S. pyogenes isolates revealed 2 main sequence clusters (clusters 1 and 2). All strains secreted streptokinase, as determined by Western blotting, and were capable of acquiring cell surface plasmin activity after incubation in human plasma. Whereas culture supernatants from strains containing cluster 1 ska alleles also displayed soluble plasminogen activation activity, supernatants from strains containing cluster 2 ska alleles did not. Furthermore, plasminogen activation activity in culture supernatants from strains containing cluster 2 ska alleles could only be detected when plasminogen was prebound with fibrinogen. This study indicates that variant streptokinase proteins secreted by S. pyogenes isolates display differing plasminogen activation characteristics and may therefore play distinct roles in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2036681915,"The parental conflict hypothesis predicts that the mother inhibits embryo growth counteracting growth enhancement by the father. In plants the DNA methyltransferase MET1 is a central regulator of parentally imprinted genes that affect seed growth. However the relation between the role of MET1 in imprinting and its control of seed size has remained unclear. Here we combine cytological, genetic and statistical analyses to study the effect of MET1 on seed growth. We show that the loss of MET1 during male gametogenesis causes a reduction of seed size, presumably linked to silencing of the paternal allele of growth enhancers in the endosperm, which nurtures the embryo. However, we find no evidence for a similar role of MET1 during female gametogenesis. Rather, the reduction of MET1 dosage in the maternal somatic tissues causes seed size increase. MET1 inhibits seed growth by restricting cell division and elongation in the maternal integuments that surround the seed. Our data demonstrate new controls of seed growth linked to the mode of reproduction typical of flowering plants. We conclude that the regulation of embryo growth by MET1 results from a combination of predominant maternal controls, and that DNA methylation maintained by MET1 does not orchestrate a parental conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2004793954,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) and tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) inhibit neurotransmitter release by proteolyzing a single peptide bond in one of the three soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors SNAP-25, syntaxin, and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin. TeNT and BoNT/B, D, F, and G of the seven known BoNTs cleave the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP/synaptobrevin. Except for BoNT/B and TeNT, they cleave unique peptide bonds, and prior work suggested that different substrate segments are required for the interaction of each toxin. Although the mode of SNAP-25 cleavage by BoNT/A and E has recently been studied in detail, the mechanism of VAMP/synaptobrevin proteolysis is fragmentary. Here, we report the determination of all substrate residues that are involved in the interaction with BoNT/B, D, and F and TeNT by means of systematic mutagenesis of VAMP/synaptobrevin. For each of the toxins, three or more residues clustered at an N-terminal site remote from the respective scissile bond are identified that affect solely substrate binding. These exosites exhibit different sizes and distances to the scissile peptide bonds for each neurotoxin. Substrate segments C-terminal of the cleavage site (P4-P4') do not play a role in the catalytic process. Mutation of residues in the proximity of the scissile bond exclusively affects the turnover number; however, the importance of individual positions at the cleavage sites varied for each toxin. The data show that, similar to the SNAP-25 proteolyzing BoNT/A and E, VAMP/synaptobrevin-specific clostridial neurotoxins also initiate substrate interaction, employing an exosite located N-terminal of the scissile peptide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2035128658,"Background In this pioneer study to the biological activity of organometallic compound Iron(III)-salophene (Fe-SP) the specific effects of Fe-SP on viability, morphology, proliferation, and cell-cycle progression on platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Fe-SP displayed selective cytotoxicity against SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 (ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma) cell lines at concentrations between 100 nM and 1 µM, while the viability of HeLa cells (epithelial cervix adenocarcinoma) or primary lung or skin fibroblasts was not affected. SKOV-3 cells in contrast to fibroblasts after treatment with Fe-SP revealed apparent hallmarks of apoptosis including densely stained nuclear granular bodies within fragmented nuclei, highly condensed chromatin and chromatin fragmentation. Fe-SP treatment led to the activation of markers of the extrinsic (Caspase-8) and intrinsic (Caspase-9) pathway of apoptosis as well as of executioner Caspase-3 while PARP-1 was deactivated. Fe-SP exerted effects as an anti-proliferative agent with an IC50 value of 300 nM and caused delayed progression of cells through S-phase phase of the cell cycle resulting in a complete S-phase arrest. When intra-peritoneally applied to rats Fe-SP did not show any systemic toxicity at concentrations that in preliminary trials were determined to be chemotherapeutic relevant doses in a rat ovarian cancer cell model. Conclusion/Significance The present report suggests that Fe-SP is a potent growth-suppressing agent in vitro for cell lines derived from ovarian cancer and a potential therapeutic drug to treat such tumors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2055319676,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled tethered ligand receptor that is expressed by pancreatic acinar and ductal cells. It can be physiologically activated by trypsin. Previously reported studies (Namkung, W., Han, W., Luo, X., Muallem, S., Cho, K. H., Kim, K. H., and Lee, M. G. (2004) Gastroenterology 126, 1844–1859; Sharma, A., Tao, X., Gopal, A., Ligon, B., Andrade-Gordon, P., Steer, M. L., and Perides, G. (2005) Am. J. Physiol. 288, G388–G395) have shown that PAR2 activation exerts a protective effect on the experimental model of pancreatitis induced by supramaximal secretagogue (caerulein) stimulation. We now show that PAR2 exerts a worsening effect on a different model of experimental pancreatitis, i.e. one induced by retrograde pancreatic ductal infusion of bile salts. In vitro studies using freshly prepared pancreatic acini show that genetic deletion of PAR2 reduces bile salt-induced pathological calcium transients, acinar cell injury, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, whereas genetic deletion of PAR2 has the opposite or no effect on these pancreatitis-related events when they are elicited, in vitro, by caerulein stimulation. Studies employing a combination of trypsin inhibition and activation of PAR2 with the activating peptide SLIGRL show that all these differences indeed depend on the activation of PAR2. These studies are the first to report that a single perturbation can have model-specific and opposite effects on pancreatitis, and they underscore the importance of performing mechanistic pancreatitis studies using two dissimilar models of the disease to detect idiosyncratic, model-specific events. We suggest PAR2 activation exerts a worsening effect on the severity of clinical pancreatitis and that interventions interfering with PAR2 activation may be of benefit in the treatment of patients with severe pancreatitis.

We suggest PAR2 activation exerts a worsening effect on the severity of clinical pancreatitis and that interventions interfering with PAR2 activation may be of benefit in the treatment of patients with severe pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a complex inflammatory disease of the pancreas that is of uncertain pathogenesis. No specific therapy for the disease has so far been identified, and as a result, treatment for this relatively common and, sometimes, lethal disease is limited to supportive care. Pancreatitis severity and disease morbidity/mortality are closely correlated leading to the widely held view that interventions that reduce the severity of an attack might have a favorable impact on clinical outcome. This concept has sparked considerable investigative interest directed at identifying factors and events that regulate pancreatitis severity in the belief that their identification would lead to therapies that might minimize disease severity. For the most part, studies pursuing that goal have employed experimental models of acute pancreatitis induced in laboratory animals, rather than clinically derived material, and the results obtained using those models have been assumed to reflect features that would be relevant to the clinical disease as well.The two best characterized experimental models of acute pancreatitis are the secretagogue-induced (1Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A. Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and the bile salt-induced (2Aho H.J. Koskensalo S.M. Nevalainen T.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1980; 15: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) models. In the secretagogue-induced model, either rats or mice are given repeated supramaximally stimulating doses of the cholecystokinin analog caerulein, and they develop a highly reproducible but relatively mild and transient form of the disease, which reaches its maximal severity within 24 h of the start of caerulein administration. Although widely employed in mechanistic studies dealing with pancreatitis, the caerulein-induced model has been criticized by many who have questioned its clinical relevance because there is no evidence to suggest that clinical pancreatitis is triggered by supramaximal secretagogue stimulation.Use of the bile salt-induced pancreatitis model eliminates this concern regarding clinical relevance because, in contrast to the caerulein model, the events that are believed to trigger clinical biliary or gallstone pancreatitis (i.e. pancreatic duct outflow obstruction and/or reflux of bile into the pancreatic duct) are indeed replicated during induction of this model (2Aho H.J. Koskensalo S.M. Nevalainen T.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1980; 15: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Bile salt-induced pancreatitis is induced by the low pressure retrograde perfusion of the pancreatic duct with a bile salt solution such as sodium taurocholate, and like the caerulein model, it reaches its maximal level of severity within 24 h of duct infusion. Use of the bile salt model has usually been confined to rats and larger animals because of technical reasons (i.e. the ease of controlled pancreatic duct infusion), and it has not been employed in studies using mice. In recently published studies, however, we have shown that the sodium taurocholate model can, in fact, be adapted for use in mice (3Laukkarinen J.M. van Acker G.J. Weiss E. Steer M.L. Perides G. Gut. 2007; 56: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and that the use of this model in genetically modified mouse strains can provide valuable insights into mechanistic issues related to pancreatitis (4Van Acker G.J.

Virtually all of our observations characterizing this bile salt-induced pancreatitis model have been confirmed in a series of studies recently reported by Wittel et al. (5Wittel U.A. Wiech T.

Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), and this, combined with the frequently made observation that intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen occurs in both clinical and experimental pancreatitis, has suggested that pancreatic PAR2 might play an important role in pancreatitis. Indeed, recently reported studies by Namkung et al. (6Namkung W. Han W. Luo X. Muallem S. Cho K.H. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1844-1859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown that pharmacological activation of PAR2 can reduce the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats, and in independent studies, we have shown that the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatitis is increased by genetic deletion of PAR2 in mice (7Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Andrade-Gordon P. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G388-G395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taken together, these two studies indicate that PAR2 exerts a protective effect on secretagogue-induced pancreatitis, and they led the authors to speculate that interventions designed to activate PAR2 might be of benefit in the treatment of patients with clinical acute pancreatitis.

Gut. 2007; 56: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have suggested that PAR2 activation in pancreatic acinar cells might protect against secretagogue-induced pancreatitis by promoting digestive enzyme secretion from those cells.We wondered, however, if the effects of PAR2 activation on the secretagogue-induced model of pancreatitis might be idiosyncratic to that model and not generally applicable to pancreatitis. In this study, we report the results of studies that have further examined the role of PAR2 in pancreatitis using the alternative and, we believe, more clinically relevant bile salt-induced experimental model of pancreatitis. We show that, in contrast to our findings with the caerulein model, genetic deletion of PAR2 markedly reduces the severity of bile salt-induced pancreatitis. Furthermore, we show that genetic deletion of PAR2 interferes with the pathological effects of bile salts on pancreatic acini under in vitro conditions, whereas activation of PAR2 promotes those in vitro changes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals—All experiments were performed using non-sex-selected wild type C57/Bl/6 mice (20–30 g) purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and 20–30-g PAR2–/– mice, of either sex, that had been bred from founder C57/Bl/6 knock-out animals kindly donated by Dr. P. Andrade-Gordon (Drug Discovery, Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Spring House, PA) (11Damiano B.P. Cheung W.M. Santulli R.J. Fung-Leung W.P. Ngo K. Ye R.D. Darrow A.L. Derian C.K. de Garavilla L. Andrade-Gordon P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar). The animals were housed in temperature-controlled (23 ± 2 °C) rooms with a 12:12 h light:dark cycle, fed standard laboratory chow, and allowed water ad libitum. All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Tufts Medical Center.Reagents—SLIGRL-NH2 (PAR2-activating peptide), TFLLR-NH2 (PAR1-activating peptide), and LRGILS-NH2 (reverse PAR2-activating peptide) were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). The amylase substrate (2-chloro-p-nitrophenyl-α-maltotrioside), the lactate dehydrogenase substrate (lactate), and the indicator for lactate dehydrogenase assay (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) were purchased from Diagnostics Chemical Ltd. (Oxford, CT). Antibodies against JNK and phospho-JNK (p-JNK) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Pluronic F-127 and Fura-2/AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium mixed 1:1 with Ham's salts was from Invitrogen. Nitex® mesh filters were purchased from Sefar America (Kansas City, MO). Choline- and methionine-deficient diet was obtained from Dyets Inc. (Bethlehem, PA). Caerulein, dl-ethionine, sodium taurocholate, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate disodium salt (TLCS), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), and all other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma.Induction of Pancreatitis and Evaluation of Pancreatitis Severity—Bile salt-induced pancreatitis was elicited as described by Laukkarinen et al. (3Laukkarinen J.M. van Acker G.J. Weiss E. Steer M.L. Perides G. Gut. 2007; 56: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) by retrograde pancreatic duct infusion using either 50 μl of 37 mm (2%) sodium taurocholate or 50 μl of 3 mm (0.18%) TLCS in phosphate-buffered saline at a rate of 5 μl/min. Secretagogue-induced pancreatitis was elicited by giving mice 12 hourly intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (50 μg/kg body weight per injection). Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h after the start of caerulein administration. Pancreatitis severity in the bile salt and secretagogue models was evaluated at the time of sacrifice by quantitating hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema (i.e. pancreatic water content), pancreatic inflammation (i.e. pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity), and acinar cell injury/necrosis as described previously (7Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Andrade-Gordon P. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G388-G395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Randomly selected regions of the pancreas were used for measurements involving the gland in the caerulein-induced model as that model is characterized by changes that are diffusely distributed within the gland. On the other hand, pancreatic measurements in the bile salt models were all made using portions of the pancreatic head as those models are characterized by changes that are primarily, and most reproducibly, localized to the pancreatic head. For this purpose, the mouse pancreatic head was defined as the portion of the gland that is located within 5 mm of the lesser duodenal curvature.Diet-induced pancreatitis was elicited by feeding female mice (13–15 g) a choline-deficient 0.5% ethionine-supplemented diet (3 g diet/24 h) for 72 h preceded by a 24-h period of fasting as described previously (12Frossard J.L. Saluja A. Bhagat L. Lee H.S. Bhatia M. Hofbauer B. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). They were then given regular diet ad libitum and observed for an additional 3 days. Pancreatitis severity in the diet-induced model was evaluated by quantitation of animal mortality occurring within 2 or 3 days of resuming the regular diet.Preparation of Pancreatic Acini and Fragments for in Vitro Studies—Pancreatic acini (1–100 cells per cluster) were freshly prepared for each experiment using collagenase digestion as described previously (13Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G686-G695Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For studies involving amylase secretion and trypsinogen activation, the acini were filtered through a 150-μm Nitex® filter. Small pancreatic acini (1–10 cells per cluster) used to evaluate calcium transients or lactate dehydrogenase leakage were filtered through a 40-μm Nitex® filter. For preparation of pancreatic fragments, freshly harvested portions of pancreas were minced, in the absence of collagenase, to create small (<0.2-mm3) pieces as described previously (4Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22140-22149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Measurement of Calcium Transients within Single Acinar Cells—Freshly prepared small pancreatic acini (1–10 cells per cluster) were pre-loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM in the presence of 0.0005% Pluronic F-127 for 10 min at room temperature followed by extensive washing, and calcium transients in single cells within the acinar cluster were monitored using a Nikon Eclipse TEU 2000 inverted microscope as described previously (13Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G686-G695Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interference filters on a rotational filter wheel allowed selection of alternate excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm from a xenon light source. Images of fluorescence emission at 510 nm were collected and sent, via an intensified charge-couple device, to a dedicated digital image analysis system (IPLAB 3.6 with ratio plus, Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Background subtraction was carried out independently at each of the excitation wavelengths. The ratios of fluorescence emission (510 nm) at the two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were determined and expressed as the ratio of 340/380 fluorescence. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), when present, was added 30 min prior to addition of caerulein or sodium taurocholate. When present, 1 mm of the PAR2-activating peptide (SLIGRL), the reverse PAR2-activating peptide (LRGILS), or the PAR1-activating peptide (TFLLR) were also added at the same time as caerulein or sodium taurocholate. All peptides were dissolved in the same buffer in which the cells had been suspended (i.e. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing sodium pyruvate and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) (4Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22140-22149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G686-G695Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Other Measurements—Cell injury, after exposure to sodium taurocholate, was quantitated by measuring the rate of LDH leakage over 20 min. LDH was measured by determining the rate of increase in absorption at 340 nm because of the conversion of NAD+ to NADH as l-lactate is converted to pyruvate. For this purpose, LDH leakage/20 min was expressed as a percent of total LDH content (measured after lysis with 0.5% Triton X-100). When present, 5 μm (0.1 mg/ml) SBTI was added 30 min prior to addition of caerulein or sodium taurocholate, and the 1 mm of the PAR-related peptides SLIGRL, LRGILS, and TFLLR was added coincident with caerulein or sodium taurocholate. Activation of JNK was evaluated, by immunoblot analysis, monitoring formation of p-JNK as described previously (4Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22140-22149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For this purpose, cytoplasmic extracts were exposed to antibodies directed against p-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and p-JNK levels were expressed as a fraction of total JNK.Analysis of Data—The results reported in this study are expressed as mean ± S.E. values obtained from four or more independent experiments (in vivo studies) or three or more independent experiments each analyzed in duplicate (in vitro studies). In all figures, the vertical bars denote S.E. values. Statistical evaluation of data was accomplished using Student's t test when two groups were compared and analysis of variance when multiple groups were compared. A p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate significant difference. The calcium results were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A p value of ≤0.0083, which is the Bonferroni adjusted p-value to control the experimentwise alpha at 0.05 when there are six comparisons, was considered to indicate significant difference.RESULTSDifferential Effects of PAR2 Deletion on Bile Salt- and Secretagogue-induced Pancreatitis—Experimental pancreatitis was induced in wild type and PAR2–/– mice by either retrogradely infusing 50 μl of 2% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct or by administering 12-h supramaximally stimulating doses (50 μg/kg) of caerulein. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the start of pancreatitis induction, and the severity of pancreatic injury was evaluated by quantitating hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema (i.e. pancreatic water content), pancreatic inflammation (i.e. pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity), and the extent of morphometrically detectable acinar cell injury/necrosis.As shown in Fig. 1, the effects of PAR2 deletion on pancreatic injury during sodium taurocholate-induced and caerulein-induced pancreatitis were markedly different. In the bile salt-induced model, PAR2 deletion was associated with markedly reduced levels of hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and acinar cell injury necrosis but similar levels of inflammation (Fig. 1, panels A and C). In contrast, in the secretagogue-induced model, PAR2 deletion was associated with a significant increase in the extent of acinar cell injury/necrosis and pancreatic inflammation but not in hyperamylasemia or edema (Fig. 1, panels B and C).Similar studies were performed in which an alternative bile salt (TLCS) was infused into the pancreatic duct, and the results of those studies are shown in Fig. 2. As had been observed following infusion of sodium taurocholate, retrograde ductal infusion of TLCS (50 μl, 3 mm (i.e. 0.18%)) resulted in hyperamylasemia, pancreatic edema, and extensive acinar cell injury/necrosis, but PAR2 deletion markedly reduced the extent of each of these features of pancreatic injury. In contrast to these observations noted in the bile salt and secretagogue-induced models of pancreatitis, no change in the mortality rate of choline deficient diet-induced pancreatitis was associated with genetic deletion of PAR2 (see supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Effect of PAR2 deletion on pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of TLCS. Pancreatitis was induced by either retrograde ductal infusion with NaCl alone or 3 mm (0.18%) TLCS. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the start of pancreatitis induction, and pancreatitis severity was quantitated by measuring serum amylase activity, pancreatic water content (i.e. edema), and acinar cell injury/necrosis (panel A). Results obtained from wild type (WT) mice (open columns) were compared with those obtained from PAR2–/– mice (closed columns). Results shown are mean ± S.E. values for four animals in each group. Asterisks denote p < 0.05 in bracketed groups. Micrographs (panel B) are of hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples obtained from animals that received 3 mm TLCS. Note the reduction in edema and necrosis in the sample obtained from a PAR2–/– mouse subjected to TLCS-induced pancreatitis compared with the sample obtained from a wild type animal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, our results indicate that the effects of PAR2 deletion on pancreatic injury during pancreatitis are highly dependent upon the model of pancreatitis that is being studied. PAR2 deletion reduces pancreatic injury in bile salt-induced pancreatitis, and this presumably indicates that PAR2 activation promotes pancreatic injury in wild type animals subjected to bile salt-induced pancreatitis. In contrast, PAR2 deletion increases pancreatic injury in secretagogue-induced pancreatitis, and this presumably indicates that PAR2 activation exerts a protective effect in wild type animals experiencing secretagogue-induced pancreatitis.We also quantitated the effects of PAR2 deletion on pancreatic inflammation in the sodium taurocholate and caerulein-induced models by measuring pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity. The worsening of caerulein-induced pancreatic injury that was associated with PAR2 deletion was paralleled by a similar worsening of pancreatic inflammation in that model (Fig. 1, panel B). In contrast, the protection against sodium taurocholate-induced injury that was associated with PAR2 deletion was not paralleled by any change in pancreatic inflammation (Fig. 1, panel A). This latter observation is consistent with recently reported findings indicating that pancreatic injury and inflammation during pancreatitis may be separately regulated phenomena (4Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22140-22149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Our unexpected and surprising finding that PAR2 has diametrically contrasting effects on the severity of pancreatic injury in the two models suggested that PAR2 expression and activation might exert its opposite effects on injury severity by differentially effecting early and critical acinar cell events that ultimately lead to acinar cell injury during pancreatitis. To address this possibility, we embarked on a series of in vitro studies aimed at characterizing the effects of PAR2 expression and activation on some of those events as follows: (a) intra-acinar cell activation of trypsinogen; (b) generation of pathological intra-acinar cell calcium transients; (c) acinar cell injury; and (d) intra-acinar cell activation of the MAP kinase JNK.Genetic Deletion of PAR2 Does Not Alter the Extent of Trypsinogen Activation That Is Observed When Pancreatic Acini Are Exposed to Either 0.2% Sodium Taurocholate or to a Supramaximally Stimulating Concentration of Caerulein—Time-dependent intra-acinar cell activation of trypsinogen has been observed previously to occur when acini are incubated, in vitro, with bile salts or supramaximally stimulating concentrations of caerulein (14Leach S.D. Modlin I.M. Scheele G.A. Gorelick F.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Fischer L. Gukovskaya A.S. Penninger J.M. Mareninova O.A. Friess H. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: G875-G886Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We evaluated the role of PAR2 in this process by comparing the extent of bile salt-and caerulein-induced trypsinogen activation that was observed in acini prepared from wild type mice to that observed in acini prepared from PAR2–/– mice. As expected, incubation of wild type acini with either sodium taurocholate (0.2%) or caerulein (100 nm) led to the rapid appearance of trypsin activity, but the time course, as well as the magnitude, of this response was not different from that observed when acini prepared from PAR2–/– mice were similarly tested (supplemental Fig. 2). These observations indicate that the process of intra-acinar caerulein-induced and bile salt-induced activation of trypsinogen and the level of active trypsin reached as a result of that trypsinogen activation are not subject to regulation by PAR2.Differential Effects of PAR2 Deletion on Bile Salt- and Secretagogue-induced Acinar Cell Calcium Transients—Pancreatic acini obtained from wild type and PAR2–/– mice were loaded with Fura-2/AM, and calcium transients following exposure to varying concentrations of sodium taurocholate and caerulein were monitored in individual cells. Three response patterns to sodium taurocholate were identified as follows: (a) type I response was defined as one in which repeated oscillations of [Ca2+]i levels, superimposed upon a stable and flat resting free [Ca2+]i, were observed; (b) type II response was defined as one in which repeated Ca2+ oscillations were superimposed upon a peak plateau rise and fall of [Ca2+]]i; and (c) type III response was defined as one characterized by a sudden fall in Fura-2 fluorescence to a level below the initial base line (Fig. 3, panel A). Type I responses have, in general, been considered to be “physiological responses,” triggered when pancreatic acinar cells are exposed to secretory doses of secretagogues (13Sharma A. Tao X. Gopal A. Ligon B. Steer M.L. Perides G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G686-G695Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Sjodin L. Dahlen H.G. Gylfe E. J. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W1993043881,"Background Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Radioresistance of lung cancer cells results in unacceptable rate of loco-regional failure. Although radiation is known to induce apoptosis, our recent study showed that knockdown of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax resulted in an increase in autophagic cell death and lung cancer radiosensitivity in vitro. To further explore the potential of apoptosis inhibition as a way to sensitize lung cancer for therapy, we tested M867, a novel chemical and reversible caspase-3 inhibitor, in combination with ionizing radiation in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Findings M867 reduced clonogenic survival in H460 lung cancer cells (DER = 1.27, p = 0.007) compared to the vehicle-treated treated cells. We found that administration of M867 with ionizing radiation in an in vivo mouse hind limb lung cancer model was well tolerated, and produced a significant tumor growth delay compared to radiation alone. A dramatic decrease in tumor vasculature was observed with M867 and radiation using von Willebrand factor staining. In addition, Ki67 index showed >5-fold reduction of tumor proliferation in the combination therapy group, despite the reduced levels of apoptosis observed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining. Radiosensitizing effect of M867 through inhibiting caspases was validated using caspase-3/-7 double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cell model. Consistent with our previous study, autophagy contributed to the mechanism of increased cell death, following inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, matrigel assay showed a decrease in in vitro endothelial tubule formation during the M867/radiation combination treatment. Conclusions M867 enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation on lung cancer and its vasculature both in vitro and in vivo. M867 has the potential to prolong tumor growth delay by inhibiting tumor proliferation. Clinical trials are needed to determine the potential of this combination therapy in patients with locally advanced lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2034537262,"PML gene was discovered as a fusion partner with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha in the t(15:17) chromosomal translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Nuclear PML protein has been implicated in cell growth, tumor suppression, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and anti-viral defense. The localization pattern of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is drastically altered during viral infection. This alteration is traditionally viewed as a viral strategy to promote viral replication. Although multiple PML splice variants exist, we demonstrate that the ratio of a subset of cytoplasmic PML isoforms lacking exons 5 & 6 is enriched in cells exposed to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In particular, we demonstrate that a PML isoform lacking exons 5 & 6, called PML Ib, mediates the intrinsic cellular defense against HSV-1 via the cytoplasmic sequestration of the infected cell protein (ICP) 0 of HSV-1. The results herein highlight the importance of cytoplasmic PML and call for an alternative, although not necessarily exclusive, interpretation regarding the redistribution of PML that is seen in virally infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041497864,"In addition to the molecular feedback loops, electrical activity has been shown to be important for the function of networks of clock neurons in generating rhythmic behavior. Most studies have used over-expression of foreign channels or pharmacological manipulations that alter membrane excitability. In order to determine the cellular mechanisms that regulate resting membrane potential (RMP) in the native clock of Drosophila we modulated the function of Shaw, a widely expressed neuronal potassium (K(+)) channel known to regulate RMP in Drosophila central neurons.We show that Shaw is endogenously expressed in clock neurons. Differential use of clock gene promoters was employed to express a range of transgenes that either increase or decrease Shaw function in different clusters of clock neurons. Under LD conditions, increasing Shaw levels in all clock neurons (LNv, LNd, DN(1), DN(2) and DN(3)), or in subsets of clock neurons (LNd and DNs or DNs alone) increases locomotor activity at night. In free-running conditions these manipulations result in arrhythmic locomotor activity without disruption of the molecular clock. Reducing Shaw in the DN alone caused a dramatic lengthening of the behavioral period. Changing Shaw levels in all clock neurons also disrupts the rhythmic accumulation and levels of Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) in the dorsal projections of LNv neurons. However, changing Shaw levels solely in LNv neurons had little effect on locomotor activity or rhythmic accumulation of PDF.Based on our results it is likely that Shaw modulates pacemaker and output neuronal electrical activity that controls circadian locomotor behavior by affecting rhythmic release of PDF. The results support an important role of the DN clock neurons in Shaw-mediated control of circadian behavior. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a central role of Shaw for coordinated and rhythmic output from clock neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1973492470,"During gastrulation of the amphibian embryo, specification of the three germ layers, endo-, ecto-, and mesoderm, is regulated by maternal and zygotic mechanisms. Although it is known that mesoderm specification requires the cooperation between TGF-β signaling and p53 activity and requires maternal factors, essential zygotic factors have been elusive. Here, we report that the Zn-finger protein XFDL156 is an ectodermal, zygotic factor that suppresses mesodermal differentiation. XFDL156 overexpression suppresses mesodermal markers, and its depletion induces aberrant mesodermal differentiation in the presumptive ectoderm. Furthermore, we find that XFDL156 and its mammalian homologs interact with the C-terminal regulatory region of p53, thereby inhibiting p53 target gene induction and mesodermal differentiation. Thus, XFDL156 actively restricts mesodermal differentiation in the presumptive ectoderm by controlling the spatiotemporal responsiveness to p53."
https://openalex.org/W2048027476,"Steroids and free fatty acids (FFA) are noncompetitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Their site of action is purportedly located at the lipid-AChR interface, but their exact mechanism of action is still unknown. Here we studied the effect of structurally different FFA and steroids on the conformational equilibrium of the AChR in Torpedo californica receptor-rich membranes. We took advantage of the higher affinity of the fluorescent AChR open channel blocker, crystal violet, for the desensitized state than for the resting state. Increasing concentrations of steroids and FFA decreased the KD of crystal violet in the absence of agonist; however, only cis-unsaturated FFA caused an increase in KD in the presence of agonist.

Some bind to the resting state of the AChR (tetracaine and 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-iodophenyl)diazirine), whereas others (e.g. phencyclidine, ethidium, chlorpromazine) preferentially bind to the desensitized form at equilibrium.

Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 200-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that both exogenous and endogenous FFA and steroids localize inside the membrane, binding to common sites at the lipid-AChR interface (26Fernández Nievas G.A. Barrantes F.J. Antollini S.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3503-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These molecules are likely to modulate the AChR function by a mechanism of action different from that exerted by hydrophilic inhibitors. For ligands acting at the lipid-protein interface, essentially two mechanisms of AChR inhibition can be considered, (a) displacement of an essential lipid from the protein-lipid interface or (b) changes in the physical properties of the lipid bilayer. The muscle AChR is a pentamer composed of four different but homologous subunits in the stoichiometry α2βγδ. Each subunit contains a relatively large extracellular domain and four hydrophobic segments referred to as M1-M4, proposed to be membrane-spanning segments, and ends with a short extracellular carboxyl-terminal domain. Three concentric rings can be distinguished in the AChR transmembrane (TM) region (27Barrantes F.J. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2003; 6: 620-632PubMed Google Scholar, 28Barrantes F.J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 47: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The M2 TM segments of all subunits outline the inner ring and form the walls of the ion channel proper; M1 and M3 constitute the middle ring, and the M4 segments form the outer ring, which is in closest contact with the AChR lipid microenvironment. Thus, an important portion of the AChR surface is exposed to the TM region, in contact with the surrounding lipids, establishing cross-talk between lipids and the protein moiety (27Barrantes F.J. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2003; 6: 620-632PubMed Google Scholar, 28Barrantes F.J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 47: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Subunit interactions, which are crucial for AChR activation, have been postulated to involve not only the AChR extracellular domain but also TM domains (29Hansen S.B. Taylor P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Marsh and Barrantes (30Marsh D. Barrantes F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4329-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) identified a layer of immobilized lipids surrounding the AChR distinct from the bulk lipids and postulated this layer as a possible site of pharmacological action. Criado et al. (31Criado M. Vaz W.L. Barrantes F.J. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) followed the kinetics of agonist-induced state transitions and showed that AChR function is sensitive to its lipid environment, postulating that the full function requires the presence of cholesterol or analogs. Sunshine and McNamee (32Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1108: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), reconstituting the AChR in different lipid environments, concluded that the lipid composition is more important than the bulk membrane fluidity in determining the AChR ion channel function; however, they subsequently indicated that the specific molecular structure of cholesterol was not key for sustaining AChR function and pointed to the hydrophobicity of the neutral lipids as the major factor in supporting AChR activity (33Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They also found a marked lipid dependence on the rate of agonist-induced desensitization, suggesting that the membrane lipid environment can directly affect the conformational changes responsible for desensitization. Different combinations of lipids appear to induce the same, final desensitized conformation of the AChR as produced by prolonged exposure to agonist (34McCarthy M.P. Moore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Narayanaswami et al. (35Narayanaswami V. Kim J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12413-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) postulated that relatively fluid layers of lipid surrounding the AChR, probably with an optimal fluidity, are responsible for facilitating AChR conformational changes. Studies from our laboratory indicated the presence of distinct sites at the AChR lipid interface for cholesterol and phospholipids (36Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this paper we studied the effect of structurally different FFA and steroids on the AChR conformational equilibrium in native Torpedo californica membranes using a fluorescent dye that has a higher affinity for the desensitized state of the AChR in an attempt to understand the effect of these two types of hydrophobic molecules on the modulation of the AChR and to discriminate between direct and indirect modes of action. The results indicate that there are two levels of AChR conformational modulation. First, the mere presence of FFA or steroids can directly drive the AChR out of its native-resting-conformation; second, perturbations of membrane polarity prevent the AChR from reaching the agonist-induced desensitized state. T. californica specimens obtained from the Pacific coast of California were killed by pithing, and the electric organs were dissected and stored at -70 °C until further use. Laurdan and pyrene-maleimides were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Affi-Gel® 10 Gel and dithiothreitol were obtained from Bio-Rad. Synthetic lipids and 5-spin labeled fatty acid (5-SLFA) were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Crystal Violet (CrV) and all the others drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Preparation of AChR-rich Membranes—Membrane fragments rich in AChR were prepared from the electric tissue of T. californica as described previously (37Barrantes F.J. Hucho F. Neuroreceptors. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1982: 315-328Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, electric tissue was chopped into small pieces, homogenized under controlled conditions using a Virtis homogenizer, and submitted to a series of centrifugation steps ending in a high speed sucrose gradient centrifugation. Specific activities on the order of 2.0–2.8 nmol of α-bungarotoxin sites/mg of protein were obtained in the middle, AChR-rich membrane fraction (37Barrantes F.J. Hucho F. Neuroreceptors. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1982: 315-328Crossref Google Scholar). The orientation of AChR in the membrane vesicles was determined as described by Hartig and Raftery (38Hartig P.R. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by comparing the total toxin binding sites in the presence of Triton X-100 and the right-side-out toxin binding sites in the absence of detergent as in previous work from our laboratory (39Gutierrez-Merino C. Bonini de Romanelli I.C. Pietrasanta L.I. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4846-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the fluorescence measurements, AChR-rich membranes and N-PyrM-AChR were suspended in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) at a final concentration of 100 μg of protein/ml (0.4 μm) or 20 μg/ml, respectively. The optical density of the membrane suspension was kept below 0.1 to minimize light scattering. Preparation of Steroid and Free Fatty Acid Solutions—Cortisone and hydrocortisone (HC) were dissolved in (1:1) ethanol: DMSO. FFAs were dissolved in ethanol. In all cases the amount of organic solvent added to the samples was kept below 0.5%. After each steroid or FFA addition, samples were kept at 25 °C for 30 min to allow equilibration of the added hydrophobic compounds with the membrane. Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorimetric measurements were performed in an SLM model 4800 fluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) using a vertically polarized light beam from Hannovia 200-W mercury/xenon arc obtained with a Glan-Thompson polarizer (4-nm excitation and emission slits) and 1-ml quartz cuvettes. The temperature was set at 25 °C with a thermostatted circulating water bath (Haake, Darmstadt, Germany) except when indicated otherwise. CrV Fluorescent Measurements—CrV was dissolved in buffer A at three different stock concentrations (10, 50, and 350 μm) and stored at -20 °C for posterior titration experiments. For the fluorescence measurements, AChR-rich membranes were suspended in buffer A. The samples were titrated with CrV. After each addition, the samples were incubated for 15 min to allow equilibration, and then the emission spectra were collected. CrV was excited at 600 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were collected from 605 to 700 nm. A background spectrum (obtained from the same cuvette before CrV addition) was subtracted from the emission spectra obtained in the presence of CrV, and the maximum intensity (at 623–625 nm) was measured. To determine the CrV dissociation constants (KD), the value of CrV maximum fluorescence emission was plotted as a function of the logarithmic CrV concentration (molarity), the resulting sigmoid curve was fitted to the Boltzmann function, and the KD was calculated. To test the magnitude of the nonspecific drug binding (40Lurtz M.M. Pedersen S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we also undertook control experiments using membrane fractions from T. californica devoid of AChR. After obtaining the crude membrane fraction by differential centrifugation, an additional sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed, and three distinct membrane bands were obtained (37Barrantes F.J. Hucho F. Neuroreceptors. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1982: 315-328Crossref Google Scholar). The middle band is highly enriched in AChR (“AChR-rich membranes”), whereas the top band has less AChR protein, and the bottom band is devoid of AChR protein. Thus, the bottom band was used as a control for CrV unspecific labeling (see the supplemental figure). The nonspecific signal was found to be small and, therefore, does not introduce significant changes in the results showing the KD of CrV. PLA2 Treatment of AChR-rich Membranes—AChR-rich membranes were suspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 35 mm KCl, pH 8.0) in the presence of 1.5 enzymatic units of PLA2 (from Naja naja venom) and incubated at room temperature with gentle stirring. Aliquots were taken at different times to obtain different degrees of phospholipid degradation. The reaction was stopped by a 10-fold dilution with cold phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Finally, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and kept at -60 °C until use (26Fernández Nievas G.A. Barrantes F.J. Antollini S.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3503-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Görne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Generalized Polarization (GP) Determination—After AChR-rich membrane incubation with the exogenous hydrophobic compound, Laurdan was added to give a final probe concentration of 0.6 μm and incubated in the dark for 1 h (36Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16653-16662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42Antollini S.S. Soto M.A. Bonini de Romanelli I. Gutierrez-Merino C. Sotomayor P. Barrantes F.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1275-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GP values, obtained from emission spectra obtained with an excitation wavelength of 290 and 360 nm for Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) or direct excitation, respectively, were calculated as GP = (I434 - I490)/(I434 + I490), where I434 and I490 are the emission intensities at the characteristic wavelength of the gel and liquid-crystalline phases, respectively (43Parasassi T. De Stasio G. d'Ubaldo A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 44Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Affinity Column Preparation and AChR Purification—T. californica crude membranes (2 mg/ml protein concentration) were solubilized in 1% sodium cholate for 45 min and then centrifuged for 1 h at 74,000 × g to discard the insoluble material. The AChR was purified by affinity chromatography in the presence of synthetic lipids (45daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 46daCosta C.J. Wagg I.D. McKay M.E. Baezinger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14967-14974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the affinity column was prepared by coupling cystamine to Affi-Gel 10, reduction with dithiothreitol, and final modification with bromoacetylcholine bromide. The supernatant was applied to the affinity column. To facilitate complete exchange of endogenous for defined lipids, the column was then washed with a linear gradient of defined lipids (POPC:POPA:cholesterol 3:1:1; where POPC is palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, and POPA is palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidic acid) dissolved in dialysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.8) and containing 1% cholate, from 1.3 to 3.2 mm and then to 0.13 mm lipid concentration (45daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The AChR was then eluted from the column with a 0.13 mm lipid solution in 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, with 0.5% cholate and 10 mm carbamoylcholine (Carb). After elution from the column, the AChR was dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer with five buffer changes (every 12 h) at 4 °C. The AChR purification was checked by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (47Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were stored at -70 °C until use. N-(1-Pyrenyl)maleimide AChR Labeling—The labeling of TM AChR cysteines was performed according to Li et al. (48Li L. Schuchard M. Palma A. Pradier L. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5428-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Narayanaswami et al. (35Narayanaswami V. Kim J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12413-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, purified AChR (1 mg/ml) solubilized in 1% cholate was incubated in the presence of N-PyrM final concentration of 1 mm for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The solution was centrifuged for 45 min at 70,000 × g to pellet aggregates. The supernatant was dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer with five buffer changes (every 12 h) at 4 °C and stored at -70 °C until use. N-PyrM-AChR samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE, and the N-PyrM label was visualized under a UV transilluminator showing that the band corresponding to the γ-subunit was predominantly labeled, as shown in previous work (35Narayanaswami V. Kim J. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12413-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Quenching with Acrylamide and Spin-label Free Fatty Acid—Quenching experiments were developed with N-PyrM-AChR. Excitation wavelength was 345 nm, and the fluorescence emission scanning was from 360 nm up to 500 nm. The maximum pyrene fluorescence emission was recorded at 374 nm. To confirm that the pyrene label was at the TM segments of the AChR, a sample of N-PyrM-AChR was titrated with acrylamide, a water-soluble quencher, up to a concentration of 500 mm. To corroborate the correct quenching process, the intrinsic Trp emission was recorded at 330 nm on the same samples (290-nm excitation wavelength). N-PyrM-AChR samples (20 μg/ml) were first titrated with steroid (HC) or different FFA up to 600 or 60 μm, respectively, and control samples were obtained with the addition of only the vehicle of the exogenous compounds. For each sample, sequential additions of 5-SLFA dissolved in ethanol were performed. After each addition, samples were kept for 30 min at 25 °C before the fluorescence measurement to allow equilibration of the 5-SLFA with the membrane. From the fluorescence data, Stern-Volmer plots were obtained according to the equation Fo/F = 1 + Ksv[Q], where Fo and F correspond to the fluorescence emission of pyrene-labeled AChR in the absence and presence of 5-SLFA, respectively, [Q] is the concentration of the quencher, and Ksv is the Stern-Volmer constant (49Lakowicz R.L. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 239-243Google Scholar). Ksv is a measure of the quencher concentration in the vicinity of the fluorophore, which allowed us to obtain topological information on the transverse location of the labeled cysteine. Aminotriarylmethane dyes share structural similarities with many known NCA of the AChR: (a) the presence of aromatic groups, (b) tertiary or quaternary amines and (c) a net positive charge. Lurtz and Pedersen (40Lurtz M.M. Pedersen S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CrV, one such compound, displays higher affinity for the D conformation (in the presence of agonist) than for the R conformation (in the absence of agonist) of the AChR. We took advantage of these differences in affinity to monitor AChR conformational states in the presence of two types of low affinity NCA of the AChR; that is, steroids and FFA. These molecules share the characteristic of being highly hydrophobic compounds. We recently demonstrated that these lipids exert their action on the TM domain of the AChR (26Fernández Nievas G.A. Barrantes F.J. Antollini S.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3503-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which they cause AChR inhibition is not yet known. Steroids Induce a Conformational Change of the Resting to the Desensitized AChR State—To study whether the presence of steroids affects the AChR conformational equilibrium, AChR-rich membranes from T. californica were first incubated with increasing concentrations (100–600 μm) of steroid (cortisone or HC). Carb was subsequently added to a subset of these membranes, and then all samples were titrated with CrV (Fig. 1a). Remarkably, in the absence of agonist, the curves furnished in the presence of steroid were displaced toward those in the D state. In the presence of agonist, the curves obtained with or without steroid (control) were similar. In the absence of agonist, HC produced a concentration-dependent diminution of the KD of the R state, which approached that of the (control) KD of the D state (Fig. 1b). Free Fatty Acids Modify Both the Resting and the Desensitized State of the AChR—We next studied the effect of different exogenous FFA. AChR-rich membranes from T. californica were incubated with increasing concentrations of different cis-unsaturated FFA (cis-FFA) (arachidonic acid, cis-20:4; linolenic acid, cis-18:3; oleic acid, cis-18:1) followed by the addition of 1 mm Carb to a subset of samples (Fig. 2a). A diminution of the KD of CrV was observed when the membranes were treated with cis-18:1 in the absence of agonist. A statistically significant increase in the value of KD was observed in the presence of agonist. Similar results were obtained for cis-20:4 and cis-18:3 (data not shown). Experiments were also performed with saturated FFA (sFFA). AChR-rich membranes from T. californica were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of arachidic acid (20:0) or stearic acid (18:0). In contrast to what was observed with cis-FFA (Fig. 2a), the KD obtained showed no statistically significant changes either in the absence or presence of agonist (Fig. 2b). A third structural class of FFA, with trans isomerism, was also tested (Fig. 2c); elaidic acid (trans-18:1). The observed effects may be due to differential partitioning of the fatty acids into the membrane and not to the chemical properties of the different acyl chains. The magnitude of the incorporation of different FFA to AChR-rich membranes was extensively characterized in a previous work from our laboratory using the fluorescence probe ADIFAB (acrylodan-derivatized intestinal fatty acid binding protein) (50Antollini S.S. Barrantes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1249-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The calculated partition coefficient values allowed us to classify the FFA into three different groups; 1) highly hydrophobic FFA (such as 20:0 and 18:0), 2) less hydrophobic FFA (such as cis-18:1 and trans-18:1), and 3) more hydrophilic FFA (such as 18:0, 18:2, 18:3, 20:4, and 22:6). Here we used FFA from the three groups (20:0, cis and trans 18:1, cis-18:3, and cis-20:4), and the observed effects show no relation with the degree of FFA partition, since the most hydrophobic FFA (i.e. the one exhibiting the highest membrane partition coefficient) did not display any effect, and the two FFA with similar partition coefficients (cis and trans 18:1) showed very different effects. Free Fatty Acids and Steroids Together Modify Both Conformational States of the AChR—The combined effects of FFA and steroids were studied next. Toward this end steroid (HC) or FFA (oleic acid) were added to AChR-rich membranes from T. californica at saturating concentrations (cf. Figs. 1 and 2), and the second lipid was added subsequently, also at saturating concentration (Fig. 3). The order of addition of the two types of lipids did not matter; either combination resulted in similar final states of the AChR both in the presence or absence of agonist. Furthermore, when CrV was added in the presence of agonist, the KD values obtained from samples treated with both HC and oleic acid were similar to those obtained with oleic acid alone.

https://openalex.org/W1979615635,"Meprin (EC 3.4.24.18) is an oligomeric metalloendopeptidase found in microvillar membranes of kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells. Here, we present the first report on the expression of meprin beta in rat glomerular epithelial cells and suggest a potential involvement in experimental glomerular disease. We detected meprin beta in glomeruli of immunostained rat kidney sections on the protein level and by quantitative RT-PCR of laser-capture microdissected glomeruli on the mRNA level. Using immuno-gold staining we identified the membrane of podocyte foot processes as the main site of meprin beta expression. The glomerular meprin beta expression pattern was altered in anti-Thy 1.1 and passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). In addition, the meprin beta staining pattern in the latter was reminiscent of immunostaining with the sheep anti-Fx1A antiserum, commonly used in PHN induction. Using Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that meprin beta is recognized by Fx1A antiserum and may therefore represent an auto-antigen in PHN. In anti-Thy 1.1 glomerulonephritis we observed a striking redistribution of meprin beta in tubular epithelial cells from the apical to the basolateral side and the cytosol. This might point to an involvement of meprin beta in this form of glomerulonephritis."
https://openalex.org/W2008978327,"G2E3 is a putative ubiquitin ligase (E3) identified in a microarray screen for mitotic regulatory proteins. It shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, concentrating in nucleoli and relocalizing to the nucleoplasm in response to DNA damage. In this study, we demonstrate that G2E3 is an unusual ubiquitin ligase that is essential in early embryonic development to prevent apoptotic death. This protein has a catalytically inactive HECT domain and two distinct RING-like ubiquitin ligase domains that catalyze lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination. To address in vivo function, we generated a knock-out mouse model of G2E3 deficiency that incorporates a beta-galactosidase reporter gene under control of the endogenous promoter. Animals heterozygous for G2E3 inactivation are phenotypically normal with no overt change in development, growth, longevity, or fertility, whereas G2E3 null embryos die prior to implantation. Although normal numbers of G2E3(-/-) blastocysts are present at embryonic day 3.5, these blastocysts involute in culture as a result of massive apoptosis. Using beta-galactosidase staining as a marker for protein expression, we demonstrate that G2E3 is predominantly expressed within the central nervous system and the early stages of limb bud formation of the developing embryo. In adult animals, the most intense staining is found in Purkinje cell bodies and cells lining the ductus deferens. In summary, G2E3 is a dual function ubiquitin ligase essential for prevention of apoptosis in early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2032174240,"Given the relative abundance of modern human DNA and the inherent impossibility for incontestable proof of authenticity, results obtained on ancient human DNA have often been questioned. The widely accepted rules regarding ancient DNA work mainly affect laboratory procedures, however, pre-laboratory contamination occurring during excavation and archaeological-/anthropological handling of human remains as well as rapid degradation of authentic DNA after excavation are major obstacles.We avoided some of these obstacles by analyzing DNA from ten Viking Age subjects that at the time of sampling were untouched by humans for 1,000 years. We removed teeth from the subjects prior to handling by archaeologists and anthropologists using protective equipment. An additional tooth was removed after standard archaeological and anthropological handling. All pre-PCR work was carried out in a ""clean- laboratory"" dedicated solely to ancient DNA work. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted and overlapping fragments spanning the HVR-1 region as well as diagnostic sites in the coding region were PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. Consistent results were obtained with the ""unhandled"" teeth and there was no indication of contamination, while the latter was the case with half of the ""handled"" teeth. The results allowed the unequivocal assignment of a specific haplotype to each of the subjects, all haplotypes being compatible in their character states with a phylogenetic tree drawn from present day European populations. Several of the haplotypes are either infrequent or have not been observed in modern Scandinavians. The observation of haplogroup I in the present study (<2% in modern Scandinavians) supports our previous findings of a pronounced frequency of this haplogroup in Viking and Iron Age Danes.The present work provides further evidence that retrieval of ancient human DNA is a possible task provided adequate precautions are taken and well-considered sampling is applied."
https://openalex.org/W2070053309,"The NR4A nuclear receptor family member Nur77 (NR4A1) promotes thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes, but may also function in mature extrathymic T cells. We studied the effects of over-expression of Nur77 on the apoptosis of murine peripheral T cells, including thymic-derived Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells. Overexpression of Nur77 in the T cell lineage decreased numbers of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells by ∼80% compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, the proportions of Treg cells were markedly increased in the thymus (61% of CD4+Foxp3+ singly positive thymocytes vs. 8% in WT) and secondary lymphoid organs (40–50% of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells vs. 7–8% in WT) of Nur77 transgenic (Nur77Tg) mice, and immunoprecipitation studies showed Nur77 was associated with a recently identified HDAC7/Foxp3 transcriptional complex. Upon activation through the T cell receptor in vitro or in vivo, Nur77Tg T cells showed only marginally decreased proliferation but significantly increased apoptosis. Fully allogeneic cardiac grafts transplanted to Nur77Tg mice survived long-term with well-preserved structure, and recipient splenocytes showed markedly enhanced apoptosis and greatly reduced anti-donor recall responses. Allografts in Nur77Tg recipients had significantly increased expression of multiple Treg-associated genes, including Foxp3, Foxp1, Tip60 and HDAC9. Allograft rejection was restored by CD25 monoclonal antibody therapy, indicating that allograft acceptance was dependent upon Treg function in Nur77Tg recipients. These data show that compared to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, Foxp3+ Tregs are relatively resistant to Nur77-mediated apoptosis, and that tipping the balance between the numbers of Tregs and responder T cells in the early period post-transplantation can determine the fate of the allograft. Hence, induced expression of Nur77 might be a novel means to achieve long-term allograft survival."

Donor binding is dominated by the higher affinity of the XXXG moiety (G = Glcβ(1→4) and X = Xylα(1→6)Glcβ(1→4)) of the substrate for positive subsites, whereas negative subsites have a more relaxed specificity, able to bind (and transfer to the acceptor) a cello-oligosaccharyl moiety of hybrid substrates such as GGGGXXXG.

IntroductionThe plant cell wall, a composite structure of cellulose, hemi-celluloses, pectin, lignin, and structural proteins, is continually modified during cell growth and differentiation.

It forms hydrogen bonds with cellulose microfibrils and provides a molecular tether between adjacent microfibrils by forming a three-dimensional cellulose-XG network (4Pauly M. Andersen L.N.

Xyloglucan consists of a cellulose-like main chain of β(1→4)-linked d-glucosyl residues, some of which are substituted at C-6 with α-d-xylosyl and β-d-galactosyl-(1→2)-α-d-xylosyl residues. Some of the 2-hydroxyl groups of the β-galactosyl units are α-l-fucosylated (1Carpita N. McCann M. Buchanan B. Gruissem W. Jones R. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants.

High molecular mass xyloglucans are hydrolyzed by microbial and plant endo-β-glucanases to xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGOs), which constitute the repetitive structural units of the XG polysaccharide (8Gilbert H.J.

They cleave the xyloglucan chains and transfer the enzyme-bound XG fragment to another XG molecule, thus allowing transient loosening of the cell wall and also incorporation of nascent XG during expansion. XETs and xyloglucan endo-hydrolases (XEHs), encoded by the XTH (xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase) gene family (15Rose J.K. Braam J. Fry S.C. Nishitani K.

XETs and a few XEHs belong to glycoside hydrolase family GH16 (18Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 19Coutinho P.M.

It involves the participation of two catalytic carboxylic amino acid residues, a general acid/base, and a nucleophile. First, the catalytic nucleophile attacks the anomeric carbon of the substrate at the scissile glycosidic bond assisted by proton transfer from the general acid residue to form a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In a second inverting step, an acceptor XG or XGO (in XET enzymes) or an acceptor water molecule (in XEH enzymes) attacks the intermediate after activation by general base catalysis, leading to the transglycosylation or hydrolysis product with overall retention of configuration. Formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is supported by the observation that XET from nasturtium seeds is able to form a relatively stable intermediate complex with XG from which the enzyme can be released by adding a suitable glycosyl acceptor (22Sulová Z. Takacova M. Steele N.M. Fry S.C. Farkaš V. Biochem.

Whereas some aspects about acceptor specificity have been analyzed using XGOs, less is known about the donor requirements. Besides the XG polysaccharide, a few XGOs such as XXXGXXXG and mixtures of XNNGXNNG (where N = Xor L), all obtained from enzymatic XG degradation, have also proven to be donor substrates for XET (17Baumann M.J.

However, a detailed study of substrate specificity requires a larger set of oligosaccharides of different sizes and containing different substitution patterns to be probed as donor substrates and for quantitative kinetic analysis.A XET isozyme from poplar (PttXET16–34) is being subjected to structure-function analysis to establish the details of the catalytic mechanism and the determinants of substrate specificity. The x-ray structures of the free enzyme and an enzyme-ligand complex have been obtained (30Johansson P. Brumer III, H. Baumann M.J. Kallas A.M. Henriksson H. Denman S.E. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and mutation of the catalytic nucleophile has been shown to inactivate the enzyme and render a glycosynthase (31Piens K. Henriksson A.M. Gullfot F. Lopez M. Fauré R. Ibatullin F.M. Teeri T.T. Driguez H. Brumer H. Org. Biomol.

XXXGXXXG was shown to be a good donor substrate and was used to kinetically characterize PttXET16–34 (35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S. Piens K. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Planas A. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).To undertake a detailed analysis of substrate specificity, we embarked on the preparation of a xylogluco-oligosaccharide library using a chemoenzymatic approach (34Fauré R. Saura-Valls M. Brumer III, H. Planas A. Cottaz S. Driguez H. J. Org. Chem. 2006; 71: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the development of an activity assay for kinetic evaluation of low molecular mass donors (35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S.

Here, we report the detailed kinetic analysis of donor substrates to define the specificity of PttXET16–34 by active-site mapping. Considering the extended binding site cleft composed of positive and negative subsites, with the site of bond cleavage and transfer between subsites –1 and +1 (Scheme 1A), the donor substrates span the entire active-site cleft. All were assayed with the same acceptor compound (XXXG-8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS)), so by systematically altering the sugar moieties binding the positive and negative subsites, respectively, a detailed description of substrate specificity and the contribution of subsites to binding and catalysis was obtained.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Enzyme—PttXET16–34 (formerly PttXET16A (36Kallas A.M.

Enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a calculated ϵ of 72,970 m–1 cm–1. ANTS and sodium cyanoborohydride were from Fluka. The donor library and labeled XXXG-ANTS acceptor were obtained by chemoenzymatic syntheses as reported (34Fauré R. Saura-Valls M. Brumer III, H. Planas A. Cottaz S. Driguez H. J. Org. Chem. 2006; 71: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S. Piens K. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Planas A. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Compounds 17 and 18 were obtained following the same methodology. The chemical structures of the donors and synthetic details are provided in the supplemental material.High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis (HPCE)—The HPCE method was developed and validated previously (35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S. Piens K. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Planas A. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Capillary electrophoresis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard HP3D CE G1600 AX system with a fused silica capillary of 72-cm effective length and 50-μm internal diameter with an extended light path bubble (150 μm) in the detection window. Electrophoretic separation was performed at –30 kV at a constant temperature of 30 °C under inverted electro-osmotic flow conditions with 50 mm phosphoric acid adjusted to pH 2.5 with triethylamine as running buffer and UV detection at 270 nm (20-nm slit).ANTS-derivatized Xylogluco-oligosaccharide Standards—Each donor substrate (10 nmol) was dissolved in a solution of ANTS (0.15 m) in AcOH/water (10 μl, 3:17, v/v). A solution of NaCNBH3 (1 m) in freshly purified tetrahydrofuran (10 μl) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 7 h at 55 °C. The crude reaction was freeze-dried. Derivatized products were redissolved in water and used as HPCE standards without further purification.Donor Concentrations—Lyophilized donor compounds purified by silica gel chromatography (34Fauré R. Saura-Valls M. Brumer III, H. Planas A. Cottaz S. Driguez H. J. Org. Chem. 2006; 71: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were dissolved in water to an approximate concentration of 20 mm. The final concentration of the stock solutions to be used in enzyme kinetics was determined by HPCE. An aliquot of each stock solution was derivatized with ANTS as described above, and the concentration was determined by interpolation of peak areas to a standard curve (area versus concentration) prepared with highly pure XXXG-ANTS as used previously for HPCE method validation (35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S. Piens K. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Planas A. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic analysis was performed in citrate (50 mm)/phosphate (50 mm) buffer (I = 0.5 M) with added KCl at pH 5.5 and 30 °C. For kcat/Km determinations, donor concentrations were between 0.3 and 1 mm, the acceptor (XXXG-ANTS) concentration was 5 mm, and enzyme concentrations were between 0.3 and 8.4 μm. For GalGXXXGXXXG (18) kinetics, the donor was varied from 0.5 to 7 mm, the acceptor (XXXG-ANTS) from 0.3 to 7 mm, and PttXET16–34 from 0.05 to 0.2 μm. For reaction monitoring, product identification, and yields at 24 h, 1 mm donor, 5 mm acceptor (XXXG-ANTS), and 3 μm PttXET16–34 were used. In all cases, aliquots of the reaction mixture (20 μl) were taken at different time intervals, diluted with 20 μl of 2 mm Man-ANTS as internal standard, and boiled for 10 min to stop the enzymatic reaction. Samples were analyzed by HPCE, and product concentrations were calculated from the relative areas to the internal standard for each peak assuming the same response factor for all compounds because all share the same chromophore. Initial rates were calculated as the slope of product concentration versus time. Yields (%) after 24-h reactions were expressed as the concentration of each product detected relative to the maximal concentration that would be obtained for that product considering all transfer reactions leading to the same product.RESULTSLibrary of Donor Substrates and HPCE Activity AssayA library of xylogluco-oligosaccharides has been synthesized previously (34Fauré R. Saura-Valls M. Brumer III, H. Planas A. Cottaz S. Driguez H. J. Org. Chem. 2006; 71: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for donor specificity studies of XET enzymes. Here, kinetics with PttXET16–34 were analyzed to define the substrate requirements for catalysis and to map the binding site of the enzyme. Donors have been grouped in two families to probe separately the acceptor and donor subsites of the binding site cleft (Scheme 1B). Family I donors have a common nonreducing part (XXXG-) and differ on the reducing end substructure (for mapping positive subsites), whereas Family II donors differ on the nonreducing end and share a common reducing end substructure (for mapping negative subsites). Compounds 16-18 with a Gal residue on the nonreducing end are also included in Family II donors. All of these compounds were assayed as donor substrates for PttXET16–34 using a heptasaccharide derivatized with ANTS as acceptor (XXXG-ANTS). Reactions were monitored by the HPCE method developed for the separation and quantitation of ANTS-labeled transferase products (35Saura-Valls M. Fauré R. Ragás S. Piens K. Brumer H. Teeri T.T. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Planas A. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).All donor compounds of the library were derivatized by reductive amination with ANTS to obtain standards for HPCE analysis. Because all ANTS-derivatized xylogluco-oligosaccharides have the same negative charge, their separation on capillary electrophoresis is based on size and shape. Under inverted electro-osmotic flow conditions at pH 2.5, the electrophoretic mobility correlates well with the log of molecular mass as shown in Fig. 1.FIGURE 1Correlation between molecular mass (Log (MW)) and electrophoretic mobility by HPCE (migration time (tm)) for ANTS-derivatized xylogluco-oligosaccharides and xyloglucan oligosaccharides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Donor Reactivity and Product IdentificationFirst, enzymatic reactions at 1 mm donor and 5 mm acceptor were monitored under standard conditions (pH 5.5, 30 °C) to detect reaction products after 24 h by HPCE. Products were identified by co-injection with standard compounds (ANTS-derivatized xylogluco-oligosaccharides), and yields were calculated from the electropherograms by the relative peak areas using Man-ANTS as an internal standard (35Saura-Valls M.

Results are summarized in Table 1, in which the detected products and their molar yields after 24 h are given for each donor substrate. For analysis of the transferase specificity, donors were grouped on the basis of their variable substructure on either the reducing or nonreducing end moiety.TABLE 1Product formation and substrate reactivity for PttXET16–34-catalyzed transglycosylations of donors 1–18 and XXXG-ANTS as acceptorDonorProductsaTransglycosylation products identified by HPCE (co-injection with standard compounds) after 24-h reactions.Yield at 24 hbYields for each transglycosylation product after 24 h of incubation (1 mm donor, 5 mm XXXG-ANTS acceptor, 3 mm PttXET16-34).kcat/Kmckcat/Km values for the first transglycosylation product under initial rate conditions under which no other transglycosylation products were detected (0.3-1 mm donor, 5 mm XXXG-ANTS acceptor, 0.3-8.4 mm PttXET16-34).%m-1 s-1XXXG-GG (1Carpita N.

https://openalex.org/W1991744490,"In T4 phage, coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis is carried out by an eight-protein complex termed the replisome. The control of lagging strand DNA synthesis depends on a highly dynamic replisome with several proteins entering and leaving during DNA replication. Here we examine the role of single-stranded binding protein (gp32) in the repetitive cycles of lagging strand synthesis. Removal of the protein-interacting domain of gp32 results in a reduction in the number of primers synthesized and in the efficiency of primer transfer to the polymerase. We find that the primase protein is moderately processive, and this processivity depends on the presence of full-length gp32 at the replication fork. Surprisingly, we find that an increase in the efficiency of primer transfer to the clamp protein correlates with a decrease in the dissociation rate of the primase from the replisome. These findings result in a revised model of lagging strand DNA synthesis where the primase remains as part of the replisome after each successful cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. A delay in primer transfer results in an increased probability of the primase dissociating from the replication fork.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The T4 replisome is made up of eight proteins, all of which have counterparts in more complex organisms such as Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and humans (2Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis is carried out in a 5′ to 3′ direction by T4 DNA polymerase (gp43), which together with the clamp protein (gp45) makes up the holoenzyme complex (3Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme can form through several different routes, all dependent on the activity of the clamp loader protein (gp44/62) (4Smiley R.D. Zhuang Z. Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7990-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Zhuang Z. Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7976-7989Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The clamp loader is an AAA+ protein that uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to chaperone the holoenzyme assembly process (6Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The T4 primosome moves along the lagging strand DNA template in the 5′ to 3′ direction and is composed of a hexameric helicase (gp41) that unwinds the duplex DNA and an oligomeric primase (gp61) that synthesizes pentaribonucleotide primers at 5′-GTT and 5′-GCT sequences to initiate repetitive Okazaki fragment synthesis (7Zhang Z. Spiering M.M. Trakselis M.A. Ishmael F.T. Xi J. Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The helicase is loaded onto the lagging strand template by the helicase loader protein (gp59) (9Barry J. Alberts B. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). gp59 plays an additional role as a “gatekeeper” of the replisome by coordinating the assembly of the primosome with the initiation of leading strand DNA synthesis through a direct interaction with the leading strand polymerase (11Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21561-21569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Xi J. Zhang Z. Zhuang Z. Yang J. Spiering M.M. Hammes G.G. Benkovic S.J.

Finally, gp32 plays a central role in most aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA replication (14Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P. Formosa T. Jongeneel C.V. Kreuzer K.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 655-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gp32 protein coats the ssDNA produced by the primosome and is thought to be involved in the coordination of lagging strand synthesis (15Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). gp32 is made up of N-terminal, C-terminal, and core domains (16Waidner L.A. Flynn E.K. Wu M. Li X. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (domain B for “basic”) is involved in cooperative ssDNA binding. Removal of residues 1-21 completely eliminates ssDNA binding cooperativity (17Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Villemain J.L. Ma Y. Giedroc D.P. Morrical S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31496-31504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The major function of the highly acidic C-terminal domain (residues 254-301, domain A for “acidic”) is to interact with other T4 proteins (19Krassa K.B. Green L.S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography using gp32-agarose has detected interactions between gp32 and itself, gp43, gp45, and gp59 (14Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P. Formosa T. Jongeneel C.V. Kreuzer K.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). gp32 also has been shown to co-purify with gp61 (21Burke R.L. Munn M. Barry J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1711-1722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of domain A abolishes interaction with all of these proteins (19Krassa K.B. Green L.S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The core domain is responsible for the recognition and binding of ssDNA (22Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R.

The T4 replisome appears to be the most dynamic of the well characterized replisomes, with the primase, clamp loader, clamp, and ssDNA-binding protein all exchanging with solution proteins during coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis (23Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Yang J. Valentine A.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49839-49849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, the DNA polymerase is “dynamically processive,” meaning solution polymerase is capable of displacing the replicating polymerase during active replication without prior disassembly of the holoenzyme complex (25Yang J. Zhuang Z. Roccasecca R.M. Trakselis M.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8289-8294Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, only the hexameric helicase remains at the replication fork for the lifetime of the replisome (26Schrock R.D. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16678-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is thought that many of these dynamic processes are related to the mechanism of repeated lagging strand synthesis. However, very little is known about the timing and rates of protein dissociation or how they may control lagging strand synthesis. Because of the opposite polarities of the leading and lagging strand template, the two polymerase holoenzymes must copy their templates in opposite directions (27Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1987; 317: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This fact, coupled with the observation that the lagging strand polymerase is resistant to dilution, led to the proposal of the “trombone model” for DNA replication (14Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P. Formosa T. Jongeneel C.V. Kreuzer K.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 655-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model links the two holoenzyme complexes and loops the lagging strand template into a structure resembling a trombone slide so that replication on both strands can occur in the same apparent direction. This model adequately explains why the lagging strand is synthesized in short 1-2-kb Okazaki fragments, whereas the leading strand is continuous. The lagging strand polymerase must repeatedly release from its position on the lagging strand template and recycle to the newly synthesized primer to begin a new round of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Presumably, interactions between the lagging strand polymerase and other components at the replication fork allow the polymerase to remain as part of the replisome during the recycling process. The signal for lagging strand polymerase release and recycling has been a subject of intense investigation (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Carver T.E. Sexton D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14409-14417Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Chastain P.D. Makhov A.M. Nossal N.G. Griffith J.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to act as the trigger for lagging strand release and recycling. The two with the most support are the collision and the signaling models. The collision model states that the collision of the lagging strand polymerase with the 5′ end of the previous Okazaki fragment causes the primase to synthesize an RNA primer and the polymerase to release from the lagging strand template and recycle to the newly made primer. In the signaling model, the lagging strand polymerase releases from the DNA as the result of events that are associated with the synthesis or capture of the RNA primer. There is substantial support for both of these models, and it is likely that both mechanisms are operable during lagging strand synthesis (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Support for the collision model comes from data indicating that the dissociation rate of the holoenzyme is drastically increased upon collision with the 5′ end of both DNA and RNA primers (29Carver T.E. Sexton D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14409-14417Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that new Okazaki fragments can be initiated without completion of the previous fragment, indicating that the polymerase recycling via collision is not necessary (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The responsiveness of primer utilization efficiency and Okazaki fragment size to the concentration of clamp and clamp loader led us to suggest that clamp loading onto the RNA primer could serve as the signal for lagging strand polymerase release and recycling (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Computer simulations of lagging strand synthesis using a simple stochastic model incorporating the rate of primase association, primer synthesis, and clamp loading onto the newly synthesized primer accurately described the observed distribution of Okazaki fragments produced in vitro (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If clamp loading does serve as the signal for lagging strand polymerase dissociation, then primer handoff must follow an indirect pathway where the primase transfers the primer to the clamp loader and clamp proteins before the release and recycling of the lagging strand polymerase. This pathway is similar to that as described in the E. coli system and contrasts that of the T7 replisome (32Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O’Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we report on experiments that highlight the interplay between the ssDNA-binding protein, primase, clamp, and clamp loader during the initiation of lagging strand synthesis. We examined the effect of removing the protein interaction domain of gp32 (gp32-A) on primer synthesis, primer utilization, and primase processivity. We found that total primer synthesis is drastically reduced in the presence of gp32-A, and a reduction in the efficiency of primer transfer from the primase to the polymerase is also observed. These effects combine to produce abnormally long Okazaki fragments with a broad distribution ranging from 0.2 to 10 kb. Using an inactive primase trap protein, we find that the rate of dissociation of the primase from the replisome is dependent on the concentration of clamp and clamp loader proteins, as well as the presence of intact gp32. The fast dissociation rate of primase in the presence of gp32-A can be compensated for by high concentrations of clamp and clamp loader. Based on these results, we present a more elaborate model for lagging strand DNA synthesis where the primase remains as part of the replisome through successful cycles Okazaki fragment initiation. If primer handoff is delayed, the primase has a higher probability of dissociating from the replication fork, and if this occurs, a new primase must enter the replisome from solution to begin a new round of primer synthesis. [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dGTP, and [α-32P]CTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled ribonucleotides were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Bacteriophage T4 replication proteins gp41, gp61, gp43, gp44/62, gp45, gp32, and primase trap protein were purified as described previously (24Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Yang J. Valentine A.M.

Single-stranded M13 phage DNA (ssM13) was purified from infected XL1-Blue cells by polyethylene glycol precipitation and phenol extraction as described (35Sambrook J.F. Maniatis T. Sambrook J.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 431-432Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotide used in the priming assays was 5′-AGAGGGAGATTTAGATGAGATGATTGAGGATGGAGATGTTGATGGAGAGATGATGAATGATGAGATGAGGG-3′. Expression and Purification of gp32-A and gp32-B Mutant Proteins—The gp32-A-petIMPACT or gp32-B-petIMPACT plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and grown (separately) in 20 ml of Luria broth (LB) overnight at 37 °C. The expression and purification of gp32-A and gp32-B were identical. The overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into two 1-liter flasks of LB and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. The cultures were then allowed to cool to 18 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 16 h of shaking, cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g and resuspended in 80 ml of chitin column binding buffer containing one protease inhibitor pellet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed using sonication, and cell debris was pelleted at 25,000 × g. Cell-free extract was loaded onto a 5-ml chitin column and washed with 200 column volumes of chitin binding buffer. The chitin resin was then resuspended in binding buffer plus 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 48 h at 4 °C to facilitate intein-mediated cleavage. Following cleavage, gp32-A or gp32-B proteins were eluted, dialyzed into storage buffer, and analyzed for purity using SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 38690 m-1 cm-1 for both gp32-A and gp32-B. Standard Minicircle Replication Reactions and Measurement of Primer Utilization—Replication reactions were carried out in a standard replication buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 125 mm KOAc, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2) at 37 °C. The standard conditions used to assemble and initiate the replication reaction consisted of the following: 100 nm minicircle substrate; 200 nm each of gp43, gp45 (as trimer), and gp44/62; 600 nm each of monomer gp41, gp61, and gp59; 0.5 μm of gp32; 100 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP; 2 mm ATP; 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, in a typical reaction volume of 12 μl. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2.5 min followed by a 10-fold dilution into replication buffer containing gp43, gp44/62, gp45, gp61, gp59, ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP at the standard concentrations. Wild-type or gp32 mutant was included in the dilution buffer at a concentration of 2 μm along with 25 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP or [α-32P]dCTP for visualization of leading or lagging strands, respectively. 20-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and quenched with a half-volume of 0.5 m EDTA. The quenched reactions were analyzed with either DE81 filter binding assays or alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (34Yang J. Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49828-49838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the filter binding assay, an 8-μl sample of the quenched reaction aliquot was spotted onto DE81 filters and allowed to air dry for ∼5 min. The filters were then washed 10 times with 100 ml of 300 mm ammonium formate or until the wash had an insignificant level of radioactivity as determined by a hand-held Geiger counter. Following the ammonium formate washes, the filters were washed once with 100% EtOH and allowed to air-dry for 30 min. Once dried, the filters were placed in LSC vials with 5 ml of Ecoscint LSC mixture in each vial and counted with single channel liquid scintillation counting. For the analysis of replication products using alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis, 10 μl of the quenched reaction aliquot was mixed with 10 μl of loading dye (50% glycerol and 0.1% Orange G) and loaded onto a 15 × 25-cm 1% agarose gel in 30 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA. The samples were run at 40 V for 24 h in 30 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA buffer. After running, the gels were removed from their trays and neutralized by soaking in 1× TBE buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The neutralized gels were then dried onto a sheet of DE81 paper using a stack of paper towels to facilitate gel drying. After 4 h of drying with the paper towels, the gel and filter sheet were vacuum-dried. The dried gel and DE81 filter paper were then exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager plate and analyzed using a Storm 800 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). To measure primer utilization, the standard replication reaction was performed by replacing [α-32P]dCTP with [α-32P]CTP in the dilution buffer. The reactions were quenched with an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA at 2, 4, and 8 min after dilution. Reaction products were then mixed with loading dye (formamide with 0.2% xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue) and run on a 20% urea-acrylamide gel at 25 mA for 3 h at room temperature. The gel was then removed from the glass plates, wrapped in plastic film, and directly exposed to a PhosphorImager plate overnight. The PhosphorImager plate was analyzed using the Storm PhosphorImager. The total number of primers synthesized was calculated by summing the signal from the free and utilized primers. The percent primer utilization was determined by dividing the signal from utilized primers by the total number of primers. Single-stranded DNA Priming Assays—Priming reactions were carried out in the standard replication buffer containing 0.4 μm gp41, 0.4 μm gp61, 100 nm gp59 (ssM13 reactions only), 2 μm gp32 (wild-type or mutant where indicated), 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, and either 10 nm M13 ssDNA or 3 μm ssDNA oligonucleotide (strands) in a typical reaction volume of 25 μl. Approximately 20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP per reaction was used for labeling the primer. For dilution experiments using the primase trap protein, the reactions were initiated using the same protein, nucleotide, and ssM13 concentrations as above except that wt-gp32 was used exclusively in the pre-dilution reaction. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 2.5 min before a 10-fold dilution into buffer containing only nucleotides, trap protein (3 μm), and either wt-gp32 or gp32-A. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and quenched with an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Priming products were analyzed by 20% urea-acrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography was accomplished as described above. Leading and Lagging Strand Replication with Wild-type and Mutant gp32 Proteins—The replisome was assembled using a low concentration wild-type gp32 (0.5 μm), followed by 10-fold dilution into replication buffer containing 2 μm wild-type or mutant gp32. This allows for the assembly and initiation of leading and lagging strand synthesis under normal conditions, followed by a rapid exchange of ssDNA-bound protein with the excess of protein in the dilution buffer (23Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The minicircle DNA substrate was used so that the leading and lagging strand could be independently monitored using alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis or DE81 filter binding assays (Fig. 1). We examined the leading and lagging strand replication products with gp32-A, gp32-B, wt-gp32, and no gp32 in the dilution buffer (Fig. 2). Omission of gp32 from the dilution buffer leads to the inhibition of both leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. This is a consequence of the rapid production of uncoated ssDNA that chelates the distributive replisomal proteins (e.g. gp45, gp44/62) and has been previously observed by us and others (15Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4387-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Inclusion of gp32-A in the dilution buffer results in helicase-dependent leading strand DNA synthesis that is very similar to the reaction containing wt-gp32 in the dilution buffer. However, when compared with the wt-gp32 reaction, there is a significant increase in the amount of helicase-independent strand displacement synthesis (indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 2). This is likely because of a reduction in the ability of gp59 to “lock” the polymerase in an inhibited state in the absence of a gp59-gp32 interaction (37Lefebvre S.D. Wong M.L. Morrical S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22830-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lagging strand DNA synthesis in the presence of gp32-A is reduced compared with the amount of leading strand synthesis produced in the same reaction, although the fragments tend to be longer. This indicates that the leading and lagging strand polymerases have become uncoupled (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Leading and lagging strand replication in the presence of gp32-B protein is reduced in a manner very similar to the reaction performed with gp32 omission. Presumably, the loss of cooperativity in ssDNA binding reduces the overall affinity to a level where gp32-B does not bind to ssDNA. For this reason, we focused our efforts at understanding the effects of gp32-A on lagging strand synthesis. We next examined the lagging strand products of reactions carried out with wt-gp32 or gp32-A in the dilution buffer in more detail. To equalize the relative amounts of signal in the reactions, we increased the amount of α-32P by 5-fold in the gp32-A reaction (Fig. 3). This enables an accurate determination of both the average Okazaki fragment length and the size distribution. As shown, the average length of Okazaki fragments in the gp32-A reaction is 2.3 times longer than the wt-gp32 reaction, and the size distribution is much broader in the presence of gp32-A (0.1-8 kb) as compared with the wild-type enzyme (0.1-2 kb). The production of longer Okazaki fragments can be caused by a decrease in either the primer synthesis rate or in the efficiency of primer handoff, or both (28Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine what mechanism is responsible for the increase in Okazaki fragment length in the presence of gp32-A, we carried out full replisome replication assays in the presence of [α-32P]CTP to label RNA primers produced by the primase. The products of these reactions were analyzed using urea-PAGE and quantitated as shown in Fig. 4. This analysis reveals both a decrease in the total primers synthesized (Fig. 4A) and in the percentage of primers being used for Okazaki fragment initiation by gp32-A (Fig. 4B). The decrease in primer number is not the result of fewer replication forks or a decrease in the amount of lagging strand template produced because the assembly of the replisome is carried out under identical conditions for both gp32-A and wt-gp32 reactions, and leading strand DNA synthesis is not affected by the gp32-A mutant (Fig. 2). The decrease in total primer synthesis could be the result of a reduction in catalytic efficiency of the primase protein itself (presumably through the loss of interaction with gp32) or a reduction in the number of replisomes containing primase (i.e. a decrease in binding rate or increase in dissociation rate). To determine whether gp32 directly affects the catalytic activity of the primase protein, we examined the activity of the primase using an ssDNA oligonucleotide containing a single priming recognition site. Under the conditions of this assay, the formation of a helicase-primase-DNA complex is efficient, and thus the overall rate of primer synthesis depends on the activity of the primase protein itself (i.e. the kcat for the priming reaction). Additionally, the loading of primase and helicase onto the ssDNA oligon"

Elevated levels of PLTP in transgenic mice result in decreased HDL and increased atherosclerosis. PLTP is present in human atherosclerotic lesions, where it seems to be macrophage derived. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the atherogenic potential of macrophage derived PLTP.Here we show that macrophages from human PLTP transgenic mice secrete active PLTP. Subsequently, we performed bone marrow transplantations using either wild type mice (PLTPwt/wt), hemizygous PLTP transgenic mice (huPLTPtg/wt) or homozygous PLTP transgenic mice (huPLTPtg/tg) as donors and low density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice (LDLR-/-) as acceptors, in order to establish the role of PLTP expressed by bone marrow derived cells in diet-induced atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis was increased in the huPLTPtg/wt-->LDLR-/- mice (2.3-fold) and even further in the huPLTPtg/tg-->LDLR-/- mice (4.5-fold) compared with the control PLTPwt/wt-->LDLR-/- mice (both P<0.001). Plasma PLTP activity levels and non-HDL cholesterol were increased and HDL cholesterol decreased compared with controls (all P<0.01). PLTP was present in atherosclerotic plaques in the mice as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and appears to co-localize with macrophages. Isolated macrophages from PLTP transgenic mice do not show differences in cholesterol efflux or in cytokine production. Lipopolysaccharide activation of macrophages results in increased production of PLTP. This effect was strongly amplified in PLTP transgenic macrophages.We conclude that PLTP expression by bone marrow derived cells results in atherogenic effects on plasma lipids, increased PLTP activity, high local PLTP protein levels in the atherosclerotic lesions and increased atherosclerotic lesion size."
https://openalex.org/W1988959734,"Acetylcholinesterase tetramers are inserted in the basal lamina of neuromuscular junctions or anchored in cell membranes through the interaction of four C-terminal t peptides with proline-rich attachment domains (PRADs) of cholinesterase-associated collagen Q (ColQ) or of the transmembrane protein PRiMA (proline-rich membrane anchor). ColQ and PRiMA differ in the length of their proline-rich motifs (10 and 15 residues, respectively). ColQ has two cysteines upstream of the PRAD, which are disulfide-linked to two AChET subunits (“heavy” dimer), and the other two subunits are disulfide-linked together (“light” dimer). In contrast, PRiMA has four cysteines upstream of the PRAD. We examined whether these cysteines could be linked to AChET subunits in complexes formed with PRiMA in transfected COS cells and in the mammalian brain. For comparison, we studied complexes formed with N-terminal fragments of ColQ, N-terminal fragments of PRiMA, and chimeras in which the upstream regions containing the cysteines were exchanged. We also compared the effect of mutations in the t peptides on their association with the two PRADs. We report that the two PRADs differ in their interaction with AChET subunits; in complexes formed with the PRAD of PRiMA, we observed light dimers, but very few heavy dimers, even though such dimers were formed with the PQ chimera in which the N-terminal region of PRiMA was associated with the PRAD of ColQ. Complexes with PQ or with PRiMA contained heavy components, which migrated abnormally in SDS-PAGE but probably resulted from disulfide bonding of four AChET subunits with the four upstream cysteines of the associated protein.

Neurosci. 2006; 30: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Heteromeric complexes containing ColQ are attached to the basal lamina at neuromuscular junctions, whereas complexes containing PRiMA are anchored in cell membranes and represent the major AChE species in the brain (3Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the t peptide forms an amphiphilic α-helix, with a sector containing seven aromatic residues that are strictly conserved in all vertebrate cholinesterases (AChE, as well as butyryl cholinesterase (BChE)) (4Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although AChET and other AChE variants can form dimers through an association zone located in the catalytic domain (the “four-helix bundle,” formed by two helices from each subunit) and an intercatenary disulfide bond through a C-terminal cysteine (5Morel N. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37379-37389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), only AChET subunits form tetramers and associate with anchoring proteins through an assembly of four C-terminal t peptides, also called tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domains. Aromatic residues play a major role in the association of four t peptides with proline-rich motifs that exist in the N-terminal regions of ColQ and PRiMA (3Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 6Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These motifs are sufficient for the association with t peptides, and have been called proline-rich attachment domains (or PRADs). It should be noted that these quaternary associations do not require intercatenary disulfide bonds, although such bonds can be formed between the structural proteins and cysteines located near the C terminus of the t peptides. The assembly of AChET with ColQ has been studied in detail using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses of oligomers produced in transfected cells (6Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Belbeoc'h S. Falasca C. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as well as crystallographic studies of a complex formed between synthetic t and PRAD peptides (8Dvir H. Harel M. Bon S. Liu W.Q. Vidal M. Garbay C. Sussman J.L. Massoulié J. Silman I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4394-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this complex, 4 α-helical t peptides form a coiled coil around the PRAD of ColQ, organized as a polyproline II helix. The aromatic residues of the t peptides are oriented toward the inside of this compact cylinder, and in particular, three evenly spaced tryptophans of each t peptide are closely stacked with the proline rings. The four t peptides are parallel and the PRAD is oriented in the opposite direction, in agreement with the fact that cysteines located at position –4 from the C terminus of each t peptide can form disulfide bonds either between pairs of t peptides or with two adjacent cysteines located upstream of the prolines in ColQ (2Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2006; 30: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although ColQ and PRiMA appear to form similar quaternary complexes with AChET subunits, they differ markedly in the number of prolines in their PRADs (8 in ColQ, 14 in PRiMA). A recent analysis of deletions in PRiMA showed that the recruitment of AChET subunits into tetramers was severely reduced by the removal of the last three prolines and the residues that follow, even though the resulting mutant still contained a longer proline-rich motif than ColQ (9Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the numbers and dispositions of the cysteines are very different in ColQ (2 adjacent cysteines, located 4 and 5 residues upstream of the first proline) and in PRiMA (4 cysteines located 2, 4, 8, and 15 residues upstream of the first proline, plus a cysteine located 13 residues downstream of the last proline). The organization of the complexes may thus be somewhat different. PRiMA was first discovered as a 20-kDa hydrophobic protein associated with membrane-bound AChE tetramers purified from bovine brain (10Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein could be labeled with the hydrophobic reagent [125I]TID, and after denaturation under nonreducing conditions, it was found to be disulfide-linked with a dimer of AChET subunits. This arrangement appeared similar to that observed with ColQ, in which half of the catalytic subunits are linked to the binding protein, forming a “heavy” dimer, and the other half are associated together, forming a “light” dimer (4Bon S. Dufourcq J. Leroy J. Cornut I. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Roberts W.L. Doctor B.P. Foster J.D. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7481-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cysteines of PRiMA that could form intercatenary disulfide bonds with the C-terminal cysteine of the t peptides were not identified. We now report an analysis of the AChET-PRiMA complexes. To compare the PRADs of PRiMA and ColQ, we also studied the soluble, secreted complexes formed by co-expressing AChET subunits with N-terminal fragments of PRiMA and ColQ and with chimeras in which we exchanged the regions preceding the PRADs and containing the cysteines that could form intercatenary disulfide bonds. We mutated the four cysteines of PRiMA individually and in combination, and we analyzed the presence of intercatenary disulfide bonds in nonreducing SDS-gel electrophoresis. We had previously shown that the deletion of the entire N-terminal region of PRiMA does not abolish its quaternary association with four AChET subunits (9Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that the cysteines are not essential. Contrary to our expectations, we found very few heavy dimers in the complexes formed with the PRAD of PRiMA. In some complexes, all four AChET subunits appeared to be disulfide-linked to PRiMA, whereas in others, they were associated only in pairs (light dimers). In addition, a mutation of the last aromatic residue in the t peptide (Y31G) differently affected the formation of complexes with the PRADs of ColQ and PRiMA. Therefore, the quaternary organizations of AChET tetramers associated with ColQ and PRiMA appear to be somewhat different. cDNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All constructs were expressed in the pEF-BOS vector (13Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 14Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al. (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Rat AChET subunits and full-length mouse PRiMA (PRiMA I) were tagged with an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) inserted before the stop codon at the C terminus of the t peptide of rat AChET, and of PRiMA I. We also added the HA epitope between the putative signal sequence and the N terminus of these proteins. In this case, the signal peptide is predicted by the SignalP site to be cleaved immediately upstream of the HA epitope, and this was verified by the fact that the anti-HA antibody recognized the mature proteins. Tryptophan 17 and tyrosines 20 and 31 (numbering of the t peptide) were mutated to glycines. All or some of the cysteines in the N-terminal domain of PRiMA were mutated to serines. Constructs encoding N-terminal domains of ColQ and PRiMA, containing the PRADs, were obtained by inserting stop codons at the indicated positions (e.g. Qs45, Ps46) (Fig. 1). In the QN-HC construct, which was described previously (16Duval N. Krejci E. Grassi J. Coussen F. Massoulié J. Bon S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3255-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the N-terminal region of ColQ, containing the PRAD, is fused to a GPI addition signal derived from the Torpedo AChEH subunit. This construct produces GPI-anchored AChE tetramers, which can be compared with PRiMA-anchored tetramers. The regions preceding the PRADs were exchanged in the chimeric constructs QP and PQ. The sequences of the mature proteins (without signal peptides) are shown in Fig. 1. Transfection of COS Cells—COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (17Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using 2 μg of DNA encoding rat AChET and various amounts of pEF-BOS vector encoding the binding proteins per 60-mm dish. In all series of transfections, which differed in the level of binding proteins, we completed to the same amount of total vector DNA with pEF-BOS encoding a noninteracting protein (ΔPRAD), a ColQ N-terminal fragment from which the PRAD was deleted (6Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After transfection, COS cells were incubated for 3–4 days at 37 °C in a medium containing 10% NuSerum (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland) that had been pretreated with 10–5 m soman to inactivate serum cholinesterases. Extracts from Transfected COS Cells and from Rat and Mouse Brain—Three days after transfection, the cells were collected and homogenized in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 2.5 mm benzamidine, a protease inhibitor, at 20 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The culture media were also collected for analysis of secreted AChE. Two g of brain dissected from 2-month-old rats or from adult mice were frozen in liquid N2, cut in small pieces, and homogenized in a Potter glass-Teflon homogenizer with 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm benzamidine). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant constituted the low salt-soluble fraction. The pellet was subjected to another cycle of extraction in 1.9 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, yielding the detergent-soluble fraction. Determination of AChE Activity—AChE activity was determined by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (18Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20603) Google Scholar) using acetylthiocholine as substrate. Enzyme samples (usually 10 μl) were added to 0.2 ml of Ellman assay medium, and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm with a Labsystems Multiskan RC automatic plate reader (Helsinki, Finland). Optical density was recorded at 20-s intervals over a period of 10 min. Under those conditions, 1 mOD corresponds to the hydrolysis of 22.5 pmol of acetylthiocholine. Sedimentation Analysis in Sucrose Gradients, Gel Filtration Chromatography, and Nondenaturing Electrophoresis—For sedimentation analyses, 100–300-μl samples were mixed with Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase as internal sedimentation markers, deposited onto 5–20% sucrose gradients (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, in the presence of 1% Brij-97 or 0.2% Triton X-100), and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 36,000 rpm for 17.5 h at 6 °C. Fractions of ∼100 μl were collected and assayed for AChE, β-galactosidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities as described previously (9Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed in a Biogel A 15-m column (95 cm long, 1.5 cm in diameter) to determine the Stokes radii of complexes. The flow rate was about 10 ml/h, and fractions were collected every 10 min. The void volume was determined with blue dextran and the total volume with potassium ferricyanide. The standards used were thyroglobulin (8.6 nm, 19.4 S, 669 kDa), β-galactosidase (6.9 nm, 16 S, 464 kDa), apoferritin (6.3 nm, 17.6 S, 443 kDa), and alkaline phosphatase (3.3 nm, 6.1 S, 87 kDa). Electrophoresis in horizontal nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels was performed as described previously (19Bon S. Lamouroux A. Vigny A. Massoulié J. Mallet J. Henry J.P. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1100-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and AChE activity was revealed by the histochemical method of Karnovsky and Roots (20Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar). Western Blots—For analysis of proteins by Western blotting, samples were submitted to electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. We used colored proteins as mass standards (PAGE regular prestained protein ladder SM0671 from Fermentas; HiMark prestained HMW protein standard LC5699 from Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, proteins from the gel were electroblotted with the Bio-Rad mini-Protean II Trans-Blot system onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Applied Science) for 1.5 h. After transfer, the membrane was saturated with 5% milk powder in a buffer containing Tween-20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.6) for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 16 °C with the appropriate antibodies: goat polyclonal anti-AChE antibody E-19, raised against the N-terminal region of mouse AChE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) were used at 1:1,000 dilution. As shown in the supplemental material on line, other commercial anti-AChE antibodies were found to label other proteins. The sensitivity of anti-HA antibodies was much higher than that of E-19; we used samples containing about 5 mOD/min of AChE activity for immunodetection with anti-HA and about 100 mOD/min for immunoblots with E-19. The secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat and anti-rabbit antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. The immunocomplexes were visualized using the ECL method (Supersignal West Pico kit, Pierce). Exposure time was usually 1–5 min. Deglycosylation—Samples of cell extracts and culture media containing about 5 mOD/min of AChE activity were mixed with a 1 μl of N-glycanase (Glyco enzymatic deglycosylation kit GK80110 from PROzyme), completed to 20 μl with extraction buffer, and incubated at 37 °C overnight after addition of 10 μl of denaturation buffer (4% SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol). Mutants, Constructs, and Antibodies—In this study, we transfected COS cells with wild type or mutated rat AChET subunits. The oligomeric associations of these subunits depend on their C-terminal t peptide (sequence shown in Fig. 1A). AChET subunits were detected in Western blots with a commercial goat polyclonal antibody (E-19) directed against the N-terminal region of the protein. We checked the specificity of this antibody in Western blots of brain extracts from normal and AChE–/– mice (21Xie W. Wilder P.J. Stribley J. Chatonnet A. Rizzino A. Taylor P. Hinrichs S.H. Lockridge O. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); this was necessary because other commercial anti-AChE antibodies detected non-AChE proteins, notably in extracts from brains of knock-out mice lacking the AChE gene (supplemental Fig. 1S). To analyze complexes formed in transfected cells, we inserted an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus of AChET. By immunoreaction with anti-HA antibodies, we verified that the HA epitope was present and accessible in the mature AChET subunits. The presence of the added epitope had no effect on the formation of complexes with binding proteins. We studied the formation of heteromeric complexes in which AChE tetramers are associated with proteins derived from PRiMA (Fig. 1B) and from ColQ (Fig. 1C). We used wild type or mutated mouse PRiMA I as well as N-terminal fragments of mouse PRiMA in which the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were deleted by inserting stop codons at different positions. As shown previously, fragments Ps46 and Ps38 produced soluble, secreted complexes (9Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Note that a downstream cysteine, Cys48, and a putative N-glycosylation site at Asn44 were deleted in Ps46 and Ps38. For detection in Western blots, PRiMA I and its fragments were epitope-tagged with HA at their C termini. These epitopes did not interfere with the association with AChET subunits. The formation of membrane-bound complexes containing full-length PRiMA was compared with the formation of GPI-anchored complexes containing the previously described QN-HC construct in which the N-terminal region of Torpedo ColQ was fused to the C-terminal GPI addition signal of the Torpedo AChEH variant (Fig. 1C). The formation of soluble complexes with N-terminal PRiMA fragments (Ps46, Ps38) was compared with the formation of similar complexes with N-terminal fragments of Torpedo ColQ (QN, Qs71, Qs45). In addition, we analyzed chimeras PQ and QP, in which the regions preceding the proline-rich motifs were exchanged, as shown in Fig. 1D (note that we obtained identical results for QP chimeras containing or not the 3 residues (LLT) that precede the prolines in ColQ). ColQ contains two cysteines upstream of the PRAD, Cys28 and Cys29, and PRiMA contains four cysteines (Cys6, Cys13, Cys17, and Cys19). The upstream cysteines in Ps46 and in PQ were mutated to serines, separately and in various combinations, as indicated for each experiment. To assess the possible importance of the distance between the cysteines and the PRAD, we constructed a QN mutant in which Cys28 and Cys29 were replaced by serines, and 2 cysteines were introduced at positions 14 and 15, similar to upstream cysteines of PRiMA. Differential Effects of a t Peptide Mutation (Y31G) on the Formation of Tetramers with the PRADs of ColQ and PRiMA—In previous studies, we had found that mutations of the central aromatic residues (W17P, Y20P) in the AChET subunits from Torpedo marmorata essentially abolished the association of AChET subunits with an N-terminal fragment of ColQ (QN), whereas mutation of the distal tyrosine (Y31P) had little or no effect (7Belbeoc'h S. Falasca C. Leroy J. Ayon A. Massoulié J. Bon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We now compared the effects of mutating this tyrosine on the formation of complexes with constructs containing the PRADs of ColQ and of PRiMA. In agreement with our previous results, tetramers associated with the binding protein were produced and secreted when wild type or Y31G AChET subunits were co-expressed with constructs containing the PRAD of ColQ (QN and PQ) and could be visualized in nondenaturing electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Such complexes were also produced with wild type AChET and constructs containing the PRAD of PRiMA (Ps46 and QP) but not with mutated Y31G AChET subunits (Fig. 3). A comparison between the PQ and QP chimeras suggests that the Y31G mutation does not interfere with the N-terminal region preceding the proline motifs but that its effect depends on the length of the polyproline motifs and/or on the residues located immediately downstream.FIGURE 3Production of AChET tetramers associated with N-terminal fragments of ColQ and PRiMA and of the chimeras QP and PQ, showing the effect of mutations of cysteines upstream of the PRAD of PRiMA. Wild type AChET subunits were co-expressed in COS cells with binding proteins containing various mutations of the cysteines preceding the PRADs, and samples of cell extracts (upper panel) and culture media (lower panel) were analyzed as described in the legend for Fig. 2. The symbols on the right indicate the molecular forms: ○, AChE monomers; ▵, AChE dimers; □, AChE tetramers associated with the binding proteins; the horizontal arrow indicates the origin of migration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Influence of the Cysteines Preceding the PRADs on the Recruitment of AChET Subunits—Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis showed that the various binding proteins (QN, Qs71, Ps46, QP, and PQ) induced the formation of AChET tetramers. All of these complexes were soluble and secreted, appearing less abundant in the cell extracts than in the culture media. We analyzed the effect of mutating the cysteines in the N-terminal region of PRiMA and found that mutants of Ps46 and PQ containing the 4 cysteines (Cys6, Cys13, Cys17, Cys19), only 2 cysteines, a single cysteine, or no cysteine, all induced the formation of heteromeric AChET tetramers. This shows that cysteines are not necessary for the formation of the complexes, in agreement with the fact that the entire N-terminal region of PRiMA, which contains the cysteines, could be deleted (9Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For a more quantitative analysis of the effect of cysteines on the recruitment of AChET subunits, we determined the proportion of secreted AChE tetramers from the patterns of sedimentation obtained from co-transfections of a fixed amount of AChET as a function of the amount of cDNA encoding mutants of Ps46 possessing 4, 2, or no cysteines. In the medium, the proportion of AChET-Ps46 complexes sedimenting at about 10 S increased gradually with the amount of binding protein to reach a saturating level of about 80%, and this was not significantly modified by mutations of the cysteines (see supplemental Fig. 3S). Comparison of the Recruitment of AChET Subunits by Proteins Containing the PRADs of ColQ and PRiMA—We also compared the recruitment of AChET subunits by Ps46, Ps38, Qs71, Qs45, and the chimeras PQ and QP in the cells and the media (see supplemental Fig. 4S). The total AChE activities were similar in all cases in both the cells and the media, but the proportions of tetramers increased with the amount of vector encoding the co-transfected binding protein and appeared to saturate at similar concentrations. However, the maximal proportion of tetramers was considerably lower for QP than for the other constructs, both in the cells and in the medium. PQ and Ps46 appeared essentially equivalent, producing a proportion of tetramers that was slightly higher than with Qs71 and Qs45 in the cells, but lower in the media, perhaps indicating a difference in the secretability of the complexes. The proportion of secreted tetramers ranked in the order QP < (Ps46, Ps38, PQ) < (Qs71, Qs45). In this series, the PRAD of ColQ associated more efficiently with t peptides than the PRAD of PRiMA, and each PRAD functioned better when associated with its own N-terminal region. Equivalent Amounts of Light and Heavy Dimers Are Formed with Binding Proteins Containing the PRAD of ColQ, but Not the PRAD of PRiMA, in Transfected COS Cells—It is well established that in complexes of four AChET subunits with ColQ or of its N-terminal fragment QN, two catalytic subunits are disulfide-linked with the structural protein through their C-terminal cysteines, and the other two are disulfide-linked together. Thus, in nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the complex gives rise to one dimer of AChE subunits (the light dimer) and one dimer associated with the binding protein (the heavy dimer). We analyzed intercatenary disulfide bonds in complexes formed by co-expressing AChET subunits and PRiMA in COS cells by nonreducing electrophoresis of cell extracts and Western blotting. For comparison, we studied AChE expressed with a nonbinding protein (ΔPRAD) and with the QN-HC construct, which, like PRiMA, produces membrane-bound AChE tetramers. Fig. 4 shows Western blots in which AChE was detected with a specific commercial anti-AChE antibody, E-19. Although AChET alone produced monomers and only a small amount of dimers, the association with QN-HC or PRiMA induced the formation of oligomers. In the case of QN-HC, we observed light and heavy dimers as reported previously. In the case of PRiMA, we observed mostly light dimers and heavy components (HC), which migrated with a very high apparent mass, above the 500-"

Odorant detection in insects involves heterodimers between an odorant receptor (OR) and a conserved seven-transmembrane protein called Or83b, but the exact mechanism of OR signal transduction is unclear.

Nature. 2008; 452: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) now reveal that these OR-Or83b heterodimers form odorant-gated ion channels, revealing a surprising new mode of olfactory transduction. The ability to detect and respond appropriately to chemical cues in the environment is essential for the survival of most animals. Indeed, large fractions of the coding capacities of animal genomes are dedicated to the expression of odorant receptors (ORs) for chemical detection. From nematodes to vertebrates, ORs are seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated through the binding of specific odor molecules. Binding of the appropriate ligand to classical GPCRs is thought to induce conformational changes in the GPCR that trigger G protein activation and second messenger generation. It seemed reasonable to assume that insect ORs would follow this signal transduction mechanism. Two recent studies published in Nature now show that far from following the classical GPCR pathway, ORs of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, when bound to the common receptor subunit Or83b, may actually form odorant-gated cation channels (Sato et al., 2008Sato K. Pellegrino M. Nakagawa T. Nakagawa T. Vosshall L.B. Touhara K. Nature. 2008; 452: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, Wicher et al., 2008Wicher D. Schafer R. Bauernfeind R. Stensmyr M.C. Heller R. Heinemann S.H. Hansson B.S. Nature. 2008; 452: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). There were early hints that insect chemical transduction may be distinct from that of other olfactory model systems. The first was the lack of homology between insect ORs and those of other species. Nearly a decade after the first vertebrate ORs were identified, extensive homology-based cloning efforts in Drosophila still failed to identify any of the elusive insect chemoreceptors. Success was finally achieved through two approaches. First, a bioinformatics scan of the recently sequenced Drosophila genome revealed multiple transmembrane protein candidates that were then tested for expression restricted to olfactory organs (Clyne et al., 1999Clyne P.J. Warr C.G. Freeman M.R. Lessing D. Kim J. Carlson J.R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, Gao and Chess, 1999Gao Q. Chess A. Genomics. 1999; 60: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Second, a differential cDNA expression screen and large-scale sequencing effort identified putative fly ORs (Vosshall et al., 1999Vosshall L.B. Amrein H. Morozov P.S. Rzhetsky A. Axel R. Cell. 1999; 96: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, once identified, the sequences of the Drosophila chemoreceptors were found to be as similar to those of ion channels as to those of the chemoreceptor proteins of other species. Characterization of the Drosophila ORs hinted that olfactory signaling was distinct in insects. Unlike classical GPCRs from most species, which share a common membrane topology with the protein N terminus at the cell surface and the C terminus within the cell, Drosophila ORs appeared to have the reverse membrane topology (Benton et al., 2006Benton R. Sachse S. Michnick S.W. Vosshall L.B. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e20https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040020Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This raised the question of how fly ORs could transduce signals after binding their odorant ligands. The Drosophila OR family is encoded by 60 genes. Most members are “tuning” ORs that define the odorant specificity of the olfactory neuron in which they are expressed. As in vertebrates, Drosophila olfactory neurons expressing the same tuning OR innervate a common target (glomerulus) in the brain, suggesting that a similar logic underlies odor discrimination in vertebrates and insects. Also in the fly OR family is a protein called Or83b that forms heterodimeric complexes with the tuning ORs but is clearly distinct from them. Or83b is not an OR per se and, in the absence of a tuning OR, cannot confer odorant sensitivity (Elmore et al., 2003Elmore T. Ignell R. Carlson J.R. Smith D.P. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9906-9912PubMed Google Scholar). Or83b is widely expressed in most but not all olfactory neurons and is the only highly conserved OR protein among divergent insect species. This suggests that Or83b is under different selection pressure than other members of the OR gene family. Flies lacking Or83b have widespread defects in odorant detection because tuning ORs cannot be transported to the dendrites of olfactory neurons (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Dominguos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this observation is reminiscent of trafficking defects caused by mutations in multisubunit ion channels in cultured mammalian cells (Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 2000Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The question remained whether Or83b is merely a chaperone for the tuning ORs or if it plays a more direct role in OR signaling. Using patch-clamping to measure the ion currents in cultured vertebrate cells expressing fly ORs and Or83b, Wicher et al., 2008Wicher D. Schafer R. Bauernfeind R. Stensmyr M.C. Heller R. Heinemann S.H. Hansson B.S. Nature. 2008; 452: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar and Sato et al., 2008Sato K. Pellegrino M. Nakagawa T. Nakagawa T. Vosshall L.B. Touhara K. Nature. 2008; 452: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar reveal a new mode of odorant signaling in insects. Both groups demonstrate that only coexpression of Or83b with a tuning OR confers odor-sensitive ion currents in the cultured cells (indicated by an inward flow of current), implying that the OR-Or83b heterodimer acts as a ligand-gated ion channel. Sato and colleagues used outside-out excised membrane patches to determine a single channel conductance of 20–30 picosiemens (pS) for several OR-Or83b heterodimer combinations in response to odor ligand, indicating that the OR complexes possess ligand-gated channel properties. Meanwhile, Wicher and coworkers found that mutations in Or83b could alter the permeability of the odor-evoked currents. Both studies concluded that the OR-Or83b heterodimers form nonselective cation channels permeable to sodium ions, potassium ions, and calcium ions. Several properties of the ion currents observed by the investigators could explain features of insect olfactory neurons in vivo. At high odorant concentrations, the ion current response is characterized by a short lag time between the addition of ligand and the observation of current flow (latency), consistent with a direct ligand-gated mechanism (Figure 1). Interestingly, even in the absence of ligand, these channels appear to be open a large fraction of the time. This could account for the relatively high spontaneous activity present in most insect olfactory neurons that allows them to use both increases and decreases in neuronal firing frequencies to encode odorant information (Hallem et al., 2004Hallem E.A. Ho M.G. Carlson J.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Although both studies concluded that Or83b, together with an associated tuning OR, forms a ligand-gated cation channel, controversy lingers regarding exactly how the channel may function. Wicher et al. showed that odorant stimulation triggers a cyclic nucleotide second messenger system, but Sato et al., undertaking similar experiments, came to the opposite conclusion. Wicher and colleagues observed a G protein-mediated rise in cyclic nucleotides upon odorant stimulation of the OR-Or83b heterodimer, and that the cyclic nucleotides appear to mediate gating of the heterodimer via Or83b. This increase in cyclic nucleotide concentration was dependent on expression of the tuning OR but not expression of Or83b (although Or83b was required for cyclic nucleotides to induce ion currents in the absence of other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels). The odor-induced production of cyclic nucleotides was blocked by the G protein inhibitor, GDP-β-S, suggesting that fly ORs might activate a cyclase (either adenylyl or guanylyl) and trigger production of cyclic nucleotides through G protein activation. Strikingly, GDP-β-S caused the odorant dose-response conductance curve to shift dramatically to the right. Wicher et al. propose a dual mode of OR activation with the second messenger pathway mediating sensitivity to low odorant concentrations and the direct gating mechanism operating only at higher odorant concentrations. These investigators suggest that cyclic nucleotides may directly gate Or83b, as a membrane-permeable cAMP mimic induced a membrane current similar to that induced by odorants. Furthermore, this induced current required Or83b but not the coexpression of an OR. The Wicher et al. study, however, does not show direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to membranes expressing Or83b. In their study, Sato et al. did observe cyclic nucleotide sensitivity in some OR-Or83b complexes, but they were unable to demonstrate odorant dependence despite performing similar experiments to Wicher et al. Obviously, more work is necessary to elucidate the potential role of second messengers in this system. Both groups do agree, however, in the major finding that ORs are heteromeric ligand-gated cation channels, implying a distinct olfactory signal transduction strategy in insects. It will now be important to establish that this mechanism contributes to odor transduction in insects in vivo. Not all fly olfactory neurons express Or83b. For example, the ab1c neurons found in the large basiconic sensilla (which are important for CO2 detection) are unaffected by loss of Or83b. Also, ectopic expression of tuning ORs in Xenopus oocytes results in odor-specific ion currents in the absence of Or83b (Wetzel et al., 2001Wetzel C.H. Behrendt H.J. Gisselmann G. Stortkuhl K.F. Hovemann B. Hatt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9377-9380Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Lastly, olfactory neurons lacking Or83b still have spontaneous activity in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that Or83b-independent conductances also may be important in odorant signal transduction. As ab1c neurons express two gustatory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, could the theme of receptors as channels be more widespread? For example, it will be interesting to determine whether these two gustatory receptors form ion channels that are gated by CO2 in the absence of Or83b, and whether a second messenger pathway is involved. These two new provocative studies raise many questions. It will be very interesting to see where this story of insect olfactory signal transduction goes. On the practical side, if insects use these unique ligand-gated cation channels for odor reception, then inhibitors of these channels may prove valuable as a new class of insect repellents."
https://openalex.org/W1982812074,"Background The analysis of complex proteomic and genomic profiles involves the identification of significant markers within a set of hundreds or even thousands of variables that represent a high-dimensional problem space. The occurrence of noise, redundancy or combinatorial interactions in the profile makes the selection of relevant variables harder. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we propose a method to select variables based on estimated relevance to hidden patterns. Our method combines a weighted-kernel discriminant with an iterative stochastic probability estimation algorithm to discover the relevance distribution over the set of variables. We verified the ability of our method to select predefined relevant variables in synthetic proteome-like data and then assessed its performance on biological high-dimensional problems. Experiments were run on serum proteomic datasets of infectious diseases. The resulting variable subsets achieved classification accuracies of 99% on Human African Trypanosomiasis, 91% on Tuberculosis, and 91% on Malaria serum proteomic profiles with fewer than 20% of variables selected. Our method scaled-up to dimensionalities of much higher orders of magnitude as shown with gene expression microarray datasets in which we obtained classification accuracies close to 90% with fewer than 1% of the total number of variables. Conclusions Our method consistently found relevant variables attaining high classification accuracies across synthetic and biological datasets. Notably, it yielded very compact subsets compared to the original number of variables, which should simplify downstream biological experimentation."

The festival features not only leading researchers from New York and beyond but also actors, writers, musicians, and choreographers in a series of multimedia programs designed to reveal science to the general public in exciting new ways. A five-day festival of science takes place this week at venues across New York City. The festival features not only leading researchers from New York and beyond but also actors, writers, musicians, and choreographers in a series of multimedia programs designed to reveal science to the general public in exciting new ways. We believe that every child begins life as a scientist. Most are full of wonder at the animals, stars, plant life, and all else they encounter in the natural world. It is a testament to the failure of scientific education that so many children lose this interest before they reach their teen years. That is why we, together with many others, are launching the World Science Festival this week in New York City (http://www.worldsciencefestival.com). The objective of the World Science Festival is to help sustain that curiosity through engaging programs showing that science is so much more than material learned in the classroom. Science, as the numerous events and programs will make clear, pervades everything we encounter in our everyday lives. The World Science Festival also provides a vital step toward preparing the general public to actively shape science's role in addressing a whole host of issues that will affect how we live our lives in the immediate as well as the not too distant future. Accordingly, the Festival is aiming to help usher in a shift in how the public perceives science, moving it from the cultural outskirts toward the cultural center. Much as is the case with festivals in film and the humanities, a science festival has the capacity to garner a critical mass of public excitement and media attention necessary for such an essential shift to commence. The Festival itself comprises four broad groups of programs: Signature Programs, aimed at a lay adult audience and focusing on a wide spectrum of developments in modern science; Science & Culture Programs, which seek to draw an audience that might not otherwise become engaged in the sciences; Youth & Family Programs, which will bring children into the world of scientific discovery; and the World Science Summit, an invitation-only event where global issues will be addressed with science taking center stage. Each of these four categories has been designed to compensate for an absence of science in our broader culture. The Festival's Signature Programs aim to reveal insights from fields as varied as quantum mechanics, the neuroscience of creativity, Einstein's search for a unified theory, the science of morality, of sustainability, and of personal genomics, and many more. By bringing together leading researchers and young rising stars both from the United States and the world, the Festival will highlight the vitality at the forefront of research while showcasing some of the stunning developments in our understanding of the universe and ourselves. The Science & Culture Programs carry forward the Festival's belief that there is an urgent need for new avenues of entry into science, ones that can attract those who might never imagine themselves becoming engaged by science. Through film, theater, music, and dance performances that have an organic connection to science, these programs aim, in the words of the Festival's Executive Director and cofounder Tracy Day, “to bring audiences in for the art and have them leave with the science.” Among the many events are a screening of The Bourne Identity at the Museum of Modern Art, which will be followed by a discussion about the neuroscience of memory and amnesia, featuring Doug Liman, the film's producer and director, James Schamus, President of Focus Features, and neuroscientist Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Works & Process series at the Guggenheim Museum will present a dance piece by director/choreographer Karole Armitage inspired by the book The Elegant Universe. And actor and writer Alan Alda (Figure 1) will premiere a new work, Dear Albert, which delves into the treasure trove of letters written by Einstein, tracing an intimate and unfamiliar line across his life and work. The Youth & Family Programs are structured to provide events that will get kids excited, while presenting the scientific underpinnings of everything from climbing Mt. Everest to robotics. For example, Disney's Imagineers are coming to the Festival and will pull back the curtain to demonstrate the science underlying pyrotechnics, virtual reality, robotics and animation. In partnership with the National Basketball Association, the Festival will present a program, “Science of Sports,” revealing to kids that there is much science in the mechanics of sports as well as in the training regimens of athletes. Nobel Prize-winning physicist William Phillips will amaze his audience with experiments performed with objects plunged to a temperature of absolute zero. Meanwhile, “Mathemagician” Arthur Benjamin will hand out pocket calculators, beat those machines at complex multiplication and division, then finally turn the tables and explain to the attendees how he is able to process such large numbers in his head. And a group of high school students will get to quiz MIT robotics engineer Cynthia Breazeal and physics Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman, asking any question they like about robots or the so-called God-particle. The fourth component of the Festival, produced in collaboration with Columbia University, is called the World Science Summit. It is of a rather different character from the other three and is modeled on the World Economic Summit held annually in Davos, Switzerland. The World Science Summit is not open to the general public but rather is a forum for more than 100 leaders in government, business, and the media to interact with some of the world's most respected and accomplished scientists in a program that focuses on the impact that cutting-edge advances may have on a broad range of policy decisions. When a host of critical topics—from climate change, to stem cell research, to cloning, to alternate energy sources, and so on—are discussed in the public sphere, all too quickly the conversation segues into politics, economics, international relations, or even morality, quickly leaving the core science behind. And it is not that the science is secondary—indeed it is primary—but most people are not sufficiently comfortable with the basic research to embrace the science as an equal part of the discussion. By gathering a large number of leading scientists—including more than a dozen Nobel Laureates—together with policy makers, journalists, business leaders, and other thinkers, the World Science Summit aims to elevate science to its proper place in such vital discourse. The Summit will also host the launch of the Kavli Awards, featuring the debut announcement by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters of the winners of $3 million in prizes for basic research in nanotechnology, astrophysics, and neuroscience. Such a commitment to basic scientific research resonates with the Festival's celebration of the scientific enterprise. Through the centuries, basic science has been a key driver of human growth, advancement, and prosperity. Recently, we have seen not only science being relegated to the back seat on matters of public policy where it should be at the core, but also the marginalization of science in all parts of public life. This was emphasized eloquently by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof who, in December 2005, wrote a column called “The Hubris of the Humanities,” in which he addressed the dangers surrounding the public's “profound illiteracy about science and math as a whole.” He noted that an educated person could never laugh off ignorance of Plato or Monet or Dickens, yet so many shrug off a lack of interest in quantum mechanics or genetics as a reasonable intellectual stance. The World Science Festival is committed to sparking a movement that will reverse this trend by building a bridge over which the public might pass toward a rich appreciation for the challenges and triumphs of the scientific journey."
