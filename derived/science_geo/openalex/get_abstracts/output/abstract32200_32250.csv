https://openalex.org/W2148568069,"Amyloid deposition in senile plaques and the cerebral vasculature is a marker of Alzheimer's disease. Whether amyloid itself contributes to the neurodegenerative process or is simply a by-product of that process is unknown. Pheochromocytoma (PC12) and fibroblast (NIH 3T3) cell lines were transfected with portions of the gene for the human amyloid precursor protein. Stable PC12 cell transfectants expressing a specific amyloid-containing fragment of the precursor protein gradually degenerated when induced to differentiate into neuronal cells with nerve growth factor. Conditioned medium from these cells was toxic to neurons in primary hippocampal cultures, and the toxic agent could be removed by immunoabsorption with an antibody directed against the amyloid polypeptide. Thus, a peptide derived from the amyloid precursor may be neurotoxic."
https://openalex.org/W1971589551,"We have examined the interaction between the serine/threonine kinase proto-oncogene product Raf-1 and the tyrosine kinase PDGF beta-receptor. Raf-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity were increased by PDGF treatment of 3T3 cells or CHO cells expressing wild-type PDGF receptors but not mutant receptors defective in transmitting mitogenic signals, suggesting that the increase in Raf-1 kinase activity is a significant event in PDGF-induced mitogenesis. Concurrent with these increases, Raf-1 associated with the ligand-activated PDGF receptor. Furthermore, both mammalian Raf-1 and Raf-1 expressed using a recombinant baculoviral vector, associated in vitro with baculoviral-expressed PDGF receptor. This association was markedly decreased by prior phosphatase treatment of the receptor. Following incubation of partially purified baculoviral-expressed PDGF receptor with partially purified Raf-1, Raf-1 became phosphorylated on tyrosine and its serine/threonine kinase activity increased 4- to 6-fold. This is the first demonstration of the direct modulation of a protein activity by a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2038516967,"Fibroblasts that harbor an antisense construct of amyloid beta protein precursor (ABPP) cDNA, A-1, produced less ABPP mRNA and ABPP and grew poorly. Normal growth was restored when either parent cell conditioned medium (CM) or purified ABPP was provided. The capacity of the CM to restore cell growth was abolished by passage through an anti-ABPP immunoaffinity column; the activity was in the bound fraction. A Mr 90,000 protein recognized by the anti-ABPP antibody was diminished in the CM of A-1. CM from ABPP cDNA-transfected cells expressing high levels of ABPP was more potent than that from non-transfected parent cells in restoring A-1 growth. These results indicate that ABPP is released from cells into the medium and has an autocrine function in growth regulation."

At present, the mechanism of cytoadherence is not fully understood. While parasitized erythrocytes have been shown to specifically bind to the platelet/matrix molecule thrombospondin, adherence to suitable target cells can also be blocked by monoclonal antibody OKM5, which recognizes a surface molecule expressed by hematopoietic cells and endothelium. In apparent reconciliation of these findings, it has been reported that the OKM5 antigen (CD36) is a receptor for thrombospondin. Here we report that expression of a CD36 cDNA clone in COS cells supports cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes but does not support increased binding of purified human thrombospondin."
https://openalex.org/W1981589551,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2 is regulated in the cell cycle of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Phosphotyrosine in cdc2 is detectable at the onset of DNA synthesis and becomes maximal in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Quantitative tyrosine dephosphorylation of cdc2 occurs during entry into mitosis and no phosphotyrosine is detected during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. While increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2 correlates with the formation of a cdc2/p62 complex, the tyrosine phosphorylated cdc2 is inactive as a histone H1 kinase. cdc2 is fully dephosphorylated in its most active mitotic form, yet specific tyrosine dephosphorylation of interphase cdc2 in vitro is insufficient to activate the kinase. In vivo inhibition of tyrosine dephosphorylation by exposure of cells to a phosphatase inhibitor is associated with G2 arrest, which is reversible upon the removal of the phosphatase inhibitor. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of cdc2 may be one of a number of obligatory steps in the mitotic activation of the kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2012781224,"The endogenous c-mos product, pp39mos, is required for progesterone-induced meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. Treatment of oocytes with progesterone induced a rapid increase in pp39mos that preceded both the activation of maturation promoting factor (MPF) and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Microinjection of synthetic mos RNA into oocytes activated MPF and induced GVBD in the absence of progesterone. Thus, the mos proto-oncogene product may qualify as a candidate ""initiator"" protein of MPF and is at least one of the ""triggers"" for G2 to M transition."
https://openalex.org/W2080263723,"It has been demonstrated that the Xenopus homolog of the fission yeast cdc2 protein is a component of M phase promoting factor (MPF). We show that the Xenopus cdc2 protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo, and that this tyrosine phosphorylation varies markedly with the stage of the cell cycle. Tyrosine phosphorylation is high during interphase (in Xenopus oocytes and activated eggs) but absent during M phase (in unfertilized eggs). In vitro activation of pre-MPF from Xenopus oocytes results in tyrosine dephosphorylation of the cdc2 protein and switching-on of its kinase activity. The product of the fission yeast suc1 gene (p13), which inhibits the entry into mitosis in Xenopus extracts, completely blocks tyrosine dephosphorylation and kinase activation. However, p13 has no effect on the activated form of the cdc2 kinase. These findings suggest that p13 controls the activation of the cdc2 kinase, and that tyrosine dephosphorylation is an important step in this process."

https://openalex.org/W1596335359,"The kinetics of forming all possible single base substitution errors are measured for Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase alpha and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Seventeen sites along bacteriophage M13 DNA are investigated so that effects of nearest neighbor base stacking on misinsertion kinetics can be evaluated. Polymerase alpha appears to be more error prone than reverse transcriptase. Polymerase alpha forms transversion mispairs at rates comparable to transition mispairs with two exceptions; A.A and C.C are formed with significantly higher and lower efficiencies, respectively. Reverse transcriptase forms transversions with lower efficiencies than transitions, especially low being A.G, G.G, and C.C. For both enzymes, misinsertion frequencies vary typically by 10-fold for the same mispair in different locations. Misinsertion frequency can be expressed as a product of two components, one based on Km and the other on Vmax. DNA polymerase alpha appears to use primarily Km discrimination (100-5000-fold) to achieve insertion fidelity while reverse transcriptase shows a greater balance between Km and Vmax discrimination. Nearest-neighbor base stacking interactions appear to have opposite effects on the two discrimination components. The 5'-nearest neighbor influence on Km is greater for correct insertions than for incorrect, while the influence on Vmax is greater for the incorrect base. Target sites that have pyrimidine as the 5'-nearest neighbor to incoming nucleotides show a higher than average misinsertion component based on Km, but a lower than average component based on Vmax. Conversely, target sites with nearest neighbor purines have a higher than average Vmax component. These results imply that nucleotide misinsertion hot spots will occur next to pyrimidines when Km discrimination is dominant and next to purines when Vmax discrimination is dominant. When Vmax and Km discrimination components have similar magnitudes, nearest neighbor effects tend to cancel thereby reducing the effects of base stacking on insertion error rates."
https://openalex.org/W1593480031,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II exert pleiotropic effects on diverse cell types through interaction with specific high affinity cell surface receptors and with locally produced binding proteins. In skeletal muscle and in myoblast cell lines, the functions of IGF-I and -II are complex. Both growth factors appear capable of stimulating cellular proliferation and differentiation, as well as exerting insulin-like effects on intermediary metabolism. We have demonstrated recently that the expression of IGF-II and its receptor is induced during the terminal differentiation of the myoblast cell line, C2, and have suggested that IGF-II may be an autocrine growth factor in these cells (Tollefsen, S.E., Sadow, J.L., and Rotwein, P. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 1543–1547). We now have examined this cell line for expression of other components involved in IGF signaling. The synthesis of IGF-I is low during myoblast proliferation; IGF-I mRNA can be detected only through use of a sensitive solution hybridization assay. Typical IGF-I receptors can be measured in myoblasts, whereas IGF binding proteins cannot be detected in proliferating cells or in conditioned culture medium. During myogenic differentiation, IGF-I mRNA levels increase transiently by 6–10-fold within 48–72 h. The expression of IGF-I mRNA is accompanied by a 2.5-fold accumulation of IGF-I in the culture medium. IGF-I receptors also increase transiently, doubling by 48 h after the onset of differentiation. By contrast, secretion of a Mr 29,000 IGF binding protein is induced 30-fold to 100 ng/ml within 16 h and continues to increase throughout differentiation. These studies demonstrate that several components critical to IGF action are produced in a fusing skeletal muscle cell line in a differentiation-dependent manner and suggest that both IGF-I and IGF-II may be autocrine factors for muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1520988136,"Abstract Three cysteine residues are located in the pro region of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) precursor at amino acid positions 33, 223, and 225. Previous studies (Gentry, L. E., Lioubin, M. N., Purchio, A. F., and Marquardt, H. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 4162-4168) with purified recombinant TGF-beta 1 (rTGF-beta 1) precursor produced by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed that Cys-33 can form a disulfide bond with at least 1 cysteine residue in mature TGF-beta 1, contributing to the formation of a 90-110-kDa protein. We now show that Cys-223 and Cys-225 form interchain disulfide bonds. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change these Cys codons to Ser codons, and mutant constructs were transfected into COS cells. Analysis of recombinant proteins by immunoblotting showed that by substituting Cys-33 the 90-110-kDa protein is not formed, and thus, more mature dimer (24 kDa) is obtained, corresponding to a 3- to 5-fold increase in biological activity. Substitution of Cys-223 and/or Cys-225 resulted in near wild-type levels of mature TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, cells transfected with plasmid coding for Ser at positions 223 and 225 expressed only monomeric precursor proteins and released bioactive TGF-beta 1 that did not require acid activation, suggesting that dimerization of the precursor pro region may be necessary for latency."
https://openalex.org/W2039826008,"We have compared nuclear accessibility of methylated and nonmethylated sequences using restriction enzymes. Mspl, which cuts CpG sites in naked DNA regardless of methylation, cut DNA in intact mouse liver or brain nuclei almost exclusively at CpG islands. Bulk chromatin was not significantly cleaved by Mspl but was cleaved extensively by enzymes that do not recognize CpG. Quantitative analysis of limit digests showed that Mspl and another methyl-CpG insensitive enzyme, Tth, have a strong bias against cutting methylated sites in these nuclei. Southern analysis confirmed this at three genomic loci. Our results suggest that resistance to nucleases is mediated by factors that are bound specifically to methylated CpGs. MeCP, a protein that binds to methylated DNA in vitro, may be one such factor, since nuclease resistance was significantly reduced in an MeCP-deficient cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1593868340,"Abstract Isolated rat hepatocytes were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 to measure cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in individual cells by digital ratio imaging microscopy. Stimulation with 0.1 nM vasopressin, 0.5 microM phenylephrine, or 0.5 microM ATP caused repetitive spikes of high [Ca2+]i in a high percentage of cells, in agreement with Woods et al. (Woods, N. M., Cuthbertson, K. S. R., and Cobbold, P. H. (1986) Nature 319, 600-602), but unlike the results of Monck et al. (Monck, J. R., Reynolds, E. E., Thomas, A. P., and Williamson, J. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4569-4575). Reduction in extracellular [Ca2+] decreased the frequency but not the amplitude of the spikes, suggesting that the spikes result from dumping of intracellular stores and that the entry of extracellular Ca2+ affects only the rate of replenishment of those stores. Membrane depolarization failed to elevate [Ca2+]i and had an effect similar to removal of extracellular Ca2+ in decreasing the frequency of agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations or inhibiting them altogether, arguing against any significant role for voltage-operated Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1558732436,"Abstract Several forms of C with molecular masses of 74-, 77-, and 80-kDa were detected in subcellular fractions of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells which express the alpha-type C. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 74-kDa is the precursor of the 77- and 80-kDa C forms. (i) Pulse-labeling experiments revealed that C is synthesized on membranes as a 74-kDa that can be chased into the 77- and the 80-kDa C forms. (ii) The primary translation product of C displayed an apparent molecular size of 74-kDa as determined by in vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA from MDA-MB-231 cells. (iii) Incubation with serine/threonine-specific phosphatases (potato acid phosphatase and phosphatase 1 or 2A) resulted in the complete dephosphorylation of the 77-kDa to the 74-kDa C form. Protein C appears to be synthesized in membranes as an unphosphorylated and presumably inactive 74-kDa form that is converted into the active 77- and 80-kDa C by post-translational modification involving at least two phosphorylation steps. The first phosphorylation is probably achieved by a specific, yet unidentified, protein C kinase since the 74-kDa C species did not undergo autophosphorylation and was neither a substrate for the purified C, S6 kinase, phosphorylase kinase, casein II, nor for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase. Except for phosphorylase and the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent kinase, phosphorylation of the 77-kDa C form with purified C (autophosphorylation), S6 or casein II shifted the molecular mass of the 77-kDa C to 80-kDa. Prolonged exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate not only leads to a complete down-regulation of C activity but also to an accumulation of 74-kDa C due to a retarded conversion of the 74-kDa into the 77- and 80-kDa C forms in these cells. Our data indicate that tumor promoters additionally interfere with the posttranslational processing that converts the 74-kDa C precursor into the 77- and 80-kDa forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1602911429,"Abstract Expression of the 66-kDa form of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase in Escherichia coli leads to isolation of small amounts of a 2 x 66-kDa homodimer and larger amounts of a heterodimer form of the enzyme in which the 66-kDa protein is complexed with its carboxyl-terminally truncated is complexed with its carboxyl-terminally truncated 51-kDa form. The latter arises via proteolysis by contaminating proteases. The heterodimer, which was characterized by gel filtration (apparent native molecular mass of 120-130 kDa), was the most active form of the enzyme (specific activity, 5000 units/mg, cf. less than 2000 for the 66-kDa fragment). The 66-kDa fragment alone was shown to be only partially dimerized, with the activity residing mainly in the dimer fraction. Proteolysis of the 66-kDa form resulting partially in the 51-kDa form led to an increase in reverse transcriptase activity. Expression of a truncated version of the protein containing the first 428 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase coding region led to a protein which had low but measurable reverse transcriptase activity (400-500 units/mg). Co-expression of the two proteins on a single plasmid led to expression in a 1:1 ratio. The 1:1 mixture behaved as a heterodimer, as shown by its chromatographic properties. It is likely that the mechanism for the production of heterodimers in vivo involves cleavage of 66-kDa monomers followed by rapid dimerization of the 51- and 66-kDa forms to give the heterodimeric form, which is stable toward further proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1594451352,Abstract The procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) of Trypanosoma brucei was purified by cell fractionation followed by ion-exchange and concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. PARP is membrane-bound and comprises about 1% of the total procyclic trypanosome protein or 6 x 10(6) molecules per parasite. The results of NH2-terminal sequencing and amino acid analysis indicate that PARP is processed by removal of an N-terminal signal sequence and the hydrophobic COOH terminus. Metabolic labeling of PARP with [3H] ethanolamine is consistent with attachment of the protein to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The glycolipid can be removed by base hydrolysis or nitrous acid deamination but is not susceptible to bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
https://openalex.org/W1513817400,"Abstract Molecular cloning has revealed the primary structure of a number of G-protein-linked receptors. The organization and topography of these proteins predicted to have seven hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, in contrast, have not been established. Antibodies were prepared against 11 peptides corresponding to each of the hydrophilic sequences of the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Each of the anti-peptide antibodies displayed immunoreactivity for its synthetic peptide antigen and beta 2-adrenergic receptor (Mr 65,000) on blots of cell membranes and of purified receptor. All but three anti-peptide antisera also displayed immunoreactivity toward human placental and rat fat cell beta 1-adrenergic receptors, reflecting the level of sequence identity that exists between the two subtypes, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with an expression vector harboring the cDNA encoding the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor provided a cell type with 2 million receptors/cell, suitable for in situ localization of the sequences used as antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence of intact and permeabilized cells performed with these site-directed anti-peptide antibodies permitted the assignment of the general topography of each of the hydrophilic sequences of this G-protein-linked receptor. The results support the predictive value of hydropathy analysis for one class of membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane-spanning domains."
https://openalex.org/W2085244301,"The regulation of antigen processing and presentation to MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes was studied in cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus. Recognition by cytolytic T lymphocytes of the phosphoprotein pp89, the immunodominant viral antigen expressed in the immediate-early phase of infection, was selectively prevented during the subsequent expression of viral early genes. The surface expression of MHC class I glycoproteins and their capacity to present externally added pp89-derived antigenic peptides were not affected. Because recognition of several other antigens occurred during the early phase, a general failure in processing and presentation was excluded. Since neither rate of synthesis, amount, stability, nor nuclear transport of pp89 was modified, the failure in recognition indicates a selective interference with pp89 antigen processing and presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2095437984,"Mammalian glucocorticoid receptors enhance transcription from linked promoters by binding to glucocorticoid response element (GRE) DNA sequences. Understanding the mechanism of receptor action will require biochemical studies with purified components. Enhancement was observed in vitro with derivatives of the receptor that were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and added to a cell-free extract from Drosophila embryo nuclei. Transcription from promoters linked to one or multiple GREs was selectively enhanced by as much as six times. The effect was weaker with only one GRE, and enhancement was abolished by a point mutation that inactivates the GRE in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1671669579,"Abstract We have investigated the effect of iron on the expression of transferrin receptors (TrfRs) and ferritin chains in cultures of human peripheral blood monocytes maturing to macrophages. Monocyte-macrophage maturation is associated with a gradual rise of Trf-binding capacity in the absence of cell proliferation. At all culture times, treatment with ferric ammonium citrate induces a dose-dependent rise of the Trf-binding level as compared with nontreated cells. Scatchard analysis revealed that this phenomenon is due to an increase in receptor number rather than an alteration in ligand-receptor affinity. Biosynthesis experiments indicated that the rise in number of TrfRs is due to an increase of receptor synthesis, which is associated with a sustained elevation of the TrfR RNA level. The up-regulation of TrfR synthesis is specific in that expression of other macrophage membrane proteins is not affected by iron addition. Conversely, addition of an iron chelator induced a slight decrease of TrfR synthesis. The expression of heavy and light ferritin chains at RNA and protein levels was markedly more elevated in cultured macrophages than in fresh monocytes, thus suggesting modulation of ferritin genes at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Addition of iron salts to monocyte-macrophage cultures sharply stimulated ferritin synthesis but only slightly enhanced the level of ferritin RNA, thus indicating a modulation at the translational level. These results suggests that in cultured human monocytes-macrophages, iron up-regulates TrfR expression, thus in sharp contrast to the negative feedback reported in a variety of other cell types. These observations may shed light on the mechanism(s) of iron storage in tissue macrophages under normal conditions and possibly on the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by abnormal iron storage."
https://openalex.org/W1485742470,"The selectivity of cathepsin D, a mammalian intracellular aspartyl proteinase involved in the degradation of endocytosed proteins, was studied. For this purpose, several proteins of known primary structure were subjected to mild proteolysis by the enzyme, and the preferentially cleaved peptide bonds were identified. Comparison of the primary structures around these sites indicates that cathepsin D shows a strong preference for peptide bonds within a distinct sequence pattern of amino acids extending over 7 residues. In general, this pattern is most likely to occur within amphipathic α-helical structures. These findings and their possible implications are discussed together with additional evidence suggesting an important role for cathepsin D in the processing of protein antigens, an essential step for their recognition by T-cells. Accordingly, it is proposed that the proteolytic activity of cathepsin D is crucial in selecting processing sites and hence the location and structural context of T-cell epitopes for the majority of protein antigens.

https://openalex.org/W1592812421,"The high inhibitory potency of the previously developed bombesin antagonist [Leu13, psi CH2NHLeu14]bombesin (analogue I) (IC50 values of 30 and 18 nM for inhibition of bombesin-stimulated amylase secretion from guinea pig acinar cells and Swiss 3T3 cell growth, respectively) diminished considerably when shorter chain lengths were examined. For instance, [Leu13, psi CH2NHLeu14]bombesin-(5-14),[Leu13, psi CH2NHLeu14] bombesin-(6-14), and [Leu9, psi CH2NHLeu10]neuromedin C had IC50 values of 150, 150, and 280 nM, respectively. Incorporation of a D-Phe residue at position 6 of [Leu13, psi CH2NHLeu14] bombesin did not significantly change the various biological parameters. However, its presence in [Leu13, psi CH2NHLeu14]bombesin-(6-14) and at position 2 of psi-neuromedin C-(2-10) resulted in about 10-fold increases in potency up to and above that of the original antagonist. For instance, [D-Phe6,Leu13,psi CH2NHLeu14]bombesin-(6-14) and des-Gly1-[D-Phe2,Leu9,psi CH2NHLeu10]neuromedin C exhibited IC50 values of 5 and 28 nM, respectively. Analogues based on the litorin sequence which contains an NH2-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue at the bombesin position 6 equivalent were also quite potent. The ability of various analogues to interact with bombesin receptors on pancreatic acini correlated reasonably well with potencies derived from inhibition of bombesin-stimulated growth of Swiss 3T3 cells. Additional studies of NH2- and COOH-terminal structure-activity relationships resulted in the synthesis of [D-Phe6,Leu13,psi CH2NHPhe14]bombesin-(6-14), which was particularly effective in inhibiting 3T3 cell growth at high picomolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.72 nM and Ki = 3.1 nM for 3T3 cells; IC50 = 7.5 nM and Ki = 9.9 nM for acini). Detailed investigations with one of the most potent antagonists, [D-Phe6,Leu13,psi CH2NHLeu14]bombesin-(6-14) (Ki = 14 nM for acini cells and 7.1 for 3T3 cells), demonstrated that this analogue was a competitive inhibitor of bombesin and that this activity was specific for the bombesin receptor. Thus, inhibitory potencies have been improved generally up to 25 times over previously reported structures; and, given that bombesin itself has a Ki of 1.2 nM for 3T3 cell binding, some of these analogues are extraordinarily high affinity receptor antagonists. They can also be synthesized more readily and offer fewer proteolytic degradation sites than the original pseudopeptide and should be excellent candidates for in vivo studies aimed at inhibition of bombesin-dependent human small cell lung carcinoma growth."
https://openalex.org/W1593285591,"The conversion of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (I alpha I) into active, acid-stable derivatives by proteolytic degradation has been tested with 10 different proteinases. Of these, only plasma kallikrein, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and the Staphylococcus aureus V-8 proteinase were found to be effective, each releasing more than 50% of this activity. However, a strong correlation between inhibitor degradation and significant release of acid-stable activity could only be found with the V-8 enzyme. Inhibition kinetics for the interaction of native I alpha I, the inhibitory fragment released by digestion with S. aureus V-8 proteinase, or the related urinary trypsin inhibitor, with seven different proteinases indicated that all had essentially identical Ki values with an individual enzyme and, where measurements were possible, nearly identical second order association rate constants. Significantly, none of the five human proteinases tested, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G, would appear to have low enough Ki values to be physiologically relevant. Thus, the role of native I alpha I or its degradation products in controlling a specific proteolytic activity is still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1495272934,"The mechanism by which the expression of adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4) is regulated in murine tissues was analyzed. Elevated levels of the specific activity of this enzyme appeared to correlate directly with steady state levels of ADA mRNA. Transcriptional studies using nuclear run-on experiments revealed a pronounced asymmetric distribution of nascent transcripts across the ADA genome. The ability to detect nascent transcripts downstream of the promoter proximal region varied among tissues and correlated with tissue levels of ADA mRNA and enzymatic activity. These results indicate that processes affecting the elongation of nascent transcripts into completed primary transcripts play a role in tissue-specific expression of ADA."
https://openalex.org/W1531097940,"The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP, Mr 74,000) has a binding site for neutral lipid which can readily equilibrate with lipoprotein cholesteryl esters or triglycerides. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (TP2) was obtained which neutralizes the cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride (TG) transfer activities of the CETP. In this report, the epitope of the inhibitory monoclonal antibody has been localized to a hydrophobic 26-amino acid sequence at the COOH terminus of CETP. The Fab fragments of TP2 caused partial (50%) inhibition of CE transfer and complete inhibition of TG transfer by the CETP. Similarly, the Fab fragments inhibited (37%) the binding of CE to the CETP and abolished the binding of TG to the CETP. Surprisingly, the TP2 Fab was also found to enhance the binding of CETP to plasma lipoproteins and to phospholipid vesicles. In conclusion, the TP2 monoclonal antibody inhibits lipid transfer by blocking the uptake of lipid by CETP. The COOH-terminal epitope may be in or near the neutral lipid binding site. Occupancy of this site by TP2 Fab fragments or by neutral lipid may result in a conformational change of CETP causing enhanced binding to lipoproteins or vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1530022836,"Abstract Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) can be categorized into molecularly divergent groups by their differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin. Receptors specifically use either pertussis toxin-sensitive or-insensitive G-proteins to couple to specific effectors. Receptor stimulation of phospholipase C, however, is pertussis toxin sensitive in some systems and pertussis toxin insensitive in others. We studied the coupling of receptors to phospholipase C by expressing receptors from both systems into a single cell, the Xenopus oocyte. [Arg8]Vassopressin (AVP) receptors from liver and cholecystokinin-8(sulfated) (CCK) receptors from brain were expressed in oocytes by intracellular injection of RNA. Both receptors stimulated a Ca2+-dependent Cl- current which can also be evoked by intracellular injection of inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate. Hence, receptor stimulation of phospholipase C was measured as the evoked Ca2+-dependent Cl- current. The liver AVP receptor, which is known to stimulate phospholipase C in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner (Lynch, C. J., Prpic, V., Blackmore, P. F., and Exton, J. H. (1986) Mol. Pharmacol. 29, 196-203), was found to stimulate phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway in the Xenopus oocyte. The CCK receptor from brain stimulated phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Both AVP and CCK stimulation of phospholipase C were attenuated by the intracellular injection of excess G-protein beta gamma subunits. Neither pertussis toxin treatment nor intracellular injection of beta gamma subunits affected any steps subsequent to inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate production. From these data we conclude that both the pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways for receptor coupling to phospholipase C are transduced by heterotrimeric G-proteins. We also find that there is a lack of coupling fidelity of receptors to G-proteins in stimulation of phospholipase C which can be influenced by the membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W1507768640,"Human alpha 2-antiplasmin readily forms 1:1 complexes with either trypsin or chymotrypsin at independent but overlapping reactive sites. In the absence of alpha 2-macroglobulin, complex dissociation and enzyme release can be demonstrated without regeneration of inhibitory activity. However, in the presence of this inhibitor the dissociation of alpha 2-antiplasmin-chymotrypsin complexes or alpha 2-antiplasmin-trypsin complexs yields functionally active inhibitors which can now inactivate trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. These results clearly indicate that Serpin-proteinase complexes can dissociate to give both active inhibitor and enzyme. If the enzyme is trapped by alpha 2-macroglobulin, in vivo, it is possible that the inhibitor may be recycled for further use."
https://openalex.org/W1534650679,"Cell lysis by staphylococcal alpha-toxin, a potent virulence factor of most pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus, follows a three-step sequence: binding of toxin to the membrane, leaking of ions caused by membrane injury, and rupturing of the membrane caused by osmotic swelling. The membrane injury step is composed of two separate events, membrane penetration and membrane perturbation. The membrane penetration event involves conversion of the soluble toxin monomer into an amphipathic molecule, which inserts into the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The membrane perturbation event involves association of the toxin monomers, in the plane of the membrane, to form hexameric transmembrane pores. In this study, we demonstrate that, in an asolectin liposome system, controlling the pH of the external buffer permits these two events to be temporally resolved. Using Controlled-Pore Glass bead-purified alpha-toxin, four events are measured as a function of pH: (a) release of potassium from prelabeled asolectin vesicles, (b) conversion of the toxin to a globally hydrophobic molecule, (c) binding of detergent by the toxin, and (d) labeling of the toxin with photoactivable, radiolabeled, hydrophobic probes. Two of these events, potassium release and conversion to a net hydrophobic state, are paired in that, for the event to occur, each requires a pH of 4.6 or less. In contrast, photolabeling with the membrane probes PC I and PC II (where PC represents phosphatidylcholine) is easily detectable at pH values as high as 5.0 and 6.0. These results demonstrate that, as the pH is lowered, two distinct changes in the physical properties of alpha-toxin occur. The first, which occurs under mild acidic conditions, converts the toxin from a water-soluble molecule into an amphipathic molecule. The second, requiring relatively more acidic conditions, converts the amphipathic toxin molecule into a globally hydrophobic molecule. Correlated with these physical changes in the alpha-toxin molecule is the acquisition of two new biological properties. The conversion of alpha-toxin into an amphipathic conformation correlates with the acquisition of the biological property of the reversible penetration into the bilayer of the asolectin liposome membrane, as evidenced by labeling with the photoactivable probes. At lower pH, the conversion of the toxin into a globally hydrophobic molecule correlates with the biological property of causing damage to the cell membrane, as measured by the release of internal potassium ions, presumably by the formation of transmembrane hexamer pores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1592553746,"Abstract The glycosylation of human cytokeratins was investigated in cultured human keratinocytes and A431 cells by metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine. In the presence of tunicamycin, keratinocytes incorporated [3H]glucosamine into a vitamin A-regulated acidic 53-kDa component of the cytoskeleton which was identified as cytokeratin 13 by one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting with specific monoclonal antibodies. This cytoskeletal component was also labeled with [3H]glucosamine in A431 cells but not in KB cells, which do not express cytokeratin 13. Its labeling was resistant to tunicamycin, suggesting that [3H]glucosamine had not been incorporated into N-linked oligosaccharides. Acid hydrolysis followed by paper and ion-exchange chromatography showed that the radioactivity in electrophoretically purified cytokeratin 13 was still present as glucosamine. Radioactivity was completely removed by treatment with beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, suggesting that it was present in terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues. The labeled carbohydrate was released by alkaline borohydride treatment and was bound by a phenylboronic acid column, indicating an O-glycosidic linkage. On Bio-Gel P-2 columns, the beta-eliminated carbohydrate co-eluted with authentic N-acetylglucosaminitol. The results indicate that cytokeratin 13 contains single residues of N-acetylglucosamine O-glycosidically linked to the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1518625926,Abstract A proteinaceous hemolysin secreted by strain 4074 of serotype 1 of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was purified by diafiltration and ion exchange chromatographic techniques. The hemolytic activity is associated with a 107-kDa band as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and confirmed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. This hemolysin produces pores in membranes as demonstrated by osmotic protection studies using red blood cells and carbohydrate compounds of various molecular weights. These assays suggest a pore diameter in the order of 2 nm. Phospholipid bilayers composed of 1:1 w/w phosphotidylserine:phosphotidylethanolamine exposed to this toxin display discrete current flow events typical of transmembrane channels and consistent with the interpretation that this toxin acts by forming pores in phospholipid membranes. The linear relationship of current amplitude to holding potential when examined over the -60 to +60 mV range indicates that this pore has a constant mean single channel conductance level of 350-400 pS.

https://openalex.org/W2065148702,"Oxyntic cells that retain distinct morphological polarity between apical and basolateral membranes were isolated from the gastric mucosa of the amphibian Necturus. Patch-clamp techniques were applied to these cells to identify apical membrane ion channels associated with hydrochloric acid secretion. A single class of voltage-dependent, inwardly rectifying chloride channels was observed in the apical membranes of both resting and stimulated (acid-secreting) oxyntic cells. Stimulation of the cells with dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and isobutylmethylxanthine increased channel open probability and simultaneously increased apical membrane surface area. This chloride channel is probably responsible for electrogenic chloride secretion by the gastric mucosa and may also participate in the fluid- and enzyme-secretory functions of the oxyntic cell, analogous to the chloride channels found in the apical membranes of other exocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500719097,"Abstract 5-Hydroxymethyluracil (HmUra) residues formed by the oxidation of thymine are removed from DNA through the action of a DNA glycosylase activity. This activity was purified over 1870-fold from calf thymus and found to be distinct from uracil (Ura)-DNA glycosylase. The HmUra-DNA glycosylase has a molecular weight of 38,000, a pH optimum of 6.7-6.8 and an apparent Km of 0.73 +/- 0.04 microM. These values are similar to those reported for other mammalian DNA glycosylases. The enzyme removed HmUra residues from single- and double-stranded DNA with almost equal efficiency. HmUra-DNA glycosylase activity was not product inhibited by free HmUra. The DNA glycosylase activity was inhibited by Mg2+, but the purest enzyme fractions contained a Mg2+-dependent apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity. HmUra-DNA glycosylase and the recently described 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HmCyt)-DNA glycosylase (Cannon, S. V., Cummings, A. C., and Teebor, G. W. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 151, 1173-1179) are unique among known DNA glycosylases in being present in mammalian cells and absent from bacteria. These DNA glycosylase activities were shown here to reside on different proteins. We suggest that the major function of HmUra-DNA glycosylase, together with HmCyt-DNA glycosylase, is the maintenance of methylated cytosine residues in the DNA of higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2108400459,"Bovine mitochondrial (mt) phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAPhe) was purified on a large scale using a new hybridization assay method developed by the authors. Although its melting profile suggested a loose higher order structure, presumably influenced by the apparent loss of D loop-T loop interaction necessary for forming a rigid L-shaped tertiary structure, its aminoacylation capacity catalyzed by mt phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) was nearly equal to that of Escherichia coli tRNAPhe. Misaminoacylation was not observed for the mt tRNAPhe-mt PheRS system. Comparing the aminoacylation efficiencies of several combinations of tRNAPheS and PheRSs from various sources, including bovine mitochondria, bovine and yeast cytosols, E. coli, Thermus thermophilus, and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, it was clarified that mt PheRS was able to aminoacylate all the above mentioned tRNAPhe species, albeit with varying degrees of efficiency. This broad charging spectrum suggests that mt PheRS possesses a relatively simple recognition mechanism toward its substrate, tRNAPhe."
https://openalex.org/W1599542520,"Abstract Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) rapidly lost functional and structural integrity in the course of a short-term incubation with either triggered neutrophils or eosinophils. In contrast to native alpha 2M, the modified antiproteinase was unable to bind neutrophil elastase or pancreatic elastase in a manner that restricted the enzymes' access to high molecular weight substrates. In addition to the complete loss of its antiproteolytic potential, the conformation of the dysfunctional inhibitor was radically altered and susceptible to further modification by exogenous proteinases as assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the mechanism by which alpha 2M was inactivated by neutrophils revealed that the process was dependent on the generation of hypochlorous acid, an oxidant generated by the hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase-chloride system. In contrast to the neutrophil, maximal eosinophil-dependent inactivation required the presence of physiologic concentrations of bromide and appeared to involve the generation of hypobromous acid. The ability of either hypochlorous acid or hypobromous acid to directly disrupt alpha 2M function and structure was confirmed under cell-free conditions. These results demonstrate that alpha 2M, an antiproteinase heretofore considered to be resistant to physiologic inactivation, could be destroyed by two populations of human phagocytes via oxidative modifications mediated by hypophalous acids."

In this study, the primary sequence of Novikoff hepatoma 7-2 RNA was determined and a possible secondary structure is presented. The Novikoff hepatoma 7-2 RNA is 94% homologous to the recently described mouse mitochondrial RNase MRP RNA, suggesting that Novikoff hepatoma 7-2 RNA may be the homologue of mouse MRP RNA. The presence of 7-2 RNA in nucleoli and in mitochondria suggests that 7-2 ribonucleoproteins, in addition to being essential components of mitochondrial RNase, may also be functional in nucleolar RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1520986587,"Colicin M inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of the bactoprenyl carrier lipid. Since the synthesis of O-antigen also requires bactoprenyl carrier lipid, the effect of colicin M on O-antigen biosynthesis was studied using a colicin-sensitive strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Determination of O-antigen intermediates by two different methods showed that bactoprenyl-dependent O-antigen biosynthesis was inhibited by colicin M. Synthesis of both O-antigen and peptidoglycan was almost immediately inhibited following colicin addition. This was followed some 20 min later by cell lysis. The only known common step between O-antigen and peptidoglycan synthesis is formation of bactoprenyl phosphate by dephosphorylation of bactoprenyl pyrophosphate. Determination of bactoprenyl phosphates showed an accumulation of bactoprenyl pyrophosphate in colicin-treated cultures. It was concluded that dephosphorylation of the bactoprenyl lipid carrier was inhibited by colicin M, and this in turn prevented both O-antigen and peptidoglycan synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497271804,"Abstract We have utilized a new class of acid-cleavable protein cross-linking reagents in the construction of antibody-diphtheria toxin conjugates (Srinivaschar, K., and Neville, D. M., Jr. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2501-2509). The potency of anti-CD5 conjugates assayed by inhibition of protein synthesis on CD5 bearing cells (Jurkat) is correlated with cross-linker hydrolytic rates. The maximum increase in potency of the cleavable conjugates over non-cleavable conventional conjugates is 50-fold and is specific for the CD5 uptake route as judged by competition with excess anti-CD5. The potency of conjugates made from diphtheria toxin and the anti-high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) is enhanced 3-10-fold by a cleavable cross-linker. However the potency of transferrin or anti-CD3 diphtheria toxin conjugates is only minimally enhanced (2-3-fold). Mutant diphtheria toxins, CRM103 and CRM9, previously shown to express less than 1/100 of the wild type in binding affinity were substituted into these conjugates as probes for possible intracellular toxin receptor interactions. Both mutants were equally as toxic to Jurkat target cells exhibiting 1/700 the wild-type potency. CRM9 non-cleavable conjugates were equally as potent as wild-type conjugates for transferrin and anti-CD3-mediated uptake but not for anti-CD5-mediated uptake where toxicity was reduced 60-fold over the wild-type analog. The cleavable cross-linker enhanced the toxicity of anti-CD5-CRM103 and anti-CD5-CRM9 conjugates, but potency was only 1/10 that of the analogous wild-type cleavable conjugate. These data are consistent with a model in which potentiation of toxicity of the anti-CD5 and anti-high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen conjugates by the cleavable cross-linker occurs from an enhanced intracellular toxin-toxin receptor interaction that ultimately results in increased toxin translocation to the cytosol compartment. In contrast, these data indicate that the anti-CD3 and transferrin uptake systems do not require this interaction in agreement with previous work (Johnson, V.G., Wilson, D., Greenfield, L., and Youle, R. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1295-1300)."

https://openalex.org/W1489954457,"Abstract Treatment of Daudi B lymphoblastoid cells with interferon (IFN)-alpha or -beta has been reported (Yap, W. H., Teo, T. S., and Tan, Y. H. (1986) Science 234, 355-358) to cause a transient increase in the level of diacylglycerol, which is the endogenous activator of protein kinase C (PK-C). To assess the role for PK-C in the induction of 2-5A synthetase mRNA and activity by IFN-alpha in Daudi cells, we have examined the effects of PK-C inhibitors and activators. We have found that the PK-C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), strongly inhibits the induction of 2-5A synthetase mRNA and activity by recombinant IFN-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) and that this inhibition appears to be at a post-transcriptional level. The inhibition by H7 could not be attributed to a generalized decrease in macromolecular synthesis or to inhibition of the binding or internalization of rIFN-alpha A. Moreover, pretreatment of Daudi cells for 24 h with phorbol esters to down-regulate or desensitize PK-C substantially inhibited the subsequent induction of 2-5A synthetase mRNA and activity by rIFN-alpha A. These data suggest that PK-C activity is required for the induction of 2-5A synthetase by rIFN-alpha A. However, phorbol esters, which are potent PK-C activators, did not induce 2-5A synthetase. Taken together, our data indicate that a functional PK-C is required for 2-5A synthetase induction by rIFN-alpha A at a post-transcriptional level in Daudi cells but that activation of PK-C is not sufficient for induction of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532840726,"Hexabrachions are extracellular proteins expressed in certain tissues and at specific points in development. cDNA sequencing has revealed that they contain a region of repeats that are similar to the type III homology units of fibronectin. The corresponding region of fibronectin contains heparin- and DNA-binding domains. We have compared the heparin and DNA binding of hexabrachion secreted by the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG to that of fibronectin. Both proteins bound to heparin-agarose in low salt (0.05 M NaCl) buffers. Using linear salt gradients, hexabrachion was eluted from heparin prior to fibronectin. The addition of 5 mM CaCl2 decreased the affinity of both proteins for heparin, but it had a greater effect upon the binding of fibronectin. Free heparin but not chondroitin sulfate inhibited the binding of both proteins to heparin-agarose. In addition, hexabrachion bound to DNA as fibronectin does, and this binding could be inhibited by heparin but not by chondroitin sulfate. Unlike fibronectin, hexabrachion did not bind to gelatin when samples containing both proteins were passed over gelatin-agarose, also indicating that there was no interaction between hexabrachion and fibronectin. In contrast to hexabrachion isolated from brain, the protein secreted by the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG does not bear the HNK-1 epitope which is on a carbohydrate that can mediate interactions between cells."
https://openalex.org/W1596733288,"Abstract We studied the characteristics of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), F1 and F3, against human coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor). Experiments with trypsin-digested 125I-factor XII revealed that the epitope for mAb F1 is located in the NH2-terminal Mr 40,100 portion of factor XII, whereas that for mAb F3 resides in the COOH-terminal Mr 30,000 portion of this protein. Factor XII in fresh plasma (single-chain factor XII) bound approximately 190 times less to mAb F1 than factor XII in dextran sulfate-activated plasma (cleaved factor XII). However, no difference in accessibility of the epitope for mAb F1 was observed between cleaved and single-chain factor XII when bound to glass. mAb F3 appeared to bind to both single-chain and cleaved factor XII in plasma as well as when bound to glass. Neither mAb F1, nor F3 affected the amidolytic activity of factor XIIa, whereas both mAb F1 and F3 inhibited factor XII-coagulant activity to about 15 and 70%, respectively, at a molar ratio of mAb to factor XII of 20 to 1. mAb F1, as well as F(ab')2 and F(ab') fragments of this antibody induced activation of the contact system in plasma, as reflected by the generation of factor XIIa. C1 inhibitor and kallikrein. C1 inhibitor complexes. Activation was induced neither upon incubation with mAb F3, nor with that of control mAbs. mAb F1-induced contact activation required the presence of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and, in contrast to activation by negatively charged surfaces, was not inhibited by the presence of Polybrene. Based on these results we propose that a conformational change in factor XII is a key event in the activation process of this molecule. This conformational change can be induced by binding of factor XII to a surface as well as by proteolytic cleavage. As mAb F1 can also induce this conformational change, this antibody may provide a unique tool in studies of the activation of factor XII."
https://openalex.org/W1571930679,"Abstract Diphtheria toxin interaction with membranes has been studied by following the release of a fluorescent dye (calcein) encapsulated within large unilamellar vesicles. Results showed that diphtheria toxin induced temperature- as well as pH-dependent permeability changes in these model membranes. Interestingly, insertion of the channel-forming B domain was not sufficient for calcein release, since dye release from vesicles composed of dimyristoyllecithin:cholesterol:dicetylphosphate 4:3:0.8) was completely inhibited at low temperatures which permitted B insertion. Rather, the temperature dependence of calcein release from and A domain insertion into dimyristoyllecithin:cholesterol:dicetyl phosphate vesicles suggest some relationship between formation and fragment A translocation across membranes. However, the nature of the toxin is called into question by our observations that size, in addition to activity, was pH-dependent. On the basis of these experiments, it is proposed that the toxin channel is the result of localized perturbations in the lipid bilayer at the interface between lipids and inserted toxin molecules that are sufficiently large in fluid membranes at low pH to allow the translocation of fragment A across the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1581888663,"Abstract Upon incubation of antithrombin III with thrombin in the presence of a monoclonal recognizing an epitope exposed on the heavy chain part of thrombin-cleaved two-chain antithrombin III, antithrombin III was preferentially cleaved by the enzyme as a substrate, rather than covalently complexed with the enzyme to form an equimolar, stable acyl complex. Once the stable acyl complex was formed between the enzyme and antithrombin III, however, no further liberation of two-chain antithrombin III was observed. Kinetic studies showed that heparin does not affect this reaction, although generation of thrombin-cleaved two-chain antithrombin III is apparently accelerated in accordance with the rate constant for heparin-enhanced thrombin-antithrombin III complex formation. Here we propose the term antibody for an that triggers deacylation of an intermediate enzyme-inhibitor complex by switching the enzyme-inhibitor reaction from the major pathway of stable acyl complex formation to an alternative pathway of cleavage of the inhibitor as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1526446436,"Abstract The molecular organization of human plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), and its 1:1 and 1:2 trypsin complexes, have been investigated using the small-angle x-ray scattering method. All the experimental data can be explained by the same basic model, consisting of three oblate-shaped domains arranged in a sandwich-like structure. Each of the larger peripheral domains consists of two parallel elliptic cylinders associated side-by-side, whereas the smaller central domain consists of just one elliptic cylinder. In the native molecule the three domains are separated by regions of low protein density. Upon trypsin binding the dimensions of the four peripheral cylinders remain unchanged, but their positioning in space is reorganized so that the whole molecule becomes more compact. The model thus offers a plausible explanation for the mechanism of inactivating of the protease by entrapping it between the two larger domains. By comparing the shape and dimensions of the total molecule with those determined for the half-molecular fragment, obtained after reducing the intersubunit disulfide bonds, we propose that the fragment consists of just one of the peripheral domains plus half of the central domain. Different projections of the model are consistent with the electron micrographs of alpha 2M given in the literature. The model can also explain many of the physical and chemical properties recorded for alpha 2M and its protease complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1497801118,"The overproduction of heterologous gene products in mammalian cells is often a prerequisite for studies of protein structure, function, and therapeutic efficacy. We report that recombinant fusion of a nonselectable reporter template into the intronic sequences of an amplifiable minigene gives dramatically enhanced co-expression efficiency in stable, primary transformants. Further incremental selective pressure for marker gene amplification results in the rapid acquisition of very high expression levels from the intronically positioned reporter. Nested within a constitutively expressing gene, these templates can be independently regulated at moderate gene dosage levels. Intronic positioning may therefore be of general utility for a variety of recombinant studies."
