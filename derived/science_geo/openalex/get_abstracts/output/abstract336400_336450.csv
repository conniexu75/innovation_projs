https://openalex.org/W2171258992,"For more than 50 years the identity of ""calorigen,"" the agent that triggers pronounced heat production in the flowers and inflorescences of some thermogenic plants, remained obscure. Mass spectroscopic analysis of highly purified calorigen extracted from the male flowers of Sauromatum guttatum Schott (voodoo lily) revealed the presence of 2-hydroxybenzoic (salicylic) acid. Application of salicylic acid at 0.13 microgram per gram (fresh weight) to sections of the upper part of the plant's immature spadix, known as the appendix, led to temperature increases of as much as 12 Celsius degrees. These increases duplicated, in both magnitude and timing, the temperature increases produced by the crude calorigen extract. The sensitivity of appendix tissue to salicylic acid increases daily with the approach of anthesis and is controlled by the photoperiod. Thus, at least in some Arum lilies, salicylic acid functions as an endogenous regulator of heat production."
https://openalex.org/W1807492636,"It has been known for the last decade that primordial helium incorporated in Earth at the time of its formation is still being degassed during the formation of new ocean crust at spreading ocean ridges. It is now clear that somewhat contrary to expectation, substantial degassing is also taking place through the continental crust. In western Europe the escape of mantle volatiles seems to occur largely where the crust is undergoing active extension. Although it is known that melting is the principal process for extracting and concentrating helium from the mantle at ocean ridges, the equivalent subcontinental process remains poorly understood. The same elements that are responsible for most of Earth's radiogenic heating (uranium and thorium) are also responsible for the generation of radiogenic helium. The present rate of mantle heat loss, however, is out of equilibrium with the rate of helium loss-too large by about a factor of 20. Either radiogenic helium is accumulated in the mantle while heat escapes or current models for the bulk chemistry of Earth are in error and much of the terrestrial heat loss is nonradiogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1967697037,"Abundant skeletal remains demonstrate that lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, tyrannosaurid, and troodontid dinosaurs lived on the Alaskan North Slope during late Campanian-early Maestrichtian time (about 66 to 76 million years ago) in a deltaic environment dominated by herbaceous vegetation. The high ground terrestrial plant community was a mild- to cold-temperate forest composed of coniferous and broad leaf trees. The high paleolatitude (about 70 degrees to 85 degrees North) implies extreme seasonal variation in solar insolation, temperature, and herbivore food supply. Great distances of migration to contemporaneous evergreen floras and the presence of both juvenile and adult hadrosaurs suggest that they remained at high latitudes year-round. This challenges the hypothesis that short-term periods of darkness and temperature decrease resulting from a bolide impact caused dinosaurian extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1979769947,"The electronic and geometric structures of surfaces are closely related to each other. Conventional surface science techniques can study one or the other, but not both at the same time. Recent developments in scanning tunneling microscopy have made it possible to study simultaneously the electronic and geometric structure of Si(111) and Si(001) surfaces. Surface states can be atomically resolved in space and energy; thus the electronic structure of single atoms on surfaces can be studied in detail. The various surface states observed on silicon surfaces are found to derive from different atomic-scale features in the surface geometric structure. Scanning tunneling microscopy has now bridged the gap between electronic and geometric structure, providing a unique opportunity to obtain a better understanding of many surface processes at the atomic level."

https://openalex.org/W2076920249,"Haughton Astrobleme is a major extraterrestrial impact structure located on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Northwest Territories. Apatite grains separated from shocked Precambrian gneiss contained in a polymict breccia from the center of the astrobleme yielded a fission-track date of 22.4 million +/- 1.4 million years before the present or early Miocene (Aquitanian). This provides a date for the impact event and an upper limit on the age of crater-filling lake sediments and a flora and vertebrate fauna occurring in them. A geologically precise date for these fossils provides an important biostratigraphic reference point for interpreting the biotic evolution of the Arctic."

https://openalex.org/W1964537395,"Government deficits and debt are surpluses and assets of the private sector of the economy that stimulate private spending. Official measures of deficits are misleading, however, for failing to distinguish public investment from current spending and for failing to adjust for inflation. Correctly measured real deficits have contributed to the growth of gross national product, consumption, and imports, and to investment as well. Optimal policy consistent with balanced growth calls not for elimination of the nominal deficit but rather for prudent deficit reduction accompanied by and stemming at least partly from sufficient monetary stimulus to achieve and sustain relatively full employment."

https://openalex.org/W2034459915,"This article summarizes some of the recent research described at the Second International Conference on Paleoceanography, 6-13 September 1986, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The article highlights research of the spectral mapping (SPECMAP) group that has been isolating the climate effects of each of the three Milankovitch cycles from the jumble of climate changes recorded in marine sediments. The two new directions reported were (1) greater use of climate indictors, such as strength of monsoon winds over the ocean and amount of monsoon rain over land, and (2) extension of analyses to a global scale, including preliminary results from 22 deep-sea sediment cores scattered somewhat unevenly about the world's oceans."

https://openalex.org/W2089526425,"Through the kindness of Dr. T. Takamine, I received some information about very accurate experimental determinations of the second order Stark effect in hydrogen, carried out by Professor M. Kiuti. Unfortunately this material came too late to be used in my article on the Stark effect (Phys. Rev., 28, p. 695, 1926), therefore, I should like to make these beautiful observations available to a larger public through the agency of Science."
