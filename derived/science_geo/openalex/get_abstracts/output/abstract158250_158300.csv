Ironically, the cost of using immune defenses could itself reduce host fitness. This indirect cost of parasitism is often not visible because of compensatory resource intake. Here, workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, were challenged with lipopolysaccharides and micro-latex beads to induce their immune system under starvation (i.e., not allowing compensatory intake). Compared with controls, survival of induced workers was significantly reduced (by 50 to 70%)."

Atomic force microscopy was used to resolve the mechanism of calcite inhibition by magnesium through molecular-scale determination of the thermodynamic and kinetic controls of magnesium on calcite formation. Comparison of directly measured step velocities to standard impurity models demonstrated that enhanced mineral solubility through magnesium incorporation inhibited calcite growth. Terrace width measurements on calcite growth spirals were consistent with a decrease in effective supersaturation due to magnesium incorporation. Ca(1-x)Mg(x)CO3 solubilities determined from microscopic observations of step dynamics can thus be linked to macroscopic measurements."

We found that in the rat heart, 92% of NAD+glycohydrolase activity is associated with mitochondria. This activity was not modified by the addition of Triton X-100, although it was abolished by mild treatment with the protease Nagarse, a condition that did not affect the energy-linked properties of mitochondria. The addition of Ca2+ to isolated rat heart mitochondria resulted in a profound decrease in their NAD+ content, which followed mitochondrial swelling. Cyclosporin A(CsA), a PTP inhibitor, completely prevented NAD+ depletion but had no effect on the glycohydrolase activity. Thus, in isolated mitochondria PTP opening makes NAD+ available for its enzymatic hydrolysis. Perfused rat hearts subjected to global ischemia for 30 min displayed a 30% decrease in tissue NAD+ content, which was not modified by extending the duration of ischemia. Reperfusion resulted in a more severe reduction of both total and mitochondrial contents of NAD+, which could be measured in the coronary effluent together with lactate dehydrogenase. The addition of 0.2 μm CsA or of its analogue MeVal-4-Cs (which does not inhibit calcineurin) maintained higher NAD+ contents, especially in mitochondria, and significantly protected the heart from reperfusion damage, as shown by the reduction in lactate dehydrogenase release. Thus, upon reperfusion after prolonged ischemia, PTP opening in the heart can be documented as a CsA-sensitive release of NAD+, which is then partly degraded by glycohydrolase and partly released when sarcolemmal integrity is compromised. These results demonstrate that PTP opening is a causative event in reperfusion damage of the heart.

Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 1-13Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Indeed, cyanide (5Ganote C.E. Worstell J. Kaltenbach J.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1976; 84: 327-350PubMed Google Scholar) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (6Ganote C.E. McGarr J. Liu S.Y. Kaltenbach J.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1980; 12: 387-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) largely reduce the release of intracellular enzymes, the marker of cell death induced by postischemic reperfusion. However, after more than 25 years, the specific mechanisms underlying these phenomenological observations have yet to be elucidated. A large body of experimental evidence suggests that a suboptimal mitochondrial function could produce low levels of ATP, which in the presence of even a modest rise in [Ca2+]i might cause hypercontracture in isolated cardiomyocytes (7Miyata H. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Silverman H.S. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and sarcolemma rupture in intact hearts (8Ganote C.E. Armstrong S.C. Cardiovasc.

Such a sequence of events could be set in motion by the opening of the mitochondrial PTP,1 a high conductance channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (10Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The open probability of this channel is regulated by several factors including mitochondrial membrane potential difference (Δψm), Ca2+, matrix pH, and CsA, a high affinity inhibitor (11Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). PTP opening causes a Ca2+-dependent increase of mitochondrial permeability to ions and solutes with molecular masses of up to 1500 Da, matrix swelling, and mitochondrial deenergization. Several studies performed on isolated cardiomyocytes (12Nazareth W. Yafei N. Crompton M. J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1461-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 16Griffiths E.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) support the idea that PTP opening might be pivotal in determining the transition of the ischemic damage to the irreversible phase. However, the role of PTP is not yet defined due to the difficulty of assaying its opening in situ. PTP opening is likely to alter several metabolic pathways linked to energy metabolism, and results from a classic study suggest that NAD+ catabolism may be one of them (17Vinogradov A. Scarpa A. Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Indeed, the content of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides was drastically reduced upon Ca2+ addition, a condition that could have induced PTP opening. Here we show that in RHM opening of the PTP causes the release of mitochondrial NAD+ followed by its hydrolysis by a CsA-insensitive NAD+ glycohydrolase localized outside the matrix space. Furthermore, we document that in the intact heart during postischemic reperfusion mitochondrial NAD+ content is severely decreased in a process that is largely reduced by PTP inhibitors, suggesting that the hydrolysis of mitochondrial NAD+ directly reflects PTP opening in situ. The maintenance of mitochondrial NAD+ is thus associated with a significant protection from myocyte death, indicating that the PTP plays a key role in this process. All aspects of animal care and experimentation were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85–23, revised in 1996), and the national laws of Italy concerning the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Padova. Hearts excised from male Wistar rats (weighing 180–200 g) were perfused by the nonrecirculating Langendorff technique as previously described (18Di Lisa F. Menabò R. Barbato R. Siliprandi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H455-H461PubMed Google Scholar). Hearts were not stimulated, and the flow was maintained at 12 ml/min throughout all the perfusion protocols except during ischemia, which was induced by the complete abolition of coronary flow for periods ranging from 30 to 90 min. Left ventricular wall temperature was maintained at 36–37 °C irrespective of coronary flow by suspending the heart in a water-jacketed chamber. Mitochondria were isolated by conventional procedures of differential centrifugation (19Lindenmayer G.E. Sordahl L.A. Schwartz A. Circ. Res. 1968; 23: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Freshly excised rat hearts were homogenized by Ultra-Turrax in a medium containing 0.18 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% fatty acid-poor bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. To remove EDTA and albumin, mitochondrial pellets were washed twice with 0.18 m KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (18Di Lisa F. Menabò R. Barbato R. Siliprandi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H455-H461PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments aimed at characterizing the localization of the mitochondrial NAD+ glycohydrolase, mitochondria were isolated after the incubation of the whole tissue homogenate with Nagarse as previously described (20Di Lisa F. Fan C.Z. Gambassi G. Hogue B.A. Kudryashova I. Hansford R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H2188-H2197PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was monitored as the changes in absorbance at 540 nm as previously described (21Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22581-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out at 25 °C with 0.25 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml in the RB medium, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Mops, 0.05 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, and 1 mm Pi-Tris. PTP opening was induced by the addition of 0.25 mmCa2+. NAD+ and CoASH were measured after perchloric acid extraction. To achieve this, the hearts were freeze-clamped with aluminum tongues cooled in liquid nitrogen, and 0.3 g of freeze-clamped tissue (stored at −70 °C) was ground and mixed thoroughly with 2 ml of 14% (v/v) HClO4. After thawing at 4 °C, this mixture was homogenized and centrifuged as previously described (18Di Lisa F. Menabò R. Barbato R. Siliprandi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H455-H461PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of isolated mitochondria, 0.1 ml of 21% (v/v) HClO4 was added to 1 mg of protein/ml suspensions. In neutralized HClO4 extracts, NAD+ was determined fluorometrically with alcohol dehydrogenase (22Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar), and CoASH was assayed with an enzymatic cycling method (23Veloso D. Veech R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial hydrolysis of endogenous FAD was measured as the increase in fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths at 450 and 520 nm, respectively) in the supernatant of mitochondria pelleted after the various incubation protocols (24Barile M. Brizio C. De Virgilio C. Delfine S. Quagliariello E. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fluorescence increase is caused by the release of the hydrolytic products, namely flavin mononucleotide and riboflavin. The activity of mitochondrial NAD+ glycohydrolase was measured by monitoring the enhancement in fluorescence emission caused by the hydrolysis of ε-NAD (25Barrio J.R. Secrist J.A. Leonard N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out by adding RHM (0.2 mg of protein/ml of RB medium) with 200 μmε-NAD, which was found to saturate the NADase activity. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS5 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set to 310 nm. Fluorescence emission was followed at 410 nm. The concentration of ε-NAD was determined by the conversion of ε-NAD to ε-NADH using the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction and assuming a molar extinction coefficient for ε-NADH of 6.2 × 106 cm2/mol at 340 nm. The fluorescence changes produced by mitochondria were calibrated by using a standard curve produced by incubating ε-NAD (at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 μm) with excess amounts of NADase from Neurospora crassa (25Barrio J.R. Secrist J.A. Leonard N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). During postischemic reperfusion, 1-ml samples of the effluent were collected at 1-min intervals for the first 5 min and at 5-min intervals until the end of the reperfusion protocol. LDH activity was measured by means of a classic procedure (26Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974: 607-612Crossref Google Scholar). Neutralized HClO4extracts of the effluents were used for NAD+ assay. Data are presented as cumulative values for the entire reperfusion period. Lactate dehydrogenase, NAD+, and NADH were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other enzymes and chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available grade. CsA and MeVal-4-Cs were generous gifts of Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). The initial aim of our study was to determine whether in isolated mitochondria NAD+ hydrolysis could be related to PTP opening. In the experiments of Fig. 1, the addition of 0.2 mm Ca2+ to RHM (0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein × ml−1) induced a rapid decrease of absorbance at 540 nm, which is indicative of swelling. Under these conditions the NAD+ content was reduced to less than 20% of control values within 20–30 min, whereas FAD and CoASH were not hydrolyzed (results not shown). Fig. 1 clearly documents that the fall in mitochondrial NAD+ content began after the completion of mitochondrial swelling and that both processes were largely prevented by pretreatment with 0.2 μm CsA, suggesting that NAD+ disappearance was related to PTP opening. The decrease in NAD+ content was also prevented by 5 mm nicotinamide, an inhibitor of NAD+glycohydrolase that did not affect either the rate or the extent of mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 1). On the other hand, neither NAD+ depletion nor PTP opening was modified by the addition of AMP, which inhibits nucleotide pyrophosphatase (27Barile M. Passarella S. Danese G. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar). Superimposable results on the relationship between PTP opening and NAD+decrease could be obtained in rat liver mitochondria (results not shown). Fig. 2 summarizes a series of experiments performed to characterize the activity and determine the location of NAD+ glycohydrolase. RHM displayed a NAD+hydrolytic activity of 0.92 nmol/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. Considering a mitochondrial content of 55 mg of proteins/g of wet heart tissue (28Idell Wenger J.A. Grotyohann L.W. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mitochondrial NAD+ glycohydrolase activity represents 92% of that measured in the whole tissue (53 milliunits/g wet weight). Because the NAD+ hydrolytic activity was totally inhibited by nicotinamide and not affected by AMP (data not shown), we attribute this activity to NAD+ glycohydrolase. The rate of ε-NAD hydrolysis was not modified by the addition of Triton X-100 to well coupled RHM (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the incubation of RHM with a serine protease Nagarse, frequently used to increase the yield of mitochondrial extraction from heart tissues (20Di Lisa F. Fan C.Z. Gambassi G. Hogue B.A. Kudryashova I. Hansford R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H2188-H2197PubMed Google Scholar, 29Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produced a time-dependent reduction of NAD+glycohydrolase (Fig. 2) without affecting the respiratory control (data not shown) and, thus, the integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These results demonstrate that the NAD+glycohydrolase activity is not localized within the mitochondrial matrix and indicate that NAD+ hydrolysis occurs outside this compartment. Importantly, the NAD+ glycohydrolase activity was not affected by CsA (Fig. 2). From these results, we conclude that PTP opening in isolated mitochondria causes the release of intramitochondrial NAD+, which then becomes a substrate for the glycohydrolase located outside the matrix space. The possible occurrence of tissue and mitochondrial NAD+hydrolysis was then investigated in isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemia and postischemic reperfusion. Figs.3 and 4document the changes of the tissue contents of NAD+ in perfused hearts and isolated mitochondria. After 30 min of ischemia, the NAD+ content was decreased by 30% and did not show further changes as the ischemic period was extended (Fig. 3). On the other hand, a reperfusion period of 20 min resulted in a severe decrease of tissue NAD+ contents (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 also shows that the mitochondrial NAD+ was depleted almost completely, suggesting that these organelles contribute to a large extent to the overall changes in cellular NAD+. It is noteworthy that the decrease of NAD+ content was largely prevented by 0.2 μm of both CsA and its analogue MeVal-4-Cs. A similar loss of tissue and mitochondrial NAD+was also observed in aerobic hearts exposed to the Ca2+paradox protocol (readmission of Ca2+ in the perfusion buffer after 10 min of perfusion in the absence of Ca2+), which is known to induce a massive intracellular Ca2+overload (30Zimmerman A.N. Hülsmann W.C. Nature. 1966; 211: 646-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) (results not shown).Figure 4CsA reduces the decrease in tissue and mitochondrial NAD + contents associated with postischemic reperfusion. In perfused rat hearts, coronary flow was reestablished (reperfusion) for 20 min after 90 min of ischemia. At the end of the perfusion protocols, hearts were either freeze-clamped or used for mitochondria isolation. NAD+ was measured in perchloric acid extracts of tissue or mitochondrial samples as described under “Materials and Methods.” CsA or MeVal-4-Cs (MV-4-CS) (0.2 μm) was added to the perfusion buffer and present throughout the perfusion protocol. Values are means ± S.E. of six experiments. *, p < 0.01 statistical difference between treated and control hearts.Normoxia, normoxic perfusion for 90 min; Isc+Rep, 30 min of reperfusion after 90 min of ischemia; w.w., wet weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether NAD+ was released from the cells. The experiments of Fig. 5 show that NAD+ was detected in the coronary effluent together with LDH and that both events were largely reduced by both CsA and MeVal-4-Cs. Indeed, in hearts perfused with these PTP inhibitors, the preservation of the mitochondrial NAD+ pool was associated with a significant decrease of LDH release in the coronary effluent (Fig. 5). The present results establish a causal link between the opening of the PTP and hydrolysis of mitochondrial NAD+ both in isolated organelles and intact hearts, and they document the relevance of the PTP in the injury of the heart produced by postischemic reperfusion. In our protocols, the disappearance of mitochondrial NAD+ is clearly the consequence of its release in the intermembrane space where it becomes the substrate of glycohydrolase. The presence of NAD+ glycohydrolase within the matrix space could be excluded because (i) treatment with Nagarse completely abolished endogenous NAD+ hydrolysis under conditions where the inner membrane was demonstrably unaffected, and (ii) the addition of Triton X-100 did not increase the hydrolysis of added ε-NAD by intact isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2). In keeping with the results of a previous study on liver mitochondria (31Boyer C.S. Moore G.A. Moldeus P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4016-4020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these findings indicate that NAD+ glycohydrolase is located in the outer membrane (24Barile M. Brizio C. De Virgilio C. Delfine S. Quagliariello E. Passarella S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the inner mitochondrial membrane separates the matrix space where NAD+ is accumulated (and possibly synthesized (27Barile M. Passarella S. Danese G. Quagliariello E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar)) from the intermembrane space where NAD+ hydrolysis takes place. The redistribution of NAD+ between these two compartments is made possible by PTP opening because mitochondrial swelling precedes NAD+ hydrolysis, and both processes are inhibited by CsA (Fig. 1), which demonstrably did not affect the activity of NAD+ glycohydrolase. Our results strongly argue against a model where mitochondrial Ca2+ would be released upon the ADP-ribosylation of an intrinsic protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane following pyridine nucleotide hydrolysis by a Ca2+-stimulated matrix glycohydrolase (32Lotscher H.R. Winterhalter K.H. Carafoli E. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9325-9330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Richter C. Winterhalter K.H. Baumhuter S. Lotscher H.R. Moser B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3188-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on the present results, we conclude that PTP opening, which induces the efflux of mitochondrial Ca2+, is the cause rather than the consequence of NAD+ hydrolysis that cannot occur within the matrix space (Fig. 2). We also note that inhibition of Ca2+ efflux by CsA was also observed by Richter et al. (35Richter C. Theus M. Schlegel J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who attributed it to the inhibition of glycohydrolase by CsA. Our experiments demonstrate that this is not the case (Fig. 2) and conclusively prove that NAD+ hydrolysis is only possible after PTP opening. Given that in postischemic reperfusion of the heart we found a CsA-sensitive decrease of mitochondrial and total NAD+(Fig. 4), clarification of this issue was essential and provided a mechanistic clue into the complex mitochondrial changes occurring in this pathological condition. In principle, mitochondrial dysfunction could be either the cause or the consequence of reperfusion injury of the heart, a complex issue that is far from having been solved. For instance, sarcolemmal rupture results in the exposure of mitochondria to the millimolar [Ca2+] of the extracellular milieu, which would cause the immediate failure of mitochondria even if they had been fully functional before this terminal event. Not surprisingly, the appearance of calcium phosphate precipitates within the matrix represents the most reliable sign of myocyte necrosis (36Shen A.C. Jennings R.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1972; 67: 417-421PubMed Google Scholar). The present results are thus extremely relevant because they indicate that PTP opening is a causative event rather than a consequence in the complex sequence of events linking mitochondrial failure to myocyte injury. Indeed, the loss of tissue viability was greatly reduced by CsA, and the effect could be traced to PTP inhibition because hydrolysis of mitochondrial NAD+ was fully prevented in parallel with cell protection (Figs. 4 and 5). It has to be pointed out that CsA can act through mechanisms other than PTP inhibition. In particular, CsA also inhibits calcineurin, and this effect was suggested to contribute to the protection afforded by CsA in both brain and heart ischemia (37Nishinaka Y. Sugiyama S. Yokota M. Saito H. Ozawa T. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Morioka M. Hamada J. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. Prog. Neurobiol. (OXF). 1999; 58: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Ramos M. Hernandez M. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 404: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that calcineurin inhibition was involved in the protective effects of CsA in our model, we also tested the cyclosporin derivative MeVal-4-Cs, which binds cyclophilins and inhibits the PTP but does not affect calcineurin activity (40Zenke G. Baumann G. Wenger R.M. Hiestand P. Quesniaux V. Andersen E. Schreier M.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The fact that MeVal-4-Cs was as protective as CsA strongly suggests that calcineurin is not involved and supports our interpretation that PTP opening plays a pivotal role in ensuing myocyte death during postischemic reperfusion. In this scenario, the changes produced by reperfusion in viable myocytes would promote PTP opening, and this event would be followed rather than preceded by the loss of sarcolemmal integrity. Thus, mitochondria would act as transducers and amplifiers of an initial trigger provided by reperfusion, and NAD+ hydrolysis could be part of the amplification pathway. The availability of mitochondrial NAD+ could indeed result in the formation of both cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, which are well known promoters of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (42Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the mitochondrial hydrolysis of NAD+ even by a fraction of the mitochondria could thus eventually induce an increase of intracellular [Ca2+], promoting the further spreading of the permeability transition to all mitochondria in the cell. This would then cause generalized mitochondrial dysfunction and establish the conditions (low ATP and high Ca2+) that precipitate irreversible contracture and sarcolemmal rupture. We also note that our results provide a mechanism for the decrease of NAD+contents that had already been reported in the ischemic myocardium (43Nunez R. Calva E. Marsch M. Briones E. Lopez Soriano F. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 231: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,44Schaper J. Schaper W. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1983; 1: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our results also highlight the relevance of mitochondria in the cellular utilization and catabolism of pyridine nucleotides, especially in the myocardium. Indeed, we found that mitochondria are the major stores of NAD+ and possess nearly all of the NAD+glycohydrolase activity of the cell (72 and 92% of the total, respectively). Thus, any condition leading to a major decrease in cellular NAD+ contents is probably contributed by mitochondria. It has been proposed that the activation of PARP results in the depletion of cellular NAD+ and consequently of ATP that is required for NAD+ resynthesis (45Thiemermann C. Bowes J. Myint F.P. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 46Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol.

Our data indicate that the activation of PARP must be coupled with the utilization of mitochondrial NAD+, which is only made possible by PTP opening. Given the importance of both processes for cell death our results may provide a further biochemical link between mitochondrial and cellular pathways to cell death. Future studies will determine whether the same stimuli that alter DNA structure stimulating PARP activation might simultaneously promote PTP opening. Although the conditions of the present study are designed to address the role of mitochondrial release of NAD+ in a model of cell death, PTP opening could underlie the bidirectional fluxes of NAD+ through the inner mitochondrial membrane observed in digitonin-treated cell lines (47Rustin P.

The idea that the inner membrane is permeable to pyridine nucleotides contrasts with notions that are, however, entirely based on studies with isolated mitochondria where incubation conditions are designed to maximize energy coupling by minimizing the chances of pore opening. We have documented transient PTP openings in healthy cells (48Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2047782251,"ErbB receptors are a family of ligand-activated tyrosine kinases that play a central role in proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. ErbB2 is overexpressed in >25% of breast and ovarian cancers and is correlated with poor prognosis. Although ErbB2 and ErbB1 are highly homologous, they respond quite differently to geldanamycin (GA), an antibiotic that is a specific inhibitor of the chaperone protein Hsp90. Thus, although both mature and nascent ErbB2 proteins are down-regulated by GA, only nascent ErbB1 is sensitive to the drug. To reveal the underlying mechanism behind these divergent responses, we made a chimeric receptor (ErbB1/2) composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of ErbB1 and the intracellular domain of ErbB2. The ErbB1/2 protein is functional since its kinase activity was stimulated by epidermal growth factor. The sensitivity of ErbB1/2 to GA was similar to that of ErbB2 and unlike that of ErbB1, indicating that the intracellular domain of the chimera confers GA sensitivity. This finding also suggests that the GA sensitivity of mature ErbB2 depends on cytosolic Hsp90, rather than Grp94, a homolog of Hsp90 that is restricted to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, although both chaperones bind to and are inhibited by GA. Lack of Grp94 involvement in mediating ErbB2 sensitivity to GA is further suggested by the fact that a GA derivative with low affinity for Grp94 efficiently depleted ErbB2 protein in treated cells. To localize the specific region of ErbB2 that confers GA sensitivity, we made truncated receptors with progressive deletions of the cytoplasmic domain and tested the GA sensitivity of these molecules. We found that ErbB2 constructs containing an intact kinase domain retained GA sensitivity, whereas those lacking the kinase domain (ErbB2/DK) lost responsiveness to GA completely. Hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated with all ErbB2 constructs that were sensitive to GA, but not with ErbB2/DK or ErbB1. Both tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ErbB2 proteins were similarly sensitive to GA, as was a kinase-dead ErbB2 mutant. These data suggest that Hsp90 uniquely stabilizes ErbB2 via interaction with its kinase domain and that GA stimulates ErbB2 degradation secondary to disruption of ErbB2/Hsp90 association.

ErbB receptors are single transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain (ECD) that bears two cysteine-rich clusters and is responsible for interaction with polypeptide ligands and an intracellular domain (ICD) that contains a tyrosine kinase motif and a long hydrophilic segment at the C-terminal end (4O'Rourke D.M. Zhang X. Greene M.I. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 209-219PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the ECD with ligands causes hetero- and/or homodimerization of ErbB proteins, followed by stimulation of their intrinsic kinase activity, leading in turn to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail (5Klapper L.N.

Although no ligand has been found for ErbB2, the protein seems to be the preferred dimerization partner for the other ErbB receptors, perhaps because it is not normally a target of Cbl and may thus protect the other ErbB members with which it dimerizes from Cbl-mediated down-regulation (8Muthuswamy S.K.

Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, overexpression of ErbB2 in cells devoid of other ErbB proteins potentiates cell migration. These results suggest that ErbB2 expression is related to the malignancy of tumor cells. In fact,ErbB2 is often amplified in various solid tumors, and the clinical implications of its overexpression in breast and ovarian cancers have been well described (5Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H.

Geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic, is a specific inhibitor of the 90-kDa chaperone protein family, which includes the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsp90 (13Whitesell L.

GA has antitumor activity in vivo and has been shown to cause rapid depletion of the ErbB2 protein mediated by its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (16Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Although ErbB2 is highly homologous to ErbB1 in amino acid sequence, its sensitivity to GA is quite different. Whereas only newly synthesized ErbB1 is sensitive to GA, both mature and nascent ErbB2 proteins are efficiently down-regulated by the drug (14Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although association of a number of cytosolic kinases with Hsp90 is necessary to maintain their solubility, intracellular trafficking, and correct response to an activating signal (15Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a requirement for chaperone association with transmembrane kinases is unclear. Likewise, although Grp94 is thought to be part of a chaperone cascade that participates in the maturation process undergone by transmembrane and secreted proteins as they pass through the ER, its direct requirement for or participation in ErbB maturation has not been demonstrated. Because a clinically tolerated GA derivative is currently in phase I trial, it is important to fully understand how it targets the ErbB2 protein for degradation and to uncover the biologic rationale for the divergent responses of ErbB1 and ErbB2 to this drug. ErbB proteins are type I transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domain is glycosylated while in the ER; and thus, these proteins may come in contact with both Hsp90 and Grp94 during their synthesis and maturation. Therefore, the mechanism by which GA destabilizes mature ErbB2 (but not mature ErbB1) might be related to drug effects on ErbB interaction with either or both chaperone proteins. Although initial reports implicated GA interference with ErbB/Grp94 association as the drug's primary mechanism of action with respect to ErbB2 (14Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), at least one study has suggested an involvement of the protein's kinase domain, which never contacts Grp94, in this process (18Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If Grp94 association with ErbB2 at the plasma membrane were responsible for ErbB2 sensitivity to GA, the chaperone would have to remain associated with the extracellular domain of the kinase at the cell surface even though Grp94 is thought to be restricted to the ER. Conversely, if the kinase domain of ErbB2 determines the protein's GA sensitivity, mature ErbB2 should associate with Hsp90. In this study, we demonstrate that a functional chimeric protein containing the ErbB1 extracellular and transmembrane domains and the ErbB2 intracellular domain displays GA sensitivity that is unlike that of ErbB1, but indistinguishable from that of ErbB2. Furthermore, we conclusively show that the GA sensitivity of the mature ErbB2 protein is conferred by its intracellular domain, secondary to GA-mediated disruption of Hsp90 association with this region. Lack of interaction of mature ErbB1 and certain C-terminal ErbB2 truncation mutants with Hsp90 is consistent with the relative insensitivity of these constructs to GA. Finally, a GA derivative with similar affinity for Hsp90, but with a 90-fold weaker affinity for Grp94, depletes ErbB2 protein from tumor cells at a concentration similar to that of GA. Taken together, these data confirm that the stability of the mature ErbB2 protein, in contrast to ErbB1, requires association of its kinase domain with Hsp90.

The first fragment was cut out of pcDNA3-ErbB1 withAcc 65I and Bsm I. The second fragment was amplified from ErbB1 by polymerase chain reaction using the 5′-end primer 5′-CCGGAGCCCAGGGACTGCGTCTCT-3′ and the 3′-end primer 5′-CGCTTCCGGACGATGTGGCGCCTTCGCA-3′, which contains a silent mutation of T to C at position 2208 of ErbB1 to make a Bsp EI cutting site. The third fragment was excised from pcDNA3-ErbB2 using Bsp EI and Xba I. The three fragments were ligated and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector, and the resulting construct was verified by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing. Truncated ErbB2 proteins were made by joining a fragment cut out of pcDNA3-ErbB2 withHin dIII/Sph I with another fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction was performed with the shared 5′-end primer 5′-GATGAGGAGGGCGCATGCCAGCCTT-3′ and the 3′-end primer 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTACTCAGAGGGCAGGGGTACTG-3′ for ErbB2/DT, 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTAGAAGAAGCCCTGCTGGGGTA-3′ for ErbB2/DHC, or 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATCTCCGCATCGTGTACTTCC-3′ for ErbB2/DK. The products of polymerase chain reactions were digested with Sph I and Xho I and, together with the first fragment, were ligated into the pcDNA3 vector. Kinase-deficient ErbB2 (ErbB2/K753A) was made by mutating lysine 753 of wild-type ErbB2 to alanine using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) with the ErbB2-specific primer 5′-ATTCCAGTGGCCATCGCAGTGTTGAGGGAAAA-3′. SKBR3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm Hepes, and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin. COS-7 cell culture medium contained 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm Hepes, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. For transient transfections, each plasmid, which was premixed with FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was added to cells at 50–70% confluency. Cells were continually cultured in the same medium for 24–48 h until lysis. For EGF stimulation, cells were first incubated with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h; then EGF was added at 100 ng/ml; and incubations were continued at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and lysed by scraping in TMNSV buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mmNa2MoO4, 0.09% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with CompleteTM proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 4 μg of mouse monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were precoated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and rotation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.0005% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins (or cell lysates mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described previously (14Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P.

GA was derivatized to Affi-Gel resin (Bio-Rad) as described (13Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Briefly, GA was dissolved in chloroform and allowed to react with 1,6-hexanediamine for 2 h at room temperature. After aqueous extraction, the resulting 17-hexamethylenediamine-17-demethoxygeldanamycin was dried under vacuum, redissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and reacted with Affi-Gel 10 resin for 4 h at room temperature. After several washes, beads were stored in cell lysis buffer and used within 10 days for competition assays. For competition assays, increasing concentrations of soluble test drugs were incubated on ice with cell lysates for 30 min; 100 μl of a 50% suspension of GA resin was added; the volume was adjusted to 500 μl with lysis buffer; and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The GA resin was washed four times with lysis buffer; 100 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer was added; and the samples were processed as described above. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed for Hsp90, and band densities were obtained by densitometry using Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image software. 250-μl binding reactions consisting of 5 μg of Grp94, 20 nm N-[3H]ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and various concentrations of competitor were incubated on ice for 1 h. Grp94 was then collected on polyethyleneimine-treated glass filters, washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), dried, and counted in a scintillation counter to determine the amount of Grp94-bound [3H]NECA (20Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate and corrected for nonspecific ligand binding. ErbB1 and ErbB2 proteins are differentially sensitive to GA. A431 cells, which overexpress ErbB1, and SKBR3 cells, which overexpress ErbB2, were both exposed to GA for varying times, and ErbB proteins in whole cell extracts were detected by Western blotting (Fig.1). Whereas the ErbB2 protein level declined by >80% within 4 h and was nearly undetectable by 6 h, the ErbB1 level did not decline noticeably until 16 h after drug exposure. ErbB1 responded similarly to cycloheximide (data not shown), suggesting that GA effects on ErbB1 were mediated solely by its ability to destabilize newly synthesized ErbB1 protein, as suggested by Sakagami et al. (17Sakagami M. Morrison P. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas mature ErbB2 retained GA sensitivity (14Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4974-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Since ErbB1 and ErbB2 proteins respond differently to GA, we constructed a chimeric protein (ErbB1/2) consisting of the ECD and transmembrane domain of ErbB1 and the ICD of ErbB2 to determine whether the ECD or ICD of ErbB2 determines sensitivity of the mature protein to GA (Fig. 2 A). We ascertained that the chimeric protein was functional by testing its responsiveness to EGF after transfection into COS-7 cells. As is evident from Fig.2 B, EGF efficiently stimulated the autophosphorylation of ErbB1/2, in contrast to its lack of effect on the autophosphorylation of transfected ErbB2 (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). The EGF responsiveness of ErbB1/2 suggests that the protein attained a native conformation in the transfected cells. Next, we compared the GA sensitivity of ErbB1/2 with that of both ErbB1 and ErbB2 following transient transfection into COS-7 cells. Treatment of cells with 1 μm GA for 6 h almost totally depleted ErbB1/2 and ErbB2 proteins, whereas only a portion of ErbB1 was degraded by 6 h (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). These data indicate that mature ErbB1/2 retains ErbB2-like GA sensitivity, thus implying that the ICD of ErbB2, rather than its ECD or transmembrane domain, mediates the responsiveness of the mature protein to GA. The ICD of ErbB2 is 580 amino acids long and is composed of a 14-amino acid juxtamembrane segment, a 343-amino acid kinase domain, and a long hydrophilic C-terminal tail (Fig.3 A). The juxtamembrane segment and the kinase domain are highly conserved between ErbB1 and ErbB2, whereas the C-terminal tail is moderately homologous, albeit a short stretch (amino acids 1097–1123) within this region shows increased homology. To further localize the region of the ICD that mediates the GA response, we progressively truncated ErbB2 from its C terminus (Fig.3 A) and tested the GA sensitivity of these truncations in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Our data show that deletion of the entire hydrophilic C-terminal tail, including the autophosphorylation sites, did not affect the GA sensitivity of ErbB2 since both ErbB2/DT (deletion of 132 amino acids at the C terminus) and ErbB2/DHC (deletion of the last 224 C-terminal amino acids) were effectively depleted by GA (Fig. 3 B). However, when the C-terminal deletion included the kinase domain (ErbB2/DK), the truncated protein lost its GA sensitivity completely. Thus, in cells exposed to 1 μm GA for up to 31 h, the ErbB2/DK protein level remained identical to that in untreated cells (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that neither mature nor nascent ErbB2/DK is sensitive to GA and indicating that the ErbB2 kinase domain is obligatory for GA-induced down-regulation of the protein. Since we have shown that the ErbB2 kinase domain confers sensitivity to GA, we next asked whether an active kinase is required for such sensitivity, as is apparent for Cbl-mediated down-regulation of ErbB1 (7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest considering that ErbB3, a member of the ErbB family containing an inactive kinase domain, is insensitive to GA (21Zheng F.F. Kuduk S.D. Chiosis G. Munster P.N. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Danishefsky S.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2090-2094PubMed Google Scholar). To answer this question, we created a kinase-deficient ErbB2 construct by mutating lysine 753 to alanine, and we tested its sensitivity to GA. ErbB2/K753A was not autophosphorylated on tyrosine in COS-7 cells, in contrast with wild-type ErbB2, confirming its lack of kinase activity (Fig.4, lower panel). However, ErbB2/K753A was depleted from cells by treatment with GA to a degree comparable to wild-type ErbB2 (Fig. 4, upper panel), confirming that the functional activity of the kinase domain is not important for GA-induced down-regulation of ErbB2 and suggesting instead that a structural motif contained within this region plays a major role in conferring GA sensitivity. The chaperone protein Hsp90 is the molecular target of GA in the cytosol (22Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E.

Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). GA exerts its destabilizing effects on soluble kinases by altering their association with Hsp90-containing multiprotein complexes, thereby targeting them for proteolytic degradation (15Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although it has not been shown previously, we reasoned that, in analogy to the soluble kinases, ErbB2 must also interact with Hsp90. We first examined ErbB2/Hsp90 association in ErbB2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells. We immunoprecipitated ErbB2 from SKBR3 cells using an antibody recognizing the ErbB2 ECD, and coprecipitation of Hsp90 was examined by Western blotting. We found that Hsp90 coprecipitated with ErbB2 proteins from untreated SKBR3 cells (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, when cells were treated with GA for 1 h, Hsp90 disappeared from ErbB2 immunoprecipitates, even though at this time we detected no change in the amount of ErbB2 protein immunoprecipitated. As seen with Hsp90-dependent soluble kinases (13Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), an increased association of Hsp70 with ErbB2 coincided with the loss of coprecipitated Hsp90 after GA treatment (Fig. 5 A). GA did not affect the level of either chaperone protein measured in total cell lysate (data not shown). We next examined whether endogenous Hsp90 associated with ErbB1, the ErbB1/2 chimeric protein, and ErbB2 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Although Hsp90 coprecipitated with wild-type ErbB2 and with the ErbB1/2 chimera, the chaperone was not found in ErbB1 immunoprecipitates, even though all three ErbB constructs were expressed to a similar degree (Fig. 5 B). Thus, Hsp90 association (or its lack of) with these transfected proteins correlates with their sensitivity profiles for GA. EGF did not affect the binding of Hsp90 to the EGF-responsive ErbB1/2 chimera, suggesting that Hsp90 association is not regulated by receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.5 B) and supporting our earlier data (see Fig. 4) that the tyrosine phosphorylation state of ErbB2 does not affect its GA sensitivity. Last, we examined endogenous Hsp90 association with the panel of C-terminal ErbB2 truncation mutants expressed in COS-7 cells, and we found that Hsp90 coprecipitated with all of the ErbB2 truncations, except ErbB2/DK (Fig. 5 C). Again, this correlates perfectly with the respective GA sensitivities of these truncated ErbB2 proteins and indicates the importance of Hsp90 association in modulating ErbB2 stability. To determine whether GA binding to Grp94 may also contribute to drug-stimulated ErbB2 destabilization, we utilized a GA derivative, WX514, with 3-fold less affinity than GA for Hsp90, but with 90-fold weaker affinity for Grp94. Relative drug binding affinities for Hsp90 were determined by competition of soluble drugs with Hsp90 binding to immobilized GA, as described previously (13Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Relative binding affinities for Grp94 were determined by drug competition with the adenosine nucleotide analog [3H]NECA binding to soluble Grp94, as NECA and GA share the same binding site on Grp94 (20Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6(A and B), soluble GA competed with immobilized GA for Hsp90 binding with an IC50 ∼0.3 μm, whereas the IC50 for WX514 was ∼1 μm. In contrast, the IC50 for GA competition with [3H]NECA binding to Grp94 was ∼1 μm, whereas that of WX514 was 90 μm. With these data in hand, we examined the ability of WX514 to deplete the mature ErbB2 protein from SKBR3 cells (Fig. 6 C). Corresponding data obtained with GA are shown for comparison. The concentration of WX514 that caused 50% ErbB2 depletion was ∼3.5 μm, whereas at 10 μm WX514, ErbB2 depletion was complete. These concentrations are 3- and 10-fold, respectively, the relative affinity of WX514 for Hsp90, but they are one-twenty-fifth and one-ninth the relative affinity of WX514 for Grp94. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that inhibition of Hsp90, but not Grp94, is responsible for ErbB2 destabilization. ErbB1 and ErbB2 are highly homologous type I transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases whose overexpression in various solid tumors correlates with poor clinical prognosis. Mature ErbB1 and ErbB2 proteins are differentially sensitive to GA. Although in their nascent form, both ErbB proteins are destabilized by this drug, only mature ErbB2 retains GA sensitivity. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. GA binds specifically to the cytosolic chaperone protein Hsp90(13) and to its ER-restricted homolog Grp94(14). Although GA binding to Grp94 probably inhibits its chaperone activity in the ER (20Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the nature of Grp94 function is still not well understood, although along with other chaperones, it is thought to participate in the maturation of transmembrane and secreted proteins (25Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Hsp90 is somewhat clearer. It forms two multiprotein complexes, each composed of a set of distinct co-chaperone proteins. These Hsp90-containing multi-chaperone complexes in turn associate with a distinct set of client proteins (e.g. many soluble kinases and steroid receptors). The nature of the particular multi-chaperone complex in which Hsp90 participates is determined by its conformation, which is regulated by occupation of an amino-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket by either ATP or ADP. When ATP-bound, Hsp90 forms a multi-chaperone complex that stabilizes its client protein and permits its activation. In contrast, when ADP-bound, Hsp90 forms a multi-chaperone complex that targets its client protein to the proteasome for degradation. The formation of both types of Hsp90-containing multi-chaperone complexes and their association with client proteins are labile and reversible and depend primarily upon intracellular ATP concentration. GA binds in the nucleotide pocket of Hsp90 with higher affinity than either ATP or ADP, but the conformation of GA-bound Hsp90 mimics that of the ADP-bound chaperone. Thus, GA promotes accumulation of the destabilizing Hsp90-containing multi-chaperone complex, leading to client protein degradation (for review, see Ref. 15Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although a requirement for Hsp90 interaction has been demonstrated for several non-receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, including RIP, p60v-src, and p210bcr/abl, and for progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, similar data showing dependence of mature transmembrane kinases on Hsp90 and the effects of GA on such client protein-chaperone complexes are lacking. Thus, although the rapid down-regulation of mature ErbB2 by GA is well established, a direct involvement of Hsp90 in this phenomenon has not been reported. In this study, we have shown that endogenous Hsp90 and ErbB2 do indeed associate in ErbB2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells and in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. As is the case with non-receptor kinases, shortly after GA addition, the nature of the ErbB2-chaperone complex shifts from one that is stabilizing (containing Hsp90, lacking Hsp70) to one that is destabilizing (reduced Hsp90, elevated Hsp70), and this is followed by rapid degradation of the kinase. Our data demonstrate that Hsp90 association is specific for ErbB2 and is not seen with ErbB1. Furthermore, the presence of the ErbB2 kinase domain is minimally required to observe Hsp90 interaction and GA sensitivity. The ErbB2-like GA sensitivity of an ErbB1/2 chimeric protein containing the ECD and transmembrane region of ErbB1 and the ICD of ErbB2 confirms the importance of the ICD in mediating the sensitivity of ErbB2 to GA. Interestingly, EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the ErbB1/2 chimera does not affect ErbB2/Hsp90 association. Thus, Hsp90 binding to the kinase domain of ErbB2 is not intrinsically inhibitory, as it is for v-Src (26Mimnaugh E.G. Worland P.J. Whitesell L. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28654-28659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The stability of kinase domain-deleted ErbB2 (ErbB2/DK) in the presence of GA and our observation that WX514, an Hsp90-binding GA derivative, is able to deplete mature ErbB2 at concentrations far below its affinity for Grp94 both supply conclusive evidence that GA-induced destabilization of ErbB2 is secondary to disruption of Hsp90 association with the ErbB2 kinase domain. Unlike endogenous ErbB1 expressed in A431 cells, on which GA has almost no effect within 6–8 h, ErbB1 expressed in transiently transfected cells is discernibly down-regulated in response to GA, although much less so than ErbB2. The apparently increased GA sensitivity of ErbB1 in COS-7 cells may be related to its higher basal level of autophosphorylation. Whereas in the absence of EGF, ErbB1 in A431 cells is not detectably phosphorylated (data not shown), transiently transfected ErbB1 in COS-7 cells is moderately autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand. EGF-stimulated ErbB1 phosphorylation results in recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, which mediates ubiquitination-dependent degradation of the phosphorylated receptor (7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 27Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). When added to the enhanced instability of newly synthesized ErbB1 in the presence of GA, this phenomenon may contribute to the decrease in the ErbB1 steady-state level observed in transfected, drug-treated cells. Although ErbB2 is not normally efficiently ubiquitinated by c-Cbl, this ubiquitin ligase has been implicated in mediating antibody-induced ErbB2 down-regulation (28Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3384-3388PubMed Google Scholar). However, c-Cbl-mediated down-regulation requires tyrosine phosphorylation of C-terminal ErbB2 residues, whereas GA-mediated down-regulation of ErbB2 requires no motifs C-terminal to the kinase domain. In addition, neither ErbB2 phosphorylation nor kinase activity is required for GA sensitivity. Thus, an ErbB1/2 chimeric protein unstimulated by EGF is sensitive to GA, as are autophosphorylated ErbB2 and a kinase-dead ErbB2 point mutant. Although GA-induced ErbB2 polyubiquitination is observed prior to degradation of the protein, the ubiquitin ligase responsible for mediating the GA effect remains elusive. Recently, a novel GA-inducible ubiquitinating activity was identified in cell lysates, 2I. Alroy and Y. Yarden, unpublished observations. and characterization of this activity is in progress. Our data definitively show that Hsp90 interacts with the kinase domain of ErbB2 and that GA-stimulated destabilization of ErbB2 is preceded by disruption of ErbB2/Hsp90 association, yet it remains unclear why ErbB2 stability, and not that of ErbB1, requires chaperone binding. Hsp90 association with several non-receptor kinases is necessary to maintain their solubility and to permit their correct intracellular trafficking following ligand stimulation (15Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the location of mature ErbB2 is fixed in the plasma membrane, and this kinase has no known ligand. Although ErbB2 is the only ligandless ErbB family member (5Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), it is the preferred partner in ErbB heterodimers (19Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 29Klapper L.N. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G.C. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4995-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). ErbB2 is recruited to an ErbB heterodimer in response to ligand binding to its ErbB partner (5Klapper L.N. Kirschbaum M.H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 25-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We therefore currently favor the hypothesis that mature ErbB2 requires Hsp90 association with its kinase domain to maintain the conformation necessary to heterodimerize with other ligand-activated ErbB proteins. In fact, a motif within the C-terminal region of the ErbB2 kinase domain has been suggested to play a role in dimerization (30Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Studies to investigate the possible involvement of this motif in Hsp90 binding to ErbB2 are in progress. How did ErbB2 acquire its unique dependence on Hsp90? ErbB2 is likely to have arisen from ErbB1 through a gene duplication event since invertebrates contain only an ErbB1-like ligand-activated protein (30Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ErbB2 amino acid sequence reveals that it contains an insert not found in the other ErbB proteins, and this insert occurs near a residue in ErbB1 shown to be in close proximity to bound EGF (31Woltjer R.L. Lukas T.J. Staros J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that this altered sequence in the ErbB2 ECD may prevent it from binding ligand (30Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The appearance of such a protein must have surely been considered a mutational event by the vertebrate organism in which it arose. Rutherford and Lindquist (32Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar) recently proposed that Hsp90 binding to mutated proteins may stabilize them while masking their phenotypic expression, thus allowing accumulation of multiple silent mutations during evolution and providing the organism with a greater diversity of responses when faced with unexpected environmental stress. IfErbB2 evolved by mutation from ErbB1 to become a ligandless heterodimerization partner, it may have simultaneously acquired dependence on Hsp90 for its stability. The growth and survival advantage conferred by ErbB2 would certainly favor its ultimate evolutionary selection."

https://openalex.org/W2039918229,"We present a 271-year record of Sr/Ca variability in a coral from Rarotonga in the South Pacific gyre. Calibration with monthly sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite and ship measurements made in a grid measuring 1 degrees by 1 degrees over the period from 1981 to 1997 indicates that this Sr/Ca record is an excellent proxy for SST. Comparison with SST from ship measurements made since 1950 in a grid measuring 5 degrees by 5 degrees also shows that the Sr/Ca data accurately record decadal changes in SST. The entire Sr/Ca record back to 1726 shows a distinct pattern of decadal variability, with repeated decadal and interdecadal SST regime shifts greater than 0. 75 degrees C. Comparison with decadal climate variability in the North Pacific, as represented by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (1900-1997), indicates that several of the largest decadal-scale SST variations at Rarotonga are coherent with SST regime shifts in the North Pacific. This hemispheric symmetry suggests that tropical forcing may be an important factor in at least some of the decadal variability observed in the Pacific Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1997641930,"Reciprocal gene activation and restriction during cell type differentiation from a common lineage is a hallmark of mammalian organogenesis. A key question, then, is whether a critical transcriptional activator of cell type-specific gene targets can also restrict expression of the same genes in other cell types. Here, we show that whereas the pituitary-specific POU domain factor Pit-1 activates growth hormone gene expression in one cell type, the somatotrope, it restricts its expression from a second cell type, the lactotrope. This distinction depends on a two-base pair spacing in accommodation of the bipartite POU domains on a conserved growth hormone promoter site. The allosteric effect on Pit-1, in combination with other DNA binding factors, results in the recruitment of a corepressor complex, including nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR, which, unexpectedly, is required for active long-term repression of the growth hormone gene in lactotropes."

Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and is located inside the nucleus, bound to chromatin (31Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The concentration of GTP within the cell is ∼30 times higher than the concentration of GDP, thus resulting in the preferential production of the GTP form of Ran by RCC1 within the nucleus (8Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the GTP of Ran is hydrolyzed to GDP through the aid of RanGAP1, which is located within the cytoplasm, thus producing a difference in the concentration of the GTP form of Ran between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The loss of RCC1 resulted in hamster (tsBN2) and yeast pleiotropic phenotypes, such as premature chromosome condensation, lack of chromosome condensation, the suppression of the receptorless mating process, chromosome instability, an abnormal mRNA metabolism, and mRNA export defects (reviewed in Ref. 28Seki T. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutation of GTR1 suppressed the prp20 mutation ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae RCC1, thus suggesting that the function of GTR1 is related to that of the RCC1-Ran (PRP20/MTR1/SRM1-GSP1) system (32Nakashima N. Hayashi N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2311-2318PubMed Google Scholar). Rag A is a human homologue of GTR1 as shown by a high sequence similarity and by the fact that the mutation of Rag A suppressed theprp20/mtr1 mutation of S. cerevisiae (33Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). Among the RCC1-Ran system proteins, Gtr1p/Rag A is another subfamily of Ras-like small G proteins (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). Gtr1p is located within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and has been reported to play a role in cell growth (35Bun Y.M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Yompakdee C. Bun Y.M. Shikata K. Ogawa N. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 171: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Rag A was originally isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 methods during the search for novel G proteins (37Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and also independently by two-hybrid screening using adenovirus E3 14.7 kDa as the bait and thus was shown to be involved in apoptosis (38Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rag A and Gtr1p were shown to belong to the sixth subfamily of the Ras-like small GTPase superfamily (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rag A and Rag B differ by seven conservative amino acid substitutions (98% identity) and by 33 additional residues at the N terminus of Rag B (37Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). There are three alternative splice variants in Rag B, such as Rag Bs, Rag Bl, and Rag Bn (33Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We herein identify two novel Rag A-interacting proteins, Rag C and Rag D. Rag C had GTP-binding motifs in its N-terminal region and was also shown to bind significantly to [3H]GTP and [3H]GDP in vitro. Both Rag A and Rag C had a mutual binding region in their C-terminal regions downstream of the GTP-binding region. These structural features led us to propose that Rag C and Rag D belong to the Rag A subfamily of the Ras-like small G protein superfamily. Rag A and Rag B bound to both Rag C and Rag D. Rag A was also colocalized with Rag C and Rag D in BHK21 cells, thus suggesting that Rag A may form a heterodimer with Rag C or with Rag D. BHK21 cells and HeLa cells were grown at 37.5 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2, 90% air. Cells were washed with TD buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 136.8 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.7 mmNa2HPO4). BHK21 cells (2 × 105 cells) were transfected with DNA-lipid complex of 1 μg each of various vectors and 7 (for 35-mm dish immunofluorescence) or 15 μl (for 60-mm dish immunoprecipitation) of LipofectAMINETM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h in the absence of serum and antibiotics, as recommended by the supplier, and incubated at 37.5 °C for 48 h as described (39Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were grown in the following media: YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), SD-Leu, Trp, His (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with all essential amino acids except for leucine, tryptophan, and histidine), and GE-Leu, Trp (3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, supplemented with all essential amino acids except for leucine and tryptophan). Amino acids were added at a final concentration of 20–50 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. Large scale yeast transformation and two-hybrid screening were carried out using the Y190 S. cerevisiae strain essentially as described (15Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pAS404 human Rag AcDNA bait construct was transformed into Y190 cells (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3, −112+URA3::GAL-lacZ, LYS2::GAL(UAS)-HIS3 cyk r) by the conventional lithium acetate-polyethylene glycol method (32Nakashima N. Hayashi N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2311-2318PubMed Google Scholar), and cells were grown on tryptophan minus SD medium (SD-Trp) for 2 days. A single positive transformant colony was grown in 10 ml of liquid SD-Trp medium overnight. The culture was diluted into 100 ml of SD-Trp medium for another 24 h and was then diluted to an A 600 of 0.4 in YPD medium. Large scale transformation was performed using human Burkitt's lymphoma cDNA library constructed in pACT2 vector (40Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) (gift from S. J. Elledge), and cells were grown on a 3-aminotriazole (50 μg/ml) plus SD-Trp, Leu, and His plate. Plasmid DNA from 100 arising colonies was isolated as described (15Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Their nucleotide sequences were determined by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI373S sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The S. cerevisiae strains shown in Fig. 8 compose a parental wild-type NBW5 (MATα ade ura3-1,2 his3-532 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 can1), HS203ΔGTR1(gtr1-1Δ MATα ade ura3-1,2 his3-532 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 can1) (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar), and HS203ΔGTR1,2(gtr1-1Δ gtr2-1Δ MATα ade ura3-1,2 his3-532 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 can1) (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). MYC-GTR2 was transformed into NBW5, NBW5ΔGTR1, and NBW5ΔGTR1/ΔGTR2 by the lithium acetate-polyethylene glycol method, and cells were grown on an SD-Ura plate. For quantitative β-galactosidase assay, yeast cells harboring a two-hybrid vector encoding GAL4BD and GAL4AD fusion proteins were grown in 2 ml of SD-Leu, Trp medium overnight. Then 0.4 ml of the yeast culture was mixed with 15 ml of GE-Leu, Trp medium in a small flask. The yeast culture was grown until the A 600 was 0.8–1.0 at 30 °C. Then 15 ml of culture were centrifuged, washed once with water, and resuspended into 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was mixed with 0.4 mg of glass beads (Sigma) and vortex-mixed for 30 s, 6 times. The cell suspension was mixed with 0.2 ml of the lysis buffer. Cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. 0.1 ml of the cell lysate was incubated with 0.9 ml of Z-buffer (100 mmNa2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) and 0.2 ml ofο-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) at 28 °C as described previously (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). When the reaction solutions turned yellow, the reaction was stopped with 0.8 ml of 1m Na2CO3. One unit of β-galactosidase activity was calculated as 1 nmol ofο-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside cleaved per min/mg of protein at 28 °C. Yeast colonies grown on the plates with synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine were also analyzed by β-galactosidase filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal) as described elsewhere (41Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

E. coli BL21 harboring a GST plasmid was grown in 750 ml of LB medium, treated with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration, 0.2 mm) for 4 h at 30 °C as described (20Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were dispersed in lysis solution at a ratio of 1:5 (cell volume:lysis solution (1× PBS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin)) and sonicated for 5 min three times on ice (SonicatorTM, Heat system-Ultrasonics Inc., microtip, 40% cycle, output control 4). After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, 10 ml of the supernatant (50 mg/ml protein concentration) were mixed with 1 ml of 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer. GST protein beads that were washed with nucleotide-binding buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm CHAPS) or buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X) were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]GDP or [3H]GTP for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 50 μl of binding buffer for the binding assay in Fig. 2, a—c, as described (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of the ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2). Nucleotides bound to GST protein beads were washed with 1 ml of stop buffer four times and then transferred into Clear-sol (Nakarai Chemicals, Kyoto, Japan). Radioactivity was counted by a scintillation counter. For Fig. 2, d–f, GST fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads with 2 ml of buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8, 10 mm reduced glutathione) three times (total, 6 ml), concentrated with Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device-Biomax 10K (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA), and suspended in PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml GST proteins. GST-Rag C and GST were incubated with various concentrations of [35S]GTPγS, [3H]GDP, or [3H]GTP for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of binding buffer for the binding assay. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of the ice-cold stop buffer. Nucleotides bound to the protein were trapped by filtering the reaction mixture through nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed three times with 25 ml of the same ice-cold stop buffer. Radioactivity was counted by a scintillation counter. Ten percent of GST-Rag C (0.3 nm) bound to [35S]GTPγS (0.03 nm) maximally. Nucleotide off-rates (dissociation) were found to follow the first-order kinetics. 4 nm[35S]GTPγS or 0.68 mm [3H]GDP were incubated with 250 nm Rag C for on-rate experiments. The on-rate (association) and off-rate (dissociation) experiments were done according to procedures described previously (43John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Hall A. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19718-19722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GTPase activity was assayed essentially based on a procedure described previously (37Schurmann A. Brauers A. Massmann S. Becker W. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28982-28988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Rag C (2 μm) or GST (2 μm) was mixed with [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 0.6 nm) in a 50-μl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 2 or 4 h. Reaction buffer (5 μl) was mixed with 2 m formic acid (5 μl) and separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose in buffer (1 m lithium chloride, 1 m formic acid). Fusion proteins with GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) were constructed in pAS1 or pAS404 (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar), and those with the GAL4 activation-binding domain (GAL4AD) were constructed in pACT2. The NcoI/BamHI fragment of human Rag AcDNA from T7-RagA-pcDEBΔ (33Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into theNcoI/BamHI sites of the pAS404 vector (34Nakashima N. Noguchi E. Nishimoto T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 853-867PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion cDNA fragments of Rag A, Rag C, and Rag D in Fig. 5 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified (PCR) by KOD polymerase (Toyobo Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) as recommended by the supplier using various synthetic oligonucleotide primers and were subcloned into pAS1 or pACT2 vectors. Each construct was checked by sequencing. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Hokkaido System Science Ltd. (Sapporo, Japan). Rag C cDNA, which was amplified by PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides introducing aBamHI cleavage site at the ATG and a BglII at the stop codon at the C terminus, was inserted into the BamHI site of pGEX-KG. NcoI/SalI fragments of the C-terminal regions of Rag A and Rag C were inserted into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pET28a.BamHI/BglII fragments of Rag C and Rag A were inserted into the BglII site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). pCDNA-HA Rag C and Rag D were constructed by inserting XhoI-BglII fragments of TKS-HA1Rag C and Rag D into pCDNA3.1/Hygro(−) (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). T7-Rag A-pcDEBΔ, T7-Rag A gtr1-11-pcDEBΔ, T7-Rag A Q66L-pcDEBΔ, and T7-Rag B-pcDEBΔ were described previously (33Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). A gtr1-11 mutation, a mutation of residue 21 from serine to leucine (hereafter referred to as T21L) in Rag A, corresponds to a dominant negative form of Ran, T24N (GDP form) (45Kornbluth S. Dasso M. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Q66L (residue 66 from glutamine to leucine) mutant of Rag A corresponds to the dominant positive form of Ran Q69L (GTP form) (24Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). MYC-GTR2, pL275 (pRS404 containing Myc-GTR2), was constructed by inserting Myc tag DNA into GTR2 at the N-terminal region, which was subcloned into theSalI/SacI site of pRS404. 1 × 106 cells that were transfected with various vectors were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μl of anti-HA antibodies or anti-T7 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C and then were incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (50% v/v) for an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, washed five times with 1 ml of the lysis buffer at 4 °C, and were then suspended in 50 μl of the sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% (w/v) SDS, and 20% glycerol before being boiled. Protein samples were electrophoresed in a 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described (46Sekiguchi T. Nohiro Y. Nakamura Y. Hisamoto N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3317-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the supplier. Rabbit anti-HA antibody (catalogue number 561) was purchased from the MBL Institute (Nagano, Japan). Mouse anti-T7 antibody (catalogue number 69522) was purchased from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-Myc antibody (A-14) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For the in vitro binding assay, the C-terminal portions of Rag A and Rag C were synthesizedin vitro. The Rag A and Rag CcDNAs in the pET28a vector (1 μg) were incubated with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 40 μl of a quick master mix of TNTR T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for 90 min at 30 °C as recommended by the supplier. The resultant extract was diluted to 500 μl with the immunoprecipitation buffer. Either GST (20 μg), GST-Rag A (20 μg), or GST-Rag C (20 μg), which were bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, was mixed with the35S-labeled proteins. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the beads were spun down, washed 4 times, and suspended in 50 μl of the sample buffer. Bound proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using the Fuji BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan). 2 × 105 cells, which were seeded on coverslips in 35-mm dish, were transfected with 1 μg of DNAs using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE ReagentTM as described above. The transfected cells on coverslips were fixed with 1 ml of cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min at −20 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of PBS buffer (Sigma). Fixed cells were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, and 10% normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature and then were processed to immunostaining by primary antibody and then by either FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies as described previously (39Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratory Inc., Burlingame, CA). Digital imaging of stained cells was obtained using the Olympus laser-scanning microscope LSM-GB200 system as described (33Hirose E. Nakashima N. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains were processed and fixed with the method described by Hagan and Hyams (47Hagan I.M. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1988; : 343-357PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular DNA was stained with 4′,6′-daimidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Human Rag A is a new member of the Ras-like small G protein superfamily and is involved in cell growth and the RCC1-Ran system. To elucidate the function of Rag A further, it may be helpful to identify interacting proteins that have identifiable enzymatic functions and/or specific subcellular localizations. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening using human Rag A as the bait from human Burkitt's lymphoma cDNA library. We picked up and analyzed 100 samples of human cDNA that were histidine- and 3-aminotriazole-positive and found two positive genes, Rag Cand Rag D, the number of cDNA clones being 54 and 22, respectively. β-Galactosidase filter assay showed that clones expressing Rag A fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and those expressing Rag C or Rag D fused with the GAL4-transactivation domain had significant β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4 a, clones 1 and 4). As controls, colonies expressing Rag A fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and vector pACT2 fused with the GAL4-transactivation domain were examined, but these did not show any β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4 a, clone 7). Sequence analysis showed Rag C and Rag D to be similar proteins with a homology of 81.1% regarding the level of amino acids (Fig.1 a). Whereas N- and C-terminal sequences were not conserved, the middle part of both proteins was highly conserved (more than 90% identity from 61 to 369 amino acid residues of Rag C"
https://openalex.org/W1977199897,"Recent biochemical studies indicate that the serotonin transporter can form oligomers. We investigated whether the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) can be visualized as an oligomer in the plasma membrane of intact cells. For this purpose, we generated fusion proteins of hSERT and spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein (cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, CFP and YFP, respectively). When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the resulting fusion proteins (CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT) were efficiently inserted into the plasma membrane and were functionally indistinguishable from wild-type hSERT. Oligomers were visualized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy in living cells using two complementary methods, i.e. ratio imaging and donor photobleaching. Interestingly, oligomerization was not confined to hSERT; fluorescence resonance energy transfer was also observed between CFP- and YFP-labeled rat γ-aminobutyric acid transporter. The bulk of serotonin transporters was recovered as high molecular weight complexes upon gel filtration in detergent solution. In contrast, the monomers of CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT were essentially undetectable. This indicates that the homo-oligomeric form is the favored state of hSERT in living cells, which is not significantly affected by coincubation with transporter substrates or blockers. Based on our observations, we conclude that constitutive oligomer formation might be a general property of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.

In contrast, the monomers of CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT were essentially undetectable. This indicates that the homo-oligomeric form is the favored state of hSERT in living cells, which is not significantly affected by coincubation with transporter substrates or blockers. Based on our observations, we conclude that constitutive oligomer formation might be a general property of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. human serotonin transporter green fluorescent protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein γ-aminobutyric acid rat GABA transporter 1 5-hydroxytryptamine (= serotonin) human dopamine D2-receptor human embryonic kidney cells 293 fast protein liquid chromatography It is widely accepted that tyrosine kinases and related receptors signal as dimers (1Heldin C.H.

In addition, over recent years it has been determined that other integral membrane proteins, which were originally thought to exist in monomeric form, actually form homo- and hetero-oligomers. For instance, this is true for several G protein-coupled receptors (2Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 3Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

The structural organization of transporters is likely to determine their function. This consideration is particularly relevant in understanding the transporters that mediate the re-uptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft (8Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). These proteins depend on the presence of Na+ and Cl−and generate a current during transport, i.e. they may share properties similar to ion channels (9Bruns D. Engert F. Lux H.D.

The human serotonin transporter (hSERT)1 is a prototypic member of this family; its properties are of considerable clinical interest because the inhibitors are useful as antidepressants, and substrates that induce the reversal of transport (e.g.“ecstasy”) are abused (13Schloss P. Williams D.C. J. Psychopharmacol. 1998; 12: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The complexity of the transport reaction is suggestive of a higher level of organization, and recent biochemical experiments on the SERT of different species indicate that the transporter can, in principle, form oligomeric structures (14Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1993; 14: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P.

However, it is at present unknown whether SERT exists as an oligomer in the membrane in situ and whether this is the preferred conformation. To address these issues, we applied a nondestructive method to visualize hSERT in living cells. This has become possible by the recent development of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants that are suited to monitor close associations of fusion proteins by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a quantum physical phenomenon that was first described by Förster (18Förster T. Ann. d. Physik (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4985) Google Scholar). The human SERT was tagged on its amino terminus with cyan fluorescent proteins (CFP) and yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP), respectively; these spectral variants of GFP have an appropriate spectral overlap of the donor (CFP) emission and the acceptor (YFP) excitation (19Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Our observations show that hSERT exists as an oligomer in the membrane of living cells and that this is the preferred conformation. Moreover, this finding was not confined to the hSERT alone. A similar homoassociation exists with the rat GABA transporter 1 (rGAT1). Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]5-Hydroxytryptamine (HT) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The following drugs were kindly donated: citalopram (Lundbeck A/S, Kobenhavn, Denmark), paroxetine (SmithKline Beecham, Worthing, United Kingdom), and cocaine (Dolda AG, Basel, Switzerland). Imipramine, para-chloroamphetamine, and serotonin were from Sigma. Methylenedioximethamphetamine (“ecstasy”) was from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). All other chemicals were from commercial sources. hSERT cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. R. D. Blakely (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). AHin dIII/Xba I fragment (encompassing the coding region) was inserted into the plasmid pRC/CMV (Invitrogen), ligated into Hin dIII/Xba I-digested pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to produce hSERT-pEGFP-C1, and transferred from this vector using Xho I to the plasmids pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to produce the plasmids hSERT-pECFP-C1 and hSERT-pEYFP-C1, respectively. GFP, CFP, or YFP is fused to the NH2 terminus of hSERT and resides in the cytoplasm. A Hin dIII/Stu I fragment of the human dopamine D2-receptor (hD2R), encompassing the coding region and lacking eight COOH-terminal amino acids, was ligated intoHin dIII/Sma I-digested pYFP-N1 to produce the plasmid hD2R-YFP; YFP is fused to the COOH terminus of hD2R and situated in the cytoplasm of the cell. As a positive control for FRET imaging, we constructed a fusion protein of CFP and YFP. The yellow variant, GFP10C, was a generous gift of Dr. Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego, CA) and was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 COOH-terminal to the enhanced GFP, which was subsequently replaced by CFP (derived from pECFP-C1), thus resulting in a plasmid coding for a CFP-YFP tandem. The cDNA encoding the rGAT1 was a generous gift of Dr. Patrick Schloss (ZI für Seelische Gesundheit, Mannheim, Germany). The coding region was excised using Bbr PI andKpn I; blunt ends were generated at the Sal I restriction site of the vector pEYFP-C1 (CLONTECH), which was digested afterward with Kpn I. The rGAT1-cDNA was then inserted to result in the construct YFP-rGAT1. Subsequently, the rGAT1-cDNA was subcloned into the vector pECFP-C1 (CLONTECH) using the enzymes Sac I andKpn I to generate the construct CFP-rGAT1. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) and HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts and l-alanyl-l-glutamine (l-GlutaMAX ITM, Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 mg/liter gentamicin on 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. One day before transfection, cells were replated to obtain subconfluent cultures either on glass coverslips (22 mm in diameter and placed into 6-well plates) or on 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well plate) for uptake experiments. Transient transfections were performed with equal amounts of CFP and YFP plasmids using the CaPO4 precipitation method or LipofectAMINE PlusTM as described (20Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmüller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were performed as described earlier (21Sitte H.H. Scholze P. Schloss P. Pifl C. Singer E.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with either hSERT-wild type, CFP-hSERT, YFP-hSERT, or pECFP-C1, pEYFP-C1 vectors were incubated for 5 min at 22 °C in 0.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, final pH 7.3) containing 2 μCi of [3H]5-HT (specific activity adjusted with unlabeled 5-HT). The amount of accumulated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Transfected HEK-293 or HeLa cells were investigated 1 day after transfection on a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope using filter sets, which discriminate between CFP and YFP fluorescence (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) (CFP filter set: excitation, 440 nm; dichroic mirror, 455 nm; emission 480 nm; YFP filter set: excitation, 500 nm; dichroic mirror, 525 nm; emission, 535 nm), and a cooled CCD-camera (Kappa GmbH, Gleichen, Germany). For ratio imaging FRET microscopy, images were taken with the donor filter set (for CFP) and a FRET filter set (XF88, Omega Optical) with excitation of the donor (440 nm), a 455 nm dichroic mirror, and an emission filter for the acceptor (535 nm). Images were captured with both filter sets under identical conditions. This choice of settings was based on initial experiments with cells expressing CFP and YFP. These experiments were employed to verify that the imaging parameters did not result in spurious ratio images. Ratio images that are suited to detect a decrease in donor and an increase in acceptor fluorescence were calculated by dividing the acceptor filter image by the donor image (20Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmüller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Periasamy A. Day R.N. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 293-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the NIH image software version 1.62. In principle, black (zero) ratio images are obtained even if an equal intensity of fluorescence is recorded with the donor and FRET filters. Nevertheless, to prevent the detection of false positive FRET images, the imaging conditions were adjusted to favor donor emission over acceptor emission. These settings introduce a bias against acceptor emission and, furthermore, underestimate FRET. We chose to sacrifice the sensitivity for detection of FRET for the sake of increasing the specificity of the signal. Quantification of fluorescence ratios was achieved by imaging the transfected cells at lower magnification (× 10 objective) with donor and acceptor filter sets and by subsequently determining the integrated density values (ID = number of pixels × (mean intensity background)) for the calculation of the YFP:CFP fluorescence ratio at donor excitation. Photobleaching FRET microscopy was done by continuous illumination with a 100-watt-mercury lamp and the CFP filter set with time series imaging for 1 min (with the acquisition of one image every 2 s), which was sufficient to bleach the donor to an extent of less than 20%. Regions of interest were selected over the membrane, and fluorescence emission intensities were quantified using the NIH image software. The resulting decay curves were fitted to the equation for a single exponential decay approaching a constant value: fluorescence intensity =A 0*e −Kt+ offset, where A 0 denotes the starting value, offset denotes the final fluorescence signal, and K is the decay constant. The time constant τ (fluorescence lifetime) is defined as 1/K. Extracts were prepared from cells expressing CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT or CFP-hSERT and YFP by solubilizing the particulate fraction in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 20 μg/ml of phosphoramidon, 40 μg/ml Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA from 1000× stock solutions). The insoluble material containing cell nuclei was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was measured on a Jasco FP-920 spectrofluorometer. Emission wavelength scans were performed with excitation at 436 nm (for CFP and FRET measurements) or at 500 nm (for YFP). The bandwidth of excitation was 18 nm, and that of the emission was set to 10 nm. Emission scans with an excitation at 500 nm were performed to determine the amount of YFP without the influence of FRET. The minor contribution of YFP fluorescence to the emission curve at the CFP excitation wavelength (436 nm), which results from coexcitation of YFP at that wavelength (instead of sensitized fluorescence due to FRET), was subtracted from the emission scans, and the curves were normalized to equal CFP peak fluorescence at 476 nm. By that means, FRET can be detected by a shift of the emission scan at the acceptor wavelength showing the increase in acceptor fluorescence. Extracts were prepared from CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT expressing cells as described above and subjected to gel filtration on a Pharmacia FPLC system using a Superdex 200 matrix equilibrated with extraction buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column (diameter = 16 mm, length = 2 m, volume = 402 ml) was calibrated with appropriate standards (Bio-Rad catalog no. 151-1901; 670, 158, 44, 17, and 1.35 kDa). Fluorescent proteins were detected during FPLC elution with a Jasco FP-920 spectrofluorometer in the kinetics mode using a 16-μl flow cell, excitation at 436 nm, and emission at 510 nm with an 18-nm bandwidth, respectively. Recording of the fluorescence signal was started briefly before the flow through of the void volume with read outs every 30 s for a total of 2 h. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. values. The significance of differences among the means of various groups was determined by Student's t test for independent samples. The major aim of this study was to investigate the serotonin transporter in living cells by using GFP chimeras of this pharmacologically important transporter molecule. For that purpose, it is essential to verify the functional integrity of the fusion protein. This was achieved on several levels. Initially, we confirmed that the chimeric proteins comprising hSERT and different variants of GFP were inserted into the plasma membrane. Upon expression of CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT in HEK-293 cells (or in HeLa cells, data not shown), the bulk of the fluorescence was recorded over the plasma membrane (Fig.1 and see Fig. 3 G). The imaging of CFP-hSERT expressing cells with the YFP filter set showed no fluorescence signal. The same was found with YFP-hSERT expressing cells and image acquisition with the CFP filter set, proving the specificity of the filters and the imaging conditions (Fig. 1). Uptake measurements showed that the fusion proteins of hSERT with GFP variants transported the natural substrate 5-HT with V max andK m values similar to those of wild-type hSERT (Fig.2 A;V max = 17 ± 1 versus 22 ± 2 pmol/min/well and K m = 0.99 ± 0.23versus 0.94 ± 0.37 μm for cells transfected with YFP-hSERT/CFP-hSERT and hSERT, respectively;n = 3). Cells transfected with CFP and YFP alone showed no specific uptake of 5-HT (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, the inhibition of 5-HT influx by imipramine exhibited no significant difference in both cases (IC50 = 16 ± 2 and 19 ± 3 nm, n = 3 for cells expressing YFP-hSERT/CFP-hSERT and hSERT, respectively, Fig. 2 B). Thus, CFP- and YFP-tagged fusion proteins of hSERT are functional with characteristics that are very similar to the wild-type protein.Figure 3Ratio-imaging FRET microscopy. HEK-293 cells were transfected with equal amounts of plasmids encoding CFP and YFP (top row, A–C), the CFP-YFP tandem (second row, D–F), equal amounts of vectors coding for CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT (third row, G–I), or CFP-rGAT and YFP-rGAT (bottom row, K–M). The next day, images (× 40 magnification) were taken using the donor filter set (CFP-filter) (left column, A, D, G, K) and the FRET filter set (middle column, B, E, H, L) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio image (right column, C, F, I, M) represents the division of the FRET filter images by the donor filter images. The images are representative of 10 different transfections with the aquisition of 12 images with each different filter set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Functional properties of YFP-hSERT and CFP-hSERT constructs.

The negative control consisted of cells that expressed CFP and YFP. In these cells, the donor image (Fig.3 A) showed a higher fluorescence signal than the FRET image (Fig. 3 B) by using the imaging conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This observation results in a black ratio image (Fig.3 C). As a positive control, we used cells expressing the YFP-CFP tandem. Given the known Förster distance (∼50 Å for CFP and YFP), the short tether in the CFP-YFP tandem, and its soluble nature, a strong intramolecular FRET was to be expected in the cytosol. The fluorescence intensity recorded with the FRET filter set (Fig.3 E) exceeded the intensity measured with the donor filter set (Fig. 3 D), resulting in an intense cytosolic FRET signal in the ratio image (Fig. 3 F). If hSERT oligomerized in the plasma membrane, the intermolecular FRET ought to be seen in cells coexpressing YFP-hSERT and CFP-hSERT. These experiments were performed by the transient transfection of two different cell lines (HEK-293 and HeLa cells) with clear-cut evidence for FRET in each case. At the wavelength for donor excitation, fluorescence emission recorded with the CFP filter set (Fig.3 G) was obviously lower than the signal obtained with the FRET filter (Fig. 3 H). This loss in donor emission is indicative of FRET. Accordingly, the ratio image revealed a signal confined to the cellular membrane (Fig. 3 I). Cells expressing CFP-hSERT or YFP-hSERT alone did not exhibit any positive ratio image, thereby further supporting the specificity of this FRET imaging technique (Fig. 1). The clear positive ratio image of CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT coexpressing cells can only be accounted for by intermolecular FRET due to oligomerization of the fluorescent-tagged hSERT proteins. This oligomerization was detected not only in cells expressing CFP- and YFP-hSERT but also in cells expressing the CFP- and YFP-tagged rGAT1, which is a member of the same subfamily of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter proteins (sharing about 50% sequence homology) (Fig. 3,bottom line, K–M). We also quantified FRET at a lower magnification in several independent experiments to obtain an average for a high number of transfected cells. The corresponding fluorescence ratio was significantly higher for images taken from cells expressing the YFP-CFP tandem (1.94 ± 0.37, n = 7) and from cells coexpressing YFP-hSERT and CFP-hSERT (1.56 ± 0.13, n = 22) or YFP-rGAT1 and CFP-rGAT1 (1.61 ± 0.18, n = 9) than the ratio obtained for the negative control cells (i.e. coexpressing CFP and YFP, 0.54 ± 0.09, n = 13). The interaction between CFP- and YFP-tagged hSERT was further verifiedin vitro by means of emission scanning fluorometry. If CFP and YFP were in close proximity due to oligomerization of tagged hSERT molecules, this would result in FRET between CFP and YFP. Hence, an increase of the YFP fluorescence (sensitized acceptor fluorescence) ought to be observed at the excitation wavelength of CFP (i.e. the FRET donor), and this effect ought to be clearly detectable in emission wavelength scans. To test for sensitized acceptor fluorescence, we prepared extracts from cells expressing either CFP- and YFP-hSERT or CFP-hSERT with untagged YFP as control and recorded emission wavelength scans at the donor and acceptor excitation, respectively. Normalized emission scans of these extracts revealed a distinct sensitized acceptor fluorescence for the CFP-hSERT/YFP-hSERT sample as compared with control extracts (Fig.4), which is clearly indicative of FRET, and this can arise only due to oligomerization of CFP- and YFP-hSERT. The detection of intermolecular FRET unequivocally demonstrated the propensity of hSERT to form an oligomer in the cellular membrane of intact cells; however, it was not possible to estimate the relative proportion of transporters in the oligomeric or monomeric form by FRET. To verify that oligomers represented a sizable fraction of the total, CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT were solubilized from the plasma membranes in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to gel filtration. The bulk of the transporter protein eluted in the high molecular mass range with a peak at about 600–800 kDa (Fig.5); two shoulders were also evident (at about 550 kDa and 320 kDa, respectively), which may represent distinct multimers (e.g. dimers and tetramers). A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the fluorescent peak using wavelength scans was not feasible because of the high dilution of tagged hSERT in the peak, which required detector settings that are not appropriate to determine FRET unequivocally. However, it seems unlikely that these high molecular mass complexes comprising CFP- or YFP-tagged hSERT are monomeric forms of the transporter molecule surrounded by detergent micelles because the size of Nonidet P-40 micelles is expected to be only 60–90 kDa based on the average number of detergent molecules in micelles () and the molecular mass of 603 for the Nonidet P-40 monomer. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that hSERT may associate with additional membrane proteins, and these may contribute to the formation of large molecular weight complexes. In fact, it is very likely that hSERT forms a complex with synaptic proteins because it is specifically targeted to synaptic specializations in neurons (and in differentiated PC12 cells). 2H. Just, M. Freissmuth, and H. H. Sitte, unpublished observation. Furthermore, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that nonfunctional hSERT aggregates are incorporated in the high molecular weight peak. However, we note that we did not detect a significant portion of hSERT monomers by employing native gel electrophoresis. In contrast, in the denatured form hSERT migrated with the relative molecular mass predicted for the monomer (data not shown). Thus, taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that hSERT is a constitutive oligomer. It is worth pointing out that the existence of higher order complexes has also been postulated based on molecular sieve chromatography, cross-linking, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (14Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1993; 14: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our observations confirm and extend these findings by directly visualizing hSERT oligomers in the membranes of living cells. To rule out the possibility that the FRET signal we detected between CFP- and YFP-tagged hSERT resulted from transient collision events within the membrane (and presumably nonspecific interaction), we aimed to investigate CFP-hSERT in combination with other transmembrane proteins fused to YFP. However, a different method has to be used for the detection of FRET in this case because the distinct nature of different transmembrane proteins might result in differences in expression levels or subcellular distribution. The prerequisite for the calculation of FRET ratio images is that both fluorophores exhibit the same intracellular distribution and that they are present in equal amounts. These requirements are met by employing essentially identical plasmids encoding homotypic proteins, such as CFP and YFP or CFP-hSERT and YFP-hSERT, which differ only by nine amino acids within the core region of the fluorophore but are otherwise identical. They may not be fulfilled if the proteins that are coexpressed differ substantially in amino acid composition. Thus, we employed the method of donor photobleaching FRET microscopy (2Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), which relies on the fact that the bleaching of a donor fluorophore is slower in the presence of a FRET acceptor because energy is transferred to the acceptor (and thus unavailable for bleaching the donor). The time constant of the fluorescence decay is independent of fluorophore concentration (as long as the acceptor is in excess) and is not affected by the differences in intracellular distribution (2Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). If high levels of illumination were applied through the donor filter set, donor fluorescence emission rapidly declined (Fig.6 A), and this process was monoexponential (Fig. 6 B). As expected, the time constant of fluorescence decay was significantly lower in cells coexpressing CFP and YFP than in cells expressing the CFP-YFP tandem, the time constant τ being 22.0 ± 1.9 s (n = 10) and 31.7 ± 2.1 s (n = 14), respectively (p = 0.015, see Fig. 6 C). Similarly, the fluorescence decay of CFP-hSERT alone significantly was faster than CFP-hSERT in the presence of YFP-tagged hSERT (24.4 ± 0.5 s,n = 7, and 29.9 ± 0.6 s, n = 31, respectively; p = 0.02). The fact that YFP-hSERT slowed the decay in the fluorescence of CFP-hSERT was indicative of intermolecular FRET and thus represented an independent confirmation of the ratio imaging results. As a prototypical structurally unrelated transmembrane protein, we chose the human dopamine D2receptor fused to YFP (hD2R-YFP). In cells expressing CFP-hSERT and hD2R-YFP (in excess), a time constant τ of 24.3 ± 1.0 s (n = 6) was calculated,i.e. similar to τ of CFP-hSERT alone. This means that there is no significant interaction between hSERT and hD2R in the cellular membrane. Hence, statistical transient collision events between structurally unrelated transmembrane proteins cannot account for the FRET signal observed between CFP- and YFP-hSERT. However, it was reported that the hD2R is able to hetero-oligomerize with another membrane protein, the human somatostatin receptor (23Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), as detected by FRET microscopy as well. An intriguing question was whether different agonistic or antagonistic drugs acting at hSERT would interfere with the oligomeric organization of the transporter as detected by intermolecular FRET. To answer this question, we applied donor-bleaching FRET microscopy of CFP- and YFP-hSERT expressing cells before and 3, 6, and 9 min after the addition of drugs (at a concentration of about 10× IC50). As antagonistic substances, we used citalopram, cocaine, imipramine, and paroxetine as transporter substrates 5-HT, methylenedioximethamphetamine (“ecstasy”), andpara-chloroamphetamine were applied. We could not detect any significant alteration of the τ values and thus no change of the intermolecular FRET, indicating that these compounds do not considerably modify the homo-oligomerization of CFP- and YFP-hSERT (data not shown). In conclusion, we unambiguously found that the human serotonin transporter forms homo-oligomers within the cellular membrane of living cells. Moreover, a similar homo-oligomerization was found for the structurally related rat GABA transporter 1. It is therefore attractive to speculate that homo-oligomer formation is a property that is common to all members of the subfamily of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.

https://openalex.org/W1993447679,"Efflux of excess cellular cholesterol mediated by lipid-poor apolipoproteins occurs by an active mechanism distinct from passive diffusion and is controlled by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1. Here we examined whether ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux involves the selective removal of lipids associated with membrane rafts, plasma membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin. ABCA1 was not associated with cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich membrane raft domains based on detergent solubility and lack of colocalization with marker proteins associated with raft domains. Lipid efflux to apoA-I was accounted for by decreases in cellular lipids not associated with cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membranes. Treating cells with filipin, to disrupt raft structure, or with sphingomyelinase, to digest plasma membrane sphingomyelin, did not impair apoA-I-mediated cholesterol or phosphatidylcholine efflux. In contrast, efflux of cholesterol to high density lipoproteins (HDL) or plasma was partially accounted for by depletion of cholesterol from membrane rafts. Additionally, HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux was partially inhibited by filipin and sphingomyelinase treatment. Apo-A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux was absent from fibroblasts with nonfunctional ABCA1 (Tangier disease cells), despite near normal amounts of cholesterol associated with raft domains and normal abilities of plasma and HDL to deplete cholesterol from these domains. Thus, the involvement of membrane rafts in cholesterol efflux applies to lipidated HDL particles but not to lipid-free apoA-I. We conclude that cholesterol and sphingomyelin-rich membrane rafts do not provide lipid for efflux promoted by apolipoproteins through the ABCA1-mediated lipid secretory pathway and that ABCA1 is not associated with these domains.

Although the mechanisms involved in cholesterol efflux are becoming better understood, there are limited data describing the cellular pools of lipids removed from cells by extracellular acceptors. When cultured cells are incubated with whole plasma, cholesterol released from cells during early times (less than 30 min) preferentially associate with a minor subfraction of lipoproteins called pre-β1 HDL (22Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 23Kawano M. Miida T. Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E.

These particles, composed mostly of apoA-I, may promote cholesterol efflux by a mechanism similar to that mediated by lipid-free apolipoproteins. Cell membrane caveolae domains may play a role in providing cholesterol to plasma acceptors during the initial efflux period (24Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 25Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14932-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Caveolin mRNA levels were increased in response to free-cholesterol enrichment of fibroblasts, and this was proportional to increased free cholesterol efflux promoted by HDL present in whole plasma (26Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that caveolae participate in delivery of intracellular lipids to the plasma membrane for removal by ABCA1-dependent efflux mechanisms. Caveolae are plasma membrane structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and contain a variety of distinct proteins (reviewed in Refs. 28Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 29Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 30Kurchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Caveolae are one component of cellular membranes broadly termed membrane rafts, discreet microdomains present on the cell surface. Raft domains exist in cells that do not express caveolin, and use of detergent-free systems have allowed the separation of caveolae from other raft microdomains (31Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 32Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Simons and Ikonen (33Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar) proposed the “raft hypothesis,” in which sphingolipid-cholesterol microdomains are involved in numerous cellular functions, including membrane trafficking and signaling. According to this hypothesis, the lateral assembly of sphingolipids and cholesterol creates rafts floating in a glycerophospholipid-rich environment. These domains were first identified as membrane complexes insoluble in Triton X-100 (TX-100) at 4 °C (34Yu J. Fischman D.A. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 35Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and detergent insolubility has been used as a tool to identify lipid rafts and associated proteins (36Rietvold A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These TX-100-insoluble cellular membranes are enriched in glycosphingolipid and sphingomyelin and contain a significant fraction of the membrane cholesterol. In contrast, most of the cell glycerophospholipids are soluble in TX-100 (37Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar, 38Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The integrity of rafts depends on the presence of both cholesterol and sphingomyelin (39Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 40Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the current study, we examined whether ABCA1 was present in membrane rafts and if plasma membrane raft domains were involved in or required for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. All cell culture incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Human skin fibroblasts from patients having TD and from normal subjects were grown and maintained as described previously (7Mendez A.J. J. Biol.

Uint L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2510-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cells were cholesterol-enriched by incubation with DMEM containing 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 30 μg/ml of cholesterol for 24 h, followed by 48 h in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA (DMEM/BSA) to allow equilibration of cholesterol pools. For immortalized fibroblast lines NL1 and TD1 (18Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin.

Blood was collected into vacutainer tubes containing streptokinase (160 units/ml final concentration) and chilled on ice, and plasma was separated by centrifugation (2000 × g for 20 min). Plasma was used for experiments within 60 min of isolation. LDL and HDL were prepared from pooled EDTA plasma by ultracentrifugation in the density intervals 1.019–1.063 and 1.12–1.21 g/ml, respectively. HDL was depleted of apoE- and apoB-containing particles by heparin-agarose chromatography (7Mendez A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5891-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). LDL was acetylated by the method of Goldstein et al. (42Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). ApoA-I was purified from HDL as described previously (43Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Efflux of [3H]cholesterol from cells was measured by the appearance of label in medium after incubation with acceptors as described in detail previously (5Mendez A.J. Uint L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2510-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mendez A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1807-1821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mendez A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5891-5900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Medium cholesterol (efflux) and cellular free and esterified cholesterol were expressed as the percentage of total [3H]cholesterol. Cell proteins were dissolved in 0.1m NaOH and quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choline-labeled phospholipids were determined in cell medium after extraction with CHCl3:CH3OH and in cell layers after extraction with isopropanol (5Mendez A.J. Uint L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2510-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) developed with CHCl3:CH3OH:H20 (65:35:4; v/v), and radioactivity corresponding to sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine was measured. Phospholipid efflux was calculated as the percentage of total individual [3H]phospholipid. Cellular free and esterified cholesterol mass were measured enzymatically (45Heider J.G. Boyett R. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 514-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after separation by TLC (5Mendez A.J. Uint L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2510-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin mass, phospholipids were separated by TLC as above, and phospholipid phosphorous was quantified by the method of Bartlett (46Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 267: 1219-1224Google Scholar). Esterification of cellular cholesterol by acyl-CoA:cholesterolO-acyltransferase was measured after the incubation with experimental medium by the incorporation of [14C]oleate (56 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL) into cholesteryl esters during an additional 1-h incubation at 37 °C in DMEM containing 9 μm[14C]oleate and 3 μm BSA (47Oram J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cholesterol esterification was expressed as nanomoles of [14C]oleate incorporated into [14C]cholesteryl esters per milligram of cell protein. Cells were separated into TX-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions by published methods (37Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). Confluent cell monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (for lipid analysis) and 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 μm aprotinin (for protein analysis). The suspension was homogenized by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, kept on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (containing the TX-100-soluble fraction) was removed. For lipid analysis, supernatants and pellets were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH (3:2; v/v), and lipids were subjected to TLC as above to separate free and esterified cholesterol or phospholipids as indicated in individual experiments. For protein analyses, the pellet was suspended in TX-100 buffer containing HEPES (pH 7.4) instead of MES and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to solubilize rafts. Aliquots of the supernatant and solubilized pellet were used for immunoblots and ABCA1 immunoprecipitation. Low density membrane rafts were separated from other cellular organelles by the sucrose density gradient method of Sargiacomo et al. (38Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 150-mm dishes were cholesterol-loaded and solubilized in MES-buffered saline containing 1% TX-100 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as above. The entire suspension was adjusted to 40% sucrose and placed in an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was layered above the samples and centrifuged for 16 h at 39,000 rpm in a SW 41 rotor. After centrifugation, 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube for [3H]cholesterol and caveolin-1 determinations. Cellular proteins were labeled with 35S by including 10 μCi of [35S]methionine overnight in the equilibration medium. The different incubation conditions used had no effect on total cell [35S]protein-specific activity. For selective labeling of plasma membrane proteins, fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin to biotinylate cell-surface proteins (48Walker J. Bossman P. Lackey B.R. Zimmerman J.K. Dimmick M.A. Hilderman R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 50: 14009-14014Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were then solubilized in detergent, and ABCA1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described below. Rabbit antiserum for ABCA1 was raised against a synthetic peptide located at the COOH terminus of human ABCA1 (18Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This antibody had immunoprecipitating activity but was ineffective on immunoblots (18Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, TX-100 extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the ABCA1 antiserum (1:200 dilution) followed by an additional 1-h incubation with protein A-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY). The antibody-antigen complex was sedimented with a magnet, the beads were washed twice with TX-100 buffer, and proteins were eluted with 1% acetic acid. After neutralization with 1 m Tris (pH 7.4), proteins were solubilized in SDS buffer for electrophoresis. Proteins were solubilized in 50 mmTris buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 6 and 15% gels for ABCA1 and caveolin-1, respectively. For each cell extract, the volume of SDS buffer added per lane represented the fraction of protein partitioning between TX-100-soluble and -insoluble membranes. To ensure that the same amount of total cell protein was represented for each experimental condition and cell line, aliquots of the initial TX-100 extracts were assayed for protein content, and the volume of SDS buffer applied to each lane was adjusted accordingly. Immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled ABCA1 was visualized in dried gels by phosphorimaging. For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit antiserum to human caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), 0.25 μg/ml mouse IgG to human clathrin heavy chain (Transduction Laboratories), 1 μg/ml mouse IgG to human Transferrin Receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), or 2 μg/ml rabbit IgG to human T-cadherin (raised against the 15 amino acids of the NH2 terminus of the mature protein). Antibody-positive bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). For detection of biotinylated ABCA1, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and visualized with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase ECL assay. Lactate dehydrogenase in cell culture medium or in cell layers solubilized with 1% TX-100 at room temperature was measured using a commercial kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis IN). Statistical comparisons were made by paired Student's t test with significance assumed for p values less than 0.05. All results were confirmed in at least two independent experiments.

This peptide is generated from the amyloid precursor protein by two consecutive cleavages. Cleavage at the N terminus is performed by the recently discovered β-secretase (Bace). This aspartyl protease contains a propeptide that has to be removed to obtain mature Bace. Furin and other members of the furin family of prohormone convertases are involved in this process. Surprisingly, β-secretase activity, neither at the classical Asp1 position nor at the Glu11 position of amyloid precursor protein, seems to be controlled by this maturation step. Furthermore, we show that Glu11 cleavage is a function of the expression level of Bace, that it depends on the membrane anchorage of Bace, and that Asp1 cleavage can be followed by Glu11cleavage. Our data suggest that pro-Bace could be active as a β-secretase in the early biosynthetic compartments of the cell and could be involved in the generation of the intracellular pool of the amyloid peptide. We conclude that modulation of the conversion of pro-Bace to mature Bace is not a relevant drug target to treat Alzheimer's disease.

Finally, Bace has an acidic pH optimum and is resistant to the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A (9Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S.

Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Although this evidence is impressive, only limited information is available on the cell biology of Bace. Bace is anN-glycosylated transmembrane protein encoded in a 501-amino acid open reading frame, from which the first 21 amino acids correspond to the signal peptide. N-terminal sequencing of Bace purified from human brain revealed that the mature protein starts at glutamic acid 46 (10), indicating that Bace is further processed after its translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Other proteases, e.g. proprotein convertases (PCs) and members of the ADAM family, are also synthesized as inactive proenzymes that require the removal of the propeptide to become active (13Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that pro-Bace is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and that constitutive propeptide cleavage takes place in the Golgi apparatus C-terminal to the Arg-Leu-Pro-Arg motif (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol.

PCs are subtilisin-like serine proteases involved in the activation of many neuropeptides, peptide hormones, growth and differentiation factors, membrane-associated receptors, adhesion molecules, blood coagulation factors, plasma proteins, and some pathogenic proteins like viral coat proteins and bacterial toxins (13Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 16Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 17Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Precursors are usually cleaved C-terminal to basic motifs like Lys/Arg-(X)n-Lys/Arg, where n = 2, 4, or 6 and X is essentially any amino acid but Cys and rarely Pro (13Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Seven members have been thus far isolated as follows: furin, PC1 (also called PC3), PC2, PC4, PC6 (also called PC5), PACE4, and LPC (also called PC7 or PC8). All enzymes have a specific, albeit partially overlapping, expression pattern and similar but not identical substrate specificities. Recently furin was implied in the production of amyloidogenic peptides in familial British dementia (18Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This observation stimulated us to ask whether proteases of the PC family could be involved in the regulation of the activity of Bace. Although the answer to this question is important from a cell biological point of view, we obviously also speculated that new insights in the regulation of Bace activity could foster new ideas for therapeutic intervention in AD. We investigate here the posttranslational maturation of Bace in cells in culture, and we demonstrate that mainly furin but, in addition, although to a lesser extent, other PCs like PACE4, LPC, PC6A, and PC6B could cleave the Bace propeptide in vivo, indicating some redundancy in this controlling step. We find also that Bace activity on APP is not significantly affected by the absence of furin or by PC inhibitors, strongly suggesting that pro-Bace can process APP. We conclude that it is unlikely that the proteolytic maturation of pro-Bace is a valid therapeutic target. Two primers were designed based on the sequence of mouse Bace/Asp2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF200346 (11Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R.

The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). This was subsequently used as template to introduce a C-terminal Myc tag in Bace and sBace. The latter encompasses the entire ectodomain of Bace but lacks the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. The sense primer contained the start codon, preceded by aBam HI restriction site (5′ctcggatccatggccccagcgctgcactgg3′), the antisense primer contained the Myc tag, followed by a stop codon, and an Eco RI restriction site (Bace, 5′ctcgaattctacaagtcctcttcagaaatgagcttttgctccttgagcagggagatgtcatc3′; sBace, 5′ctcgaattcctccaagtcctcttcagaaatgagcttttgctcataggctatggtcataagtg3′). The PCR products were digested with Bam HI andEco RI and cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Bace-ALPA and sBace-ALPA, in which the propeptide cleavage site RLPR↓ was mutated into ALPA, were made using QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the suppliers guidelines and using Bace-Myc as template. Note that these constructs also contain the Myc tag. All constructs were verified by sequencing. A polyclonal antibody was raised in New Zealand White rabbits against a synthetic polypeptide (ETDEEPEEPGRRGSFV) corresponding to the region immediately C-terminal to the propeptide, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Generation of antibody GM 190, directed against the propeptide of Bace, has been described before (15Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M. Kaiser H. Meyer C. Walter J. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30849-30854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody clone 9E10 was used to detect the Myc-tagged Bace proteins. All antibodies used for immunodetection of the different members of the proprotein convertase family were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. The polyclonal antibodies against the APP C terminus and against the ectodomain of APP have been described elsewhere (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Monoclonal 4G8 and 6E10 antibodies were raised against Aβ-(17–24) and Aβ-(1–16), respectively, and were obtained from Senetek. Polyclonal rabbit 53/4 specifically recognizes the β-secretase-generated neoepitope and was kindly provided by Dr. Savage, Cephalon (20Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J.

Hippocampal neurons were cultured from embryonic day 17 C57 black embryos and co-cultured with a glial feeder layer. At day 15 post-plating, neurons were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by ice-cold methanol/acetone incubation to permeabilize the cells (36Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. St. George-Hyslop P. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). After blocking (4 °C, overnight), neurons were incubated with primary antibodies anti-Bace polyclonal and anti-β-COP monoclonal antibody (clone MAD, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. For detection, Alexa488 and Alexa546 dyes coupled to secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used (1 h at room temperature). Analysis was done on a NIKON inverted microscope DIAPHOT 300 (PlanApo 60/1.40 oil) connected to a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope, and images were captured by Lasersharp (version 3.2) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe, CA). Medium, serum, and supplements used for the maintenance of cells were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and the furin-deficient derivative RPE.40 cells (21Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), N2A, and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 8–10 × 105 cells/10-cm2 culture plate were transfected with 2 μg of DNA and 6 μl of Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and were used for experiments the next day (CHO and RPE.40) or after 2 days (N2A and COS cells). Cells (8–10 × 105 cells/10 cm2) were starved for 1 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium and then labeled in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) for the times indicated in the figure legends. In case of overnight labeling, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum was added to the labeling medium, and starvation was omitted. For immunoprecipitation of Bace and PCs, cells were lysed in 1 ml of DIPA (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Immunoprecipitations and endoglycosidase H and F digestions were performed as described (22Creemers J.W. Vey M. Schafer W. Ayoubi T.A. Roebroek A.J. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation of Bace and Bace mutants with either anti-Myc 9E10 or anti-Bace antibody gave identical results (data not shown). The figure legends indicated which antibody was used. To study APP processing, cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding APP, Bace constructs, furin, and PDX as indicated in the figures. Twenty four (for CHO and RPE.40 cells) or 48 h (N2A and COS cells) after transfection, cells were pulse-labeled for 4 h and immediately lysed. APP full-length and C-terminal fragments (CTFs) were immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts, whereas Aβ and total secreted APP (APPs) were immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium as described (4De Strooper B.

To discriminate between APPs originating from α- versusβ-cleavage, samples from the conditional medium were resolved by 10% PAGE. Western blotting was subsequently performed with either 6E10 or 53/4 antibodies. Separation of Bace immunoreactive bands in isoelectric focusing was performed essentially as described (25Ploegh H.L. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10.2.1-10.2.8Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5% acrylamide (w/v) reducing gel containing 2% Triton X-100, 9.1 m urea, 4% ampholytes, pH 5–7, and 1% ampholytes, pH 3.5–10, was run 13–16 h at a starting voltage of ∼20 V/cm and a limiting voltage of 50 V/cm. Prior to IEF samples were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F as described above. We used confocal microscopy to study the intracellular localization of Bace in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (Fig.1). Mouse neurons indeed express Bace, and some overlap in the distribution of Bace and the Golgi marker β-COP is observed. Bace is, however, also present in β-COP negative vesicles, most likely endosomes. Previous studies have addressed the issue of Bace subcellular distribution in non-neuronal cells using Bace overexpressed from transfected cDNA (8Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D.

Our data confirm these previous findings at the endogenous levels of expression and indicate that transfected Bace localizes to the relevant subcellular compartments. Since the levels of endogenous expression of Bace are very low (results not shown), further biochemical analysis to characterize the maturation and the activity of Bace was performed in transfected cells. We next cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding Bace from a brain-specific mouse cDNA library (Stratagene) and confirmed its identity to the sequence published by Yan et al. (11Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). To characterize the biosynthesis and maturation of Bace, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Transiently transfected CHO cells were radiolabeled and chased for various times (Fig. 2 A). Immediately after the pulse labeling, three specific protein bands were observed as follows: a major one migrating with an approximate mass of 65 kDa and two minor ones migrating at 50 and 75 kDa, consistent with previous reports (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol.

The 50-kDa protein disappeared during the chase, whereas the amount of 65-kDa protein decreased but remained prominent and the 75-kDa increased during the first 2 h of chase and remained constant afterward. Deglycosylation experiments with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 2 B) demonstrated that the 75-kDa protein but not the 65-kDa protein carries complex-type oligosaccharides. Removing all N-linked sugars using endoglycosidase F resulted in a single band of 50 kDa. This indicates that the three protein species contain the same polypeptide backbone. The 50-kDa protein is therefore the unglycosylated Bace precursor; the 65-kDa protein is Bace containing simple N-linked oligosaccharides; and the 75-kDa species finally is the fully complex glycosylated protein. The large shifts in molecular weight upon glycosylation indicate that the four potential glycosylation sites of Bace are probably all utilized, although some heterogeneity is possible (14Haniu M.

Analysis of the N terminus of Bace reveals a potential propeptide of 24 amino acids, ending in the sequence Arg-Leu-Pro-Arg45. Basic motifs are often recognized and cleaved by PCs (13Seidah N.G.

The kinase domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3 are nearly identical, although their N-terminal regulatory domains are significantly divergent. By yeast two-hybrid library screening, we have identified MEK5, the MAPK kinase in the big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1)/ERK5 pathway, as a binding partner for MEKK2. MEKK2 expression stimulates BMK1/ERK5 activity, the downstream substrate for MEK5. Compared with MEKK3, MEKK2 activated BMK1/ERK5 to a greater extent, which might correlate with a higher affinity MEKK2-MEK5 interaction. A dominant negative form of MEK5 blocked the activation of BMK1/ERK5 by MEKK2, whereas activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was unaffected, showing that MEK5 is a specific downstream effector of MEKK2 in the BMK1/ERK5 pathway. Activation of BMK1/ERK5 by epidermal growth factor and H2O2 in Cos7 and HEK293 cells was completely blocked by a kinase-inactive MEKK3 (MEKK3kin−), whereas MEKK2kin− had no effect. However, in D10 T cells, expression of MEKK2kin− but not MEKK3kin− inhibited BMK1/ERK5 activity. Two-hybrid screening also identified Lck-associated adapter/Rlk- and Itk-binding protein (Lad/RIBP), a T cell adapter protein, as a binding partner for MEKK2. MEKK2 and Lad/RIBP colocalize at the T cell contact site with antigen-loaded presenting cells, demonstrating cotranslocation of MEKK2 and Lad/RIBP during T cell activation. MEKK3 neither binds Lad/RIBP nor is recruited to the T cell contact with antigen presenting cell. MEKK2 and MEKK3 are differentially associated with signaling from specific upstream receptor systems, whereas both activate the MEK5-BMK1/ERK5 pathway.

The core component of such a MAPK module is a set of three sequential kinases that are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes from unicellular yeast to plants and animals. In mammalian cells, three distinguishable MAPK modules have been well described; they are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 pathways. The MAPK pathways regulate cell growth, differentiation, adaptation to the environment, and apoptosis in response to a great number of stimuli, including cytokines and various stresses (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

The MAPKs also control numerous regulatory processes during development and homeostasis (4Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 5Stronach B.E. Perrimon N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6172-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Noselli S. Agnes F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously cloned two MAPK kinase kinases, designated MEKK2 and MEKK3 (7Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MEKK2 and MEKK3 are extremely homologous (94% conserved) in their catalytic domains, but their regulatory N-terminal sequences are quite divergent, with only 65% homology, predicting that they perform similar as well as different cellular tasks. In this regard, Schaefer et al. (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks R.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that T cell MEKK2 but not MEKK3 is activated and translocates to the plasma membrane at the contact with antigen-loaded presenting cells. Thus, although MEKK2 and MEKK3 are both mediators of signal transduction to the MAPK pathways, they are subject to stimulus- and cell type-specific regulation. A differential involvement of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in cellular signaling has also been demonstrated by our recent finding that MEKK2 but not MEKK3 regulates the activity of the protein kinase C-related kinase PRK2 (9Sun W. Vincent S. Settleman J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24421-24428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1)/ERK5 was recently cloned as a novel member of the MAPK family (10Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 11Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Like ERK1/2, BMK1/ERK5 has a TEY sequence in its dual phosphorylation motif; however, other structural features such as a large regulatory C terminus and a unique loop 12 domain distinguish BMK1/ERK5 from ERK1/2 and other MAP kinases (10Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This predicts that the regulation and function of BMK1/ERK5 are distinct from those of other MAPKs. In this regard, Zhou et al. (11Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) showed that BMK1/ERK5 interacts specifically with MEK5 but not its closely related MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2, suggesting that MEK5/BMK1 represents a separate signaling module. Indeed, MEK5 selectively phosphorylates and activates BMK1/ERK5 (12English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that MEK5/BMK1 lies in a signal transduction pathway parallel to the classical MAPK cascades, MEK5 is not significantly phosphorylated by Raf-1, c-Mos, or MEKK1, specific MAPK kinase kinases of the ERK and JNK pathways (12English J.M.

Although MEF2 family members, which currently also include MEF2B and MEF2D, were initially thought to be muscle-restricted, they are also expressed at high levels in a variety of other cell types (20Naya F.J. Olson E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether this involves a requirement for BMK1/ERK5-mediated expression of c-jun. Nonetheless, in fibroblasts c-Jun appears to be necessary for normal cell cycle progression and cell growth (25Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Pena A. Lipson K. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar,26Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Here we report that MEKK2, like MEKK3, binds MEK5 and activates the BMK1/ERK5 pathway. Using two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation, we show that MEKK2 but not MEKK3 binds the adapter protein Lad/RIBP. Lad/RIBP is an adapter protein that contains several protein-interaction motifs including an SH2 domain; binds Lck, Rlk, and Itk; and is involved in T cell receptor-mediated antigen activation of the T cell (27Choi Y.B. Kim C.K. Yun Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5242-5249PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rajagopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Korthauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In D10 T cells activated by antigen presentation, MEKK2 and Lad/RIBP colocalize at the T cell contact with the antigen presenting cell. We have also shown that MEKK3 is not regulated by antigen and does not localize to the T cell contact with antigen presenting cell (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks R.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, MEKK3 appears to mediate EGF receptor activation of the BMK1/ERK5 pathway. Our findings show that MEKK2 and MEKK3 are differentially associated in signaling by specific receptor tyrosine kinase systems, and both regulate the BMK1/ERK5 pathway. The dominant negative mutants of MEKK2 and MEKK3 have been described previously (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks R.F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of MEK5 (MEK5AA) was generated by replacing the two activating phosphorylation residues (Ser-311 and Thr-315) with alanine. MEKK2 amino acids 1–188 or 228–360 was fused in-frame to the C terminus of the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA in vector pBTM116 (30Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The construct was used to transform yeast reporter strain L40 (31Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), together with mouse T-cell lymphoma library cDNA cloned C-terminally to the activation domain of Gal4 (GAD) in plasmid pACT (32Durfee T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24421-24428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For two-hybrid interaction analysis, transformant L40 cells were streaked on SC-His + 3-AT plates after first growth on plates with histidine. A second two-hybrid system was also used in the study; in this case, yeast CG1945 (CLONTECH) was used as the host strain, and MEK5 was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GBD) in vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) as “bait.” In these two systems, the “prey” proteins were either fused to the GAD in pACT or the VP16 activation domain (VAD) in plasmid pVP16 (31Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Quantitation of β-galactosidase (β-gal) activities was assayed on liquid cultures usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. HEK293 and Cos7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. At 50–80% confluence, cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids (as indicated in the figures) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum for 36–40 h. For analysis of BMK1/ERK5 activation induced by extracellular stimuli, 36–40 h posttransfection cells were incubated with low serum medium (0.4% bovine calf serum) for a further 24 h and then treated with 1 ng/ml EGF for 15 min or 500 μm H2O2 for 30 min. To investigate the requirement of MEKK2 for BMK1/ERK5 activity in T cells, parental D10 cells or stable MEKK2kin−-GFP or MEKK3kin−-YFP infectants (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R.

Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation or directly to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by Western blotting. 293 cells were transfected with pFlag-MEK5 or mock vector, together with HA-MEKK2 or V5-epitope-tagged MEKK3. After lysis, 400 μg of cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M5 antibody (Sigma) with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation with rec-protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and after heat denaturation were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 antibody from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, monoclonal anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen, and anti-BMK1/ERK5 antiserum from Sigma. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To investigate MEKK2/3-Lad/RIBP interaction, lysates of cells transfected with Flag-Lad and HA-MEKK2/3 or empty vector were precipitated with 12CA5 and Western-blotted with M5. The T cell clone D10 and the D10-derived clones expressing MEKK2-GFP and Lad-YFP were maintained as described previously (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks R.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). D10 T cell clones were mixed with antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with no antigen or with 500 μg/ml conalbumin. After 10 min, conjugates were bound to coverslips and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde/3% sucrose and stripped of membranes by 5 min of treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Conjugates were stained with antibodies or analyzed directly for GFP/YFP fluorescence using a Leica DMXRA epifluorescence microscope. Data was acquired with a Cooke Corp. SensiCam CCD camera and was digitally deconvolved using a nearest neighbor algorithm with Slidebook software from Intelligent Imaging Corp. Conjugate contact analysis involved acquiring stacks of images in 0.2-μm steps throughout the contact volume (8Schaefer B.C. Ware M.F. Marrack P. Fanger G.R. Kappler J.W. Johnson G.L. Monks R.F. Immunity. 1999; 11: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For analyzing activation of MEK5 by MEKK2 in cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged MEK5 alone or together with MEKK2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M5 antibody and rec-protein G beads in the above lysis buffer with 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. After washing beads were incubated with 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Upstate Biotechnology) in a 50-μl kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2) with 90 nm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for 20 min. For analysis of endogenous JNK activity, 400 μg of lysates of transfected 293 or Cos7 cells were incubated with 50 μg of bacterially expressed and purified glutathioneS-transferase-cJun1–79, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed and suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer. In vitro phosphorylation of c-Jun1–79 by endogenous JNK was analyzed as described above. The regulatory sequence outside the MEKK2 kinase domain is located in the N-terminal 360 residues (MEKK2aa1–360). However, no known signature domains can be found for this region. In fact, data base searches show that it is homologous only to the corresponding sequence of MEKK3. In attempts to identify the organization of the MEKK2 signaling module, we performed yeast two-hybrid analyses using MEKK2aa1–360 as bait. Unfortunately, this fragment of MEKK2 by itself turned out to have strong transcriptional activation activity and was thus not suitable for the purpose of library screening. Analysis of the MEKK2 protein indicates that residues from 189 to 227 are particularly rich in acidic residues, which have been shown to be an essential characteristic of many transcription factors (33Rudden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Rudden D.M. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We therefore fused amino acids 1–188 of MEKK2 to the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA (LexA-MEKK2aa1–188) and used it as bait to screen a mouse T-cell lymphoma cDNA library in the yeast reporter host strain L40 (31Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). One positive clone encoded the open reading frame of MEK5 except for the first 4 amino acids. Analysis of the His3 and LacZ reporter genes of yeast L40 transformed with LexA-MEKK2 and Gal4 activation domain fusion of MEK5 (GAD-MEK5) confirmed that full-length MEKK2 interacted with MEK5 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.1, A and B). To further validate the binding partnership between MEKK2 and MEK5, we switched the bait and prey constructs and tested their interaction in a different yeast two-hybrid system. MEK5 was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) and MEKK2 to the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16. As expected, yeast CG1945 cells could grow on synthetic complete plates Lacking histidine (SC-His) and containing 3 mm 3-AT only when they were provided with both GBD-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK2 (Fig. 1 C). The results also showed that MEK5 binds full-length MEKK3 in the two-hybrid analysis, confirming the findings of Chao et al. (35Chao T.-H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36305-36308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in which they identified a fragment of MEKK3 (amino acids 213–626) as a binding sequence for MEK5. This region of MEKK3 corresponds to residues 200–618 of MEKK2, which does not overlap with MEKK2aa1–188, which we had shown binds to MEK5. These results suggested that MEK5 interacts with at least two separate regions within the MEKK2 protein. To test this possibility, MEKK2 truncated of the first 188 amino acids (MEKK2Δ1–188) was fused to the VAD, and its interaction with MEK5 was examined by the two-hybrid analysis. Yeast cells transformed with GBD-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK2Δ1–188 were histidine prototrophic (Fig.1 C), showing that MEKK2Δ1–188 binds MEK5. Because the LacZ gene in CG1945 is driven by a weak promoter and does not allow for quantitative β-gal assays, quantitation of the strength of interaction with MEK5 was performed using the LexA-based yeast strain L40 as the host (Fig. 1 D). Cells transformed with LexA-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK2 exhibited a β-gal activity ∼6 times that of cells with LexA-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK3. Cells containing LexA-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK2Δ1–188 had a basal level of β-gal activity as control cells having LexA-MEK5 and the vector VAD. However, cell lysates from yeast CG1945 transformed with GBD-MEK5 and VAD-MEKK2Δ1–188 were able to convert the substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside into slightly yellow substance when the incubations were allowed to proceed overnight, whereas the control reactions remained colorless (data not shown). These results may suggest that MEK5 interacts more strongly with MEKK2 than with MEKK3, and the major binding site for MEK5 in MEKK2 is located in the first 188 amino acids. Alternatively, significant interaction between MEK5 and MEKK2aa189–619 requires prior binding to, or a structure maintained by, MEKK2aa1–188. It should be cautioned, however, that studies have found that the β-gal activity does not always correlate with the strength of an interaction (36Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and analysis of the interactions using recombinant purified proteins will probably need to be completed. Future work will investigate the differential contributions and potential synergy of the two sites in the MEKK2 protein sequence that interact with MEK5. To substantiate the yeast two-hybrid findings in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged MEK5 or mock expression vector, plus HA-tagged MEKK2 or V5-epitope-tagged MEKK3. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and Western-blotted with anti-HA (for detecting MEKK2) or anti-V5 (for detecting MEKK3) antibody (Fig. 1 E). The results showed that MEKK2 and MEKK3 were present in the anti-Flag immunoprecipitates only when cells were cotransfected with MEK5, confirming the interaction of MEKK2 and MEKK3 with MEK5 in the mammalian cell expression system. We asked whether MEKK2 could stimulate the kinase activity of MEK5 in vivo. To investigate this, HEK293 cells were transfected with MEK5 alone or together with MEKK2. Equal amounts of MEK5 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and its kinase activity was analyzed by an in vitro kinase reaction using MBP as substrate (Fig. 2 A). MEK5 by itself had background level of activity (compare lanes 1 and4). Cotransfection with MEKK2 gave a reproducible 2-fold increase in MEK5 activity (lane 2). The increased phosphorylation of MBP was due to activation of MEK5 by MEKK2 because immunoprecipitate from lysates of cells cotransfected with MEKK2 and a dominant negative mutant (MEK5AA) had a similar background MBP phosphorylation activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Because MEK5 is a direct upstream regulator of BMK1/ERK5 (11Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 13Kato Y. Kravchenko V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we next examined whether MEKK2 could activate BMK1/ERK5 by a transient transfection assay. Previous studies have established that the migration of phosphorylated and activated BMK1/ERK5 in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel is significantly retarded compared with the inactive protein (13Kato Y. Kravchenko V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 14Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of BMK1/ERK5 can be assayed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Transfection with MEKK3 did not activate BMK1/ERK5 (lane 5), consistent with the report by Chao et al. (35Chao T.-H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36305-36308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of MEKK2 at similar or even lower protein levels (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel) led to the appearance of a phosphorylated BMK1/ERK5 band with altered electrophoretic mobility (lane 3). The data suggests that MEKK2 is more potent than MEKK3 in promoting the activation of BMK1/ERK5. Expression of MEK5 alone did not activate BMK1/ERK5 (lane 2). However, in contrast to the results of Chaoet al. (35Chao T.-H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.-D. J. Biol. Chem"

In vitro, cells utilize a complex temporal and spatially regulated mechanism of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly required for cell migration. Recent studies indicate that members of both calpain and caspase protease families can promote limited proteolytic cleavage of several components of focal adhesions leading to disassembly of these complexes. Such mechanisms that influence cell adhesion may be deregulated under pathological conditions characterized by increased cell motility, such as tumor invasion. v-Src-induced oncogenic transformation is associated with loss of focal adhesion structures and transition to a less adherent, more motile phenotype, while inactivating temperature-sensitive v-Src in serum-deprived transformed cells leads to detachment and apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that v-Src-induced disassembly of focal adhesions is accompanied by calpain-dependent proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, inhibitors of calpain repress v-Src-induced focal adhesion disruption, loss of substrate adhesion, and cell migration. In contrast, focal adhesion loss during detachment and apoptosis induced after switching off temperature-sensitive v-Src in serum-deprived transformed cells is accompanied by caspase-mediated proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase.

Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Dynamic regulation of these adhesive links through assembly of focal adhesions at the leading edge of cells, coordinated with focal adhesion disassembly at the trailing edge, plays a key role in controlling cell migration (9Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating turnover of focal adhesions are not well understood. However, a recent study suggests that proteolysis of specific components of the focal adhesion complex by the calpain family of proteolytic enzymes promotes disassembly of smooth muscle focal adhesions in response to collagen fragments (10Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calpain activity has been implicated in promoting migration of Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H.

The calpains are defined as a well conserved family of intracellular, nonlysosomal calcium-dependent cysteine proteases consisting of two ubiquitously expressed calpain isozymes, μ-calpain (calpain-I) and m-calpain (calpain-II) and several tissue-specific isoforms (12Mellgren R.L.

Tsukahara I. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that calpains are functional at focal adhesion sites. Oncogenic transformation of cells by v-Src is associated with an overall loss in abundance of focal adhesions as well as changes in focal adhesion architecture to smaller more condensed structures (22David-Pfeuty T. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which v-Src promotes the disassembly of focal adhesions have so far not been elucidated. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 is both a substrate of Src kinase activity and a central component of focal adhesions and may be a strong candidate for mediating v-Src-induced disassembly of focal adhesions. Through multiple protein-binding domains, FAK can interact with and phosphorylate several members of the focal adhesion complex (23Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Studies on cells derived from FAK knock-out embryos demonstrate that focal adhesions devoid of FAK are larger and that these cells have a reduced migratory capacity, suggesting that FAK may be required to regulate the turnover of focal adhesion structures (24Ilic D.

To specifically examine the role of calpain-mediated proteolysis in tyrosine kinase-induced focal adhesion disruption, we have used a temperature-dependent mutant of v-Src (ts LA 29 v-Src). Activation of v-Src by shift to the permissive temperature initiates focal adhesion disassembly (5Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work has indicated that this and consequent morphological transformation are dependent on the catalytic activity of v-Src that induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion components, including FAK, followed by dissociation of the Src-FAK complex and degradation of FAK, events that precede focal adhesion loss and cell rounding (5Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Despite this characterization of the sequence of events during the initial stages of v-Src-induced cell transformation, we still lack any understanding of the nature of the process of FAK proteolytic cleavage induced by v-Src, and specifically, the identities of the proteases involved have not been elucidated. As mentioned above, calpains represent good candidates; however, FAK has also been demonstrated to be cleaved by caspases as focal adhesions are lost during apoptosis (25Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In this study, we have addressed whether FAK cleavage that is triggered prior to focal adhesion disassembly during cell transformation is mediated by members of either the calpain or caspase family of proteolytic enzymes. Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were subcultured as described previously (5Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). Low density cultures were transfected with replication-competent avian retroviral constructs, RCAN-v-src, encoding the temperature-sensitive ts LA 29 v-Src mutant. Transfected CEF were cultured at the permissive temperature of 35 °C until cells were uniformly infected and expressing v-Src protein. For analysis of v-Src-induced transformation, cells were cultured at the restrictive temperature (41 °C) and then examined following shift to the permissive temperature (35 °C). Rat 1 fibroblasts expressingts LA 29 v-Src were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mml-glutamine at the permissive temperature (35 °C). Rat 1 cells were serum-starved for 24 h (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% newborn calf serum) prior to a shift to the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C). Calpain inhibitor studies were performed using calpain inhibitor 1 (ALLN; Calbiochem), calpain inhibitor 2 (ALLM), and the cell-permeable sense and scrambled calpastatin peptides (Calbiochem). Caspase inhibitor studies were carried out with caspase inhibitor 1 (ZVAD-FMK; Calbiochem). CEF were preincubated with ALLN, ALLM, or ZVAD-FMK (50–100 μm) for 1 h prior to shift to 35 °C and then subsequently incubated at 35 °C in the presence of ALLN, ALLM, or ZVAD-FMK (50–100 μm) or sense and scrambled calpastatin peptides (50 μm) for the indicated time periods. Serum-starved Rat 1 fibroblasts were preincubated with ZVAD-FMK or ALLN (100 μm) for 1 h prior to shift to restrictive temperature 39.5 °C and then subsequently incubated at this temperature in the presence of the inhibitors. Antibodies for Western blot detection and immunocytochemistry included2–18N pp125FAK and 903–1058C pp125FAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.),354–534N pp125FAK (Transduction Laboratories), paxillin (Transduction Laboratories), and calpain-II (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Anti-mouse and -rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Nontransformed and transformed ts LA 29 CEF were cultured on permanox plastic chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and washed serially in PBS, 0.15 mglycine/PBS plus 0.02% NaN3, and PBS. Cells were blocked in 10% fetal calf serum/PBS prior to 1 h incubation at room temperature with primary antibodies, including affinity-purified monoclonal anti-paxillin (Transduction Laboratories) and polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated against the large subunit of m-calpain (calpain II) purified from human placenta (Research Diagnostics Inc.). Primary antibody incubation was followed by several washes in PBS and subsequent incubation with FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Cells were also incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Immunostaining of cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in low detergent lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm NaF, 10 mm β−glycerophosphate, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 μm NaVO4 with protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C, supplemented with SDS-sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. ts LA 29 v-Src-expressing CEF were cultured on tissue culture plastic substrates at 41 or 35 °C for 18 h in the absence or presence of calpain inhibitor 1 and 2 (ALLN, ALLM; 100 μm), or herbimycin A (5 mm) cells were washed three times with PBS, and those cells remaining attached to the culture substrate were quantified by counting the number of cells per high power field (magnification × 200). Data representing the mean of four high power fields were expressed as the number of cells per high power field remaining attached to the culture substrate. 2 × 105 CEF expressing ts LA 29 v-Src were cultured at 41 °C in 60-mm dishes until 70–80% confluent. The cell monolayers were wounded by scoring with a sterile micropipette tip, and cultures were incubated at 35 °C for a further 18 h in the absence or presence of ALLN (50 μm), ALLM (50 μm), and ZVAD-FMK (100 μm). To analyze the role of the calpain proteolytic enzymes in focal adhesion loss associated with v-Src induced morphological transformation, we examined protein levels and localization of the ubiquitously expressed calpain II in nontransformed (41 °C) and v-Src-transformed CEF (35 °C). Immunoblotting cell lysates prepared at sequential time points following shift to 35 °C demonstrated a consistent rapid increase in levels of calpain II following activation of v-Src, which subsequently declined at 24 h (Fig.1 A). Calpain I protein was detected at extremely low levels in CEF, and levels of calpain I did not vary during the early stages of transformation (results not shown). Messenger RNA levels of calpain II and the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin are not altered in response to v-Src transformation (results not shown), suggesting that elevation of calpain II protein levels and proteolytic activity following v-Src activation are regulated at a post-transcriptional level. Immunostaining of nontransformed CEF (41 °C) with an antibody against calpain II was generally weak and diffuse throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, some calpain II immunoreactivity was evident at peripheral focal adhesion sites colocalizing with the focal adhesion protein paxillin (indicated by arrows) (Fig.1 B). Six hours following shift to the permissive temperature (35 °C), immunostaining of ts v-Src-expressing CEF with anti-calpain II was of greater intensity than that of nontransformed cells (Fig. 1 C), consistent with the elevated protein levels observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A). In v-Src-transformed CEF, calpain II staining often localized at peripheral podosome-like structures (indicated by arrows) that may represent substrate attachment sites consisting of residual focal adhesions (Fig.1 C). Immunostaining of anti-calpain II at these peripheral sites again colocalized with focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether calpain activity was involved in the process of oncogenic transformation, CEF expressing ts v-Src were studied following treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of calpain proteolytic activity as well as a calpastatin peptide highly specific for calpain inhibition. ts v-Src-expressing CEF were shifted from the restrictive temperature (41 °C) to the permissive temperature (35 °C) to induce cell transformation. Characteristic of v-Src transformation, untreated CEF lost focal adhesion structures, exhibited a disorganized actin cytoskeleton, and developed a rounded morphology with many cells having detached from the culture substrate 18 h following shift to 35 °C (Fig.2 B). Treatment of cells cultured at 35 °C with a well characterized pharmacological peptide aldehyde inhibitor of calpain activity, ALLN (100 μm) (27Squier M.K. Miller A.C. Malkinson A.M. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 28Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme.

Physiol. 1999; 178: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suppressed the loss of focal adhesions, cell rounding, and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2 C). Calpain inhibitor I-ALLN has also been reported to inhibit the lysosomal proteases cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome complex (27Squier M.K. Miller A.C. Malkinson A.M. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 30Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M.

Biophys. 1996; 335: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Treatment of ts v-Src-expressing CEF undergoing transformation with ammonium chloride, a reputed inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins (32Seglen P.O. Grinde B. Solheim A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 33Ziegler H.K. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), or the specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (34Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), had no effect on the characteristics of v-Src transformation (results not shown), indicating that the effects of ALLN were most likely due to calpain inhibition. In addition, treatment ofts v-Src-expressing CEF with ALLM (100 μm), which is inhibitory against calpains, but not the proteasome, can suppress v-Src-induced loss of focal adhesions and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology (results not shown). A more specific approach to inhibiting intracellular calpain activity can be achieved by exploiting the characteristics of the naturally occurring endogenous inhibitor of calpain, known as calpastatin. Calpastatin is highly specific for calpain I and calpain II and has not been demonstrated to inhibit other proteases (35Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 36Mohan P.S. Nixon R.A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Studies demonstrate that a 27-amino acid synthetic calpastatin peptide corresponding to the minimal inhibitory segment of domain I of calpastatin specifically inhibits activity of calpain both in vitro (37Maki M. Bagci H. Hamaguchi K. Ueda M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18866-18869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in a cell-permeable fashion in vivo (38Eto A. Akita Y. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25115-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ts v-Src-expressing CEF treated with the sense (Fig. 2 D), but not the scrambled (Fig. 2 E), cell-permeable calpastatin peptide demonstrate a reduction in the loss of focal adhesions, disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and cell rounding normally associated with v-Src transformation at 35 °C. In contrast, treatment of cells with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK has no effect on transformation (Fig. 2 F). The results obtained with the above panel of inhibitors indicate that calpains are the proteases involved in promoting disassembly of focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton and transition to a less adherent and more rounded morphology during v-Src transformation of CEF. We have previously observed proteolytic degradation of the recognized calpain substrate FAK during v-Src transformation and focal adhesion loss, although the antibody used in these studies did not detect cleavage products (5Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize FAK cleavage in more detail, we have utilized three epitope-specific antibodies raised against defined regions of the FAK protein. Using a low detergent lysis buffer to enrich for proteolytic fragments of FAK present in the cytoplasm (see “Experimental Procedures”), total cell lysates were prepared fromts v-Src-expressing CEF cultured at 41 °C or at sequential time points following v-Src activation by shift to 35 °C. Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using three antibodies recognizing the amino terminus (N-pp125FAK), residues 354–534 downstream of the amino terminus (354–534N-pp125FAK), and the carboxyl terminus (C-pp125FAK) of FAK as probes (Fig.3). Immunoblotting with all three antibodies indicated that cleavage of native FAK occurred between 6 and 8 h following activation of v-Src. The loss of native FAK was paralleled by the generation of approximately sized 95- and 40-kDa amino-terminal fragments and a 30-kDa C-terminal cleavage product (Fig.3, A and C). Additionally, 55-, 42-, and 30-kDa fragments of FAK derived from the internal region of the protein can be identified by the 354–534N pp125FAK antibody (Fig. 3 B). The initial cleavage of FAK to approximately 95-kDa amino-terminal and 30-kDa C-terminal fragments is consistent with the pattern of calpain-mediated cleavage described previously for other stimuli (16Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Pretreatment and subsequent incubation ofts v-Src-expressing CEF at 35 °C in the presence of ALLN at 100 μm significantly inhibited cleavage of FAK and generation of all cleavage products associated with v-Src transformation (Fig. 3, A–C), whereas treatment with a caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-FMK; 100 μm) had no effect (results not shown). To examine the influence calpain inhibition had on the adhesive strength of v-Src-transformed CEF for their culture substrate,ts v-Src-expressing CEF were cultured for 18 h at 41 °C or at 35 °C in the absence or presence of the calpain inhibitors ALLN and ALLM. The number of cells remaining attached to the substrate after extensive washing was quantified and expressed as the number of cells per high power field (Fig.4). These results demonstrated that after 18 h at 35 °C there was a significant loss in the number ofts v-Src-expressing cells remaining strongly adherent to the substrate. Transformation of cells at 35 °C in the presence of the calpain inhibitor ALLN or ALLM (100 μm) resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in the number of cells remaining attached to the culture substrate. Incubation of CEF at 35 °C in the presence of the general inhibitor of kinase function herbimycin A, which inhibits Src kinase activity, also partially rescued substrate anchorage (Fig. 4). These results indicate that calpain-dependent disassembly of focal adhesions that accompanies v-Src transformation results in a general decrease in the adhesion of transformed CEF to their culture substrate. Thus, treatment of v-Src-transformed CEF with calpain inhibitors stabilized focal adhesion structures and maintained substrate anchorage. Since we have shown that the proteolysis of FAK during transformation by v-Src is most likely calpain-dependent and since we have shown previously that Src-induced focal adhesion disassembly is required for cell migration (6Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we addressed whether inhibitors of calpain could suppress cell migration into a wounded monolayer of v-Src-transformed cells. After wounding, ts v-Src-expressing CEF cultured at 35 °C for 18 h demonstrated extensive migration into the denuded area (Fig. 5). Incubation of ts v-Src-expressing CEF at 35 °C in the presence of the calpain and proteasome inhibitor (ALLN; 50 μm) inhibited any motility of transformed CEF into the wound (Fig. 5). Treatment of CEF with the inhibitor ALLM (50 μm), which inhibits calpain and not the proteasome complex, also substantially prevented migration. Since ALLN and ALLM have previously been reported to exhibit cathepsin-inhibitory activity (27Squier M.K. Miller A.C. Malkinson A.M. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 30Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we also treated ts v-Src-expressing CEF with the reported inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins, ammonium chloride, as a negative control and found this had no significant influence on migration (results not shown). Treatment of cells with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK also has no effect on migration of v-Src-transformed CEF (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that v-Src-transformed CEF are dependent on calpain activity for optimal migration, most likely as a result of its proposed role in FAK cleavage and focal adhesion turnover. Our previous studies demonstrate that Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing thets LA 29 v-Src protein undergo apoptosis when cultured in low serum following attenuation of v-Src activity by culture at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C). Following shift of serum-starvedts LA 29 Rat-1 cells from permissive (35 °C) to restrictive temperature (39.5 °C), the cells rapidly round up and become less adherent (40Johnson D. Agochiya M. Samejima K. Earnshaw W. Frame M. Wyke J. Death Differ. 2000; 7: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of FAK to 85- and 77-kDa N-terminal fragments accompanies these morphological changes (Fig. 6); however, in contrast to v-Src transformation, FAK cleavage in serum-deprived cells switched to the restrictive temperature was not inhibited by ALLN but instead was inhibited by ZVAD-FMK (Fig. 6), indicating that caspases and not calpains are responsible for FAK cleavage that accompanies adhesion loss under these circumstances. Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix substrates regulates many aspects of normal cell physiology, including proliferation, migration, and cell survival (9Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 41Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 42Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). An integral role for calpain activity in regulating critical aspects of cell behavior has been suggested by previous studies demonstrating that calpain activity can degrade focal adhesion components (39Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), mediate substrate detachment at the trailing edge of cells (9Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and regulate filipodia and lamellipodia formation and forward protrusion at the leading edge of cells (43Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition calpain may also contribute to caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death pathways (44Kato M. Nonaka T. Maki M. Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 45Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 46Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). However, evidence demonstrating either a physiological or pathological role for calpain-dependent proteolysis of focal adhesion components has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that levels of calpain II protein are regulated at the post-transcriptional level following v-Src transformation of CEF. Furthermore, in response to activation of v-Src, calpain activity promotes proteolytic cleavage of FAK, focal adhesion disassembly, and morphological transformation. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we have identified putative cleavage fragments generated by calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK taking place during v-Src transformation. FAK cleavage data indicate that a 30-kDa C-terminal fragment containing the focal adhesion targeting sequence and a second proline-rich domain dissociates from a 95-kDa amino-terminal fragment containing the kinase domain. Since the C-terminal domains of FAK are important in targeting FAK to focal adhesions (47Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), this cleavage event is likely to influence the localization of the kinase domain to focal adhesion sites and may lead to reduced FAK activity at adhesions, something that is known to negatively regulate FAK function and cell motility (48Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal cleavage fragment is relatively stable following its generation, so it could potentially act in a dominant negative role, competing with functionally intact full-length FAK for focal adhesion substrates. Calpain-dependent cleavage of FAK would also be expected to impair the ability of FAK to act as an adapter protein, thereby compromising the integrity of the focal adhesion complex. Thus, modulation of FAK function through calpain-dependent cleavage is likely to play a significant role in the process of oncogenic transformation. The induction of calpain-dependent proteolytic cleavage following v-Src activation appears to be selective for FAK, since other known calpain substrates within focal adhesions, such as paxillin, talin, or Src itself do not undergo calpain-dependent processing during v-Src transformation (results not shown). Although the detailed regulation of calpain-mediated FAK cleavage induced by v-Src remains to be elucidated, we have found that calpain II protein levels are modulated during transformation. In addition, calpain-induced cleavage of FAK may be linked to specific tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK that leads to complex dissociation, perhaps releasing FAK and permitting its cleavage by calpain. Previous studies demonstrate that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and the NR2 subunits of NMDA receptors influences the ability of these proteins to be cleaved by calpain (49Huang C. Tandon N.N. Greco N.J. Ni Y. Wang T. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19248-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 50Bi R. Rong Y. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Baudry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26477-26483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that v-Src-dependent phosphorylation of FAK may influence the suitability of FAK to act as a substrate for calpain. We are currently investigating the mechanism by which Src activity controls calpain II protein levels and the influence phosphorylation of specific FAK residues has on its ability to be cleaved by calpain. FAK cleavage mediated by the caspase family of cysteine proteases has previously been demonstrated in T lymphocytes and endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis (25Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Treatment of v-Src-expressing CEF with inhibitors against a broad spectrum of caspase family members (ZVAD-FMK) had no effect on FAK cleavage or morphological transformation. In contrast, FAK cleavage in serum-starved Rat-1 fibroblasts induced to detach and undergo apoptosis after switching off v-Src activity is suppressed by caspase inhibitors, whereas calpain inhibitors had no effect. These data lead us to conclude that proteolysis of FAK is a general phenomenon associated with focal adhesion disassembly but can be mediated by distinct proteases under different biological Src-regulated processes: caspases during apoptosis and calpain (most likely calpain II) during tyrosine kinase-induced cell transformation. From the data presented in this report, we propose that calpain- and caspase-mediated proteolysis of FAK are important mechanisms for regulating focal adhesion integrity in both viable and apoptotic cells, respectively. During v-Src transformation of CEF, calpain-dependent cleavage of FAK precedes disassembly of the focal adhesion complex and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to a loss of substrate anchorage and increased motility. This implicates calpain as a major effector in the process of v-Src-induced oncogenic transformation and Src-dependent cell migration. A recent study examining the expression of calpain I in human renal cell carcinomas demonstrated significantly higher levels of calpain I expression in tumors that presented evidence of metastases to peripheral lymph nodes relative to low expression levels in tumors that apparently had not metastasized (51Braun C. Engel M. Seifert M. Theisinger B. Seitz G. Zang K.D. Welter C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 84: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This study together with our own data suggests that calpain family proteases could mediate disassembly of focal adhesions and loss of substrate anchorage that may contribute to tumor cell motility and invasion. Targeting the inhibition of calpain activity in transformed cells may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the prevention of tumor invasion and metastases. We are grateful to John Wyke for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2045088907,"The Escherichia coli mazEF system is a chromosomal “addiction module” that, under starvation conditions in which guanosine-3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) is produced, is responsible for programmed cell death. This module specifies for the toxic stable protein MazF and the labile antitoxic protein MazE. Upstream from the mazEF module are two promoters, P2 and P3 that are strongly negatively autoregulated by MazE and MazF. We show that the expression of this module is positively regulated by the factor for inversion stimulation. What seems to be responsible for the negative autoregulation of mazEF is an unusual DNA structure, which we have called an “alternating palindrome.” The middle part, “a,” of this structure may complement either the downstream fragment, “b,” or the upstream fragment, “c”. When the MazE·MazF complex binds either of these arms of the alternating palindrome, strong negative autoregulation results. We suggest that the combined presence of the two promoters, the alternating palindrome structure and the factor for inversion stimulation-binding site, all permit the expression of the mazEF module to be sensitively regulated under various growth conditions.

What seems to be responsible for the negative autoregulation of mazEF is an unusual DNA structure, which we have called an “alternating palindrome.” The middle part, “a,” of this structure may complement either the downstream fragment, “b,” or the upstream fragment, “c”. When the MazE·MazF complex binds either of these arms of the alternating palindrome, strong negative autoregulation results. We suggest that the combined presence of the two promoters, the alternating palindrome structure and the factor for inversion stimulation-binding site, all permit the expression of the mazEF module to be sensitively regulated under various growth conditions. base pair(s) factor for inversion stimulation polymerase chain reaction isopropyl-1-thio-βd-galactopyranoside In Escherichia coli programmed cell death is mediated through unique genetic elements called “addiction modules.” These consist of two genes, where the second gene specifies for a stable toxin, and the first gene specifies for a labile antitoxin. Addiction modules were first discovered in a number of extra-chromosomal elements where they were found to be responsible for the post-segregational killing effect, that is, the death of cells from which these extra-chromosomal elements have been removed. In other words, these cells are “addicted” to the continuous presence of a labile antitoxic element. Among the best studied addiction modules of this kind are ccdAB borne on factor F, pemIK borne on plasmid R100, and phd-doc borne on bacteriophage P1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Couturier M. Bahassi el-M.

For example, such modules as ccdAB of the F factor (5de Feyter R. Wallace C. Lane D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Tam J.E. Kline B.C. J.

Magnuson and Yarmolinsky (11Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the autoregulation of addiction modules might prevent fluctuations in the levels of the antidote and the toxin that would result in the activation of the toxin. During autoregulation, both the toxin and the antidote bind to a palindrome sequence in their own promoter region thereby decreasing their own transcription. In a few cases, the binding of antitoxin by itself resulted in a low level of autoregulation; the concomitant binding of the toxic element increased the level of binding (8Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Berzal-Herranz A. Gerdes K. Diaz-Orejas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2685-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In more complicated cases, as has been found for the pemIK (9Tsuchimoto S. Ohtsubo E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) andphd-doc (11Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) modules, the promoter region of addiction module contains two separate palindrome sequences. Based on the stoichiometry and dynamics of binding, Magnuson and Yarmolinsky (11Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a model in which the palindrome sequence binds the antidote dimer independently but cannot bind the toxin. When the toxin interacts with the antidote it increases the binding affinity of the antidote to the palindrome sequence, and thus increases half-life of the complex. Pairs of genes homologous to some of the extra-chromosomal addiction modules have also been found on the E. coli chromosome (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 13Gotfredsen M. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Masuda Y. Miyakawa K.

As we have reported previously, the E. coli mazEFsystem is the first known regulatable prokaryotic chromosomal addiction module (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This system consists of the two genes, mazE andmazF, that are located in the rel operon downstream from the relA gene (16Metzger S. Dror I.B. Aizenman E. Schreiber G. Toone M. Friesen J.D. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15699-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) that themazEF gene pair has all the properties required for an addiction module. MazF is toxic and long lived, while MazE is antitoxic and short lived. MazE and MazF are coexpressed and they interact. In addition, the mazEF system has a unique property: its expression is regulated by guanosine-3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp), which is synthesized by the RelA protein under conditions of amino acid starvation (17Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.Z. Vinella D. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Furthermore, overproduction of ppGpp inducesmazEF-mediated cell death (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 18Engelberg-Kulka H. Reches M. Narasimhan S. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Klemes Y. Aizenman E. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15481-15486Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that the mazEF module may be responsible for programmed cell death under conditions of nutrient starvation (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Here we studied the regulation of the expression of themazEF system. The promoter region of the chromosomally bornemazEF addiction module is partially homologous to that of the promoter of the pemIK plasmid borne addiction module (14Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoters of both modules contain similar palindrome sequences, although, like the promoter of the phd-doc module (11Magnuson R. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6342-6351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the pemIK promoter includes two separated palindromes (9Tsuchimoto S. Ohtsubo E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the mazEF promoter was found to include only one (14Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since pemIK is autoregulated, Masuda and colleagues (14Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesized that mazEF might also be autoregulated. Results of our previous in vitro work (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) revealed that the chromosomal addiction module mazEF can be expressed from two promoters, P2 and P3, which are located 13 bp1 apart. In in vivo studies, we found that, P2, the upstream promoter, was active in exponentially growing cells. Here we showed that the in vivo activity of the P3 promoter is only one-tenth of that of the P2 promoter. We found that the mazEF system is weakly autoregulated by the antitoxic component MazE, and efficiently autoregulated by the combined action of the antitoxic component MazE and the toxic component MazF. In this respect, the chromosomal promoter of the mazEFsystem is regulated as are most of the previously studied promoters of extra-chromosomal addiction modules. However, the mazEFpromoter has two unique properties: it has an unusual DNA structure that we call an “alternating palindrome,” and it carries a binding site for the factor for inversion stimulation (FIS). In the following discussion, we shall consider the relevance to mazEFregulation of these two sites. The media used were LB broth or LB agar (Bio 101, Inc.) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at the following final concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, or 20 μg/ml tetracycline. The bacterial strains used in this work are listed in TableI. The bacterial strain MC4100 and its derivatives bearing either the mazEF null allele or afis − allele were constructed by P1 transduction using strains bearing corresponding mutations as we have described previously (12Aizenman E.

Open table in a new tab Using appropriate DNA primers (EE-1 and EF-2 for mazE gene, or EE-1 and FG-1 for mazEF genes, see Table II), we synthesized PCR fragments bearing the open reading frame of the mazE or the mazEF genes. These PCR products were used for cloning the corresponding genes under thetac promoter present on the expression vector pKK223-3. We called the resulting plasmids pKK-mazE and pKK-mazEF (Table I). We also cloned these PCR fragments into the modified pSK10Δ6 compatible plasmid pLex1 that bears the IPTG inducible promoter ptac (20Diederich L. Roth A. Messer W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 916-923PubMed Google Scholar). We could not use the plasmids of the pKK set for testing the influence of MazE and MazF proteins on their promoter because both pKK223-3 and pSK10Δ6 are derivatives of the plasmid pBR322 and they are not compatible. Using pLex1 as our parent plasmid, we constructed the plasmids pLex-mazE and pLex-mazEF by introducing the promoter ptac, the chloramphenicol resistance gene, the p15A replication origin, and either mazE or mazEF such that they were under control of the ptac promoter. We used these plasmids to study the influence of the proteins MazE and MazE-MazF on themazEF promoter when it was present on the pSK10Δ6-pef plasmid. With the exception of the wild type N99 strain, we made crude cell extracts of all E. coli strains mentioned in Table I. We grew all of the strains at 37 °C to A 6000.2 in LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. We transformed strain MC4100ΔmazEF with plasmids pKK-mazE or pKK-mazEF. We induced the expression of the genes cloned under the ptac promoter by adding 1 mm IPTG, and then allowing growth to continue for 1 more hour. No plasmids were added to the control bacteria that were also grown to A 600 0.2. Cells were harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol at pH 8.0. The amount of protein in the samples was estimated by use of the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Dialyzed supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Proteins expressed either from the ptac promoter bearing plasmid pKK223 or from the chromosome of E. colistrain MC4100 were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing and native gels and by Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against MazE (Fig. 1, A and C) and MazF (Fig. 1 B). As a control, we tested the proteins expressed from the chromosome of MC4100ΔmazEF. As we found previously (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), we also found here that MazE and MazF interact directly. We observed no bands of the proteins from the cell extracts of the addiction modulemazEF expressed from the cell chromosome, presumably because under such conditions these proteins were expressed at very low physiological concentrations. When both MazE and MazF were present on native gels, we observed a complex between the toxin and its antidote (indicated by an arrow on the Fig. 1 C). We used these crude protein extracts to study the influence of MazE and MazF on their own promoter. DNA fragments for the gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprint analysis were obtained by PCR with appropriate primers (TableII) and purified with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Short fragments (about 20–30 bp) were obtained by slow annealing of complementary primers in the presence of 100 mm NaCl and 1 mmEDTA. The primers that were used are listed in Table II. The fragments obtained were end labeled by polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on the Sephadex G-50 columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 80: 7010-7013Google Scholar) using the Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ten-microgram samples of crude protein extracts were diluted with the binding buffer (0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol) to a final volume of 10 μl. To inactivate the nucleases, the samples were then heated at 65 °C for 3 min. When the mixtures had cooled to room temperature, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 μl of labeled DNA fragments were added. The binding reactions were conducted at room temperature for 10 min, after which they were loaded onto 6% native polyacrylamide gels and run in TAE buffer (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) at 200 V. DNase I footprinting analyses were done according to Giladi et al. (23Giladi H. Koby S. Gottesman M.E. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were done according to Miller (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Crude cellular extract of E. coliMC4100ΔmazEF strain was loaded on Sephadex G-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 75 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with binding buffer, and supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl to prevent unspecific adsorption. The column was initially calibrated with standard proteins having established molecular weights. Collected fractions were analyzed by the gel mobility shift assay. RNA extraction was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Primer extension experiments were carried out with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to Gafny and colleagues (25Gafny R. Hyman H.C. Razin S. Glaser G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer used for the pSK10Δ6-pef construct and its mutant derivatives was “−40 M13 forward” (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from the lacZ gene to the transcription start sites of themazEF promoter. The primer was end labeled as a DNA fragments (see above). Reaction products were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel. A DNA sequencing reaction was performed with the same primer and run on the gel parallel to the primer extension reaction. To quantify the RNA levels, the gels were analyzed and the bands were quantified using the Fujix BAS100 PhosphorImager. Point mutations were introduced into mazEF promoter region by PCR-based site-directed overlap extension mutagenesis (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar) using appropriate primers (Table II). All introduced mutational changes were verified by DNA sequence determination. Like most addiction modules, sequence analysis of the promoter region ofmazEF suggests that it is autoregulated at the transcriptional level (15Masuda Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5861-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether mazEF was indeed autoregulated we chose lac'Z as a reporter gene and fused it to the mazEF promoter region, where the beginning ofmazE is fused to the eighth codon of lacZ. We introduced this gene fusion into plasmid pSK10Δ6-pef. We used pSK10Δ6-pef to transform the MC4100ΔmazEF strain and then measured the cellular levels of β-galactosidase (Fig. 2 A). Under optimal growth conditions at A 600 0.2–0.3, we found cellular levels of β-galactosidase around 7000–8000 Miller units. This high level of lac'Z expression suggests that themazEF promoter is very strong, similar to the promoters of other addiction modules that have been studied (5de Feyter R. Wallace C. Lane D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Berzal-Herranz A. Gerdes K. Diaz-Orejas R. Mol.

Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Strain MC4100ΔmazEF, already harboring pSK10Δ6-pef, was transformed with the compatible plasmids pLex-mazE or pLex-mazEF in which themazE or mazEF genes were under control of the IPTG inducible tac promoter. The levels of β-galactosidase activity were measured at mid-log phase. Inducing plasmid pLex-mazE to produce MazE led to moderate inhibition (about 40%) of mazEF promoter activity, as reflected by the reduction in β-galactosidase activity; however, inducing pLex-mazEF to produce both MazE and MazF led to a much higher level (up to 90%) of inhibition (Fig. 2 A). Using Western blot analysis, we found increased cellular levels of protein MazE when plasmid pLex-mazE was induced, and similarly, increased cellular levels of MazE and MazF when pLex-mazEFwas induced (data not shown). Thus, the activity of mazEFpromoter is about five times more inhibited by the combination of MazE and MazF then by MazE alone. To verify that the regulation of the mazEF promoter took place at the transcriptional level, we performed a series of primer extension experiments using plasmid pSK10Δ6-pef as the template. Using RNA extracted from cells carrying this plasmid, we estimated the relative efficiency of transcription from the two promoters P2 and P3 (Fig. 2 B). Transcription initiated from promoter P3 was about 10-fold weaker then that from P2, located 13 bp upstream (Fig.2 B). This explains why we were unable to observe initiation from P3 by primer extension on RNA transcribed from a chromosome borne mazEF module, which is present in only one copy per cell (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Primer extension experiments under the same experimental conditions revealed that induction by IPTG led to repression of transcription from both P2 and P3 by MazE or by the MazE·MazF complex. Twenty minutes after induction, MazE repressed P2expression by 53% compared with the activity of the unrepressed promoter; MazE·MazF complex repressed P2 by 92% (Fig. 2,B and C). We believe that these two promoters are inhibited similarly; however, after repression, the levels of the P3 transcript may have been so low that we could not measure them (Fig. 2 B). These results from our primer extension experiments (Fig. 1,B and C) confirmed the data that we obtained in our assays for β-galactosidase activity (Fig.2 A). Thus, we concluded that the mazEF addiction module is autoregulated at the transcriptional level. To further investigate the mechanism of the action of MazE-MazF on the promoters, we studied how MazE and MazF bind to the promoter region of the mazEFmodule (see map in Fig. 3 A). As the source of proteins for these assays we used crude cell extracts enriched for either MazE or MazE and MazF (Fig. 1). For our electrophoretic mobility shift assay we used the 74-bp fragment of themazEF promoter that extends from the multi-linker to the residue +2 of the P2 promoter (Fig. 3 A). This DNA fragment was labeled and exposed to every one of the cell extracts that we had prepared (defined in the legend to Fig. 1). We found that the mazEF promoter was bound by the MazE·MazF complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), confirming our hypothesis that mazEF is negatively autoregulated (Fig. 2). The crude extract containing only MazE but lacking MazF also bound the promoter fragment (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). Although MazE was present in approximately equal amounts when by itself or in the presence of MazF, here the shift was much weaker (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 3 and4). Thus, MazE could bind to its own promoter, but, like the antidotes from most other addiction modules of plasmid origin, the binding affinity of MazE to its promoter was very low. The cooperative binding of the toxic protein, here MazF, greatly enhanced the binding of MazE"

Although there is clear evidence that the transcription factor NF-κB plays a central role in inducible IL-8 transcription, very little is known about the cis-elements and trans-acting factors involved in silencing of the IL-8 promoter. By sequence comparison with the interferon-β promoter, we found a negative regulatory element (NRE) in the IL-8 promoter overlapping partially with the NF-κB response element. Here we show that an NF-κB-repressing factor (NRF) binds to the IL-8 promoter NF-κB-NRE. Reduction of cellular NRF by expressing NRF antisense RNA results in spontaneous IL-8 gene expression. In contrast, IL-1-induced IL-8 secretion is strongly impaired by expressing NRF antisense RNA. Mutation of the NRE site results in loss of NRF binding and increased basal IL-8 transcription. On the other hand IL-1-induced IL-8 transcription is decreased by mutating the NRE. These data provide evidence for a dual role of the NRF in IL-8 transcription. Although in the absence of stimulation it is involved in transcriptional silencing, in IL-1-induced cells it is required for full induction of the IL-8 promoter.

The regulation of IL-8 by IL-1 is of particular pathophysiological importance, because blockade of IL-1 receptors by application of the IL-1 receptor antagonist consistently reduces tissue neutrophilia in a variety of disease models presumably by preventing IL-1-induced synthesis of IL-8 and related chemokines (13Dinarello C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As chemokine gene expression is tightly regulated, understanding the underlying molecular basis of this control is likely to yield novel insight into the pathology of inflammation and may result, ultimately, in development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs. In that respect the dimeric transcription factor NF-κB has emerged as a key molecule in the transcriptional regulation of genes relevant to inflammation (14Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar), including chemokines such as IL-8 (15Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is controlled at multiple levels. First, extracellular signals activate the recently identified inhibitor of NF-κB kinase complex that induces phosphorylation-dependent proteolytic degradation of IκB proteins and allows translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus (16Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Second, transcriptional activity of NF-κB is potentiated by inducible phosphorylation (17Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol.

Recombination signal sequence-binding protein Jκ (RBP-Jκ) constitutively binds to NF-κB sites in the IL-6 and NF-κB 2 (p100/p52) promoters and represses basal transcription (28Oswald F. Liptay S.

Upon induction RBP is displaced by NF-κB, relieving transcriptional repression. Nuclear hormone receptors physically interact with NF-κB in the absence of DNA (31Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby interfere with inducible IL-6 (32DeBosscher K. Schmitz M.L. VandenBerghe W. Plaisance S. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The zinc finger protein A20 represses tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB-dependent IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) gene expression by a cytosolic pathway (34Heyninck K. DeValck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a sequence spanning the nucleotides −1 to −133 within the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene is essential and sufficient for transcriptional induction of the gene by most stimuli including IL-1 (15Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This region contains a single NF-κB element that is required for activation in all cell types studied, as well as an AP-1 and a C/EBP site (15Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 35Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of immune stimulation, this promoter fragment is transcriptionally silent (15Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,36Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This suggests that it may be under negative transcriptional control. In a search for potential repressory mechanisms of IL-8 transcription, we found a sequence within the IL-8 promoter that showed high homology with a regulatory element of the IFN-β promoter. This 16-base pair sequence spans the decameric binding site for NF-κB which overlaps with a previously characterized negative regulatorycis- element (NRE). The NRE is required for position-independent silencing of the NF-κB site of the IFN-β promoter (37Nourbakhsh M. Hoffmann K. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A protein called NF-κB-repressing factor (NRF) was cloned recently which specifically binds to this site (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NRF represses basal IFN-β transcription but, although permanently bound to the promoter, is not required for virus-induced IFN-β gene expression (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we report a second gene, interleukin-8, whose basal expression is controlled by NRF. Furthermore, we provide evidence that by binding to the NRE of the IL-8 promoter, NRF plays an additional role and acts as a coactivator of IL-1-induced IL-8 gene expression. HeLa cells stably transfected with the plasmid pUHD15-1 expressing the tet transactivator protein were obtained from H. Bujard and used throughout this study (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum. E64 (trans- epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and all other chemicals were from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Hartmann Analytics.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of J. Saklatvala. Antibodies directed against NRF were raised in rabbits immunized against five different peptides based on the antigenic index of the NRF protein sequence (aa 25–45, 175–191, 256–272, 272–288, and 364–382). Antibodies 12CA5 directed against hemagglutinin (HA) and 9E10 againstc-MYC epitopes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies against NF-κB p65 (sc-372) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Protein A-, G-, and GSH-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human recombinant IL-1-αa was produced as described (40Finch A. Holland P. Cooper J.A. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for GST-JUN (amino acids 1–135) was a kind gift of J. R. Woodgett. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by standard methods. Plasmid pMCL-HAMKK1R4F, encoding constitutively active MKK1 (ΔN3/S218E/S222D), was a kind gift of N. G. Ahn. Plasmids pFC-MEKK1 encoding amino acids 360–672 of MEKK1 and pSV-β-galactosidase were from Stratagene and Promega, respectively. PcDL-SRα-HATAK1 and pEFTAB1 were from E. Nishida and J. Ninomiya-Tsuji, respectively. Plasmids pCS3MT-MKK73E(Ser-271, Thr-275, and Ser-277 mutated to Glu), peVHA-MKK62E (Ser-207 and Thr-211 mutated to Glu), peVHA-JNK2, and the IL-8 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid pUHC13–3-IL-8pr (nucleotides 1348–1527 of the IL-8 gene) have been described (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids p65 NF-κB, pNRFVP16, pDBDVP16, pNRF, and pGFPNRF have been described (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCS3MT-NRF encodes for N-terminally MYC-tagged NRF. The tet-off expression plasmids pTBC-NRF and pTBC-ΔNRFas contained the full-length NRF coding region or nucleotides 1–300 of the coding region in antisense orientation, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of NRE and NF-κB sites was performed using the oligonucleotides described in Fig. 1. The AP-1 mutant of the IL-8 promoter plasmid has been described elsewhere (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). All mutations described above were introduced using the Quick ChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer sequences used for polymerase chain reaction are available upon request. Sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing on an ABI 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method exactly as described (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For determination of reporter gene activity, cells were lysed in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.8), containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2,5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. After 15 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and β-galactosidase activity was measured with reagents from CLONTECH. Luciferase activity was determined using reagents from Promega and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended and pelleted in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and freshly added 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 300 μmPMSF, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm DTT, 400 nmokadaic acid). The pellet was resuspended in buffer A + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and left on ice for 10 min and then vortexed. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, supernatants were taken as cytosolic extracts. Pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β -glycerophosphate, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 300 μm PMSF, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm DTT, 400 nm okadaic acid). After 1 h on ice nuclear extracts were vortexed and cleared at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and supernatants collected. Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford and samples stored at −80 °C. Cell extract protein (100–250 μg) from cells transfected with indicated plasmids was diluted in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100). Samples were incubated for 3 h with 2 μl of antibody SAK9 to which 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added subsequently. Beads were spun down, washed 3× in 1 ml of IP buffer, and resuspended in 10 μl of IP buffer. Then 10 μl of GST-JUN (1 μg) and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mmMgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added. After 30 min at room temperature, assays were stopped and proteins eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer(8% SDS, 100 mmTris, pH 6.8, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 24% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the IL-8 promoter sequences shown in Fig. 1 were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by gel filtration on S-200 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed with 5–20 μg of nuclear extract protein, labeled oligonucleotide, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) dried low-fat milk, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 10 μl. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For NRF supershifts the five α-NRF antisera were mixed, and 1–2 μl of this mixture or of the corresponding preimmune sera were added at the beginning of the binding reaction. HeLa tTA cells were transfected with 5 μg of pTBC, pTBC-NRF, or pTBCΔNRFas, 10 μg of high molecular weight DNA, and 0.5 μg of pSV2PAC encoding the puromycin acetyltransferase gene as described (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected and maintained in 4.2 μg/ml puromycin and 500 μg/ml G418 in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. More than 100 clones were pooled and tested for IL-8 and NRF expression. Tetracycline was removed for 48 h to induce NRF sense or antisense mRNA. Cells were then stimulated where indicated with 24 ng/ml IL-1α or with Sendai virus (10 plaque-forming units/ml) or left untreated. After 18 h, the supernatants of HeLa-tTA cells were tested for IL-8 expression or cells were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments. Northern blots were performed as described (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 42Krause A. Holtmann H. Eickemeier S. Winzen R. Szamel M.

Western blots were performed as described (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The endogenous NRF protein was detected by immunoprecipitation using an equal mix of polyclonal antibodies directed against aa 256–272 and 272–288. Following immunoprecipitation, cleared extracts were analyzed by Western blot using a mix of polyclonal antibodies directed against aa 25–45, 175–191, and 364–382 of NRF. This procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). IL-8 protein concentrations in the cell culture medium were determined using the human IL-8 duo set kit (R & D Systems) exactly following the manufacturer's instructions. Although the IL-8 and IFN-β promoters differ in most of their known positive regulatory elements, sequence comparison revealed one highly homologous region (Fig. 1). Therefore, we carried out experiments to examine a putative role of the NRE and NRF in IL-8 promoter regulation. Initially, we explored the role of the NRE in basal and IL-1-induced regulation of IL-8 transcription using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 180-base pair fragment of the IL-8 promoter. Parallel experiments were carried out with wild type (wt) promoter or versions mutated in the NF-κB and NRE sites (Fig. 1). The NRE mutant IL-8 promoter contained two point mutations immediately adjacent to the NF-κB site, which were previously found to inactivate the NRE (37Nourbakhsh M. Hoffmann K. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, three distinct mutations within the NF-κB-binding site were introduced as reported by others (36Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to create an inactive NF-κB-binding site. The wt IL-8 promoter displays a low transcriptional activity, which is somewhat lower when the NF-κB-binding site is mutated. Mutation of the NRE leads to a low but significant activation of the reporter (Fig.2 A). This is consistent with the role of the NRE in repression of basal transcription as previously observed for the IFN-β gene (37Nourbakhsh M. Hoffmann K. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). IL-1 treatment of cells transfected with the wild type IL-8 promoter resulted in more than 80-fold induction of promoter activity. This was strongly reduced by mutating the NF-κB site. Surprisingly, mutating the NRE also resulted in a more than 3-fold reduction of IL-1-stimulated promoter activity (Fig.2 A). To analyze further the requirement of the NRE site for inducible IL-8 transcription, we tested if any of the known signaling pathways triggered by IL-1 target the NRE. IL-1 induces NF-κB-dependent genes through the protein kinases MEKK1 (43Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or TAK1 (44Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252256Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cotransfected the IL-8 promoter reporter gene together with a constitutively active form of MEKK1 or of TAK1 together with its coactivator TAB1 (44Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252256Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). This results in strong induction of the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 2 B). Mutation of the NRE reduced MEKK1- and TAK1-mediated IL-8 transcription by more than 70% (Fig. 2 B). Since MEKK1 and TAK1 activate NF-κB as well as MAP kinase signaling cascades, we further delineated the involvement of individual MAPK pathways for NRE-dependent IL-8 transcription. A significant activation of the IL-8 promoter, although lower than with MEKK1 and TAK1, was observed by selective activation of the ERK or p38 MAPK pathways. This was achieved by transfecting the constitutively active forms of MKK6 and MKK1, MKK62E (41Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and MKK1R4F (47Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), respectively. However, this induction of the IL-8 promoter was not affected by the NRE mutation (Fig.2 B). Thus ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are unlikely to contribute to IL-1-, MEKK1-, and TAK1-mediated NRE-dependent IL-8 transcription. These results suggest that the NRE is also required for transcriptional induction by stimuli that activate NF-κB, namely IL-1, MEKK1, and TAK1. It was thus necessary to characterize the role of protein(s) binding to the NRE in IL-8 gene expression. Since the NRE in the IFN-β promoter represents the binding site for NRF (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we examined if NRF binds to the IL-8 promoter. The minimal IL-8 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was cotransfected with an effector plasmid encoding an NRF-VP16 fusion protein. This fusion protein was shown to convert the NRF protein to a transcriptional activator (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the IL-8 reporter was inducible by the simultaneous expression of the NRF-VP16 fusion protein demonstrating the ability of the fusion protein to bind to the IL-8 promoter. DNA binding of NRF to the IFN-β NRE requires amino acids 296–388 of its C-terminal end (38Nourbakhsh M. Hauser H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This part of the NRF protein is also sufficient to recognize the IL-8 promoter, as the DBDNRF-VP16 fusion protein stimulated the IL-8 reporter to a similar extent as NRF-VP16. As a control, coexpression of an empty eukaryotic expression plasmid had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the IL-8 reporter. The IL-8 promoter NRE site overlaps with the NF-κB site (Fig. 1). NF-κB binding is crucial for inducible transcription of IL-8. We therefore examined if the impaired induction of the IL-8 promoter NRE mutant (Fig. 2, A and B) was caused by a loss of p65 NF-κB binding to the IL-8 promoter. We investigated the formation of IL-1-inducible complexes between proteins and IL-8 promoter DNA by EMSA. As shown in Fig.3, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated for 30 min with IL-1 formed two complexes (I and II), which were absent in untreated cells. The appearance of two IL-1-inducible complexes binding to the IL-8 promoter is consistent with the results of others (36Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 49Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell.

Both complexes contained p65 NF-κB as detected by supershifts (Fig. 3). This indicates that p65 is the major NF-κB subunit binding to the induced IL-8 promoter. This is explained by the fact that the IL-8 promoter NF-κB site lacks the first G of the NF-κB consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC, resulting in preferential binding of p65 NF-κB over other REL proteins to this DNA element as determined by crystallographic studies (48Chen Y.-Q. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the presence of an NRE mutant oligonucleotide, both IL-1-inducible complexes I and II were formed and were supershifted with the anti-p65 antibodies, indicating that p65 NF-κB binding to the IL-8 p"

The principal receptor mediating the physiological actions of NO is the cGMP-synthesizing enzyme, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Exposure to NO increases the sGC catalytic activity up to several hundred-fold (3Gerzer R. Hofmann F. Schultz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 5Humbert P.

Cornwell T.L. Komalavilas P. Boerth N. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 149-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (7Juilfs D.M. Soderling S. Burns F. Beavo J.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 67-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (8Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to bring about the various biological effects. Since the purification of sGC in the late 1970s, much knowledge of the structure and the mechanism of activation of the enzyme by NO has accrued (9Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The enzyme is an αβ-heterodimer with a prosthetic heme group, the NO binding site, attached to the β-subunit. Somewhat unexpectedly by comparison with analogous receptors, sGC exhibits limited molecular heterogeneity; only 2 α- and 2 β-subunits have been identified, and only 2 isoforms have so far been found to exist at the protein level as follows: α1β1, which is widespread, and α2β1, which is found in human placenta (10Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The two isoforms appear to have similar functional and pharmacological properties (10Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As with any other signaling molecule, knowledge of the kinetic properties of the receptor is a prerequisite for understanding how the signals are decoded. When studied in tissue homogenates or in its purified form, sGC exhibits simple Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics. Consequently, in the presence of NO, excess substrate (GTP), and cofactor (Mg2+), sGC synthesizes cGMP at a constant rate over long periods, more in the manner of a “housekeeping” enzyme than a receptor. However, our recent investigation (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) of how sGC behaves within its natural cellular environment suggested a very different profile of activity; within seconds of adding NO, the enzyme underwent rapid desensitization to reach a steady-state level of activity that was 10–15% of the peak. Other kinetic properties of sGC were also different in the cells compared with those of the purified enzyme, notably the potency of NO and the rate at which the enzyme deactivated following removal of NO. The precision of this previous study was handicapped by the poor temporal resolution of the method used (simple manual pipetting), and so much of the information had to be extracted from the data by mathematical deconvolution techniques. Furthermore, the values of key kinetic parameters were not disclosed because they were too fast to be measured. To address these deficiencies, we have devised a method for investigating second messenger responses in cells on a sub-second time scale. The aim was to determine the kinetic constants for sGC activation, deactivation, and desensitization, and so obtain the first quantitative description of NO-stimulated sGC activity in a physiologically relevant setting. Cerebellar cell suspensions were prepared from 8- to 9-day-old rats as described previously (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and were incubated at a concentration of 20 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C. From at least 1 h before use, the NO synthase inhibitorl-nitroarginine (100 μm) was included to prevent possible complications arising from endogenous NO production. Aliquots (200 μl) of the cells were added to a glass vessel (V005; QMx Laboratories, Essex, UK) and preincubated for 5–10 min with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil citrate (100 μm). This concentration is sufficient to inhibit completely phosphodiesterase activity in these cells at the cGMP levels achieved in the present experiments (12Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The vessel was placed in the rapid-quenching apparatus (Fig. 1) after addition of the UV-sensitive compound potassium ruthenium nitrosyl pentachloride (13Murphy K.P. Williams J.H. Bettache N. Bliss T.V. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as “caged-NO,” to the suspension. The apparatus (Fig. 1 a) consists of a perspex module, with a central port surrounded by a water jacket at 37 °C. The glass vessel sits within the port, over a photodiode (OSD15-E visible light enhanced; RS Components, Northants, UK). Above the vessel, a XF-10 xenon flash lamp (Hi-Tech Scientific; Salisbury, UK) fitted with a UG11 filter (peak transmission 320 nm) was mounted at a distance of ∼15 cm from the bottom of the vessel. The focal point for the lamp was only 2.5 cm so that, on flashing, the cell suspension was exposed to an unfocused pulse of UV light. Just above the vessel, either one or two glass pipettes (tip internal diameter ∼ 350–400 μm), formed with an electrode puller, were positioned obliquely with micromanipulators. These pipettes were attached to a Picospritzer (Picospritzer IID, General Valve Corp.). The principle of the machine is simple; at a predetermined time after uncaging NO with an UV flash (intensity, 200 V, duration 1 ms), a volume (20 μl) of 3 m trichloroacetic acid is expelled from the pipette under pressure (50 pounds/square inch, 10-ms pulse duration) and mixes with the cell suspension (final trichloroacetic acid concentration = 0.3 m), denaturing the cells and therefore quenching the cGMP accumulation. The photolysis time of the caged-NO is <1 ms (13Murphy K.P. Williams J.H. Bettache N. Bliss T.V. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and estimated quenching time is <3 ms (14Barman T.E. Gutfreund H. Chance B. Eisenhart R.H. Gibson Q.H. Lonberg-Holm K.K. Rapid Mixing and Sampling Techniques in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1964: 339-344Crossref Google Scholar). The triggering of the flash lamp and Picospritzer is coordinated by a Master 8 voltage step generator (Intracel Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK). The vessel was then removed from the apparatus, and the sample was neutralized with an equal volume of 1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane:tri-n-octylamine (4:1 v/v), mixed thoroughly and spun at 2500 × g for 10 min. The upper (aqueous) layer was removed and its cGMP content measured by radioimmunoassay. To evaluate the method in terms of speed and thoroughness of mixing, 20 μl of India ink was injected into 200 μl of incubation buffer. The resulting change in light intensity was registered as a change in potential difference (P.D.) across the photodiode (response time 12 ns). The P.D. was monitored with an oscilloscope and captured on computer. The mean change in P.D. with time is illustrated in Fig.1 b. There was a 15-ms delay from triggering of the Picospritzer to onset of mixing (presumably attributable to the time taken for the propagation of the pressure pulse). The subsequent total mixing time was ∼5 ms. In the data presented, all time points take the 15-ms lag into consideration (i.e. they represent the time of onset of mixing). In experiments aimed at determining the rate of sGC deactivation, a second pipette was used to inject either incubation buffer (for control cells) or hemoglobin (final concentration 100 μm) to scavenge NO. With this excess of Hb over NO, free NO would disappear with a half-time of less than 50 μs (15Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently quenched with trichloroacetic acid at fixed intervals. The data are presented as means ± S.E. for 3–4 independent samples at each time point in each experiment. For identifying cGMP accumulating cells by immunocytochemistry, paraformaldehyde was injected in place of trichloroacetic acid, to give a final concentration of 4%. The samples were allowed to fix for 15 min, and they were then processed as described previously (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), except that the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was present in the mounting medium to illustrate the total cell number in a given field. Slides were viewed with a confocal microscope (TCS SP; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). To estimate the concentration of NO achieved following flash photolysis, the method of Murphy et al. (13Murphy K.P. Williams J.H. Bettache N. Bliss T.V. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was adapted. Caged-ATP (ATP, P31,-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester, disodium salt) was added to 200 μl of freeze-fractured cells, which had been boiled for 20 min, sonicated, and vortex-mixed. Following flash photolysis, the samples were kept on ice, and the ATP was assayed (in subdued light) by the firefly luciferase method (“ATP-lite-M” kit, Packard Instrument Co.). Un-flashed samples were assayed as a control, and the values were deducted from the total ATP in the samples, to give the concentration of uncaged ATP. As the caged-ATP and caged-NO compounds have nearly identical absorption spectra in the range of filtered flash lamp wavelengths, the amount of uncaged NO can be deduced from the relative quantum efficiencies of the cages, which is 0.08 (13Murphy K.P. Williams J.H. Bettache N. Bliss T.V. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). With the above protocol, 2.96% of ATP was uncaged per flash, indicating that 0.237% of NO would be uncaged. This value was used for estimating the NO concentrations achieved in the experiments. Potassium ruthenium nitrosyl pentachloride and ATP, P31,-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester (disodium salt) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands);l-nitroarginine was from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK); sildenafil citrate was supplied by the Chemistry Division, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research. All other special chemicals were from Sigma. The purpose-built rapid quenching apparatus (Fig.1 and “Experimental Procedures”) allowed the termination of cGMP accumulations in the cell suspensions with a mixing time of ∼5 ms and quenching time <3 ms. In applying the technique to the measurement of sGC kinetics, therefore, an operational limit of 20-ms intervals between data points was imposed. Because the experimental material was a cell suspension containing different cell types, it was important in the first instance to identify the cells generating cGMP in response to NO over the time scales used for subsequent biochemical measurements. Previous immunocytochemical studies with the cell suspension had shown that the cGMP accumulations were restricted to a subpopulation of cells, the astrocytes, regardless of whether the cells were exposed to NO for 10 s or 2 min (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, given that certain cells (e.g. human platelets) exhibit a transient cGMP signal (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,16Salvemini D. Radziszewski W. Korbut R. Vane J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it was important to ascertain whether any other cell types in our preparation were making a significant contribution with sub-second exposures to NO. To address this, paraformaldehyde was injected into the cell suspension (final concentration, 4%) to fix the cells 100 ms to 1 s after uncaging NO (from 30 μm caged-NO). The samples were then double-stained for the astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and for cGMP. In control cells, only the occasional cell stained for cGMP, and such cells were also GFAP-positive (Fig. 2, a andb). After 100 ms of exposure to NO, additional cGMP-positive cells were present, although the staining was relatively weak. Again, cGMP immunoreactivity could not be identified in cells that were not GFAP-positive (Fig. 2, c and d). The same result applied when the NO exposures were 500 ms (Fig. 2, e andf) or 1 s (Fig. 2, g and h), although the cGMP staining became increasingly intense. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that no cell types other than astrocytes were contributing significantly to the measured cGMP elevations. The levels of cGMP were measured in cells quenched at different times following flash photolysis of a concentration (30 μm) of caged-NO that was maximally effective when assessed at 1- or 10-s time points (see below for concentration-response relationships). The most detailed time course (Fig. 3 a) covered 0–400 ms, and this included measurements made every 20 ms for the first 200 ms. Over this period, the rate of cGMP accumulation appeared roughly linear; the first time point at which cGMP was significantly higher than the basal level was 40 ms (p = 0.001 by Student'st test). No lag in the onset of cGMP accumulation following liberation of NO could be discerned. Over the first 400 ms of sGC activity (Fig. 3 a), there was no clear deviation from linearity in the rate of cGMP accumulation, but over a 1-s time course (Fig. 3 b) the rate became noticeably nonlinear, an effect that became increasingly evident over a 10-s time course (Fig.3 c). Since the experiments were done under conditions where degradation of cGMP was abolished (see “Experimental Procedures”) the progressive fall in the rate of cGMP accumulation reflects the progressive desensitization of sGC activity. To describe the cGMP accumulation with time, the data from the different time courses were combined into a single progress curve. This was rendered feasible without having to resort to a normalization procedure because of the small inter-experiment variation in the absolute values of the cGMP responses obtained using this technique. The combined data could be adequately fit by a single exponential function, having a time constant (τ) of 6.9 s for sGC desensitization; this fit is overlaid on all the data sets in Fig. 3, a–c (solid line). Whereas the single exponential provided a reasonable approximation of the time course as a whole, in no experiment did the line pass through the starting cGMP level (Fig. 3 a). In fact, all 9 individual cGMP measurements at this time point fell below the line, indicating a significant misfit (p < 0.05 by sign test), which suggests that there may initially be an additional fast component to desensitization. The inclusion of a second early exponential (68 ms time constant) provides a fit to the starting data (not shown). Deactivation refers to the cessation of sGC activity after the agonist is removed. To investigate the rate of deactivation, NO was liberated (30 μm caged-NO) and cGMP accumulation allowed to proceed for 400 ms. A high concentration of Hb (100 μm) was then added to scavenge the NO in the bathing medium (scavenging would be achieved in well under 1 ms). As a check, Hb was injected 20 ms before the UV pulse, and the usual cGMP accumulation was eliminated (data not shown). The inability of Hb to penetrate the cells means that the protein cannot directly influence sGC, and so the rate at which cGMP accumulation levels off (phosphodiesterase activity being inhibited) corresponds to the rate of deactivation of sGC. Control cells, which received an equivalent injection of buffer after 400 ms, continued to accumulate cGMP as normal (Fig. 4, cf. Fig. 3). On adding Hb, there was a rapid reduction in the rate of cGMP accumulation such that the first time point examined (50 ms later) was significantly less than control (p < 0.05 by Student's t test). By about 600 ms, cGMP was stable (Fig.4). The overall time course could be fit by an exponential function corresponding to a deactivation rate constant of 3.7 s−1. This must be regarded as a purely operational description, however, as the starting gradient of the fitted exponential (at 400 ms) was less than that of the control, implying that the true kinetics of deactivation is more complex and may involve an initial fast phase. Concentration-response relationships for NO activation of sGC were assessed using different concentrations of caged-NO and different periods of exposure to the liberated NO. At the first time point examined (100 ms after photolysis), cGMP increased in a simple sigmoidal manner with logarithmic increases in caged-NO concentration, the EC50 being about 20 μm and the maximum being reached at 100 μm (Fig.5, a and b). The corresponding concentrations of released NO, estimated by comparing the quantum efficiency of the caged-NO and caged-ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”), are 47 and 240 nm. When examined after 1 s stimulation, and more so after 10 s stimulation, however, the concentration-response curves became bell-shaped. Moreover, at both time points, the maximum response occurred at the lower concentration of 30 μm (71 nm NO) and the EC50was, accordingly, left-shifted to about 10 μm (24 nm NO). These changes in the concentration-response curves with time are what would be predicted for agonist-induced desensitization (17Raman I.M. Trussell L.O. Neuron. 1992; 9: 173-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Paternain A.V. Rodriguez-Moreno A. Villarroel A. Lerma J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such an effect is well illustrated by the progressive decline in the rate of cGMP accumulation over the interval 100 ms to 1 s relative to the initial rate (0–100 ms) as the NO concentration is raised (Fig. 5 c). Accordingly, the potency of NO at the earliest time point (100 ms) should correspond to that at which sGC desensitization exerts the least influence. The variation in this initial rate of cGMP formation with NO concentration (estimated) could be adequately fit by a standard Hill plot, which showed an EC50 for NO of 45 nm (Fig. 5 c, inset). To examine quantitatively how the rate of desensitization is influenced by agonist concentration, the time course of cGMP accumulation over 10 s at a high concentration of caged-NO (300 μm; 710 nm NO) was examined in more detail. As predicted, the rate of cGMP accumulation at the higher concentration was slower, indicating an enhanced rate of desensitization (Fig. 5 d). An exponential fit to the data indicated a shortening of the time constant for desensitization from 6.9 to 5.4 s. The development of a new method for rapid quenching of cell suspensions has enabled cGMP responses in cerebellar cells to be satisfactorily resolved on a sub-second time scale. The major factor limiting the time resolution of the method is the mixing time (5 ms). In principle, the approach can be applied to any cell type that can be kept in suspension, although it could be adapted easily for studying cells adhering to a solid surface, e.g. cells cultured on coverslips. Rapid changes in the levels of a variety of metabolites, second messengers, etc. could be measured. The apparatus is fairly inexpensive and relatively simple to construct and use, and it allows highly reproducible results from one day to another. Initially, attempts were made to use a classical, commercially available, quench flow device, as used previously for measurements of cyclic nucleotides in olfactory cilia (19Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, in practice, the quench flow apparatus was found to have several disadvantages. For example, the time ranges permissible within a given experiment are limited, relatively large volumes of cell suspensions are needed, and the cells tend to settle out within the apparatus, causing variation in the numbers sampled. Furthermore, whereas small structures such as olfactory cilia may survive well, the forcing of whole cells under pressure through narrow-bore tubing creates potential problems associated with shear stresses (which vary in magnitude and duration with reaction time). With the present technique, the absolute values for cGMP in cells exposed to NO are closely similar to those reported previously from the use of simpler methods (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), suggesting the new method does not compromise the functional properties of the cells. The primary aim was to obtain quantitative information on the kinetics of sGC activation, deactivation, and desensitization, and the results are summarized in schematic form in Fig.6 a. A model analogous to ones developed to describe the binding and gating of neurotransmitter receptors (20Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) is depicted in Fig. 6 b. The activation kinetics (predicted to be second order) was too rapid to be resolved even with a 20-ms sampling time (at 30 μmcaged-NO). No delay between uncaging of NO and the start of cGMP synthesis was detectable, although the data could accommodate a lag of a few milliseconds. This lack of detectable delay also applied to lower NO concentrations (see Fig. 5 c). From studies of purified sGC (21Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 23Sharma V.S. Magde D. Methods. 1999; 19: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), there appears to be general agreement that the NO-free state of sGC heme is a 5-coordinate ferrous (Fe2+) center, with a proximal bond to the histidine residue at position 105 of the β-subunit. Binding of NO, creating the 6-coordinate form of the enzyme, is extremely rapid (near diffusion limited) and is followed by a transition to the catalytically active 5-coordinate species as a result of cleavage of the histidine bond (Fig. 6 b). This step is considered to be rate-limiting. One report has concluded that the 6- to 5-coordinate transition is NO concentration-dependent in that at sub-stoichiometric levels of NO there is a pronounced lag in onset of catalytic activity (at 4 °C), which decreases at higher levels of NO (22Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as evidence for a second (nonheme) NO-binding site. With NO in excess over sGC, the lag was around 100 ms, and this would presumably be much less at physiological temperatures. Another report (21Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) indicated that the transition occurred exponentially with a rate constant of 38 s−1 (half-time = 18 ms) at 15 °C. One assumes that the half-time would reduce to a few milliseconds at 37 °C. Consequently, there is no indication from our data that the kinetics of activation of sGC determined using the purified enzyme in an artificial environment is not applicable to the enzyme inside cells. The rate of deactivation, however, represents one parameter where there is a major divergence between the behavior of purified and cellular sGC. For reasons that are unclear, there is disagreement between different laboratories on the rate of deactivation of the purified enzyme. Kharitonov et al. (24Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using Hb or myoglobin to remove NO estimated the half-life for loss of NO from nitrosyl-sGC was 2 min at 37 °C. When substrate (GTP) and cofactor (Mg2+) were included, however, the half-life was greatly accelerated to an estimated 5 s at 37 °C. Brandish et al. (25Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), in contrast, obtained a 2.5–3-min half-life (at 37 °C) irrespective of the presence of GTP and Mg2+. Margulis and Sitaramayya (26Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), on the other hand, reported from sGC activity measurements (with GTP and Mg2+ present) a deactivation half-time of 18 s (20 °C), extrapolated to 5 s at 37 °C. Our experiments indicate that sGC deactivation in cells at 37 °C is much faster and does not occur in a kinetically straightforward manner. The data could be described operationally as an exponential decline, with a rate constant of 3.7 s−1. Strictly speaking, this constant describes the rate at which sGC catalytic activity declines to zero, and this may not just reflect deactivation if progressive desensitization also contributes to the decline in sGC activity. In this case, the rate constant for deactivation would be the measured rate constant (k = 3.7 s−1) minus the rate constant for desensitization (k = 0.14 s−1) over the 600-ms period, giving a slightly lower value of 3.56 s−1. This correction, however, makes the assumption that desensitization would proceed as normal after removal of free NO. As NO appears to contribute to desensitization (see below), this assumption may not be valid. Consequently, we favor an operational constant of 3.7 s−1 as a description of the slowest rate at which sGC deactivate"

In addition to its function as an extracellular matrix organizer, it has the ability to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor, and it forms complexes with various isoforms of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Decorin is expressed during skeletal muscle differentiation and is up-regulated in dystrophic muscle. In this study we investigated the role of decorin in TGF-β−dependent inhibition of myogenesis. To probe the function of decorin during myogenesis, C2C12 myoblasts were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing antisense decorin mRNA. The resulting inhibition of decorin expression led to the expression of myogenin, a master transcription factor for muscle differentiation, under growth conditions and accelerated skeletal muscle differentiation as determined by the expression of creatine kinase. In contrast myogenin expression was inhibited by adenovirally induced decorin expression or by adding exogenous decorin. Reduced synthesis of decorin resulted in a 7-fold decreased sensitivity to TGF-β−mediated inhibition of myogenin expression. In contrast, adenovirally induced decorin expression in wild type cells resulted in a 5-fold increased sensitivity to TGF-β−mediated inhibition of myogenin expression. Transfection studies with the TGF-β-dependent promoter of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 coupled with luciferase revealed that the transducing receptors for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were involved in the different responses of wild type and antisense decorin myoblasts. These results demonstrate that a reduction of decorin expression or of decorin availability results in a decreased responsiveness to TGF-β. These findings strongly suggest a new role for decorin during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation by activating TGF-β-dependent signaling pathways.

Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) governs these processes. One of the factors responsible for the induction of terminal differentiation is myogenin, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family that activates skeletal muscle-specific products such as creatine kinase, myosin heavy chain, acetylcholine receptor, etc. (3Ludolph D.C.

Terminal differentiation is critical as well during skeletal muscle formation as during muscle regeneration after injury (5Grounds M.D. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1999; 12: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The onset and progression of this process are controlled by a complex set of interactions between myoblasts and their environment. The presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 is essential for normal myogenesis (6Hauschka S.D. Konigsberg I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Melo F. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Saitoh O. Periasamy M.

The ability of myoblasts to differentiate is controlled in a negative manner by the extracellular concentration of specific mitogens, such as FGF-2, HGF/SF, and TGF-β (10Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J.

In the presence of these inhibitory growth factors, myoblasts continue to proliferate and fail to fuse or to express muscle-specific gene products. Conversely, the reduction in the concentration of these growth factors below a critical level results in cell culture experiments in an irreversible arrest in the G0 phase and in terminal differentiation. It has been demonstrated that the activities of FGF-2, HGF/SF, and TGF-β can be regulated by binding to proteoglycans (14Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 15Olwin B.B. Rapraeger A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in particular, have been suggested to play a role in modulating the activities of heparin-binding growth factors (16Carey D.J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). They modulate terminal myogenesis probably by acting as low affinity receptors for some growth factors such as FGF-2 (18Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HGF/SF (19Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the constitutive expression of syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan whose expression is down-regulated during terminal skeletal muscle differentiation, inhibits the differentiation of myoblasts in culture (20Larraı́n J.

Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32288-32296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, abolishing the expression of syndecan-3, which is another heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by myoblasts, results in an acceleration of skeletal muscle differentiation by a mechanism being dependent on FGF-2, too (22Fuentealba L. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37876-37884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Decorin is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans gene family, which consists of a core protein and a single covalently linked glycosaminoglycan chain (23Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Decorin binds several types of collagen in vivo, among them being types I, II, and VI, and promotes fibril stability. By interacting with ECM molecules like fibronectin and thrombospondin it influences cell adhesion. Additionally, at least in some types of cells, decorin activates the epidermal growth factor receptor, thereby triggering a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, to the induction of p21, and to growth suppression (24Moscatello D.K.

Great attention has been given to the observation that its core protein interacts with TGF-β (26Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Med. 1996; 2: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). There are independent binding sites of decorin core protein for TGF-β and type I collagen (30Schönherr E. Broszat M. Brandan E. Bruckner P. Kresse H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Affinity measurements of the interaction between decorin and TGF-β indicate the presence of at least two sites withK d values of 1–20 and 20–200 nm for the high and low affinity binding sites, respectively (31Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The biological consequences of the interaction between decorin and TGF-β are still a matter of debate. In analogy to the curative effect of blocking antibodies against TGF-β on the course of the anti-Thy-1-induced glomerulonephritis (32Border W.A. Noble N.A. Yamamoto T. Harper J.R. Yamaguchi Y. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1992; 26: 361-364Crossref Scopus (924) Google Scholar), the beneficial effect of decorin in the same disease model has been interpreted as the consequence of the inactivation of the cytokine by the proteoglycan. The reversal of TGF-β-mediated effects in this and other disease models by decorin gene transfer (27Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas P.J. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Am. J.

Med. 1996; 2: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) supported this conclusion. On the other hand, the addition of decorin to osteoblasts resulted in an increased biological activity of TGF-β (33Takeuchi Y. Kodama Y. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32634-32638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise mechanism whereby decorin modulates TGF-β activity remains to be elucidated. In skeletal muscle decorin is found mainly in the perimysium (34Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The synthesis and expression of decorin is up-regulated during skeletal muscle differentiation (35Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the synthesis of decorin is also augmented in dystrophic mdx mouse skeletal muscle (36Caceres S. Cuellar C. Casar J.C. Garrido J. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Brandan E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the function of decorin during muscle differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with an expression plasmid containing antisense decorin cDNA. Suppression of decorin production was accompanied with accelerated terminal differentiation and with a significant decrease in the sensitivity to TGF-β-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. It will be shown that this inhibition is mediated directly by interfering with the signaling cascade triggered upon binding of TGF-β to its transducing receptors. These findings demonstrate that the responsiveness of myoblasts to TGF-β, an inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation, is directly modulated by decorin expression.

The formed lattice was cultured on myoblasts monolayers for different period of time. C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 6000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes in growth medium. 24 h later the cells were transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid pCMVneo containing a 1372-bp cDNA insert containing the full-length mouse decorin sequence, in the antisense orientation, kindly donated by Dr. Renato Iozzo, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia. The complete insert and a pCMVneo plasmid were digested with Eco RI to generate the pCMVneo-decorin recombinant plasmid; positive clones were selected by ampicillin resistance, and the orientation of the insert was determined by polymerase chain reaction; the antisense orientation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Control cells were transfected with pCMVneo containing no insert. For transfections, 40 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μg of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 600 μl of Opti-MEM I were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 6 h at 37 °C, FCS and CEE were added to final concentrations of 10 and 0.5%, respectively, and the cells were incubated overnight. The next day the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and cultured in normal growth medium. Medium was supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml) after 3 days. After 2–3 weeks colonies were selected using cloning rings. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using Trizol. RNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membranes, and hybridized with probes for creatine kinase, myogenin, MyoD, and tubulin as described previously (20Larraı́n J.

Blots were hybridized with random primed labeled probes in a hybridization buffer at 65 °C. Hybridized membranes were washed twice at 65 °C and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. For quantitative determination of the mRNA levels the intensity of the hybridization signals were measured by densitometric scanning (epson scanning densitometer). Conditioned media from wild type and antisense decorin transfected cells, obtained after metabolic labeling during 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate, were fractionated on a DEAE-Sephacel column (0.5 ml of resin) pre-equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7,5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.2–1.0 m) at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fraction of 1.0 ml were collected, and radioactivity and conductivity were determined. Pooled fractions containing radioactive proteoglycans were then chromatographed on an analytical Sepharose CL-4B column (100 x 1 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Samples (0.5 ml) were applied to the column together with prefractionated dextran blue (2000) and phenol red to mark void and total volumes, respectively. Columns were eluted at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/h, and effluent fractions of 0.8 ml were collected and aliquots counted for radioactivity. Selected fractions obtained from the Sepharose CL-4B column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (41Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larraı́n J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of secreted labeled decorin followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography were carried out as described previously (42Schönherr E. Beavan L.A. Hausser H. Kresse H. Culp L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Treatment of purified decorin with chondroitinase ABC was performed as described previously (41Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larraı́n J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). For immunostaining cells were grown on coverslips for 72 h. For staining of decorin the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. They were then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking unspecific binding sites with Blotto they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies diluted in blotto. The coverslips were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Immunostaining of fibronectin, biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican, and perlecan was carried out as described previously (7Melo F. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Larraı́n J. Alvarez J. Hassell J.R. Brandan E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Myoblasts and myoblasts induced to differentiate for the indicated days were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 25 °C, and harvested by scraping. Creatine kinase activity was determined using the creatine phosphokinase assay kit. All data points represent the means of duplicate determinations from two independent experiments. Transfections with decorin adenoviral constructs or insert-free adenoviral preparations were performed as described previously (38Schönherr E. O'Connell B.C. Schittny J. Robenek H. Fastermann D. Fisher L.W. Plenz G. Vischer P. Young M.F. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells, which had been plated the day before (6000 cells/cm2 in 25 cm2 flasks), were treated with 7.5 × 107 plaque-forming units of adenovirus containing the decorin sequence or with control virus in 1.3 ml/25 cm2 flask of Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium/F-12 containing 2% heat-inactivated FCS. After 90 min of incubation 4 ml of standard medium/25-cm2flask was added and incubation continued for an additional period of 23 h. Subsequently, the medium was changed for fresh medium, and the cells were grown for RNA analysis for 2 days. For transfection with pMYOLuc and pRL, cells were plated at a density of 8000 cells/cm2 in six-well plates for 48 h and transfected for 6 h using Opti-MEM I containing 5 μg of pMyoLuc and 0.01 μg of pRL DNA and 12 μg of LipofectaMINE. Following transfection, 10% FCS and 0.5% CEE were added to the medium, and the cells were cultured for a further 14 h. Cells were then trypsinized and plated in 24-well plates in normal growth medium. Under these conditions, decorin or TGF-β1 was added at the indicated concentrations. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for dual luciferase activity. For transfection with TGFβ-inducible luciferase reporter construct (3TP-Lux), the cells were plated in growth medium 1 day before transfection at a density of 8000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm plates. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 6 h in Opti-MEM I containing 2 μg of reporter plasmid (3TP-Lux), 2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid and 15 μg of LipofectAMINE. After transfection the cells were incubated for 14 h in Opti-MEM I containing 10% FCS and 0.5% CEE. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 2 days in growth medium followed by 1 day in differentiation medium or 30 h in differentiation medium containing TGF-β1, TGF-β2 (0–1.0 ng/ml), or FGF-2 (0–30 ng/ml). The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase (37Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activities (39Larraı́n J. Alvarez J. Hassell J.R. Brandan E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as a control of the transfection among different plates. All transfections were performed at least three times. DNA (43Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar) and protein (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) were determined in aliquots of cell extracts as described. Skeletal muscle myoblasts up-regulate decorin during differentiation (35Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). Because decorin binds TGF−β, a strong inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation, we reasoned that the down-regulation of decorin expression would affect skeletal muscle differentiation by modulating TGF-β activity. To test this hypothesis C2C12 myoblasts were stably transfected with a plasmid containing full-length decorin cDNA in the antisense orientation or with the control vector. Of the nine clones showing reduced [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans, two were chosen for more detailed studies. Myoblasts were labeled with [35S]sulfate followed by chromatographic analysis of the conditioned media on a Sepharose CL-4B column. Fig.1 A shows that both antisense clones, A4 and A6, synthesized significantly lower levels of sulfated proteoglycan compared with wild type cells. The specificity of the effect on decorin synthesis is shown in Fig.1 B. SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography of three selected fractions obtained after the Sepharose CL-4B chromatography showed that in contrast to wild type cells, the antisense clones A4 and A6 did not synthesize detectable amounts of decorin. Decorin migrates like anM r 100,000∼110,000 protein during SDS-PAGE (34Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicated by a bracket in Fig. 1 B; this material can completely be degraded by chondroitinase ABC (data not shown). On the contrary, the synthesis of cell surface proteoglycans, composed mainly of heparan sulfate-containing species, was unchanged compared with wild type cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 C shows that there is no change in the synthesis of proteins by antisense clone compared with wild type cells. To further confirm the decreased synthesis of decorin in the antisense-transfected cells, antibodies against decorin were used to stain myoblast cultures. Fig.2 shows that decorin was readily detectable in control transfected cells (35Brandan E. Fuentes M.E. Andrade W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 55: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar), whereas significantly lower levels were seen in the antisense clones. As a control measure, the localization of biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican, fibronectin, and perlecan was also assessed in control and transfected myoblasts and was found to indicate no changes in localization. Taken together, these results show unequivocally that stable clones with strongly reduced decorin expression were obtained by transfection with antisense decorin cDNA. To evaluate whether the diminished synthesis of decorin in the antisense clones had any effect on skeletal muscle differentiation, the expression of myogenin, a master regulatory gene of skeletal muscle differentiation, was determined. Total RNA was isolated from antisense clones and wild type cells and analyzed by Northern blotting, during growth and differentiation conditions. Fig.3 A shows that in contrast to wild-type cells, myogenin was expressed in both antisense clones already under growth conditions. However, MyoD, a transcription factor involved in skeletal muscle commitment, was not up-regulated by decorin suppression (Fig. 3 B), and the expression of myogenin in the transfected clones was further augmented upon triggering muscle differentiation for 30 h."

However, the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif remains unknown and needs to be further determined. In this report, we show that, like many other proteins encoded by HIV-1, Vif proteins possess a strong tendency toward self-association. In relatively native conditions, Vif proteins formed multimers in vitro, including dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Through in vivo binding assays such as coimmunoprecipitation and the mammalian two-hybrid system, we also demonstrated that Vif proteins could interact with each other within a cell, indicating that the multimerization of Vif proteins is not simply due to fortuitous aggregation. Further studies indicated that the domain affecting Vif self-association is located at the C terminus of this protein, especially the proline-enriched 151–164 region. Moreover, we found that a Vif mutant with deletion at amino acid 151–164 was unable to rescue the infectivity ofvif-defective viruses generated from H9 T-cells, suggesting that the multimerization of Vif proteins could be important for Vif function in the viral life cycle.

Malim M.H. Science. 1998; 280: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Vif affects the late stages of the viral life cycle, possibly through the assembly of viral particles (2Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blanc D. Patience C. Schulz T.F. Weiss R. Spire B.

The vif-defective (vif−) viruses are able to penetrate into target cells but not accomplish reverse transcription (4von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Courcoul M. Patience C. Rey F. Blanc D. Harmache A. Sire J. Vigne R. Spire B. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2594-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The requirement for Vif, however, is cell type-specific. Thevif− viruses exhibit a negative phenotype only when produced from primary T-lymphocytes, terminally differentiated macrophages, or a few T-lymphoid cell lines, such as H9. These cells were entitled as “nonpermissive” cells. In some T-cell lines such as SupT1, C8166, and other non-T-cells such as HelaCD4 cells, however, productive replication of vif− HIV-1 viruses can be achieved. These cell lines therefore were named as “permissive” cells (2Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gabuzda D.H. Li H. Lawrence K. Vasir B.S. Crawford K. Langhoff E. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1994; 7: 908-915PubMed Google Scholar). There are two possibilities for Vif function in the nonpermissive cells; Vif may counteract an endogenous inhibitor existing in the nonpermissive cells or alternatively, substitute a Vif homologue that exists in the permissive cells but not nonpermissive cells (9Trono D. Cell. 1995; 82: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that the permissive HelaCD4 cells expressing the HIV-1F12 Vif were resistant to the replication of wild-type HIV-1, suggesting that there may be a Vif homologue in the permissive cells that was inhibited by HIV-1F12 Vif (10D'Aloja P. Olivetta E. Bona R. Nappi F. Pedacchia D. Pugliese K. Ferrari G. Verani P. Federico M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4308-4319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the progeny viruses generated from the heterokayons that were formed between permissive and nonpermissive cells showed a phenotype similar to that generated from the nonpermissive cells. This result suggested that nonpermissive cells, most likely the natural targets of HIV-1, contain a potent endogenous inhibitor of HIV-1 replication that is counteracted by Vif (11Simon J.H. Gaddis N.C. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 12Madani N. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10251-10255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of endogenous inhibitor and the molecular mechanism(s) regarding how Vif interacts with it remain unknown. Recently, it has been shown that Vif is associated with a complex in the virus-producing cells (13Simon J.H. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that Vif of HIV-1 interacts with the NCp7 domain of p55 Gag precursorin vitro through its positively charged amino acid-enriched C terminus and colocalizes with Gag precursors in a cell, no direct interaction was observed between Vif and Gag precursors (13Simon J.H. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2667-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bouyac M. Courcoul M. Bertoia G. Baudat Y. Gabuzda D. Blanc D. Chazal N. Boulanger P. Sire J.

General Virol. 1998; 79: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that Vif is an RNA binding protein and able to form an RNase-sensitive messenger ribonucleoprotein complex with viral unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm of HIV-1-infected cells. As Vif-RNA binding could be displaced by Gag-RNA binding, Vif may mediate viral RNA engagement with HIV-1 Gag precursors and thus could be involved in genomic RNA folding and packaging (31Zhang H. Pomerantz R.J Dornadula G. Sun Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8252-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate a new biochemical characteristic of Vif protein; Vif proteins have a strong tendency to form multimers, which could play an important role for the Vif function in HIV-1 life cycle. With infectious clone pNL4–3 as template, deletion mutants of HIV-1 Vif were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated and site-directed mutagenesis (17Zhang H. Dornadula G. Alur P. Laughlin M.A. Pomerantz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12519-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The PCR-generated wild-type vif gene and its mutants were then inserted into pCITE-4a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for in vitro translation. The vif gene was also inserted into pGEX vector for in vitro expression and isolation of GST-Vif fusion protein. For studying intracellular Vif-Vif interaction,vif genes were tagged with FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL) epitope-encoding sequences at the 3′ terminus, respectively, via PCR. These tagged vif genes were then inserted into the vector pCI-Neo, which contains a chimeric intron just downstream of the cytomegalovirus enhancer and immediate early promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmids were named pCI-vif-c-Myc or pCI-vif-FLAG, respectively. For mammalian two-hybrid analysis, pGal-Vif or pGal-VifΔ151–164 were constructed by replacing theHin dIII-Bam HI fragment (containing vp gene) of pSG5GalVP with a PCR-amplified complete vif gene or its mutant Δ151–164. The pVif-VP or pVifΔ151–164-VP were constructed by replacing the Eco RI-Bgl II fragment (containing gal4 gene) of pSG5GalVP with a PCR-amplified complete vif gene or its mutant Δ151–164, respectively (18Shimano R. Iida S. Fukumori T. Yamamoto Y. Kawamura M. Furuta R.A. Adachi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 242: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The integrity of all the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The vector pGEX, with or without the vif gene, was transformed into BL21 competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). After growth at 37 °C to ∼0.6 optical density, The expression of GST or GST-Vif proteins were induced by 0.4 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The bacterial cells were lysed by adding lysing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by sonication. The sample was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-conjugated agarose bead (Sigma) column. After batch binding, the matrix was washed by the addition of 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline 3 times. The GST or GST-Vif-conjugated agarose beads were then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Conversely, 35S-labeled Vif or its mutant proteins were synthesized utilizing SPT3 kits (Novagen, Madison, WI). The protocol supplied by manufacturer was followed. Afterin vitro translation, RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) was added to stop the reaction and remove tRNAs and the in vitro transcribed-mRNA. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactive amino acids were quantitated in the presence of a scintillantion mixture. For GST pull-down assays, a GST- or GST-Vif-conjugated bead slurry was mixed with 35S-labeled Vif or its mutants (50,000 cpm) in a binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100). After binding at 4 °C for 1 h, the mixture were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 1 min, and the beads were washed with binding buffer three times. The35S-labeled Vif proteins were dissociated from beads by adding SDS-containing loading buffer, and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were then electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels (15% Tris-HCl ready gel made by Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After treatment with the fixing buffer (10% acetic acid, 10% methanol) and then Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film or quantitatively analyzed utilizing a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyview, CA). Furthermore, in vitro-translated, 35S-labeled Vif (50,000 cpm) was also directly loaded into a 4–20% Tris/glycine gel (SDS-free) via 10% glycerol-containing loading buffer, with SDS at various concentrations, and electrophoresed with an SDS-free Tris/glycine running buffer. After fixing and drying, the gel was directly subjected to autoradiography. The COS-1 or 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCI-vif-c-Myc and pCI-vif-FLAG using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Zhang H. Dornadula G. Alur P. Laughlin M.A. Pomerantz R.J. Proc.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3929-3932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in a cell lysing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). For direct Western blotting, the whole-cell lysates were mixed with acetone (1:3). The mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer. The samples were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels and then electronically transferred onto a nylon/nitrocellulose membrane. The primary antibodies, goat anti-c-Myc antibody (A14) (Research Antibodies, Santa Cruz, CA), or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used to bind the samples, respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Research Antibodies, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as the secondary antibody. A Chemiluminescence-based system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to visualize the antigen-antibody binding. For coimmunoprecipitation, cell lysates from COS-1 or 293T cells expressing Vif-FLAG and/or Vif-c-Myc were incubated with A14 anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) (1 μg/ml) by mixing 12 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional 2 h. The pellet was washed three times with cell lysing buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in SDS-containing buffer, heated at 95 °C, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto a nylon/nitrocellulose membrane, the samples were detected with a mouse M2 anti-FLAG antibody. An horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Research Antibodies, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a secondary antibody. A mammalian two hybrid system, which was modified from the GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid assay, was used to study the self-association of HIV-1 Vif proteins in viv o (18Shimano R. Iida S. Fukumori T.

Briefly, 5 μg of pGal-Vif and pVif-VP were cotransfected with pG5BCAT into COS-1, using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in reporter lysing buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, as described previously (19Zhang H. Duan L.X. Dornadula G. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3929-3932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological activity of Vif mutants was evaluated by using a single-round viral infectivity assay, with some modifications (7Dornadula G. Yang S. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2594-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To generate recombinant HIV-1 viruses, H9 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pNL4–3ΔvifΔenv, pMD.G (containing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope), and wild-type vif gene or its mutants (in pCI-Neo construct) by electroporation (7Dornadula G. Yang S. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2594-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The electroporation (350 V, 250 microfarad, 5.1–6.3 ms) was performed by a gene pulser apparatus and capacitance (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thereafter, conditioned medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum) was used to maintain the transfected H9 cells. Two days after transfection, the viral particles in supernatant were collected and pelleted via ultracentrifugation (7Dornadula G. Yang S. Pomerantz R.J. Zhang H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2594-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After normalization by the HIV-1 p24 antigen level, which was detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (kits from DuPont), the viruses were used to infect 5 × 105 HeLaCD4-CAT cells (22Ciminale V. Felber B.K. Campbell M. Pavlakis G.N. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 48 h post-infection, the cells were lysed in reporter lysing buffer (Promega) and subjected to CAT assays. To examine whether Vif proteins have a tendency toward self-association, GST-Vif was expressed in BL 21 bacterial cells and isolated onto glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. In vitro-translated,35S-labeled Vif proteins were allowed to incubate with the GST-Vif-conjugated beads. The bead-associated 35S-labled Vif was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by direct autoradiography. Fig. 1 A illustrates that GST-Vif (lane 2), but not GST (lane 3), can strongly bind to 35S-labeled, in vitro-translated Vif protein, indicating a Vif-Vif interaction. Further, 35S-labeled, in vitro-translated HIV-1 Vif protein was directly loaded onto a Tris/glycine-native gel (SDS-free) for electrophoresis, with loading buffers containing 10% glycerol only or SDS at various concentrations. At the native or relatively native conditions, the 35S-labeled Vif proteins migrated in the 4–15% Tris/glycine gels as monomers (23 kD), dimers (46 kD), and trimers (69 kD) or tetramers (92 kD) (Fig. 1 B). With the increment of concentrations of SDS in the loading buffer, the major forms of Vif eventually became a monomer (23 kD). When the sample was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, all the multimers of Vif proteins disappeared, suggesting that the Vif-Vif binding is unlikely to be covalent. It is notable that, prior to the sample loading,35S-labeled, in vitro-translated HIV-1 Vif protein was treated with RNase A to remove possible RNA contamination. Therefore, the Vif-Vif binding should be RNA-independent. To determine the binding sites for Vif multimerization, a series of deletions in Vif protein have been generated through PCR-based mutagenesis, followed by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. These Vif mutants were then allowed to bind to GST-Vif fusion protein conjugated to agarose beads. Fig. 2 A indicates that the deletion of the C terminus in Vif protein severely loses the Vif-Vif binding activity. Further studies indicated that deletion at amino acid 151–164 would significantly decrease this binding ability (Fig. 2 A). This result was further confirmed by native multimer formation assay. In the presence of 0.1% SDS, Vif mutants Δ151–192 and Δ151–164 were unable to form multimers, whereas other mutants were able to do so (Fig. 2 B). It is notable that there are several positively charged amino acids in the 151–164 fragment. The mutants that substitute these positively charged amino acids, generated by Goncalves et al. (23Goncalves J. Shi B. Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7196-7204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been examined for this Vif-Vif binding. However, all these mutants still contain Vif-Vif binding ability (data not shown). It is also notable that there are several prolines (Pro156, Pro161, Pro162, and Pro164) in this fragment. Among these prolines, Pro161 is highly conserved in various strains of HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus. Whether these prolines are important for Vif-Vif binding remains to be further verified. To elucidate the possibility that Vif self-association also occurs intracellularly, we utilized a coimmunoprecipitation method. The Vif protein was tagged with c-Myc or FLAG epitope at its C terminus, respectively, and expressed in the COS-1 cells. Fig. 3indicated that the expression of c-Myc-tagged Vif and FLAG-tagged Vif could be detected via Western blotting, with mouse anti-c-Myc epitope antibody or goat anti-FLAG epitope antibody, respectively (top two panels). To study Vif-Vif interaction, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. The goat anti-FLAG antibody was used to detect FLAG-tagged Vif. Fig. 3 demonstrated that the FLAG-tagged Vif was coprecipitated with Myc-tagged Vif when mouse anti-Myc antibody was utilized for the immunoprecipitation, suggesting a Vif-Vif interaction within a cell (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Alternatively, the in vivo Vif-Vif interaction was examined by the mammalian two-hybrid system. A fusion protein composed of VP16 and Gal4 is able to activate the Gal4 response element-contained E1b promoter. Gal4 would function as a DNA binding domain, whereas VP16 will function as a DNA activation domain. HIV-1 Vif protein was allowed to replace VP16 or Gal4 domain, respectively (Fig.4 A). If the interaction between Vif proteins take place, the VP16 and Gal4 domain would be brought together, and the Gal4 binding sequence-contained E1b promoter would be activated. Fig. 4 B indicated that, like Rev-Rev interactions, Vif in Vif-VP16 fusion protein could bind to Vif in the Gal4-Vif fusion protein and activate the expression of CAT (lane 6). As controls, pGal-Vif or pVif-VP alone were unable to activate CAT expression (lanes 3 and 4). Fig.4 B also shows that Vif mutant Δ151–164, which did not have the ability to interact with Vif protein in other systems, also could not interact with Vif in this system (lane 7). As mentioned previously, Vif functions in the late events of HIV-1 life cycle and is required by nonpermissive cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and H9 T-cells (2Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blanc D. Patience C. Schulz T.F. Weiss R. Spire B. Virology. 1993; 193: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological significance of Vif multimerization, we examined whether Vif mutant (Δ151–164), which is unable to form multimers in the cell-free system and within cells, is able to complement Vif function in the viral life cycle. To this end, a single-round viral infectivity assay was adapted. Wild-type Vif or its mutants were expressed in the nonpermissive H9 T-cells. At the same time, pseudotyped (with VSV envelope) HIV-1 viruses, without vif and env in their genome, were generated from these cells. After ultracentrifugation for enrichment, the recombinant viruses were allowed to infect the target cells (HelaCD4-CAT), which harbor an expression cassette containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter-driven CAT gene. The viral infectivity was measured by the level of CAT gene expression in the target cells, which is driven by the HIV-1 Tat protein expressed by the newly synthesized proviruses. Fig. 5 demonstrates that, when the wild-type vif gene was expressed in thevif-defective HIV-1 virus-producing nonpermissive H9 T-cells, the viral infectivity could reach a high level (lane 2). However, when VifΔ151–164 was expressed in thevif-defective HIV-1 virus-producing nonpermissive H9 T-cells, the viral infectivity was almost unaltered (lane 3), compared with the vif-defective HIV-1 viruses (lane 4). These data indicated that the 151–164 deletion severely decreased the function of Vif protein and made it unable to rescue the infectivity of the vif-defective HIV-1 viruses generated from nonpermissive T-cells. It is notable that another group also demonstrated that this fragment is essential for Vif function (24Simon J.H. Sheehy A.M. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2675-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment demonstrated that multimerization of Vif proteins is required for Vif function. Many HIV-1 proteins, including Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase, glycoprotein 41 (gp41), Tat, Rev, Vpr, and Nef, have been shown to form dimers or multimers in vitro and in vivo. The formation of dimers or multimers has been demonstrated to be important for their functions in the lentiviral life cycle (25Frankel A.D. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 26Vaishnav Y.N. Wong-Staal F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 577-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 27Zhao L.J. Wang L.

Schwartz O. Benichou S. Benarous R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5310-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, multimerization is critical to the biological activity of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins and is a common mechanism for the functional activation/inactivation of proteins. In this study, we analyzed the multimerization potential of HIV-1 Vif proteins via various complementary methods. The in vitro-translated, 35S-lableled Vif proteins were able to form multimers in the native environment. Conversely, GST-Vif fusion proteins, rather than GST proteins, which were generated from the bacterial expression system, were able to bind to the in vitro-translated, 35S-lableled Vif proteins. Further, coimmunoprecipitation and a mammalian two hybrid system also demonstrated a Vif-Vif interaction intracellularly. These in vitro and in vivo data strongly support the notion that Vif proteins are able to form multimers. As the deletion of the domain that is essential for the Vif-Vif binding severely decreases the function of Vif in the nonpermissive cells, multimerization of Vif could be important for its function in the HIV-1 life cycle. However, as the function of Vif protein in the life cycle remains largely unknown, the precise role of Vif multimerization and the active form(s) (i.e. monomer, dimer, or tetramer) of Vif protein in the virus-producing cells remains to be determined. The domain for Vif multimerization has been located in a positively charged amino acid- and proline-enriched fragment (amino acid 151–164) (Fig. 2). As the positively charged amino acids in this region are not responsible for the Vif-Vif interaction, whether the prolines are important remains to be clarified. It is notable that a highly conserved motif, SLQYLAL (amino acid 144–150 for HIV-1NL4–3), is close to this domain. It has also been shown that Ser165 is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44/42) of Vif, and this phosphorylation is important for Vif function (30Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29879-29887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As these residues are close to the domain for multimerization, it is possible that the multimerization of Vif proteins is regulated by phosphorylation in the virus-producing cells. Interestingly, the positively charged amino acids (replaced in B4 and B7 mutants) in the C terminus of Vif are responsible for Vif-NCp7 binding in vitro (14Bouyac M. Courcoul M. Bertoia G. Baudat Y. Gabuzda D. Blanc D. Chazal N. Boulanger P. Sire J. Vigne R. Spire B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that HIV-1 Vif is an RNA binding protein and an integral component of a messenger ribonucleoprotein complex of viral RNA in the cytoplasm and could be involved in the viral RNA packaging process (31Zhang H. Pomerantz R.J Dornadula G. Sun Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8252-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to interactions with NCp7 via its C terminus, Vif binds to RNA via its N terminus. Although more RNA would bind to Vif than to Gag at the same conditions when RNA is mixed with Vif or Gag separately, RNA will only bind to Gag but not Vif when Vif protein is mixed together with RNA and NCp7 (31Zhang H. Pomerantz R.J Dornadula G. Sun Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8252-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This “displacement” could be because of various mechanisms and is under investigation. However, as the domains for Vif multimerization and for Vif-NCp7 binding are quite close in location or possibly overlap, it is possible that the interaction between Vif and Gag, as well as the interactions among Vif, RNA, and Gag, is regulated by Vif multimerization. Thus, the finding of Vif multimerization may be helpful in understanding the structure-function relationship of Vif protein, identifying the molecular mechanism(s) of HIV-1 Vif in the viral life cycle. In addition, these data provide a promising intervention target for anti-HIV-1 agent development. We thank Drs. Roger J. Pomerantz, Geethanjali Dornadula, Charvi A. Patel, and Jianhua Fang for critical review of the manuscript and valuable discussions. We also thank Dr. Dana Gabuzda for providing plasmids of Vif C-terminal mutants (B1-B7)."
https://openalex.org/W2001717624,"We cloned a novel mouse cDNA,CORS26 (collagenousrepeat-containing sequence of26-kDa protein), encoding a secretory protein by suppression subtractive hybridization between transforming growth factor-β1-treated and untreated C3H10T1/2 cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of CORS26 consists of 246 amino acids with a secretory signal peptide and contains a collagenous region (Gly-X-Y repeats) at the NH2terminus and a complement factor C1q globular domain at the COOH terminus.

Identifying the genes underlying the induction of chondrocyte differentiation will provide powerful tools for understanding skeletal development. The induction of chondrogenesis has been extensively studied in vitro using primary cells and clonal cell lines from a variety of sources (1Ahrens P.B. Solursh M. Reiters R. Dev.

The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, C3H10T1/2, are multipotential cells and have been induced to undergo differentiation into myocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes under specific culture conditions and treatments (5Taylor S.M.

The frequency of chondrogenic conversion in C3H10T1/2 cells was much lower and irregular compared with other types of conversion (5Taylor S.M. Jones P.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 771-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 8Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), but it was recently reported that the induction of chondrogenesis and the formation of spheroids in C3H10T1/2 cells preferentially occurred when treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)1-β1 (9Denker A.E. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (10Haas A.R. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or a combination of osteoinductive bone proteins (11Atkinson B.L. Fantle K.S. Benedict J.J. Huffer W.E. Gutierrez-Hartman A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in high-density micromass cultures. The formation of the spheroids resembled the condensation of mesenchymal cells seen in precartilage. Thus, C3H10T1/2 cells in high-density micromass cultures are suited for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in skeletal development. In the present study, to help clarify the mechanism for skeletal development, mRNAs expressed in TGF-β1-treated C3H10T1/2 cells were subtracted with those in untreated C3H10T1/2 cells using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique (12Diatchenco L. Lau Y.F.C. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), and we isolated a novel gene, CORS26 (collagenousrepeat-containing sequence of 26-kDa protein). Sequence analysis revealed that CORS26 possesses a collagenous structure at the NH2 terminus and a complement factor C1q globular domain at the COOH terminus. Due to the structural similarity between CORS26 and subunits of complement factor C1q, this novel protein is thought to be a member of the C1q-related protein family. The presence of the signal peptide, plus the hydrophilic nature of CORS26, suggests that CORS26 is a secretory protein. Indeed, the CORS26 protein was secreted from COS-7 cells by transient transfection analysis. CORS26 mRNA is specifically expressed in cartilage and kidney in the adult mouse. Moreover, the expression of this novel gene was observed in cartilage primordium or developing cartilage in embryonal mouse tissues in vivo. Thus, a possible secretory protein encoded by the CORS26 gene may be one of the important signaling molecules produced by prechondrocytic mesenchymal cells or early chondrocytes during skeletal development. The mouse cell line, C3H10T1/2, was obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan), and micromass cultures were performed as described previously (9Denker A.E. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In brief, trypsinized cells were suspended in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at a concentration of 107 cells/ml, and then a 10-μl drop of this cell suspension was placed in the center of a 24-well dish at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were allowed to adhere to the dish for 3 h, and the culture was flooded with 1 ml of medium. After 24-h incubation, 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 was added to the culture medium. Human TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The mouse cell lines, NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1, were also obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank, and BALB/3T3 cells were from Cancer Cell Repository of Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). Messenger RNAs obtained from C3H10T1/2 cells were isolated using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). SSH was performed using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tester cDNA was synthesized from mRNAs of C3H10T1/2 cells treated with TGF-β1 for 6 h, and driver cDNA was from mRNAs of untreated C3H10T1/2 cells. Products from the secondary PCR were cloned into pT7Blue T vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Cloned cDNA inserts were initially evaluated for differential expression by DNA dot-blot analysis. White colonies from a subtractive cDNA library were picked randomly and boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of H2O and then centrifuged. DNA in the supernatant was amplified by PCR using universal vector primer M13 and M13R. The PCR products were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and dot-blotted on Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The membranes were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled tester cDNA as positive and [32P]dCTP-labeled driver cDNA as negative probes, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of candidate positive clones were determined by sequencing, and cDNA inserts were used as probes in Northern blot analysis confirming differential gene expression. Sequencing of cDNA inserts in the vector were performed by the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the M13 vector primers on an ABI 373 automated sequencer. For long cDNA inserts, synthetic oligonucleotides were used as primers. The cDNA sequence was analyzed using sequence analysis software, DNASIS (Hitachi Software Engineering, Yokohama, Japan). Data base homology searches for the cDNA sequence and deduced protein sequences were performed by BLAST programs with the DNA and protein data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Analysis of the primary structure of predicted proteins were performed by the PROSITE motif search program. Total RNA was isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells before and after 6-h treatment with TGF-β1 or mouse rib growth plate cartilage using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Rib growth plate cartilages were obtained from 10-day-old mice. Twenty micrograms each of total RNA was denatured using glyoxal and electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel, then transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and UV-cross-linked onto the membrane. For analysis of CORS26 expression in various normal adult mouse tissues, the Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was purchased. The blotting membrane was incubated in prehybridization solution of 50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate (SSC), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 43 °C for 3 h, and then hybridization was performed using a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment of CORS26 labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) at 43 °C for 16 h. The membrane was washed in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 60 min, and 0.1× SSC at room temperature for 10 min, respectively. The membranes were autoradiographed with Hyper-film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −80 °C. After autoradiography, the membrane was stripped and rehybridized with mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe for internal loading control. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed in both directions using the SMART cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) from mRNA of C3H10T1/2 cells treated with TGF-β1. For the 3′-RACE method, 5′-GGGCCAAAGGTGAGAAAGGA-3′ and 5′-GCCCCCGTATCAGGTGTGTA-3′ were designed as gene-specific primers, and for the 5′-RACE method, 5′-GGCCCCAAATCTCCCAGTCAT-3′ and 5′-GGTCGCCTTTGTCTCCTTTCT-3′ were designed as gene-specific primers. The nested PCR products were subcloned into the pT7Blue T vector and sequenced. The full-length coding sequence of CORS26 was amplified by LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) using primers 5′-CTGTCAAGCTTCCCTGCGAGACTCTT-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCCAGATGGGAGAAAAGTTTAT-3′ from TGF-β1-treated C3H10T1/2 cDNA and cloned directly into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The amplification conditions were 80 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min and a final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. This construct was sequenced for accuracy and was used forin vitro transcription and translation. The TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) was used to transcribe and translate the full-length CORS26 cDNA construct in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five microliters of the products were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was treated with Enlightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried and autoradiographed. Total RNAs isolated from various cell lines were digested with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) at 37 °C for 15 min. Then the denatured 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 5× RT buffer, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm amount of each dNTP, 500 ng of oligo(dT)15 primers, 100 units of RNase inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently heated at 70 °C for 10 min. After the RT reaction, PCR was carried out in a total volume of 25 ml of a mixture containing 1 μl of RT samples, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm amount of each dNTP, 0.4 μm amount of each primer, and 1.0 unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Twenty-five cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (54 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 45 s) were carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primer sequences forCORS26 were 5′-GAAACAATGGGAACAATGGAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGAAGGTGAAGAAATACA-3′. Aliquots (10 μl) of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel, and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. The amplified 300-bp PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. One microgram of recombinant pGEM-T Easy vector containing the 300-bp fragment located at the coding region (nucleotides 305–604) of CORS26 was used as a template. Plasmids were linearized with Spe I to prepare the antisense riboprobe and Nco I to prepare the sense riboprobe.In vitro transcription was performed with35S-UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Unincorporated labels were removed by ethanol precipitation, and the counts/min were determined on a scintillation counter. Embryos were obtained from ICR mice. In situ hybridizations were carried out as described previously (14Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. McMahon A.P. Development (Camb.). 1989; 105: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, mouse embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. The 7-μm-thick sections were pretreated with proteinase K and HCl and acetylated. Hybridization was performed with riboprobes (1 × 105 cpm per slide) at 53 °C overnight. After hybridization, the sections were washed with 5× SSC containing 10 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C for 30 min, SF solution (2× SSC, 50% formamide, and 20 mmdithiothreitol) at 65 °C for 30 min, NTE buffer (0.5 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, and 1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 30 min, treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed with 2× SSC and 0.1× SSC at room temperature. The sections were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, air-dried, coated with NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed for 2–3 weeks. Microphotographs were taken using both light- and dark-field optics. A CORS26 cDNA was tagged with a FLAG epitope at the COOH terminus by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-TTTGCCGAGCCATGCTCGGGAGGC-3′ and 5′-TCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTTAGTTTCAAAGAGCAGAAA-3′. The sequence for a FLAG tag is underlined. The amplification conditions were 80 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and a final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and the insert was excised withEco RI and recloned into the Eco RI site of pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). The orientation and nucleotide sequence of pcDNA3.1/CORS26-FLAG was confirmed by an automated ABI 373 sequencer. The pcDNA3.1/CORS26-FLAG construct was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank) using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A pcDNA3.1(+) vector was transfected in parallel as a negative control. Transfections were performed on cells seeded into six-well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS 24 h before use at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells were typically transfected with 2 μg of DNA, incubated with the DNA suspension for 3 h, and replenished with fresh medium. Then, 48 h after transfection, conditioned medium was collected, and cells were lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). Protein from the conditioned medium was concentrated for 1 h with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The proteins from the medium and cell extracts were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a Trans-Blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500. Immunocomplexes were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A DNA fragment containing a coding region ofCORS26 was inserted into theEco RI-Eco RV sites of pcDNA3.1(+) vector. C3H10T1/2 cells were seeded into 35-mm culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at a density of 3 × 104cells per dish. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of either control pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1/CORS26 using the SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were incubated for 48 h and then trypsinized and seeded at a 1:20 ratio in 100-mm culture dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Sixteen hours later, the cells were switched to a selective medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Promega). After 4 weeks of culture in the selective medium, clonal isolates were expanded, and expression ofCORS26 mRNA was verified by RT-PCR as described above. To analyze the growth of C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CORS26, the transfectants were seeded in 24-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The number of cells were counted with a hemocytometer at the indicated days. To identify genes specifically expressed during skeletal development, the SSH technique was utilized using the mRNA extracted from C3H10T1/2 cells with or without TGF-β1 treatment, and we selected several clones specifically up-regulated by TGF-β1 treatment. We determined the sequence of the isolated partial cDNA clones and carried out homology searches in the GenBankTM using BLAST2. Among all clones that had no significant homology with any known genes in the nucleotide sequence data bases, a 380-bp cDNA clone (clone 129) showed a marked induction by TGF-β1 treatment (Fig.1). We, therefore, focused further analysis on this clone. To obtain a full-length sequence, we carried out the 5′- and 3′-RACE using a TGF-β1-treated C3H10T1/2-derived cDNA. The full nucleic acid sequence obtained (1,879 bp) and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.2. The full length of 1,879 bp obtained was in good agreement with the transcript size of ∼2.0 kb estimated on Northern blots. An open reading frame extends from nucleotide positions 100–837 and encodes a protein of 246 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 26.8 kDa. The first ATG codon (nucleotides 100–102) lies in the context of the Kozak consensus initiation site of the eukaryotic mRNA translation (15Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheCORS26 cDNA contains two consensus polyadenylation signals at nucleotide positions 1,462 and 1,837. Comparison of aCORS26 cDNA sequence to the GenBankTM data base using the BLAST program revealed that there was no significant homology with any known genes. The CORS26 cDNA sequence was submitted to the GenBankTM as a novel gene with accession number AF246265.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of CORS26.

Two separate consensus polyadenylation signals are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The open reading frame predicted a polypeptide sequence of 246 amino acids corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 26.8 kDa with an isoelectric point of 6.2. Indeed, a protein of ∼26 kDa was generated by coupledin vitro transcription and translation of theCORS26 cDNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig.3 A), suggesting that the predicted initiation sequence serves as the start site of the translation. Hydropathy analysis (16Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17166) Google Scholar) revealed that the predicted protein was predominantly hydrophilic, and the signal peptide of 22 amino acid residues and the cleavage site were also predicted at the amino-terminal end on the basis of the rules of von Heijne (17von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). No transmembrane spanning region was predicted. To investigate whether CORS26 protein was secreted from cells, FLAG-taggedCORS26 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. These findings demonstrated that COS-7 cells synthesized the CORS26 protein, and the protein was secreted into the medium (Fig.4). Amino acid sequence analysis of the predicted CORS26 protein using the BLASTp search program revealed that the COOH-terminal globular region of CORS26 was 34, 32, and 30% identical to precerebellin (18Wada C. Ohtani H. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), complement protein C1q-related factor (CRF) (19Berube N.G. Swanson X.H. Bertram M.J. Kittle J.D. Didenko V.

A unique feature of this protein is that the NH2-terminal part contained uninterrupted collagen-like Gly-X-Y repeats (23 repeats) immediately downstream of a short noncollagenous sequence (at amino acids positions 45–113). NH2-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats are known to be found in the complement protein C1q A, B, and C chains (22Petry F. Reid K.B.M. Loos M.

In the COOH-terminal half, CORS26 shares homology with the globular domain of the C1q subunits, precerebellin, Acrp30, CRF, and collagens VIII and X (26Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5).Figure 4Detection of FLAG-tagged CORS26 protein in conditioned medium.

The predicted protein also contained other putative functional sites, phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (at amino acid positions 152–154) and casein kinase II (at amino acid positions 77–80 and 138–141) and several N-myristoylation sites. We examined the expression of CORS26 mRNA in various adult mouse tissues by Northern blot analysis (Fig.6). CORS26 cDNA hybridized to double transcripts of 2.3 and 2.0 kb. The CORS26 mRNA was expressed in rib growth plate cartilage and kidney.CORS26 mRNA was not detected in other tissues. In growth plate cartilage, the hybridization signal at 2.0 kb was stronger than the signal at 2.3 kb, while, in kidney, the signal at 2.3 kb was stronger than the signal at 2.0 kb. The 2.0-kb size of the transcripts agrees approximately with the length of the cloned CORS26 cDNA. By RT-PCR analysis, the expression ofCORS26 mRNA was not detectable in NIH3T3 cells, BALB/3T3 cells, C3H10T1/2 cells, and MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig.7). To examine the expression of CORS26 during embryonic development in vivo, we performed in situ hybridization using embryonal mouse serial sections at 13–15 days p.c. CORS26 transcripts were localized in regions of cartilage primordium of occipital bone and that of the vertebral body of a 13-day-p.c. embryo (Fig. 8,A–C and F–H). In Meckel's cartilage, high levels of CORS26 mRNAs were seen in a 15-day-p.c. embryo (Fig. 8, D and I). In the cartilage primordium of digital bone of a 14-day-p.c. embryo, CORS26 was expressed in prechondrocytes, but not in mature chondrocytes (Fig. 8,E and J). These experiments showed thatCORS26 mRNA was present at relatively high concentrations in precartilaginous primordia and developing cartilages. No specific signal was detected above background levels by sense riboprobes as controls. We generated C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with the mammalian expression vector containing CORS26. The expression of CORS26 mRNA in the transfectant was verified by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). The growth of CORS26 transfectants was significantly enhanced when compared with that of control cells. Moreover, saturation densities of CORS26 transfectants were higher than that of control cells (Fig. 9). During skeletal development, condensation of multipotential mesenchymal cells to differentiate toward the various cell types is an important process. One such process is the formation of chondrocytes from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. It was recently demonstrated that the mouse embryonic mesenchymal cell line, C3H10T1/2, when cultured at high density, is induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation by TGF-β1. C3H10T1/2 cells cultured under this condition form a three-dimensional spheroid structure, and the morphology of the cells in the spheroid resembled that of the cells seen in precartilage condensations (9Denker A.E. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The formation of the spheroid in vitro mimic the condensation event of chondrogenesis in vivo. In the present study, we demonstrated isolation of a novel gene,CORS26, encoding a secretory protein of 246 amino acids using a suppression subtractive hybridization technique between TGF-β1-treated and untreated C3H10T1/2 cells cultured at high density. Sequence analysis reveals that CORS26 protein has a hydrophobic signal peptide at the NH2 terminus and lacks a putative transmembrane domain. The presence of a putative signal peptide suggests that CORS26 enters the secretory pathway. Actually, CORS26 was secreted from COS-7 cells after transient transfection of a FLAG-tagged CORS26 expression vector. The deduced amino acid sequence of CORS26 displays structural similarity to several C1q related proteins, such as C1q A, B, and C chains, Acrp30, and CRF, containing the collagenous repeats (Gly-X-Y) at the NH2 terminus and the globular domain at the COOH terminus. This suggested that CORS26 may belong to the C1q family proteins. C1q family proteins are known to homo- or hetero-oligomerize via the collagenous structures, suggesting that CORS26 might form oligomers with itself or other proteins. The COOH-terminal region of the protein contains three potential phosphorylation sites. Consequently, this molecule is a potential target for protein phosphorylation via protein kinase C and casein kinase II. In addition, a cysteine residue in the globular region of the C1q B and C chains plays an important role in the formation of disulfide bonds with IgG (27Martin H. Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the stabilization of the triplex strands in the collagenous domain (24Petry F. Reid K.B.M. Loos M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues are replaced by other residues in CORS26 similar to Acrp30 and CRF. Recently, it was reported that the crystal structure of Acrp30, a member of the C1q family of proteins, showed homology with that of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family proteins. Moreover, TNFs (28Nedwin G.E. Naylor S.L. Sakaguchi A.Y. Smith D. Jarrett-Nedwin J. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. Gray P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6361-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and C1q proteins have similar gene structure in the globular domains (29Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These similarities suggest an evolutionary link between the C1q-like proteins and TNFs and establish a C1q/TNF molecular superfamily. It has been reported that TNFs have monospecific receptors (TNFRs) (30Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. J. Inflamm. 1995; 47: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Since CORS26 and C1q share significant similarities in the structure of the collagenous domain, which has been shown to be important for ligand-receptor interaction (13Malhotra R. Laursen S.B Willis A.C. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is possible that CORS26 might signal through the TNFRs or TNFR-like receptors. Both Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR analysis showed a unique pattern of gene expression of CORS26 in various tissues and cell lines. CORS26 mRNA expression was found in rib growth plate cartilage and early stages of chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells from which the CORS26 cDNA was isolated. Although the expression level was lower than that in cartilage,CORS26 was also expressed in kidney of adult mice. Indeed, DNA sequence homology searches in the GenBankTM Mouse EST data bases using the BLAST search program revealed that several mouse EST sequences isolated from whole embryo or adult kidney libraries were homologous or identical to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the CORS26 cDNA. These findings from the EST data base are consistent with the tissue distribution of the CORS26 gene. However,CORS26 mRNA was not detected in fibroblastic cell lines and osteoblastic cell lines. The expression of CORS26 in kidney raises the question about its possible role in this tissue, but at present, details are unclear. The basic form of the skeleton are first recognizable when mesenchymal cells aggregate into regions of high cell density called condensations. They subsequently differentiate into cartilage and bone and continue to grow by cell proliferation, maturation, and matrix deposition. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos 13–15 days p.c. showed thatCORS26 was highly expressed in precartilaginous primordia and Meckel's cartilage. In each case, CORS26 transcripts appeared to be localized in condensed prechondrocytic mesenchymal cells or in less mature chondrocytes, whereas the levels of CORS26 mRNA were lower or undetectable in the mature chondrocytes. Furthermore, to test the role of the CORS26 gene in vitro, we generated C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1/CORS26. Since CORS26 mRNA is expressed in condensed prechondrocytic mesenchymal cells in vivo, we examined the effect of the CORS26 gene on cell proliferation. Overexpression of CORS26 enhanced growth of C3H10T1/2 cells and increased saturation densities in vitro. This finding suggested that secreted CORS26 protein acted as a growth factor based on its mitogenic activity on C3H10T1/2 cells. Although the function of CORS26 in vivo is not clear, one possible function is the local regulation of mesenchymal condensation as secreted autocrine/paracrine factors during an early stage of skeletal development. Further analysis of CORS26 will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism in skeletal development."
https://openalex.org/W2078466467,"The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcriptional activator. The transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) binds via its KIX domain to the activation domain of c-Myb and mediates c-Myb-dependent transcriptional activation. CBP possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, and can acetylate not only histones but also certain transcriptional factors such as GATA1 and p53. Here we demonstrate that the C/H2 domain of CBP, which is critical for the acetyltransferase activity, also directly interacts with the negative regulatory domain (NRD) of c-Myb. Consistent with this observation, CBP acetylated c-Myb in vitro at Lys438 and Lys441 within the NRD. In addition, CBP acetylated c-Myb in vivo not only at the sites found in this study but also at the p300-induced acetylation sites reported recently. Replacement of lysine by arginine at all of these sites dramatically decreased thetrans-activating capacity of c-Myb. The results of transcriptional activation assays with c-Myb acetylation site mutants suggested that acetylation of c-Myb at each of these five sites synergistically enhances c-Myb activity. Mutations of these acetylation sites reduced the strength of the interaction between c-Myb and CBP. Thus, acetylation of c-Myb by CBP increases thetrans-activating capacity of c-Myb by enhancing its association with CBP.

The transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb, which is rich in acidic amino acids, is adjacent to the DNA-binding domain. The transcriptional coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) binds to this activation domain to mediate c-Myb-induced transcriptional activation (17Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T.

Deletion of the NRD, located in the carboxyl-proximal portion of the molecule, increases both trans-activation and transformation capacity, implying that this domain normally represses c-Myb activity (10Sakura H.

CBP was originally identified as a coactivator of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CBP acts as a bridging factor between CREB and the general transcription factor TFIIB (24Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

The CBP gene family contains at least one other member, p300, which was originally identified as a protein that binds to the adenovirus E1A protein (26Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCapiro J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Both CBP and p300 bind to the phosphorylated form of CREB and also to E1A (27Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

CBP possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (32Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

The finding that certain TAFs (TBP (TATA-binding protein)-associated factors) are integral components of PCAF and yeast SAGA·HAT complexes further suggests a mechanistic connection between the RNA polymerase II machinery and CBP HAT activities (36Ogryzko V.V.

CBP/p300 acetylates not only histones but also transcription factors. p300 directly acetylates p53 and GATA-1, and enhances their sequence-specific DNA binding activity (38Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition to some sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, CBP also acetylates other types of transcription factors. Drosophila CBP acetylates T-cell factor, a high mobility group domain protein, and this acetylation blocks the interaction between T-cell factor and its coactivator β-catenin/Armadillo (43Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Acetylation of another high mobility group protein, HMG-I, also leads to transcriptional repression of the interferon-β gene promoter (44Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, CBP appears to control transcription by acetylating certain transcription factors through multiple mechanisms. Here, we have identified CBP-induced acetylation sites in the c-Myb protein. Three of the sites correspond to those recently identified as p300-induced acetylation sites, and the two other sites are new. Our results suggest that acetylation of c-Myb at each site synergistically increases the trans-activating capacity of c-Myb. Acetylation of c-Myb enhanced its affinity for CBP, explaining at least partly the mechanism of CBP stimulation of thetrans-activating capacity of c-Myb. The plasmids pGEX-KIX, pGEX-Bromo, pGEX-C/H2, and pGEX-C/H3 to express GST fusions containing various portions of CBP were described previously (45Sano Y. Tokitou F. Dai P. Maekawa T. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for GST fusion proteins of ATF-2, Smad3/4, and c-Ski were also described previously (45Sano Y. Tokitou F. Dai P. Maekawa T. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

To express GST fusion proteins containing various regions of c-Myb, appropriate DNA fragments of c-Myb were introduced into the pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pSPUTK vector (Stratagene) was used for in vitro transcription/translation of the various derivatives of c-Myb. The expression plasmids for the c-Myb mutants were described previously (10Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Kanei-Ishii C. Macmillan E.M. Nomura T. Sarai A. Ramsay R.G. Aimoto S. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1990: 61-70Google Scholar) was used to introduce the mutations K438R, K441R, 2K/R, or 5K/R into c-Myb. The CBP expression plasmid pRc/RSV-CBP-HA was a gift from R. Goodman. The plasmids to express various derivatives of Gal4-c-Myb fusions, in which the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was fused to c-Myb, were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction-based method using the cytomegalovirus promoter-containing vector pCMX (47Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The GST pull-down assay using GST-CBP and in vitro translated c-Myb was essentially performed as described previously (17Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and bacterial lysates containing 20 μg of GST-CBP were rocked for 2–3 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed with 1 ml of 0.6 m NaCl two times, with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 four times, and then with 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.7, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% skim milk, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Various forms of [35S]methionine-labeled c-Myb were synthesized using anin vitro transcription/translation kit according to the procedures described by the supplier (Promega). A sample from the reaction was mixed with GST-CBP affinity resin in 750 μl of binding buffer. After rocking at 4 °C overnight, the resin was washed with 1 ml of binding buffer 5 times, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled to release bound proteins. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. HepG2 cells were transfected with 6 μg of the CBP expression plasmid pRc/RSV-CBP-HA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were disrupted using lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The anti-CBP CT polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotech) were added to the supernatant and incubated on ice overnight. Protein G-Sepharose was added and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3–4 h. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer 3 times and with acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing the protease inhibitors. About 1–2 μg of the purified GST fusion protein as substrate and 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA (51 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the protein G-Sepharose beads containing CBP, and the reaction volume was adjusted to 30 μl with acetylation buffer. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels containing14C-labeled proteins were fixed with 10% glacial acetic acid and 40% methanol for 1 h. The efficiency of autoradiography was enhanced by impregnating the gels with a fluorography enhancing solution (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Gels were then dried and autoradiography was performed. The GST-CBP fusion protein containing the HAT domain (amino acids 1099–1758) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads from E. coli extract. The acetylation assay was done as described above except that 1 μg of GST-CBP was used instead of immunoprecipitated CBP as a source of acetyltransferase enzyme. To investigate the in vivo acetylation of c-Myb by CBP, 293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of the CBP expression plasmid pRc/RSV-CBP-HA together with equal amounts of one of the plasmids expressing various forms of c-Myb. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm sodium butylate) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The acetylated forms of c-Myb were detected with anti-acetylated lysine polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), while a mixture of acetylated and nonacetylated forms of c-Myb were detected by the anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody 1-1 or 5-1. The Myb site containing luciferase reporter, in which the SV40 early promoter is linked to six tandem repeats of the Myb-binding site, was transfected into HepG2 cells together with plasmid expressing various forms of c-Myb or the control vector, and the internal control plasmid pRL-CMV using the CaPO4 method. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured by using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Experiments were repeated 4 times, and the data were averaged. To examine the trans-activation capacity of the Gal4-Myb fusion, the Gal4 site containing luciferase reporter, in which the thymidine kinase promoter is linked to three tandem repeats of the Gal4-binding site, was transfected together with plasmid expressing various forms of Gal4-Myb fusions or the control vector and the internal control plasmid pact-β-gal. The transfection efficiency was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activities were measured as described above. To examine the effect of c-Myb acetylation on c-Myb affinity for CBP, 293 cells were transfected together with 3 μg of the CBP expression plasmid pRc/RSV-CBP-HA and 3 μg of plasmid expressing various forms of c-Myb using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared using TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium butyrate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture and the lysates were centrifuged. The CBP-containing immunocomplexes were precipitated with anti-CBP CT polyclonal antibody from the supernatant and washed with TNE buffer 3 times. The immunocomplexes were separated on 8% SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody 5-1 and a chemiluminescent detection regent (New England Biolabs). We previously reported that CBP directly binds to the transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb via the N-terminal KIX domain (17Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Numerous other transcriptional factors such as CREB also bind to the KIX domain. In a more precise analysis of the interaction between c-Myb and CBP, we obtained evidence suggesting that a region other than the KIX domain also directly interacts with c-Myb. To precisely identify this region, we performed the GST pull-down assay using GST-CBP fusion proteins containing various portions of CBP (Fig.1). In vitro translated mouse c-Myb directly bound to not only the GST-KIX fusion but also to the GST-CBP fusion containing the C/H2 domain. To determine which region of c-Myb interacts with the C/H2 domain of CBP, we next performed GST pull-down assays using the GST-C/H2 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and various derivatives of c-Myb translatedin vitro (Fig. 2, A and B). The results indicated that the NH2-terminal two-thirds of the NRD (amino acids 326–448) was responsible for binding to GST-C/H2. To further confirm that the NRD of c-Myb directly binds to the C/H2 domain of CBP, the GST pull-down assays using the GST fusion containing the NRD were performed (Fig. 2 C). The in vitro translated CBP fragment containing the C/H2 region (amino acids 1191–1758) bound to the GST fusion containing the NRD of c-Myb (amino acids 326–448). Thus, in addition to the previously reported interaction between the KIX domain of CBP and the transcriptional activation domain of c-Myb, the C/H2 domain of CBP also binds to the NRD of c-Myb.Figure 2Direct interaction between the C/H2 domain of CBP and the NRD of c-Myb. A, the functional domains of c-Myb and the deletion mutants used are schematically shown. The results of binding assays shown in B are indicated on the right. B, GST pull-down assay. In the input lanes, various forms of 35S-c-Myb were synthesized in vitro and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In theright panel, the 35S-c-Myb proteins indicatedabove each lane were mixed with the GST-CBP-C/H2 affinity resin and the bound proteins were analyzed. In the input lane, the amount of protein was 10% of that used in the binding assay.C, GST pull-down assay using GST-NRD. Binding of thein vitro translated CBP fragment containing the HAT domain (amino acids 1191–1758) was analyzed using the GST-Myb fusion proteins containing various regions of c-Myb indicated above each lane. In the input lane, the amount of protein was 10% of that used in the binding assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the C/H2 domain of CBP is critical for the intrinsic HAT activity of CBP, the direct interaction between the C/H2 domain of CBP and c-Myb suggested that CBP might directly acetylate c-Myb via its HAT domain. To test this, various transcription factors expressed in bacteria (Fig.3 A) were incubated with the CBP protein together with [14C]acetyl-CoA, and the level of acetylation of the transcription factors was investigated (Fig.3 B). The CBP protein was prepared by immunoprecipitating CBP with the anti-CBP polyclonal antibody from extracts of HepG2 cells transfected with the mouse CBP expression plasmid. The c-Myb protein was efficiently acetylated, whereas the other four transcription factors, ATF-2, Smad3, Smad4, and Ski, were not. To identify which region of c-Myb molecule was acetylated by CBP, we used a series of GST-c-Myb fusion proteins containing various portions of c-Myb (Fig.4 B) for in vitro acetylation assays. Among the five GST-c-Myb fusion proteins, only the fusion protein containing the NRD was acetylated by CBP (Fig. 4,A and C). This is consistent with our observation that the C/H2 domain of CBP directly binds to the NRD of c-Myb.Figure 4Localization of the acetylation site in NRD. A, schematic representation of the GST-c-Myb proteins used. The results of the acetylation assays shown inC are indicated on the right. B, analysis of GST-Myb fusion proteins. Various regions of c-Myb were expressed as GST fusions, and the proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin or bacterial lysates containing full-length c-Myb (FL) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. C, in vitro acetylation of GST-c-Myb. The GST-c-Myb fusion proteins were used for in vitro acetylation with CBP as described in the legend to Fig. 3 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which lysine residue(s) in the NRD are acetylated by CBP, we first used a series of GST-NRD fusion proteins containing various portions of the NRD truncated from the COOH terminus (Fig.5,A and B). The GST fusion proteins containing the entire NRD (GST-326–563 and GST-326–500) were efficiently acetylated by CBP (Fig. 5 C, left panel). Deletion from the COOH terminus to amino acid 449 (GST-326–448) did not abrogate acetylation by CBP, whereas deletion to amino acid 436 (GST-326–435) dramatically reduced the acetylation level. Next, we used one GST fusion protein containing the downstream region from the NRD (GST-501–636) and two GST fusion proteins containing both the downstream region from the NRD and the different C-terminal region of the NRD (GST-473–636 and GST-449–636) (Fig.5 C, right panel). Neither of these three GST fusions were acetylated by CBP. These results indicate that the region between amino acids 436 and 448 contains the CBP-induced acetylation site(s). This narrow region contains two lysine residues, Lys438 and Lys441, which could serve as potential CBP-mediated acetylation sites (Fig. 6 A). We mutated either or both of these lysine residues to arginine, and used them in in vitro acetylation assays containing immunoprecipitated CBP (Fig. 6 B). The GST-NRD fusion protein containing amino acids 326–563 was efficiently acetylated by CBP, whereas the construct with arginine at either Lys438 or Lys441 displayed significantly reduced but not total loss of acetylation by CBP (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, the construct possessing the two mutated lysine residues was very weakly acetylated by CBP. To further confirm that CBP really acetylates these two lysine residues, we examined the acetylation of c-Myb by GST-CBP recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli (Fig. 6 D). The GST-c-Myb fusion protein containing amino acids 326–563 was efficiently acetylated by GST-CBP protein containing the HAT domain. In contrast, GST-CBP acetylated neither the GST-c-Myb mutant protein, in which both Lys438 and Lys441 were mutated to ariginine, nor the GST protein alone. Thus, CBP directly acetylates the c-Myb protein in vitro at Lys438 and Lys441. We next confirmed that the two acetylation sites identifiedin vitro were also acetylated by CBP in vivo. When the c-Myb expression plasmid was transfected into 293 cells together with increasing amounts of the CBP expression plasmid, the acetylated form of c-Myb was detected by the anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 7 A). The amount of acetylated c-Myb increased in a dose-dependent manner with the amount of the CBP expression palsmid. These results indicated that CBP also acetylates c-Myb in vivo. To investigate which region of c-Myb is acetylated in vivo, plasmids expressing various derivatives of c-Myb were transfected into 293 cells together with the CBP expression plasmid, and the acetylated form of c-Myb was detected by the anti-acetylated lysine antibodies (Fig. 7 B). The two mutants lacking the DNA-binding domain or the transcriptional activation domain (ΔDBD or ΔTA) were not acetylated by CBP. The DNA-binding domain contains the nuclear localization signals and the ΔDBD mutant cannot enter the nucleus (10Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which means that the ΔDBD mutant would not be able to associate with CBP. The transcriptional activation domain is critical for association with CBP and the ΔTA mutant has probably much lower affinity for CBP compared with wild-type c-Myb (17Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.-X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, failure to detect acetylated forms of these two mutants may not be due to defects in their acetylation sites, but rather due to inefficient association between c-Myb and CBP. In fact, we observed CBP acetylated in vivo the c-Myb ΔDBD mutant fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain which has a nuclear localization signal. 2Y. Sano, unpublished results. CT1 was efficiently acetylated in vivo, whereas CT2 was not. These results indicate that the region between amino acids 404 and 500 in the NRD contains the acetylation sites. These results are consistent with the data from the in vitro acetylation assays described above. When the c-Myb mutant in which Lys438 or Lys441 was replaced by arginine (K438R or K441R) was expressed together with CBP, the density of the band corresponding to the acetylated form of c-Myb was significantly lower than that of wild-type c-Myb (Fig. 7 C, left panel). However, the acetylated form of these two c-Myb mutants could still be detected. Furthermore, when the c-Myb mutant in which both Lys438 and Lys441 were replaced by arginine (2K/R) was used, the density of the band corresponding to the acetylated form of c-Myb was about half of that of wild-type c-Myb (Fig. 7 C, right panel). Although the results indicate that Lys438 and Lys441 are acetylated by CBP in vivo, other sites of acetylation must exist to explain the residual level of acetylation of the 2K/R mutant. During the course of this study, another group reported the acetylation of three other sites, Lys471, Lys480, and Lys485, in the human c-Myb protein by p300 (42Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Kosugi H. Tamai K. Miyazaki T. Kinoshita T. Saito H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These three sites in human c-Myb correspond to Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481 in mouse c-Myb, and are located further downstream from the two acetylation sites identified here. Based on this report, we speculated that the acetylation of the 2K/R mutant occurred at these three sites. To confirm this possibility, we constructed a mutant c-Myb that had all five lysine residues (two sites identified in this study and the three sites reported by the other group) mutated to arginines (5K/R), and used it in the in vivo acetylation assay (Fig.7 C, right panel). The mutant displayed almost no acetylation by CBP, suggesting that CBP acetylates c-Myb in vivo at five sites. The use of different substrates for in vitro acetylation by our group and the other group may explain the discrepancy in the number of detected acetylation sites (see “Discussion”). To examine whether acetylation of c-Myb affects thetrans-activating capacity of c-Myb, we performed co-transfection assays. The luciferase reporter, in which luciferase expression was placed under the control of the SV40 early promoter linked to six tandem repeats of the Myb-biding site, was co-transfected into HepG2 cells together with the c-Myb expression plasmid. Wild-type c-Myb stimulated luciferase expression 8.3-fold, whereas the 2K/R and 5K/R mutants stimulated luciferase expression by 6.0- and 4.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 8 A). These results indicate that the CBP-induced acetylation of c-Myb positively regulates the trans-activating capacity of c-Myb. Furthermore, acetylation at Lys438 and Lys441synergistically enhanced the trans-activating capacity of c-Myb already acetylated at Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481. In the study of p300-induced acetylation of c-Myb, it was reported that p300-mediated acetylation enhanced the DNA binding activity of c-Myb (42Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Kosugi H. Tamai K. Miyazaki T. Kinoshita T. Saito H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We also observed that CBP-induced acetylation increased the DNA binding activity of c-Myb.2 In addition, we observed that the CBP-mediated acetylation of c-Myb stimulated transcriptional activation by the Gal4-c-Myb fusion protein (Fig. 8 B). The luciferase reporter containing the Gal4-binding sites was transfected into HepG2 cells together with the plasmid to express the Gal4 fusion protein containing full-length c-Myb. The luciferase expression from this reporter was enhanced 4.5-fold by Gal4-c-Myb. Replacement of both Lys438 and Lys441 by arginine (2K/R) suppressed activation by Gal4-Myb to 3.6-fold. Furthermore, replacement of all five lysine residues by arginines suppressed activation to 2.2-fold. The expression levels of these acetylation site mutants were similar to that of wild-type Gal4-c-Myb (Fig. 8 C). In the case of the Gal4-Myb fusion, the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, but not the authentic DNA-binding domain of c-Myb, was functional. Therefore, these results indicate that acetylation of c-Myb at five sites specifically stimulates trans-activation activity. During investigation of the mechanism of how CBP-mediated acetylation increases the trans-activating capacity of c-Myb, we found that acetylation of c-Myb enhances its association with CBP. As described above, the two regions of CBP, KIX and C/H2, directly interact with c-Myb. In the GST pull-down assays using the GST-CBP-KIX fusion protein, in vitro translated 2K/R and 5K/R mutants bound to GST-CBP-KIX less efficiently compared with wild-type c-Myb (Fig. 9 A). The 2K/R and 5K/R mutants bound to GST-CBP-KIX at levels that were 67 and 39% of that of wild-type c-Myb. In the second GST pull-down assays using GST-CBP-C/H2, similar results were obtained (Fig. 9 B). The binding efficiencies of the two mutants, 2K/R and 5K/R, to GST-CBP-C/H2 were 61 and 26% of that of the wild-type, respectively. To confirm that c-Myb acetylation really enhances its affinity for CBP in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed (Fig. 9 C). The plasmid to express the wild-type or the acetylation site mutants was transfected into 293 cells together with the CBP expression plasmid. Lysates were prepared from transfected cells, and used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-CBP antibody. Under these conditions, apparently less 2K/R and 5K/R mutant proteins were co-precipitated with CBP compared with wild-type c-Myb. These results indicate that acetylation of c-Myb increases its affinity for CBP. In this study, we have identified Lys438 and Lys441 of c-Myb as the targets of CBP-induced in vitro acetylation. In addition to theses two lysine residues, three other lysine residues (Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481 of mouse c-Myb), which were recently reported to be acetylated in vitro by p300, were also found to be acetylated by CBP in vivo. Consistent with our observations, their study suggested that p300 might also acetylate c-Myb at other acetylation sites in addition to the three sites at Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481 on mouse c-Myb. In fact, we observed that immunoprecipitated p300 acetylated c-Myb in vitro at Lys438 and Lys441.2These results strongly suggest that both CBP and p300 acetylate c-Myb at five lysine residues (Lys438 and Lys441identified in this study and Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481 of the recent report). We used the GST-c-Myb fusion protein as a substrate for in vitro acetylation, whereas in vitro translated c-Myb was used for acetylation by p300 (42Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Kosugi H. Tamai K. Miyazaki T. Kinoshita T. Saito H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggests that the three lysine residues identified as p300-induced acetylation sites may have been masked in the GST-c-Myb fusion protein by GST-mediated changes in c-Myb protein conformation, leading to no acetylation at these sites. Mutation analysis of the acetylation sites in c-Myb suggested that acetylation at each site synergistically enhanced thetrans-activating capacity of c-Myb. Our results indicated that acetylation of c-Myb by CBP enhanced its affinity for CBP. Acetylation of the NRD in c-Myb enhanced its binding not only for the C/H2 domain of CBP but also for the KIX domain of CBP. The C/H2 domain interacts with the NRD containing the acetylated lysines, whereas the KIX domain directly interacts with the activation domain of c-Myb which lacks acetylation sites. Compared with wild-type c-Myb, the c-Myb mutant lacking the activation domain (ΔTA) has a lower affinity for the C/H2 domain of CBP (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that NRD and the activation domain interact with each other in the c-Myb molecule and synergistically stimulate c-Myb association with CBP. Probably, acetylation at NRD affects the protein conformation of the activation domain of c-Myb, leading to enhanced association of c-Myb with the KIX domain. After binding of c-Myb to the enhancer region of c-Myb target genes, CBP may be recruited to c-Myb on the enhancer. However, this association between c-Myb and CBP may be transient or very weak. Once c-Myb is acetylated by CBP, CBP may become tightly associated with c-Myb, and mediate more efficient c-Myb-induced transcriptional activation. In the study of p300-induced acetylation of c-Myb, it was shown that acetylation of c-Myb enhanced the DNA affinity of c-Myb for the Myb recognition sequence (42Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Kosugi H. Tamai K. Miyazaki T. Kinoshita T. Saito H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We also observed that the DNA-binding capacity of c-Myb was enhanced by CBP.2Therefore, acetylation of c-Myb by CBP/p300 has two functional consequences for c-Myb activity: increased DNA binding activity and increased activation potential. Recently, it was also reported that acetylation of E2F stimulates E2F activity via multiple mechanisms including increased DNA binding activity, activation potential, and protein half-life (41Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Thus, acetylation may affect multiple characteristics of transcription factors. NRD negatively regulates c-Myb activity by associating with uncharacterized inhibitor(s). Thus, acetylation of the NRD of c-Myb could also serve to inhibit the binding of such inhibitors to c-Myb. Both A-Myb and B-Myb, other members of the myb gene family, are also acetylated by CBP.2 Five lysine residues of mouse c-Myb (Lys438, Lys441, Lys467, Lys476, and Lys481), which can be acetylated by CBP, are well conserved in A-Myb. Both c-Myb and A-Myb bind to CBP to elicit strong transcriptional activation. Among these five lysine residues, Lys438 is the only one not conserved in B-Myb, although the other four lysines are present. This difference could be partly related to the observation that B-Myb is a weaker transcriptional activator compared with c-Myb and A-Myb (48Mizuguchi G. Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Nomura N. Date T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although B-Myb has a transcriptional activation domain, which is rich in acidic amino acids, the COOH-terminal portion containing the putative acetylation sites appears to be required for transcriptional activation by B-Myb (50Tashiro S.

Cyclin A/Cdk2 phosphoryates this region, and stimulates its trans-activating capacity (52Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K.

The hepatic functions affected include bile secretion, metabolic activity, liver regeneration, and the response to xenobiotics. In the present study, we demonstrate the presence, in the liver, of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), described previously in the parathyroid and thyroid glands and kidney. CASR mRNA was specifically expressed in hepatocytes and was absent in nonparenchymal liver cells (stellate, endothelial, and Kupffer cells). Western blot analysis using a specific CASR antibody showed staining in both whole liver and hepatocyte extracts. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of rat liver sections showed expression of CASR protein and mRNA by a subset of hepatocytes. The known agonists of the CASR, gadolinium (Gd3+; 0.5–3.0 mm) and spermine (1.25–20 mm), in the absence of Ca2+o, elicited dose-related increases in Ca2+i in isolated rat hepatocytes loaded with Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester. There was a greatly attenuated response to a second challenge with either agonist. The response was also abrogated when inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive calcium pools had been depleted by pretreatment with either thapsigargin or phenylephrine, an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist known to mobilize Ca2+i from IP3-sensitive pools. Addition of the deschloro-phenylalkylamine compound, NPS R-467, but not the S enantiomer, NPS S-467, increased the sensitivity of the Ca2+i mobilization response to 1.25 mm spermine. Bile flow ceased after Ca2+o withdrawal, and its recovery was enhanced by spermine in isolated perfused liver preparations. The CASR agonists Ca2+ and Gd3+ increased bile flow, and the response to a submaximal Ca2+ concentration was enhanced by NPS R-467 but not the S compound. Thus, the data indicate that rat hepatocytes harbor a CASR capable of mobilizing Ca2+i from IP3-sensitive stores and that activation of the CASR stimulates bile flow.

The modulation of cellular signaling pathways thereby brought about affects hormone secretion and renal electrolyte handling. The CASR plays a critical role in coordinating hormonally regulated systemic calcium homeostasis, and this is emphasized by the fact that naturally occurring loss or gain of function mutations in the CASR gene on human chromosome 3q13–21 (2Janicic N.

In addition, there is an association between serum calcium concentrations in the normal Caucasian population and a common polymorphism in the C-terminal tail of the CASR (9Cole D.E.C. Peltekova V.D.

The CASR is a G protein-coupled receptor, and its activation can lead to cell signaling via more than one pathway. Coupling to a Gq/11 type protein activates phospholipase C effecting membrane phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate turnover with production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and subsequent mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, as well as production of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C (10Nemeth E.F.

Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the CASR leads to reduced production of intracellular cAMP in parathyroid cells (12Chen C. Barnett J. Congo D. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and cells of the nephron, for example, distal convoluted tubule cells (13Bapty B.W. Dai L-J. Ritchie G. Jirik F. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This might occur via coupling to the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein, which inhibits the adenylyl cyclase enzyme, or via an indirect mechanism involving arachidonic acid metabolites (14Wang W-H. Lu M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C103-C111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to ligand specificity the CASR is promiscuous, being responsive not only to divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ but also trivalent cations such as the transition metal, gadolinium (Gd3+) (15Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C.

Physiol. 1997; 273: C1315-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CASR could function as the physiological receptor for Mg2+ and polycations, such as spermine, at certain sites in the body. Changes in ionic strength are also able to modulate CASR activation (17Quinn S.J. Kifor O. Trivedi S. Diaz R. Vassilev P. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19579-19586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, certain phenylalkylamine compounds and their deschloro derivatives selectively potentiate the responsiveness of the CASR to its ligands by acting as positive allosteric modulators (18Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C.P. Van Wagenen B.C. Delmar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Such compounds, so called calcimimetics, if of sufficient selectivity and potency, have enormous potential for the pharmacological modulation of PTH secretion and the medical management of hyperparathyroid states (19Silverberg S.J.

Although the CASR is highly expressed in tissues important for regulating the [Ca2+]o, including parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney, it is also found at lower levels in many other tissues not known to play a role in calcium homeostasis (22Brown E.M. Vassilev P.M. Quinn S. Hebert S.C. Vit. Horm. 1999; 55: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These latter tissues include regions of the brain such as hippocampus and pituitary, lung, and keratinocytes. For many of these, the physiological role of the CASR is not yet clear, and it may be that the CASR senses endogenous ligands other than Ca2+ at these particular sites. With respect to the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs, the CASR is expressed in cells within the small and large intestines (23Gama L. Baxendale-Coe L.M. Breitwieser G.E. Am. J.

However, CASR expression has not been studied in the liver. With respect to calcium homeostasis, the liver plays an important role in the uptake and metabolism of intact PTH, and this occurs specifically in Kupffer cells (28Segre G.V. Perkins A.S. Witters L.A. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PTH binding occurs on hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells and is linked in the former cells to adenylyl cyclase (29D'Amour P. Segre G.V. Roth S.I. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Rouleau M.F. Warshawsky H. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At one time the hepatic metabolism of PTH was suggested to be [Ca2+]o-regulated, although this is not now thought to be the case (31D'Amour P. Rousseau L. Rocheleau B. Pomier-Layrargues G. Huet P.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The liver is also the site of the C-25-hydroxylation of vitamin D, which is a prerequisite step for the final production of the hormonally active, 1-α-hydroxylated metabolite. The 25-hydroxylase step has not yet been fully investigated with respect to regulation by [Ca2+]o (32Gascon-Barré M. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 41-55Google Scholar). However, liver cells do respond in a variety of ways to changes in [Ca2+]o, and certain liver functions may be compromised when serum calcium levels rise or fall above or below the normal range. These functions include bile secretion, metabolic activity, liver regeneration, and resistance to xenobiotics. In the present study, we demonstrate the presence of the CASR in the liver. Its expression is diffuse throughout the hepatic acinus, the functionally active receptor mobilizes [Ca2+]ifrom IP3-sensitive pools, and CASR agonists stimulate bile flow in the perfused rat liver. Protocols for obtaining rat tissues were approved by local animal ethics committees. Tissues for RNA and Western blot analysis were flash frozen and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from tissues that were homogenized using a Polytron and from cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT-PCR was carried out as follows. First-strand cDNA was made by reverse transcribing 3 μg of DNase-I- treated total RNA with a recombinant superscript II RNase H (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT)15–18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 20 μl as described (33Kawasaki E.S.

Five microliters of the RT reaction were electrophoresed in ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels to check for quantity and quality of the cDNAs. Five microliters were used for PCR amplification with a GeneAmp PCR System thermocycler model 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Portions of the CASR cDNA were amplified using the primer pairs shown in Table I. The PCR mixture contained 2.25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 300 nm of forward and reverse primers, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 μl. The PCR amplification consisted of 30 (unless otherwise stated) cycles of denaturation of 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 58 °C for 35 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s.

Semi-automated sequence analysis was performed on three independent clones of each product using either Alf Express (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or ABI-373 (Applied Biosystems Inc.) sequencers located at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center of McGill University. Tissues and cells were lysed in triple detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 5 min at 0 °C. The cell lysates were spun at 1200 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Aliquots were electrophoresed through 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were rinsed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, blocked with 5% dried milk powder in TBST for 3 h, and incubated with a CASR antibody. The mouse monoclonal antibody (ADD) was raised against a peptide comprising residues 214–236 of the extracellular domain of the CASR, which are completely conserved between human, bovine and rat. This antibody was kindly provided by Drs. P. K. Goldsmith and A. M. Spiegel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and K. V. Rogers (NPS Pharmaceuticals, Salt Lake City, UT). The specificity of this antibody for the parathyroid/kidney CASR has been previously well documented (13Bapty B.W. Dai L-J. Ritchie G. Jirik F. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Quamme G.A.

As a control, immunoblotting was carried out as described above with the antibody preadsorbed for 1 h with the peptide (10 μg/ml) against which it was raised. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected by chemiluminescence using the Lumi-glo kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). 12-week-old female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, St. Constance, Canada) were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and tissues were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Specimens were dehydrated with an increasing concentration of ethanol before paraffin embedding. 5-μm sections were mounted on Superfrost slides (Fisher, Nepean, Canada). Sections were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by a 10-min incubation in 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature to retrieve fixation-concealed antigens. After stabilization in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, sections were incubated with the CASR monoclonal antibody (described above under Western blotting) at a dilution of 1:750 in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, staining was done with the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlington, Canada) according to the manufacturer's directions. As a control, some sections were treated with primary antibody that had been preadsorbed overnight at 4 °C with the peptide (10 μg/ml) against which it had been raised. In situ hybridization was carried out using biotin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes and the Genpoint CSA kit (Dako Diagnostics, Mississauga, Canada). Labeled riboprobes were prepared from a plasmid containing a 509-bp insert corresponding to the rat CASR (13Bapty B.W. Dai L-J. Ritchie G. Jirik F. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Quamme G.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a nucleotide labeling mix containing biotin-16-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a standard xylene and alcohol series and in situ hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, slides were heated in target retrieval solution and proteinase K to reveal hidden antigens. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Sections were hybridized for 2 h at 50 °C with 5 ng/ml biotin-labeled riboprobe in the supplied RNA hybridization buffer. After stringent washing at 55 °C, sections were treated to successive incubations in primary streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, biotinyl-tyramide solution, and secondary streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Dako) for 15 min each at room temperature. Color was developed with the supplied diaminobenzidine diluted as directed (DAKO), and sections were counterstained with Carazzi's hematoxylin prior to dehydration and mounting. Sinusoidal cells were isolated from livers of nonfasting rats by the method of Knook and Sleyster (35Knook D.L. Sleyster E.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1976; 99: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After Nicodenz density gradient, cells were washed in Gey's balanced salt solution (GBSS), pH 7.4, at 4 °C, resuspended, and introduced in a type J2-21M centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a JE-6B elutriation rotor and a Sanderson chamber. While being centrifuged at 2500 rpm, cells were washed out at pump flows of 13, 23, and 42 ml/min to collect stellate, endothelial, and Kupffer cells respectively using GBSS, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Stellate, endothelial, and Kupffer cells were centrifuged and counted, and viability was evaluated. Sinusoidal cells had a viability greater than 95% and were free of hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were obtained from livers of nonfasting rats as described previously (36Benbrahim N. Dube C. Vallieres S. Gascon-Barré M. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated cells were suspended in William E medium containing 1% albumin, 0.5 mm glucose, sequentially filtered through 250- and 74-μm filters, and centrifuged at 250 rpm for 3 min. The freshly isolated hepatocytes were then equilibrated in William E medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell viability was evaluated by Trypan blue exclusion, and those cells showing greater than 85% were taken for further study. Rat whole bile duct was harvested. The mouse biliary cell line (BDC) was kindly provided by Dr. Emile Levy (Hôpital Ste-Justine, Montreal, Canada) and was cultured as described previously (37Paradis K. Le O.N.L. Russo P. St-Cyr M. Fournier H. Bu D. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1308-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated at a density of 3.5–5 × 105 cells/ml onto collagen-coated coverslips in Williams E medium containing 25 mm bicarbonate, 1% bovine serum albumin, at pH 7.4, 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After incubation for 60 min cells were loaded for 30 min at 20 °C with the fluorescent probe Fura-2/AM (2 μm) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) in bicarbonate-free Williams E medium supplemented with 0.25% fetal bovine serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. Dye-loaded cells were then transferred in a 100-nl plastic chamber to the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped for epifluorescence measurement. Cells were superfused at a rate of 3.6 ml/min, pH 7.4, at 32 °C in a 10 mm Krebs buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA for the gadolinium (0.5–3 mm) studies, and 10 mm Hepes buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.2 mmMgSO4 0.2 mm EDTA for the spermine (1–20 mm) studies. Phenylephrine and thapsigargin were used at a concentration of 5 nm. Calcium measurements were made as described previously (38Gascon-Barré M. Petit J-L. Ethier C. Bilodeau S. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 343-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence signals from single hepatocytes were obtained with an MCID dual excitation spectrofluorometer system (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Canada). Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured at 505 nm. A refrigerated camera (Hamamatsu Photonics C4880, Hamamatsu City, Japan) was used as the imaging device. Output from the fluorometer was digitized, ratioed, and computer analyzed. Intracellular dye calibration was performedin situ by perfusion of 10 μm ionomycin in a solution containing 4 mm EGTA (R min) or 4 mm CaCl2 (R max). After correction for sample autofluorescence, signal ratios (F 340/F 380) were transformed into [Ca2+]i as previously reported (39Grynkiewicz G.M. Poeni M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The presence of nonhydrolyzable dye was periodically verified by quenching with 2 mm MnCl2 and found to be negligible when compared with autofluorescence. To investigate the involvement of the CASR in bile secretion, bile flow was monitored in the isolated-perfused rat liver either (1Brown E.M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 238-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) following a period of cholestasis induced by calcium deprivation in vitro or (2Janicic N. Soliman E.

Rats were anesthetized with forane, and the liver was perfused in situ as described previously (40Plourde V. Gascon-Barré M. Coulombe P.A. Vallières S. Huet P.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 3: 461-471Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) using a perfusion apparatus (MX Ambec Perfuser, MX International Inc., Aurora, CO). Briefly, the common bile duct was cannulated using PE-10 tubing (Clay-Adams, Parsipanny, NJ), and the bile was collected throughout the experiment. The perfusion medium consisted of a 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, saturated with a mixture of O2/CO2 (95:5, v/v) that contained 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4H2O, 21.4 μm taurocholic acid, and 100 mg/100 ml glucose. Experiment 1 was done in Ca2+-free perfusate or in perfusate containing 1.25 mm Ca2+ and 0, 1.25 or 2.5 mm spermine. Experiment 2 was done in perfusate containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ (base-line conditions) throughout or at 20 min changed to 1.25 mmCa2+, 100 μm Gd3+, 0.5 mm Ca2+ + 1 μm NPS R-467, or 0.5 mm Ca2+ + 1 μm NPS S-467 (0.5 mm MgSO4 was used throughout). The liver remained in situ throughout the experiments, and its temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The perfusate was recirculated with a Masterflex pump (Cole Palmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL) through a stainless steel filter. A pressure regulator was used to damp down pulsatile flow. The perfusion rate through the liver was set at 30 ml/min. In each preparation, perfusate Ca2+ measurements were done using a ICA2 ionized calcium analyzer (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significant differences between grouped means were determined by Tukey's analysis of variance or by Student'st test (41Winer B.J. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1971: 309Google Scholar) where appropriate. Expression of CASR mRNA was examined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A cDNA fragment of 367 bp corresponding to the CASR mRNA sequence encoded by part of exons 2 and 3 was amplified using forward primer r2BF and r3AR (Fig. 1 and TableI). Aliquots of the PCR reaction were taken after 21, 24, 28, and 32 cycles for CASR and 18, 21, 24, and 28 cycles for GAPDH and electrophoresed through ethidium bromide-stained gels. Fig. 2 shows that a low level of CASR mRNA expression was observed in total liver and hepatocytes compared with the parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney. The series of PCR products 1, 2, 4, and 5, which together comprise the entire coding region of rat CASR mRNA, were amplified from rat liver cDNA, subcloned into plasmid vectors, and sequenced. The derived sequence was identical to that of rat kidney (42Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W-S. Gamba G. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fig.3 shows that hepatocytes were positive for CASR mRNA expression, whereas all other cell types were negative. Mouse cell or rat tissue extracts (10 μg of protein each) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient gel. The blot shown in Fig. 4 was stained with CASR mouse monoclonal antibody (ADD, raised against a peptide comprising CASR residues 214–236). The predominant species present in rat kidney and parathyroid are the nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms ranging from 120 to 160 kDa, with some higher molecular weight aggregates, which the rat liver lacks.

We have developed a concerted approach of endoarabinanase digestion coupled with chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis to rapidly identify and quantitatively map the complement of such terminal units among the clinical isolates of different virulence and drug resistance profiles. In comparison with LAM from laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an ethambutol (Emb) resistant clinical isolate was shown to have a significantly higher proportion of nonmannose capped arabinan termini.

Both cases resulted in an increase of arabinose to mannose ratio in the overall glycosyl composition of LAM. Emb, therefore, not only could affect the complete elaboration of the arabinan as found previously for LAM from Mycobacterium smegmatis resistant mutant but also could inhibit the extent of mannose capping and hence its associated biological functions inM. tuberculosis.

Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). In the chemical setting of mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, AG forms an integral part of the cell wall proper, whereas the wall associated LAM has been implicated as a key molecule involved in the virulence and immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis (2Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The arabinan of LAM is attached to a mannan core that extends from a phosphatidylinositol mannoside anchor at the reducing end. Of major biological significance is the degree and chemical nature of capping functions and other substituents on the arabinan. It was demonstrated that the arabinan chains of LAMs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as the attenuatedMycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine strain andMycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, are mannose-capped to varying degrees (40–70%). In contrast, the majority of the arabinan termini from the rapidly growing, noninfectiveMycobacterium smegmatis are uncapped, whereas a minor portion terminates with inositol phosphate (3Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen.

The mannose-capped LAM isolated from M. tuberculosis is generally less effective at stimulating macrophages than the non-mannose-capped LAM from fast growing strains (2Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which may owe its potency in inducing cytokine production entirely to its inositol phosphate capping (5Khoo K.-H. Dell A.

The presence of mannose caps on LAM has also been implicated to be essential in mediating the binding to human macrophage mannose receptors (7Schlesinger L.S. J.

The arabinan represents a valid target for antimycobacterial drug because disruption of its biosynthesis would lead to dual dismantling of both the mycolyl-AG-peptidoglycan cell wall complex and LAM. Ethambutol (Emb), an effective antimycobacterial drug known to inhibit the biogenesis of the cell wall components, is now understood to act by inhibiting the arabinan biosynthesis (12Takayama K. Kilburn J.O. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 1989; 226: 139-146Google Scholar, 13Deng S. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R. Lowary T.L. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), but its precise site or mechanism of action is still unknown. Interestingly, an Emb-resistant mutant derived from M. smegmatis apparently made normal cell wall AG but truncated LAM of smaller size in an Emb dose-dependent manner when grown in the presence of this drug (15Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusová K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this phenomenon of truncation extends to mannose-capped LAMs from M. tuberculosis, which has a very similar underlying arabinan structure. Specifically, it is of interest to know whether Emb inhibition of arabinan synthesis would result in concomitant reduction in the extent of mannose capping on prematurely terminated arabinan chains, thereby compromising their biological activities. LAM is a notoriously difficult biomolecule for precise structure and function definition because of its size, extreme heterogeneity, and the chemical nature of the arabinan. Further, it is not known whether our current understanding based on LAM samples from well established laboratory strains, such as M. tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv or M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis, truly reflectsin vivo scenario of infection. At present, virtually nothing is known about the branching pattern and capping function of LAMs from drug-resistant clinical isolates that are difficult to obtain in large quantities. Given the particular biological relevance of the terminal arabinan structures, a rapid and high sensitivity method of defining their relative profiles is imperative to further understanding of the consequence of drug action and resistance. Toward this end, our own crude endoarabinanase preparation (16McNeil M.R. Robuck K. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) provides the only presently available tool to release intact the variably capped terminal oligoarabinosyl motifs from LAM (5Khoo K.-H.

Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) without resorting to chemical cleavage methods that would otherwise degrade the labile arabinofuranosyl bonds. We demonstrated in this paper that endoarabinanase digestion of intact LAM followed by direct high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis can be a quick and effective way to assess the branching nature and capping functions of the arabinan motifs. For more detailed characterization, the enzymatically released oligomers can be fluorescently labeled at the reducing end and fractionated on normal phase HPLC. The liquid chromatography based analysis afforded a useful quantitative map of various digested products, whereas MS analysis allowed firm identification based on molecular mass, along with any novel substituents. These two approaches are therefore highly complementary and were used here to gain an insight into the arabinan framework of each LAM under investigation. We provided the first pictures of the native construct of the arabinan terminal motifs in LAMs from clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. avium complex and highlighted their substantial differences in the nature of mannose capping. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that mannose capping on LAM from the laboratory M. tuberculosis strain can be completely abolished when grown in the presence of Emb at a concentration that would be ineffective against the drug resistant clinical isolates. All chemical reagents were of highest grade from Aldrich/Fluka unless otherwise specified. Milli-Q® water was used for all chemical reactions and also for isolation of lipoglycans and column chromatography. The Emb-resistant M. tuberculosis isolate CSU19 (from Korea) was propagated on 7H11 plates. Isolated colonies were then grown in 5 ml of glycerol-alanine salts broth for 2–3 weeks at 37 °C on a shaker. Large scale cultures were initiated by using 100 μl of broth culture to inoculate 5 ml of fresh glycerol-alanine salts followed by 1 ml of culture into 400 ml of broth. M. tuberculosis, H37Ra, was grown in glycerol-alanine salts broth in the presence of 0.5 μg of Emb. M. avium, strain 2151, was grown in Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment supplement to maintain stable colony morphotypes (18Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The smooth transparent (SmT) type was used in this study. Wet cells (∼10 g) were disrupted mechanically using either a French Pressure Cell or a Bead Beater as required for over 90% breakage of cells. The initial breaking buffer for disruption contained Triton X-114 (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin) and DNase, RNase. The suspension after cell breakage was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer and centrifuged as before. The combined supernatant was placed at 37 °C to initiate biphase (19Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The aqueous layer and the detergent layer were back extracted a second time, the detergent layer was separated, and the combined detergent layer was precipitated with 9 volumes of acetone. The acetone precipitate was collected, dried, and partitioned between phenol and water. The aqueous layer that contained majority of cellular LAM and lipomannan was dried and used for further purification (3Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was prepared by using methods as described before (15Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusová K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The gel was suspended in a buffer containing 0.2m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (3Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was used to monitor the elution profile of fractions containing LAM and lipomannan, which were then pooled accordingly and dialyzed at 37 °C without detergent followed by water for several days. LAM/lipomannan thus recovered was reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to check for purity prior to detailed analysis. SDS-PAGE and silver-periodic acid Schiff staining were performed essentially as described (4Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sample concentrations were maintained at 1–2 μg in 10 μl of sample buffer. Selective growth of a soil microorganism,Cellulomonas gelida, from which the endoarabinanase was purified, has been described (16McNeil M.R. Robuck K. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crude enzyme preparation (containing both endo and exo glycosidases) was fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column, and the eluents were examined for their ability to digest AG. The active fractions were then applied to a Cibacron Blue 3GA Affinity column (Sigma) and eluted with a step gradient of 0.2-1 m NaCl. The fractions were then desalted using Centricon, and enzyme activity was remonitored. The suitable fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 100 mmTris/HCl. After a final concentration of the enzyme dialysate in 20% polyethylene glycol, the concentrated solution is stored and maintained at 4 °C in the Tris buffer. The activity of the enzyme reduced significantly when the initial dialysis was carried out in water as opposed to the Tris/HCl. To ensure a directly comparable and consistent result, all LAM samples (10 μg for initial mapping; 50 μg for enzyme digestion and subsequent analysis by 2-AB tagging and HPLC/MS analysis) were treated with same amount of the enzyme preparation for 4 h at 37 °C. An aliquot from the digestion product mixtures that contained both mannan core and the released oligoarabinosides were analyzed directly by HPAEC. Analytical HPAEC was performed on a Dionex LC system fitted with a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column (15Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusová K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the oligoarabinosides were detected with a pulse amperometric detector (PAD-II). The remaining sample was frozen and dried down in SpeedVac (Savant) for subsequent MS analysis. For larger preparation, the reaction mixtures were boiled briefly to terminate the digestions and desalted directly to remove the Tris salts and the mannan core, as described in the “2-Ab Labeling and Normal Phase HPLC”. Endoarabinanase released oligomers were first separated from resistant LAM core and desalted simultaneously with a HyperSep Hypercarb poros graphitized carbon (PGC) column (ThermoQuest). Samples were dissolved in water and loaded onto the cartridge. After washing with 3 ml of water, the oligosaccharides were eluted with 3 ml of 25% acetonitrile, whereas the mannan core was recovered in the subsequent 3-ml fraction of 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified oligosaccharides were then incubated with 5 μl of the labeling reagents (0.35 m 2-aminobenzamide and 1 msodium cyanoborohydride in 70:30 dimethyl sulfoxide:glacial acetic acid) at 65 °C for 2 h, after which the reaction mixtures were directly spotted onto a GlycoClean S cartridge (Glyko). After 15 min, the disc was washed sequentially with 1 ml of acetonitrile, 5× 1 ml of 96% acetonitrile, and finally the 2-AB-labeled glycans were recovered by eluting with 3× 0.5 ml of water. Normal phase HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 series LC system fitted with a thermostat column compartment and a PalPak type N column (Takara, 4.6 × 250 mm). Solvents A and B are acetonitrile and 250 mm aqueous formic acid, respectively. 2-AB-labeled glycans were size fractionated with a gradient of t = 0, 20% B, t = 40 min, 40% B, t = 65 min, 85% B, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and detected by fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 310 and 410 nm, respectively. Samples were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described by Dell et al. (20Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). FAB-MS and ESI-MS analyses were performed on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK), and fitted with a magnet bypass flight tube and interchangeable FAB and ESI source assemblies. For FAB-MS experiments, the fitted cesium ion gun was operated at 26 kV, and the source accelerating voltage was operated at 8 kV. The permethyl derivatives were redissolved in CH3OH for loading onto the probe tip coated withm-nitrobenzylalcohol as matrix. Collision-induced dissociation FAB-MS/MS was performed by introducing argon gas to the collision cell to a reading of ∼1.2 × 10−6millibars on the time of flight ion gauge, at a lab frame collision energy of 800 eV and a push-out frequency of 56 kHz for orthogonal sampling. A 1-s integration time per spectrum was chosen for the time of flight analyzer with a 0.1-s interscan delay. Individual spectra were summed for data processing. For ESI-MS, the accelerating voltage was maintained at 4 kV. The permethyl derivatives were dissolved in CH3OH, and 10-μl aliquots were injected through a Rheodyne loop into the mobile phase (methanol/water/acetic acid, 50:50:1, v/v/v), delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the ESI source by a syringe pump. Underivatized native samples analyzed by ESI-MS were first subjected to clean up using the PGC cartridge described to remove salts and mannan core. Our previous work has shown that the α1–5 arabinan chains of LAM can be digested by endoarabinanase from C. gelida into di-arabinosides, Arafα1→5Araf(Ara2). However, the characteristic chain termination with a Arafβ1→2Araf renders the adjacent Arafα1→5Araf unit resistant to endoarabinanase digestion, leading instead to the recovery of variably capped nonreducing terminal tetra- (Ara4) and hexa-arabinosyl (Ara6) units (Fig.1). Thus, for an extensively mannose-capped LAM such as that from M. tuberculosis Erdman, the major products have been isolated by size fractionation on a Bio-Gel P-6 column and structurally characterized as Ara2, Man2Ara4, and Man4Ara6because the most abundant cap on each arabinan terminus is Manα1→2Man (17Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, endoarabinanase digestion of non mannose-capped LAM gave Ara2, Ara4, and Ara6 as major products (5Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LAM fromM. tuberculosis H37Rv (RvLAM) has previously been shown to be very similar in structure to that from Erdman, although the relevant ManxAran terminal units have not been isolated intact. To rapidly map these nonreducing terminal motifs, the endoarabinanase digested RvLAM was analyzed directly by HPAEC, and the profile obtained (Fig. 2 A) was compared against that from the same sample further treated with α-mannosidase to remove the caps (Fig. 2 B). The latter was found to give a simpler profile with three major peaks, which eluted at retention times corresponding to Ara2, Ara4, and Ara6 standards (peaks 1–3 in Fig.2 B). Thus, the major endoarabinanase digestion products of RvLAM as observed in Fig. 2 A could be assigned as mannose-capped Ara4 and Ara6. This was further corroborated when Man2Ara4 and Man4Ara6 isolated from a Bio-Gel P-6 column and identified by MS analysis were found to elute at positions corresponding to peaks 4 and 5, respectively (data not shown). The major mannose-capped Ara4/Ara6 motifs, namely Man2Ara4 and Man4Ara6, could therefore be adequately resolved from the uncapped Ara4 and Ara6, respectively. Interestingly, mannose substitution at 5-OH of the β-Ara results in earlier retention time of the oligoarabinosyl motifs, indicating that separation by HPAEC is both structure- and size-dependent. Direct analysis by HPAEC of the endoarabinanase digested LAM will thus give a rapid indication of whether the LAM under investigation does terminate with the Ara4/Ara6 motifs and whether it is characteristically capped with a dimannoside. To provide a more definitive identification of the oligoarabinosyl motifs, the digestion product mixture of RvLAM was dried down directly, permethylated, chloroform extracted to remove most of the salt buffers used, and analyzed by MS. Rather unexpectedly, them/z values of the major molecular ions did not correspond to the calculated molecular masses of the expected molecular species. Instead, they could be assigned as incorporating a Tris moiety at the reducing end. Thus, the expected [M+Na]+molecular ions for Man2Ara4 and Man4Ara6 are only observed as minor signals atm/z 1117 and 1845, respectively, whereas the corresponding ones assigned as incorporating a Tris adduct afforded strong M+ signals at m/z 1254 and 1982 (Fig. 3 A). Other Tris-incorporating molecular ion signals observed include Ara2, Ara4, Ara6, Man3Ara4, Man2Ara6, and Man5Ara6 at m/z 526, 846, 1166, 1458, 1574, and 2186, respectively. The assigned molecular composition clearly demonstrated that most of the heterogeneity associated with the digestion products could be attributed to the mannose capping, which ranges from Man1 to Man3or no capping on each terminus. MS/MS analysis of the Man2Ara4 peak at m/z 1254 yielded a series of fragment ions at m/z 380, 540, 700, 860, and 1064, corresponding to reducing terminal ring cleavage ions Ara1 + Tris, Ara2 + Tris, Ara3 + Tris, Ara4 + Tris, and Man1Ara4 + Tris, respectively (Fig.3 B). Together with additional fragment ions, the MS/MS data supported a linear Man2Ara4 structure as drawn (Fig. 3 B) and also indicated a covalent incorporation of Tris at the reducing terminus. Further investigation demonstrated that Tris incorporation could be largely avoided if the enzyme digested mixture was first passed through a PGC column for salt removal instead of drying down directly, which probably concentrated the Tris buffer while the enzyme was still active (Fig. 3, insets C and D). Thus, for a specific purpose when it is imperative to maintain the free reducing end or for a large scale preparation, the digestion products could be desalted directly using a PGC or gel filtration column, which also render the sample clean enough for direct ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 3 D). However, when sample amount is limited, permethylation of the dried down digestion products is preferable because it avoids the additional step of work up and improves sensitivity of detection by MS, probably because of creation of a fixed charge on the quaternary ammonium during permethylation. Thus, although it is yet unclear how the released oligoarabinosyl motifs could be transglycosylated with Tris present in the enzyme buffer, its stable incorporation clearly did not interfere with MS analysis. In fact, the dried down sample was equally amenable to further clean up with PGC column for ESI-MS analysis (Fig.3 C). The m/z values of the observed [M+Na]+ molecular ion signals for the Tris incorporating native samples further validated our assignment of the molecular compositions of the various oligoarabinosyl motifs. As shown previously, LAM from the avirulent H37Ra (RaLAM) was very similar to that from the virulent Erdman or H37Rv strain in that it was also mannose-capped. The HPAEC and MS profiles of endoarabinanase digested RaLAM (Fig. 4 A) were indeed similar to those of RvLAM, with Man2Ara4(m/z 1254) and Man4Ara6(m/z 1982) being the dominant products. Other molecular ions afforded by ESI-MS analysis of the permethyl derivatives attested to the variation in mannose capping, corresponding to Ara4 (m/z 846) with shorter (Man1Ara4, m/z 1050) and longer (Man3Ara4, m/z 1458) mannose caps and Ara6 with a total of 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 Man residues at m/z 1166, 1574, 1778, 2186, and 2390 respectively. In addition, Ara5(m/z 1006) and Man2Ara5(m/z 1414) were also detected. Interestingly, the RaLAM derived from H37Ra propagated and maintained in an Emb concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (minimal inhibitory concentration = 1 μg/ml) (RaLAMemb) afforded a HPAEC profile that resembled that of α-mannosidase-treated samples, namely, instead of the ManxAran peaks, RaLAMembyielded mainly the noncapped Ara4 and Ara6(Fig. 4 B, inset). In comparison with α-mannosidase-treated normal RaLAM, the amount of Ara4and Ara6 terminal motifs were clearly reduced relative to Ara2, indicating that a larger proportion of the arabinan of RaLAMemb terminated prematurely, concomitant with loss of mannose capping. In support of the HPAEC analysis, glycosyl composition analysis showed that the Ara:Man ratio for RaLAMemb was 2.03, whereas that of a “normal” RaLAM was 0.95. ESI-MS analysis of the permethyl derivatives of the digestion products further confirmed that the major oligoarabinosyl motifs detected were devoid of Man capping (Fig. 4 B). In addition to Ara2, Ara4, and Ara6, significant amounts of Ara7 (m/z 1326), Ara8 (m/z 1486), and larger oligoarabinosides (Ara9 up to at least Ara14) were also detected. Together, the data clearly showed that application of 0.5 μg/ml of Emb to the M. tuberculosis, H37Ra culture has drastically led to complete inhibition of mannose capping, concomitant with significant alteration in the underlying arabinan framework. The LAM isolated from Emb-resistant CSU19 clinical isolate (TbLAM) grown without any Emb showed endoarabinanase digestion/HPAEC and MS profiles (Fig. 5) distinct from that of RvLAM. TbLAM was deduced to be more heterogeneous in the spread of size, ranging from full size to severely truncated even in the absence of Emb (results not shown). Its average Ara:Man molar ratio of 1.44 is somewhat intermediate between a normal mannose-capped LAM (∼1.0) and the noncapped RaLAMemb(2.03). The HPAEC profile of its endoarabinanase digestion products indicated that peaks corresponding to Man2Ara4(peak 4) and Ara4 (peak 2) were almost of equal abundance, whereas the Man4Ara6 peak (peak 5) was reduced in relative abundance (Fig. 5, inset). Interestingly, after α-mannosidase digestion, the relative ratio of the resultant Ara2, Ara4, and Ara6 peaks was comparable with that of RvLAM and RaLAM, indicating that the difference was mainly due to mannose capping. FAB-MS analysis of the TbLAM digestion products corroborated this observation (Fig. 5). Qualitatively, all peaks observed for RvLAM were also present in TbLAM but with significant changes in relative intensities. Most obvious was the enhanced abundance of molecular ions corresponding to Ara4 (m/z 846) relative to Man2Ara4 (m/z 1254), wh"

Russell D.G. Adv. Parasitol. 1992; 31: 175-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A family of unique Leishmania glycoconjugates, the phosphoglycans (PGs),1 have been implicated as virulence factors of these parasites in the mammalian host and as essential molecules for survival and development in their sandfly vector (2Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The phosphoglycan family of parasite molecules is characterized by linear or branched arrays of disaccharide phosphate repeats ([6-Galβ1–4Manα1-PO4-]n) that may carry glycan side chains and often terminate at their nonreducing ends with mannose-rich oligosaccharide caps (Fig. 1 A).Leishmania PG repeats and caps exists 1) as free secreted phosphoglycan chains (3Greis K.D.

A series of earlier investigations have demonstrated that developmental modifications of LPG in the Leishmania insect (promastigote) stages are instrumental for the phenomenon of vector competence, and that they may play an important role during transmission to the mammalian host (8Sacks D.L.

Furthermore, a recent study has shown unequivocally an essential role for both LPG and PPGs for successful colonization of Phlebotomus papatasi by Leishmania major (13Sacks D.L. Modi G. Rowton E. Späth G. Epstein L. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The notion that phosphoglycan assembly in Leishmania is a specialized virulence pathway (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) required for infection of a mammalian host was based on a number of investigations on LPG-deficient mutants, which were shown to be unable to colonize macrophages or mammals (16King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 18Elhay M.J. Kelleher M. Bacic A. McConville M.J. Tolson D.L. Pearson T.W. Handman E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This lack of virulence was explained by an apparently essential role of LPG in parasite uptake by macrophages, for resistance of the parasites to toxic and lytic host influences inside and outside the macrophage, and for modulation of the host immune response (19Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By contrast to these studies, recent results in our laboratory have shown that LPG is not required for successful experimental infections of macrophages or mice by Leishmania mexicana (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), arguing against a crucial role for this molecule in virulence to mammals. These results did not, however, preclude a role for PG assembly as a virulence pathway, as the virulent LPG-deficient L. mexicana strains generated in this study still contained abundant PGs linked to various PPGs (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one of the avirulent LPG-deficientL. donovani mutants (C3PO) generated by chemical mutagenesis in earlier studies (17McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar) proved to be not only deficient for LPG, but appeared to lack also protein-bound PG repeats on the secreted acid phosphatase (SAP) (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A defect in the gene lpg2 encoding a Golgi GDP-Man transporter was identified as the cause for the down-regulation of PG repeat synthesis in this mutant (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol.

These results taken together with the identification of abundantly expressed amastigote-specific PPGs in Leishmania-infected tissue (21Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 215-227Google Scholar,22Ilg T. Craik D. Currie G. Multhaup G. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that, instead of LPG, PG repeat-modified PPGs may be crucial for Leishmania virulence in the mammalian host (6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated this question more stringently inL. mexicana using a fortuitously isolated mutant with an unknown defect and defined mutants generated by targeted disruption of the Golgi GDP-Man transporter gene of this species. These mutants were devoid of PG repeats, but synthesized normal or reduced levels of mannooligosaccharide caps, respectively. Surprisingly, despite the lack of PG repeat synthesis in promastigotes as well as amastigotes, both mutants were as efficient or more efficient than wild type L. mexicana with respect to binding to and uptake into macrophages, and did not show any impairment with respect to survival, transformation and multiplication within macrophages. After experimental infections of mice, lesions developed with both mutants at high and low challenge doses and disease progression was comparable to that observed in infections with wild type parasites. These results suggest that, in contrast to previous assumptions, phosphoglycan synthesis is not an absolute requirement for infectivity of L. mexicana to mammals. Promastigotes of the Leishmania mexicana wild type (WT) strain MNYC/BZ/62/M379 and derived gene deletion mutants were grown at 27 °C in semi-defined medium 79 (SDM) supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum as described previously (23Ilg T.

Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Total lipids from washed L. mexicana promastigotes were obtained by two extractions with chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3). High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC; Silica 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of total lipids was performed as described earlier (30McConville M.J. Collidge T.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15595-15604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the solvent chloroform/methanol/1 mNH4OH (10:10:3). Glycolipids on HPTLC plates were selectively stained by orcinol/H2SO4.Leishmania promastigotes were metabolically labeled by incubating 5 × 107 cells/ml overnight at 27 °C with either 10 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol or 50 μCi/ml 2-[3H]d-mannose (Hartmann Analytics) in myo-inositol- or glucose/mannose-free SDM, respectively. HPTLC-separated radioactively labeled lipids were detected by spraying with En3Hance (DuPont) and fluorography.myo-[3H]Inositol or 2-[3H]d-mannose-labeled delipidated cells were incubated with benzonuclease to cleave nucleic acids (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled compounds were detected by immersion of the polyacrylamide gel in Amplify™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by drying and fluorography. L. mexicana amastigotes were isolated from BALB/c mice that were infected 10 weeks earlier with L. mexicana wild type promastigotes. After their transformation to promastigotes, IFM studies using the mAb LT6 directed against PG disaccharide repeats (Fig.1 A) unexpectedly showed that >95% of the parasites in one of the reisolated L. mexicana lines displayed no surface fluorescence signal. Limiting dilution cloning resulted in several L. mexicana clones that were completely unreactive with mAb LT6. This fortuitous isolation of a mAb LT6-negative, and therefore potentially PG repeat-negative, L. mexicana strain (termed “PG repeat-negative mutant”) from an infected mouse prompted us to generate more defined deletion mutants for the lmexlpg2 gene, whose homologue in L. donovani is essential for PG repeat synthesis (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The L. mexicana lmexlpg2 gene, which was isolated by homology cloning using a PCR-amplified L. donovani lpg2 gene probe, contained an open reading frame of 1023 base pairs and the deduced protein sequence showed a remarkably high identity (94.7%) and similarity (96.5%) to L. donovani LPG2 (Fig. 1 B). A hydrophobicity plot indicates the presence of 10–12 transmembrane regions (Fig. 1 C), as observed previously for L. donovani LPG2 (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis indicates that lmexlpg2 is a single-copy gene (data not shown), and double targeted gene replacement (Fig.2 A) led to the generation oflmexlpg2 null mutants (Fig. 2 B). The resulting promastigote clones showed no growth defect in culture compared with wild type cells (data not shown). Immunoblot studies on total cell lysates using the anti-([6-Galβ1–4Manα1PO4-]n) repeat mAb LT6 (Fig. 1 A) showed that, as in the Δlmexlpg1 mutant (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), LPG-like molecules were completely absent in the PG repeat-negative mutant and in the Δlmexlpg2 mutant. However, in contrast to the Δlmexlpg1 mutant, PPG-like molecules were also absent (Fig. 3 A). These results were confirmed by IFM and FACS studies, which revealed a prominent flagellar pocket and a weak cell surface signal on Δlmexlpg1 mutants (Figs.4 F and 5 A), but no reaction on either the PG repeat-negative mutant or theΔlmexlpg2 mutant (Figs. 4 (G andH) and 5A). With the distinct anti-repeat mAb LT17 (Fig. 1 A), which binds preferentially to PPGsversus LPG (Fig. 3 B), similar results were obtained, except for a very weak signal in immunoblots of the Δlmexlpg2 mutant, which was also apparent in FACS analysis (Fig. 5 B). The anti-mannooligosaccharide cap antibody L7.25 (Fig. 1 A) recognizes LPG and a large number of phosphoglycosylated parasite PPGs (Fig. 3 C, lane 1) (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Ilg T. Menz B. Winter G. Russell D.G. Etges R. Schell D. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Δlmexlpg1 mutant, the immunoblot signal of LPG is absent, as expected (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the signal of PPGs is increased (Fig. 3, B and C,lanes 2). In the PG repeat-negative mutant, L7.25 recognizes the full set of PPGs, whereas LPG is absent. Instead, in the low molecular weight region near the front of the gel, a broad band of L7.25-reactive material is visible that is absent in either wild type parasites or the Δlmexlpg1 mutant (Fig.3 C, lanes 1–3). This material is reminiscent of the LPG precursor GIPL-6 from L. major (31McConville M.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5855-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is also reactive with L7.25. 2T. Ilg, unpublished results. FACS analysis (Fig.5 C) and IFM (data not shown) suggests that surface L7.25 epitopes are not down-regulated in the LT6-negative mutant. Mannooligosaccharide cap synthesis is, however, down-regulated in theΔlmexlpg2 mutant, as judged by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 C, lane 4), FACS analysis (Fig.5 C), and IFM (data not shown), but not to undetectable levels (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). This result indicates that, in contrast to repeat synthesis, the assembly of mannooligosaccharide caps is only partially affected by the loss of the Golgi GDP-mannose transporter. In immunoblot and FACS analysis of the LPG2-deficient L. donovani mutant C3PO (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar) using mAb L7.25, we obtained similar results (data not shown). Concanavalin A, a lectin directed preferentially against α-mannosyl residues, bound more avidly to the surface of Δlmexlpg2 mutants than to the wild type (Fig. 5 D), while its binding to PG repeat-negative or Δlmexlpg1 parasites was unchanged (data not shown). Surface expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane-anchored cell surface metalloproteinase leishmanolysin (gp63) was not diminished in eitherΔlmexlpg1, the PG repeat-negative mutant orΔlmexlpg2 (Fig. 4, A–D). FACS analysis suggested an increase of surface fluorescence by a factor of 2–3 in these mutants (Fig. 5 E), most likely due to better access of the mAb L3.8 to surface gp63 in the absence of LPG rather than an increase in expression of this metalloproteinase (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Attempts to purify LPG-like molecules from promastigotes of L. mexicana PG repeat-negative and Δlmexlpg2 mutants by a standard method (32McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unsuccessful, as described previously for L. mexicana Δlmexlpg1(data not shown; Ref. 7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, absence of LPG in the LT6-negative and Δlmexlpg2 mutants was confirmed by [3H]inositol labelings, which also suggested that there is no increase in gp63 expression in either mutant (Fig.6).Figure 4Immunofluorescence labeling of L. mexicana WT and phosphoglycan-deficient mutant promastigotes.

The molecular masses of 14C-labeled standard proteins are indicated in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The modification of L. mexicana SAP by phosphoglycans was assessed by immunoblots of culture supernatant. Wild type parasites secrete SAP composed of the two subunits SAP1 and SAP2 (Fig.7 A, lane 1), which are modified by mannooligosaccharide caps (Fig.7 B, lane 1) and LT17 binding sites (Fig. 7 C, lane 1). Expression of these epitopes is up-regulated in Δlmexlpg1 mutants, as indicated by a stronger signal and an increase in apparent molecular mass on immunoblots (Fig. 7 A, B and C,lanes 3). The PG repeat-negative mutant showed a normal level of L7.25 epitopes, but LT17 epitopes were absent (Fig. 7,A–C, lanes 4), whereas SAP of theΔlmexlpg2 mutant was devoid of either binding sites. This lack of phosphoglycan caps and repeats led to a considerable decrease in apparent molecular mass (Fig. 7 A,lane 2). As indicated by immunoblots of total cell lysates (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 4) and the FACS analyses (Fig. 5, A–D), the PG-deficient phenotype of Δlmexlpg2 could be reversed by episomal expression of the lmexlpg2 gene from plasmid pX. In summary, it appears that the PG repeat-negative mutant is completely defective in phosphoglycan repeat synthesis but synthesizes normal levels of mannooligosaccharide caps, whileΔlmexlpg2 is almost completely deficient for phosphoglycan repeats and severely down-regulates mannooligosaccharide cap synthesis. Recent reports suggest that the L. mexicana phosphoglycan synthesis pathway is distinct from glycoinositolphospholipid (GIPL) synthesis pathway (33Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4245-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The GIPL profiles of L. mexicana Δlmexlpg1, the PG repeat-negative, and theΔlmexlpg2 mutant are in agreement with this view, as no gross changes in abundance and composition of GIPLs could be detected in comparison with the wild type by either isolation and chemical staining (Fig. 8 A), by [3H]mannose (Fig. 8 B), or bymyo-[3H]inositol labeling (data not shown). Some extra glycolipid bands observed in [3H]mannose labelings of Δlmexlpg1 and Δlmexlpg2 may be due to accumulating LPG core precursors (Fig. 8 B). Phosphoglycan synthesis of Leishmania is considered to be crucial for successful invasion and colonization of mammalian macrophages (6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17McNeely T.B.

However, in macrophage binding experiments, Δlmexlpg2 mutants appeared to be more efficient in attachment than either wild type parasites or gene addback mutants (Fig. 9 A). Transformation to amastigotes and intracellular survival in long term infection studies of macrophages was very similar for Δlmexlpg2, Δlmexlpg1, and PG repeat-negativeL. mexicana mutants compared with wild type parasites or gene addback Δlmexlpg2 mutants (Fig. 9 B). Intracellular multiplication of Δlmexlpg2, Δlmexlpg1, and PG repeat-negative L. mexicana mutant amastigotes appeared to be even more pronounced than that of wild type parasites or gene addback Δlmexlpg2 mutants (Fig. 9 C). Immunofluorescence studies on infected macrophages demonstrated that, as expected, in L. mexicanaΔlmexlpg2- parasitized macrophages PG repeats and mannooligosaccharide caps are largely absent (Fig.10, A, B,E, F, I, and J), while these epitopes are abundant in L. mexicana wild type-infected host cells (Fig. 10, C, D,G, H, K, and L). Collectively these data suggest that, in contrast to previous assumptions, PG repeats and mannooligosaccharide caps are not essential for successful macrophage infections by L. mexicana.Figure 10Immunofluorescence of saponin-permeabilized peritoneal macrophages infected with five L. mexicanaΔlmexlpg2 (A,B, E, F,I, and J) or wild type (C, D, G,H, K, and L) promastigotes per host cell. Infected macrophages were labeled after 3 days in culture with the mAbs LT6 (A andC), LT17 (E and G), and L7.25 (I and K). Counterstaining of the same specimen for DNA was performed with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Dapi; B, D, F,H, J, and L).Leishmania-infected macrophages that can be recognized by the intracellular spotlike 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole signals of the parasite kinetoplasts are marked by arrows, whereas uninfected cells are marked by asterisks.

Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the Golgi GDP-mannose transporter LPG2 specifically (2Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have been implicated in a specialized virulence pathway ofLeishmania that is thought to be required for their infectivity to mammals. To investigate these proposals more stringently, BALB/c mice were infected with wild type,Δlmexlpg2, PG repeat-negative, and, for comparison, with Δlmexlpg1 L. mexicana promastigotes. Mice infected with 107 parasites immediately developed footpad lesions with all parasite strains, whereas a challenge dose of 105 parasites led to a 30–40-day delay in lesion formation (Fig. 11,A–D). Surprisingly, only minor differences in lesion development were observed between L. mexicana wild type parasites or L. mexicana lmexlpg2 + pXlmexlpg2 addback mutants and PG repeat-negative orΔlmexlpg2 mutants (Fig. 11, A–D). As observed previously (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) disease progression caused by the L. mexicana Δlmexlpg1 mutant, which is selectively deficient in LPG synthesis, was faster than in all other strains and mutants investigated in this study. L. mexicana Δlmexlpg2 and PG repeat-negative parasites could be reisolated from lesion tissue, draining lymph nodes and the spleen of infected animals, suggesting that they retained the ability to metastasize in mice. Lack of PG repeat expression in reisolated promastigotes was confirmed by IFM analysis. These results indicate that, in contrast to expectation, PG repeat synthesis in L. mexicana is not required for efficient experimental infection of BALB/c mice. Previous reports have proposed that PG repeat synthesis inLeishmania belongs to a specialized virulence pathway that is essential for survival and development of the parasites throughout their life cycle and for virulence in the mammalian host (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J.

PG repeat-modified molecules include free PG chains, lipid-containing LPG, and the protein-containing PPGs (6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although a crucial role for phosphoglycan synthesis has been unequivocally demonstrated forLeishmania promastigotes within the sandfly (13Sacks D.L. Modi G. Rowton E. Späth G. Epstein L. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and an important role for these molecules during transmission from the insect vector to the mammalian host appears likely (8Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Stierhof Y.-D. Bates P.A. Jacobson R. Schlein Y. Rogers M.E. Handman E. Ilg T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the importance of PG-modified compounds during actual disease formation byLeishmania in the mammalian host has been questioned more recently (7Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In experimental infections with L. mexicana, LPG-deficient lines are indistinguishable from wild type in their infectivity to macrophages and mice; furthermore, a recent study on L. major suggests that this is also the case for this Leishmania species, once transmission has been achieved (35Späth G.F. Epstein L. Leader B. Singer S.M. Avila H.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9258-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although LPG is absent in these virulent LPG-deficient mutants, they still synthesize abundant PPGs, which raises the possibility that these molecules may be the crucial products of the proposed virulence pathway (6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Mengeling B.J. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J.

Important arguments for this notion were 1) the discovery of an avirulent PG repeat-negative L. donovani mutant that was deficient in the Golgi GDP-Man transporter LPG2 (14Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,17McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol.

Turco S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which suggested an essential function; and 3), a range of functional studies on amastigote-expressed aPPG (6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which indicated an important role for this molecule for the colonization of mammalian tissue byLeishmania. The data collected in this study show that, in contrast to the common expectation, at least in L. mexicana, PG repeat synthesis is not a requirement for virulence to the mammalian host. The spontaneous, undefined PG repeat-negative mutant and a defined Δlmexlpg2 mutant are as efficient in colonizing macrophages and BALB/c mice as their parental wild type strain. Both the PG repeat-negative mutant and the Δlmexlpg2 mutant lack wild type LPG and PG repeats on PPGs such as SAP, mPPG (this study), and fPPG (Ref. 6Ilg T. Handman E. Stierhof Y.-D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; data not shown). By contrast, mannooligosaccharide cap structures appear to be present at normal levels in the PG-negative mutant, whereas the Δlmexlpg2 mutant down-regulates the expression of such epitopes considerably on cellular proteins and to undetectable levels on secreted SAP and fPPG. This suggests that, like PG repeat synthesis, mannooligosaccharide cap synthesis occurs primarily in the Leishmania Golgi. However, the presence of some cap epitopes in Δlmexlpg2 promastigotes suggests that these are synthesized in a manner or at a location that does not require the Golgi GDP-Man transporter. By contrast, in immunofluorescence studies onLeishmania-infected macrophages, neither PG repeats nor mannooligosaccharide caps could be detected by monoclonal antibodies, which indicates that amastigotes do not even require this residual cap synthesis observed in promastigotes. The increase in concanavalin A binding on L. mexicana Δlmexlpg2 promastigotes could be due to the increased exposure of α-Man-terminating GIPLs (30McConville M.J. Collidge T.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Schneider P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15595-15604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or N-glycans on the cell surface or the PG repeat-deficient parasites. This increase of potential mannose/fucose receptor binding sites may explain the more avid macrophage binding of mutant versus wild type parasites. The synthesis of the abundant cell surface GIPLs is not affected in any of the virulent PG repeat-deficient mutants, which is in agreement with a potentially essential role for these glycolipids (41Ilgoutz S.C. Zawadzki J.C. Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results of this study provide also an explanation for our recent finding that deletion of the gene ppg2 (36Göpfert U. Goehring N. Klein C. Ilg T. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) encoding the dominant secreted PPG of amastigotes, the aPPG (22Ilg T. Craik D. Currie G. Multhaup G. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13509-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), has only a minor impact on parasite virulence to macrophages or mice (37Ilg T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 489-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).2 It is possible that in other Leishmania species likeL. donovani and L. major, the Golgi GDP-Man transporter LPG2 or PG synthesis in general, are of greater importance to the invading promastigotes and/or the disease-causing amastigotes. Final conclusions on this topic will require studies on mutants of these organisms. In L. mexicana, amastigote-expressed aPPG has been implicated in parasite virulence to the mammalian host (42Peters C. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Peters C. Kawakami M. Kaul M. Ilg T. Overath P. Aebischer T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our more recent results here argue against a central role of aPPG in the disease process caused by this Leishmania species. However, it should be kept in mind that experimental infections of mice mimic the natural situation only incompletely. It is possible that, in the natural life cycle, aPPG and other PPGs provide a subtle advantage to mammalian stage parasites that may, for instance, translate into higher transmission rates.

The gene represents the murine homologue of pescadillo, an uncharacterized gene that is essential for embryonic development in zebrafish. Pescadillo is a strongly conserved gene containing unique structural motifs such as a BRCA1 C-terminal domain, clusters of acidic amino acids and consensus motifs for post-translational modification by SUMO-1. Pescadillo displayed a distinct spatial and temporal pattern of gene expression during brain development, being detected in neural progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons. Although it is not expressed in differentiated astrocytes in vivo, the pescadillo protein is dramatically elevated in malignant human astrocytomas. Yeast strains harboring temperature-sensitive mutations in the pescadillo gene were arrested in either G1 or G2 when grown in nonpermissive conditions, demonstrating that pescadillo is an essential gene in yeast and is required for cell cycle progression. Consistent with the latter finding, DNA synthesis was only observed in mammalian cells expressing the pescadillo protein. These results suggest that pescadillo plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and may be necessary for oncogenic transformation and tumor progression.

Recent studies have been directed toward defining the genes and gene products responsible for glial tumorigenesis and progression. Mutation or loss of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is thought to be an important event in the early neoplastic transformation of astrocytes (1Nagane M. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Rasheed B.K. Wiltshire R.N. Bigner S.H. Bigner D.D. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Studies of human glial tumors have demonstrated that loss of the p53 gene is a frequent event in all grades of astrocytoma. A subpopulation of cells will then proceed to either mutate or delete the remaining copy of the p53 gene, leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Of interest are studies suggesting that some high grade astrocytic malignancies result from clonal expansion of cells that have lost or mutated their p53 (3Sidransky D. Mikkelsen T. Schwechheimer K. Rosenblum M.L. Cavenee W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 355: 846-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The genes that may be adversely regulated following p53 alterations and that might contribute to enhanced growth and survival are just now being identified in different biological contexts but not yet in malignant astrocytes (4Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar, 5Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We have previously established, using cultured astrocytes from p53-deficient mice, an in vitro model of malignant transformation recapitulating glial tumorigenesis (7Yahanda A.M. Bruner J.M. Donehower L.A. Morrison R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Early passage p53−/− astrocytes achieved higher saturation densities than p53+/− and p53+/+ cells but did not exhibit evidence of neoplastic transformation. With continued passaging, p53−/− astrocytes exhibit a multistep progression to a transformed phenotype displaying significant aneuploidy and acquiring the ability to form large, well vascularized tumors in nude mice. In marked contrast, p53+/+ astrocytes fail to show a transformed phenotype and senesce after 7–10 passages. Thus, loss of wild type p53 function promotes genomic instability, accelerated growth, and malignant transformation in astrocytes. Using this model system in conjunction with cDNA microarray technology, we sought to examine the relationship between the progressive phenotypic changes in astrocytes and alterations in gene expression. Glass-based high density microarray hybridization is an efficient way to establish a detailed expression profile of up to 10,000 genes simultaneously from a single tissue or cell type and has been successfully used to analyze tumor- or tissue-specific patterns of gene expression (8Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Khan J. Bittner M.L. Chen Y. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

We have utilized cDNA arrays to identify genes that are differentially expressed between malignant late passage p53−/− astrocytes and nontransformed early passage p53+/+ and p53+/−astrocytes. 1G. Foltz, J. Schuster, Y. Kinoshita, L. Hood, R. S. Morrison, and P. S. Nelson, manuscript in preparation One expressed sequence tag that was up-regulated in malignant p53−/−astrocytes represented the murine homologue of a novel zebrafish gene known as pescadillo (10Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The pescadillo gene was initially identified through an embryonic mutation in zebrafish, which resulted in animals bearing small eyes, impaired brain growth, and aberrant development of the liver and gut. Pescadillo is widely and highly expressed during the first 3 days of zebrafish development but was not observed in any adult tissues except for the ovary, suggesting that its expression is principally limited to developing tissues. In the present study, we present an analysis of the pescadillo protein and provide evidence that pescadillo is a nuclear cell cycle regulatory protein that is abnormally expressed in malignant astrocytes and other transformed cell types. COS-7, HeLa, and SW480 colon carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection. SNB-19 human glioblastoma cells (11Welch W.C. Morrison R.S. Gross J.L. Gollin S.M.

Donehower L.A. Morrison R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Normal human mammary epithelial cells and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells were generously provided by Dr. Karen Swisshelm (Department of Pathology, University of Washington). A primary culture of human glioblastoma cells was established from a primary glioblastoma resected at the University of Washington by previously described methods (12Chicoine M.R. Silbergeld D.L. Cancer. 1995; 75: 2904-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The procedure for obtaining and culturing human tumor tissue received human subjects approval from the Institutional Review Board Committee of the University of Washington, and informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to surgery. All cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, except for HeLa cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Expression constructs encoding pescadillo fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)2 or to a Myc epitope were created using a full-length human pescadillo cDNA (derived from a Soares human fetal brain cDNA library obtained from Research Genetics) inserted into the vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) (13Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) or a Myc-tagged expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Cs2+Myc tag) (14Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), respectively. DNA transfections were performed using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (15Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar) as we described previously (16Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy, or cells were processed for immunoprecipitation. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a peptide derived from the C-terminal 23 amino acids of the human pescadillo protein and used after affinity purification. Custom antibody production service was obtained from Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Protein extracts were prepared from tumor and nonmalignant brain tissue samples as described previously (17Bobola M.S. Blank A. Berger M.S. Silber J.R. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 13: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cultured cells at confluency were lysed in an extraction buffer as described previously (18Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma surgical specimens, as well as brain tissue surrounding the primary tumors (margin tissue) were generously provided by Dr. John Silber from the Department of Neurological Surgery's Brain Tumor Bank (University of Washington). Margin tissue is routinely removed to minimize the chance of recurrence. All patients provided informed consent, allowing their tissue to be used for research purposes. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an affinity purified rabbit anti-pescadillo polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), an anti-SUMO-1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000, 21C7,Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or an anti-c-Myc epitope antibody (9E10 hybridoma culture supernatant (19Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar)) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz). Blots were subsequently reprobed with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, 1:40,000; Sigma) to normalize for protein loading. The ratio of the protein band intensities corresponding to pescadillo and actin (pescadillo/actin) on the x-ray film was determined by densitometric imaging using NIH Image analysis software (version 1.62). For immunoprecipitation COS-7 cells were transfected with the c-Myc-pescadillo construct, and protein extracts were prepared 2 days later as described above for Western blotting. Protein extracts were incubated with anti-c-Myc epitope antibody (9E10 hybridoma culture supernatant) complexed with protein L agarose beads (ImmunoPure immobilized Protein L gel; Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Alternatively, protein extracts were incubated with the anti-SUMO-1 antibody (5 μg) for 3 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated by using Protein L beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3× with lysis buffer and resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting and probing with an appropriate antibody as indicated. Cells were cultured in 4-well multidishes (Nunc), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20–30 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking in a buffer containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% thimerosal in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, cultures were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and/or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (both at 1:1000; Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. Cultures were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and examined under an inverted microscope with fluorescence optics. Fluorescent micrographs were taken on Elite Chrome ASA 400 film (Kodak) and scanned into Photoshop (Adobe). Immunostaining of samples requiring a direct comparison was done in single runs, and the subsequent processing of scanned images was performed in an identical way for individual photographs. Anti-pescadillo antibody was used at 0.5 μg/ml, C23 monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibody (Santa Cruz) at 2 μg/ml, and G3G4 monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1.5 μg/ml. For BrdU immunostaining, cultures were pretreated with DNase I (10 units/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 80 min at room temperature. In situhybridization was performed as described previously using35S-labeled riboprobes (20Kornblum H.I. Chugani H.T. Tatsukawa K. Gall C.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and their brains or whole heads were rapidly frozen in isopentane and sectioned on a cryostat at 20-μm thickness, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and stored at −75 °C. A partial cDNA fragment encoding the mouse pescadillo gene was cloned into Bluescript (Stratagene). An antisense RNA probe was prepared from the NspI- and PvuII-digested plasmid using T7 polymerase in the presence of [35S]UTP. Sense riboprobes transcribed with T3 polymerase and RNase pretreated sections were used as negative controls. Tissue sections were washed, acetylated, defatted, and incubated with the riboprobe overnight. Following RNase A treatment, sections were washed in descending concentrations of SSC, dried, and apposed to autoradiographic film (β-max, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to dipping in Kodak NTB2 emulsion. The slides were then developed and counter-stained with cresyl violet. A complete deletion of the yeast pescadillo homologue 1 (YPH1) open reading frame (YGR103w) was generated using a PCR-mediated gene disruption method (21Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HIS3 gene was amplified from pRS303 with primers (5′-CTTGTAGAAAATAGTATAGTAACAGCGGTATCCTACTTATACAAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′; 5′-GAGAGGCTATTGGAAAAGAAGAGAAAACT- ATTTCTTGGAATCCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′) containing flanking sequences corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of YPH1 open reading frame, respectively. The HIS3 PCR product was transformed in diploid yeast strain YPH982. Gene disruption was confirmed in His+ colonies by PCR analysis. His+ colonies were sporulated, and 10 tetrads were dissected resulting in 2+:2− segregation for viability. All viable spores were His−, indicating that YPH1 is an essential gene. The temperature-sensitive mutations were generated using a PCR-mediated procedure and integrated into the genome at the LEU2 locus (22Connelly C. Hieter P. Cell. 1996; 86: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-kilobase PvuII-PvuII DNA fragment derived from a yeast genomic clone was cloned into pRS316 generating pRS316YPH1, which was then used as a template for PCR random mutagenesis. yph1–24 and yph1–45 mutant alleles were subcloned into p679LEU2 vector and integrated at the LEU2 locus generating YJMF29 (Mata ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 leu2-Δ 1 yph1::HIS3 yph1–24:LEU2) and YJMF30 (Mata ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63 leu2-Δ 1 yph1::HIS3 yph1-45:LEU2), respectively. Cells growing in logarithmic phase at 25 °C were split and incubated at either 25 or 37 °C for 3 h and subjected to DNA content analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (23Gerring S.L. Spencer F. Hieter P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or treated with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindol and anti-tubulin antibody to monitor nuclear and bud morphology using fluorescent microscopy. p53−/− astrocytes maintained in culture for 20 or more passages display the ability to form colonies in soft agar and form large, well vascularized tumors in nude mice, in contrast to p53+/+ astrocytes and early passage p53−/−and p53+/− astrocytes (7Yahanda A.M. Bruner J.M. Donehower L.A. Morrison R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We attempted to characterize changes in gene expression that were associated with these markedly different behavioral phenotypes using glass-based high density cDNA arrays. We observed a reproducible series of genes whose expression pattern was altered as a result of continuous proliferation in the absence of p53.1 One cDNA in particular was expressed at higher levels in late passage p53−/− astrocytes relative to early passage p53−/− or p53+/+astrocytes and matched the sequence of an uncharacterized gene referred to as pescadillo (10Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The pescadillo gene was selected for further study in malignant astrocytes because its expression was largely restricted to periods of embryonic development, and it was shown to be essential for nervous system development in zebrafish. The human pescadillo gene is well conserved among a variety of species and shares 40 and 79% sequence homology with yeast and zebrafish pescadillo homologues, respectively (Fig.1 A). The human, zebrafish, and yeast pescadillo proteins range in size from 582 to 605 amino acids, and each contains several unique structural motifs including a BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain, two extensive acidic amino acid clusters (glutamic and aspartic acid) in the C terminus, numerous presumptive tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, and several conserved consensus sequences for covalent attachment of SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin modification) (24Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). All three pescadillo homologues contain putative nuclear localization signals, suggesting that pescadillo may function in the nucleus. The subcellular distribution of the pescadillo protein was evaluated by immunostaining and by expressing a Myc or GFP fusion construct. Endogenous pescadillo detected by an affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide was typically observed as highly localized, punctate immunofluorescence in the nucleus with faint nucleoplasmic staining (Figs. 1 B, panel A, and4). This punctate immunofluorescence appeared to be associated with nucleoli when viewed under phase contrast optics, which was confirmed by double labeling with an anti-nucleolin antibody (Fig. 1 B,panels B and C). The distribution of endogenous pescadillo protein was consistent with the pattern obtained after expressing tagged forms of pescadillo, GFP-pescadillo (Fig.1 B, panel D) and Myc-pescadillo (Fig.1 B, panel E). This punctate nuclear distribution was reproducibly observed in every cell type transfected with the GFP-pescadillo construct including human glioblastoma cells, HeLa cells, normal human diploid fibroblasts, and p53−/− mouse astrocytes (data not shown). These results confirm the specificity of the anti-pescadillo antibody as well as the normal distribution of the epitope-tagged forms of pescadillo. Interestingly, postmitotic primary cortical neurons in culture displayed a different distribution pattern than that observed in the proliferating cell types; the distribution was significantly more diffuse throughout the nucleus (data not shown). These results demonstrate that pescadillo is a nuclear protein whose compartmentalization within the nucleus may be regulated in a cell type-dependent manner. The predicted molecular mass for the human pescadillo protein is 69.2 kDa. Immunoblots of extracts prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with human Myc-pescadillo and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody displayed two bands corresponding to molecular masses of ∼72 and 94 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Both bands were absent in extracts prepared from cells transfected with the empty Myc-tagged vector. The 94-kDa protein (pes*) was a more prominent band and was also observed in total cell extracts not subjected to immunoprecipitation. The 72-kDa band corresponded to the predicted size of the full-length pescadillo protein plus the Myc epitopes contained in the expression construct. We hypothesized that the 94-kDa band represented a post-translationally modified form of pescadillo because it was only observed in Myc-pescadillo transfected cells. We directly tested this possibility in the following study. The pescadillo protein sequence was evaluated for the presence of various post-translational modification motifs. We observed the presence of several potential consensus sequences ((I/L)KXEX(K/R)) for the covalent modification by the ubiquitin-like protein, SUMO-1 (24Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved site was found at position 516–521 (LKLEDK). The size of the 94-kDa band was consistent with the covalent attachment of the SUMO-1 protein, which has been shown to increase the apparent molecular mass of proteins by ∼20 kDa on SDS-PAGE (25Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To test for the presence of the SUMO-1 modification, immunoblots were performed using extracts prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-pescadillo and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-SUMO-1 antibody. The blot was subsequently probed with an anti-Myc antibody, and only the 94-kDa band was detected (Fig. 2 B). Identical results were obtained when Myc-pescadillo was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the blot was probed with the anti-SUMO-1 antibody (data not shown). In contrast to the results obtained from pescadillo transfection studies, the unmodified band (70 kDa) represented the major endogenous form of pescadillo protein in a human glioblastoma cell line, COS-7 cells and in late passage p53−/− mouse astrocytes (Fig.2 C). A band migrating at about 92 kDa, consistent with the presence of SUMO-1, was detected in these cell lines if a film was overexposed (data not shown). These results confirm the presence and molecular mass of the pescadillo translation product and demonstrate that under some circumstances the pescadillo protein may be modified by the covalent attachment of SUMO-1. The cellular distribution and the temporal pattern of pescadillo expression were evaluated in the mammalian brain to determine which cell types in the brain normally express pescadillo. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the pescadillo mRNA was found to be widely and highly expressed throughout the developing mouse brain and spinal cord at embryonic day 13, consistent with its expression in neural progenitor cells and developing neurons (Fig. 3 A). No hybridization was detected with the sense probe or in tissue sections pretreated with RNase A (data not shown). At the day of birth (P0; Fig. 3, Band C), hybridization was present in the germinal zones and developing neuronal fields, with relatively intense hybridization detected in the developing hippocampus, piriform, and entorhinal cortices. No hybridization signal was present within developing white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum (Fig. 3 B). Throughout postnatal development, the general pattern of distribution did not appear to change (data not shown). In the adult, labeling was detected in many, if not all, neurons of the brain, but with some regional specificity. The most intense hybridization was present in allocortical regions such as the hippocampus (Fig. 3, E–G), especially in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Pescadillo mRNA was also present within the rostral portions of the germinal zone lining the lateral ventricles (Fig. 3 D). This area is the site of continuing neurogenesis in the adult brain. Little or no hybridization signal was present within white matter in the adult (Fig.3 I), suggesting that normal glial cells do not express pescadillo. The in situ hybridization studies described above demonstrate that pescadillo is not normally expressed by differentiated astrocytes in vivo. Therefore, to confirm that pescadillo is abnormally expressed in malignant astrocytes as suggested from our cDNA microarray results,1 we compared the expression of the pescadillo protein in normal and transformed mouse astrocytes in culture. Low levels of pescadillo immunoreactivity were detectable in primary cultures of p53−/− (Fig. 4,A and C) and p53+/+ astrocytes (data not shown). As previously reported, p53+/+ astrocytes and early passage p53−/− astrocytes display a normal pattern of contact-inhibited growth and fail to form tumors in nude mice (7Yahanda A.M. Bruner J.M. Donehower L.A. Morrison R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Pescadillo immunoreactivity in primary cultures of p53−/−astrocytes was localized to the nucleus and in the same punctate pattern that was observed following transfection with GFP-pescadillo. Also, pescadillo immunoreactivity remained constant in these cultures independent of cell density or length of time in culture (up to 3 weeks; data not shown). In marked contrast, pescadillo immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in malignant, late passage p53−/− mouse astrocytes (Fig. 4, B andD), and the subcellular distribution remained the same in malignant astrocytes. Significant up-regulation of pescadillo protein expression was also observed in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 4, F and H) compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 4, E and G). Additionally, significant levels of pescadillo immunoreactivity were detected in a variety of human cancer cell lines including glioblastoma, colon carcinoma (Fig. 4), and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cells, Figs. 1 and 6). To demonstrate that pescadillo expression was not elevated in established cell lines simply because of long term growth in culture, we evaluated pescadillo expression in a primary culture of human glioblastoma cells that was directly dissociated out of a surgically resected tumor specimen without being passaged. The primary glioblastoma culture expressed the same intense nuclear pescadillo immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 J) that was seen in the established cell lines (Fig. 4, I, K, and L). This finding indicated that pescadillo expression may be elevated in malignant astrocytes in vivo. We evaluated this possibility by comparing the levels of pescadillo protein in matched tissue pairs resected from individual patients consisting of malignant brain tumor tissue and the brain tissue surrounding the tumor (margin). Pescadillo was also evaluated in nonmalignant brain tissue obtained from patients without neoplastic disease. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that the pescadillo protein was highly expressed in malignant human glial tumors including four glioblastomas and one anaplastic astrocytoma (Fig. 5). When pescadillo expression levels were normalized against actin expression levels, the malignant tumors exhibited up to a 12-fold increase in pescadillo expression relative to the matching margin tissue. Variations in pescadillo expression between tumor-margin pairs may reflect the fact that margin tissue is generally composed of normal glial cells and variable degrees of infiltrative tumor cells. These findings clearly demonstrate that the pescadillo protein is abnormally elevated in malignant human tumors of astrocytic origin. The BRCT (BRCA1 C terminus) motif has been identified in a superfamily of proteins involved in various aspects of DNA repair, recombination, and checkpoint control (26Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P.

The observation of NADH and NADPH oxidation by intact mitochondria from the nde-1 mutant suggests the existence of a second external NAD(P)H dehydrogenase.

The process of oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereby the electrons produced by the oxidation of substrates like NAD(P)H are transported through the electron transport chain to oxygen, coupled to the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient that eventually leads to ATP synthesis (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 59: 1015-1069Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to mammals, the electron transport chains of plants and fungi possess several nonproton-pumping NAD(P)H dehydrogenases for transferring electrons to ubiquinone (2Møller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 21-27Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the case of potato tubers, four rotenone-insensitive NAD(P)H dehydrogenases have been identified in the inner mitochondrial membrane, two with the catalytic site facing the matrix (3MØller I.M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the proton-pumping complex I is not present, the oxidation of NADH and NADPH is performed exclusively by three nonproton-pumping enzymes, one facing the matrix and two facing the intermembrane space (6de Vries S.

In addition, the genome analysis ofSynechocystis revealed three open reading frames that may code for such type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (9Howitt C.A. Udall P.K. Vermaas W.F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3994-4003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, only one external type II NADH dehydrogenase was reported for the fungus Yarrowia lipolytica (10Kerscher S.J. Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although NAD(P)H dehydrogenases have been studied for a long time, our understanding of protein function at the molecular level is still very incomplete.

These enzymes might constitute a wasteful system acting to prevent the overreduction of the electron transport components and the production of reactive oxygen species, but their exact roles remain unclear. Both proton-pumping and nonproton-pumping NAD(P)H dehydrogenases have been described in Neurospora crassa mitochondria. In 1970, the presence of at least two different rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenases in the inner membrane was described (14Weiss H. von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Butcher T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), one on the inner side catalyzing the oxidation of matrix NADH and a second on the outer side accessible to cytosolic NADH and NADPH. It was later reported that the external NAD(P)H activity is partly calcium-dependent (15Møller I.M. Schwitzguébel J.-P. Palmer J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The internal rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase is not linked to the formation of ATP and is very active in the early exponential phase of growth (16Schwitzguébel J.-P. Palmer J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2387-2397Google Scholar). Here we identify NDE1, previously called p64 (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as an external calcium-dependent NADPH dehydrogenase and provide evidence for the presence of at least a second dehydrogenase; both enzymes oxidize reduced pyridine nucleotides from the cytosol of N. crassa cells. General manipulation ofN. crassa, including crosses, was performed by standard procedures (17Davis R.H. de Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 18Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4869-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The wild-type strain 74-OR23–1A and thende-1 mutant were grown in Vogel's minimal medium. The techniques for the preparation of N. crassa mitochondria and IO-SMP1 either for oxygen electrode measurements (4Melo A.M.P. Roberts T.H. MØller I.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 133-139Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or for digitonin and import experiments (19Werner S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as well as the isolation of mitochondria from S. cerevisiae wild-type strain d-273–108 (20Rojo E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8040-8047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), have been described. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of NDE1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two specific primers and cloned in pCR II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Precursor polypeptides were synthesized in vitro with a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (21Segui-Real B. Kispal G. Lill R. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and imported intoN. crassa or S. cerevisiae mitochondria. Import reactions were performed in a medium containing 0.5 msorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 1% (v/v) ethanol, 2 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1% (v/v) of rabbit reticulocytes with the relevant radiolabeled precursors, and 0.2 mg/ml mitochondria for 20 min at 25 °C. To abolish the membrane potential, 0.1 mm valinomycin was added, and creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were omitted. After import, mitochondria were incubated with 30 μg/ml trypsin on ice for 15 min, and the protease activity was stopped by the addition of 800 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (22Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Swelling of yeast mitochondria was achieved in media without sorbitol. The cDNA encoding NDE1 (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was excised from pBluescript by digestion at flanking Pvu II restriction sites, inserted in the Eco RV restriction site of the pCSN44 vector, and transformed into N. crassa spheroplasts (18Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4869-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Individual transformants were selected on hygromycin B (Sigma) plates (200 μg/ml) and purified by several asexual transfers in Vogel's minimal medium plus 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. A single copy transformant was identified by Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA (23Lee S.B. Milgroom M.G. Taylor J.W. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1988; 35: 23-24Crossref Google Scholar, 24Videira A. Azevedo J.E. Werner S. Cabral P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and crossed with the wild-type strain 74-OR23–1A to obtain mutants by repeat-induced point mutations (25Selker E.U. Garrett P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6870-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,26Alves P.C. Videira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7777-7784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of nde-1 mutants among the progeny of the cross was carried out by the analysis of Western blots (27Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) of mitochondrial proteins with an antiserum against NDE1 (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To analyze gene expression, N. crassa mRNA was isolated from conidial (germinating asexual spores), mycelial (branching hyphae), or perithecial (fruiting body or sexual) tissues (28Nelson M.A. Metzenberg R.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 149-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots (29Nelson M.A. Morelli G. Carattoli A. Romano N. Macino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were hybridized with random primer-labeled restriction fragments from four N. crassa cDNA clones obtained from three cDNA libraries (30Nelson M.A. Kang S. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Dolan P.L. Leonard P.M. Mitchell J. Armijo A.M. Bean L. Blueyes E. Cushing T. Errett A. Fleharty M. Gorman M. Judson K. Miller R. Ortega J. Pavlova I. Perea J. Todisco S. Trujillo R. Valentine J. Wells A. Werner- Washburne M. Yazzie S. Natvig D.O. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The probes used were NM1C2, encoding NDE1, and SC3A5, SM1F6, and SP6B10, which encode the 12.3-, 17.8-, and 21-kDa subunits, respectively, of the mitochondrial complex I. Respiration was measured polarographically at 25 °C with a Hansatech oxygen electrode in a total volume of 1 ml. Assays with mitochondria and IO-SMP contained 0.3–0.5 mg of protein, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 4 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. For the pH experiments, the reaction medium contained 20 mm MES, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm MOPS, 0.3m sucrose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 4.7–9.2 with KOH. Calcium depletion was achieved with 1 mm EGTA. The assays were initiated by the addition of either 1 mm NADH or 1 mm NADPH. Rotenone and antimycin A were added to final concentrations of 20 μm and 0.2 μg/ml, respectively. Integrity of mitochondria and sidedness of IO-SMP were assessed by the activities of cytochrome-c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) in the absence and presence of Triton X-100 (31MØller I.M. Lidén A.C. Ericson I. Gardeström P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 442-453Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for cloning, agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting (32Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar), and the development of rabbit antisera (36Videira A. Werner S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Digitonin solubilization followed by proteinase K treatment (37Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and Na2CO3 extraction (24Videira A. Azevedo J.E. Werner S. Cabral P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) of mitochondrial proteins have been described. To investigate the specific role of NDE1, we disrupted the corresponding gene by the generation of repeat-induced point mutations, an unusual phenomenon that causes methylation and GC to AT transition mutations of repeated sequences inNeurospora (38Selker E.U. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Briefly, a strain carrying two copies of the nde-1 gene was generated and crossed with a wild-type strain to achieve the inactivation of both copies of nde-1 in the duplication strain. Mitochondrial proteins from individual ascospore progeny were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against NDE1 (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a mutant strain lacking the polypeptide was identified (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). Because we initially thought that NDE1 was acting on the inner side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, oxidizing matrix NADH as an alternative to complex I, we crossed thende-1 mutant with several mutants in subunits of complex I. Surprisingly, we obtained double mutants in crosses betweennde-1 and the complex I mutants nuo51 (39Fecke W. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar),nuo24 (40Almeida T. Duarte M. Melo A.M.P. Videira A. Eur. J.

Genetics. 1995; 139: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, which display various phenotypes in terms of complex I assembly and function. Fig. 1, lane 3 depicts the analysis of the double mutant nde-1/nuo51, which expresses a nonfunctional complex I. We would expect these double mutants to be nonviable due to severe deficiency in the oxidation of matrix NADH, because only complex I and one alternative dehydrogenase were described in Neurospora (14Weiss H. von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Butcher T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, these results represented the first indication that NDE1 was using cytosolic NAD(P)H as a substrate. Thus, despite the fact that complex I is required for sexual development (44Duarte M. Mota N. Pinto L. Videira A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), neither complex I nor NDE1 is essential forNeurospora vegetative growth under standard conditions. We analyzed the expression of the corresponding genes throughout the life cycle of the fungus and performed a Northern blot analysis of mRNA from conidia (germinating asexual spores), mycelia (branching hyphae), or perithecia (fruiting bodies) using cDNAs encoding NDE1 and complex I subunits as probes. The results demonstrated that all transcripts, and probably the encoded proteins, are expressed constitutively throughout the Neurospora life cycle (data not shown). This finding is corroborated by the identification of the various cDNA clones in three different cDNA libraries, representing both vegetative and sexual stages of development (30Nelson M.A. Kang S. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Dolan P.L. Leonard P.M. Mitchell J. Armijo A.M. Bean L. Blueyes E. Cushing T. Errett A. Fleharty M. Gorman M. Judson K. Miller R. Ortega J. Pavlova I. Perea J. Todisco S. Trujillo R. Valentine J. Wells A. Werner- Washburne M. Yazzie S. Natvig D.O. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2M. A. Nelson, unpublished results. To characterize the activity of NDE1, mitochondria and IO-SMP were prepared from wild type and the nde-1 mutant and tested for different activities under various conditions. The oxidation rates of NADH and NADPH were followed polarographically with an oxygen electrode. The rotenone-insensitive oxidation rates for both substrates at pH 7.2 were similar in IO-SMP from both strains. In addition, when intact mitochondria were assayed with NADH at pH 7.2 no significant difference was found between the two strains. However, NDE1-defective mitochondria showed very reduced oxidation activity relative to the wild-type organelles when NADPH was used as substrate. All activities were fully inhibited by antimycin A (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out a detailed characterization of exogenous NAD(P)H oxidation by mitochondria from both strains by following the oxidation rates of NADH and NADPH in the pH range from 4.7 to 9.2, in the presence or absence of calcium (Fig.2). The data were examined by the statistical analysis of variance-covariance (ANCOVA), using as covariate the value of pH (45Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall International, London1996Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in the pattern of NADH oxidation between mitochondria from the two strains throughout the pH range, neither in the presence (p = 0.29) nor in the absence of calcium (p = 0.089). NADH oxidation by both strains was unaffected by calcium at acidic pH, whereas decreased activity in the absence of calcium was observed under alkaline conditions (Fig. 2, a and b). The differences were not statistically significant either in wild type (p = 0.62) or in nde-1 (p = 0.89) in the pH range from 4.7 to 7.4 but were significant both in wild type (p < 0.001) and nde-1(p < 0.01) when the pH range from 7.7 to 9.2 was considered. In contrast, there was a clear difference in NADPH oxidation. In the presence of calcium, wild-type mitochondria oxidized NADPH from pH 4.7 to 8.3, whereas mitochondria from thende-1 mutant had no activity above pH 7.2. Under calcium depletion conditions, a drastic reduction in NADPH oxidation rate was observed in wild-type mitochondria. At pH 8, this activity was totally dependent on calcium (Fig. 2 c). The statistical analysis revealed that calcium had a highly significant effect on wild-type activity throughout the pH range (p < 0.001). In contrast, the oxidation of NADPH by mitochondria from thende-1 mutant was not significantly affected by calcium (Fig.2 d), as confirmed by the statistical analysis (p = 0.63). These results clearly indicate that NDE1 is the external calcium-dependent NADPH dehydrogenase. Several approaches were employed to obtain a more detailed characterization of the topology of NDE1. Fig.3 displays the accessibility of the protein to proteinase K upon the fractionation of mitochondria with increasing concentrations of digitonin. The opening of mitochondrial membranes was monitored by the use of antisera against the mitochondrial processing peptidase (46Hawlitschek G. Schneider H. Schmidt B. Tropschug M. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Cell. 1988; 53: 795-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), the ADP/ATP carrier (47Kubrich M. Rassow J. Voos W. Pfanner N. Honlinger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), cytochrome c heme-lyase (48Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Nargang F. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and TOM20 (49Sollner T. Griffiths G. Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) as markers for the matrix, inner membrane, intermembrane space, and outer membrane, respectively. TOM20, with domains facing the cytosol, was readily digested by proteinase K. Total solubilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane was achieved at a digitonin concentration of 0.2% as attested by the disappearance of cytochrome c heme-lyase. The inner mitochondrial membrane was solubilized at the highest digitonin concentration (2%). The behavior of NDE1 parallels that of cytochrome c heme-lyase; when the outer membrane was opened at 0.2% digitonin concentration, its exposure to proteinase K resulted in two resistant fragments. The larger fragment of 57 kDa remained membrane-bound as shown in Fig. 3, right panel. In this experiment, a mitochondrial sample incubated with 0.3% digitonin and proteinase K was incubated with Na2CO3 and resolved into pellet and supernatant to discriminate between intrinsic and extrinsic membrane proteins. The mitochondrial processing peptidase and the ADP/ATP carrier were used as controls. Preliminary experiments of in vitro import of NDE1 into mitochondria were performed. In parallel experiments, the precursor of subunit F1β of ATPase (50Rassow J. Harmey M.A. Muller H.A. Neupert W. Tropschug M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used as control. The precursor of NDE1 was synthesized in vitro and imported intoNeurospora mitochondria with and without a membrane potential. Import and processing to the mature form was only achieved in the former case (data not shown), a typical result for an inner membrane protein (51Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Because it is not possible to swellNeurospora mitochondria, the NDE1 precursor was also successfully imported into and processed in yeast mitochondria, as deduced by the resistance of the mature form of the protein to added trypsin, again only in the presence of a membrane potential (Fig.4). In addition, and in contrast to F1β, mature NDE1 was made accessible to the protease in the mitoplasts generated by the swelling of mitochondria, in agreement with the results obtained in the digitonin experiments. We have further characterized an NADPH dehydrogenase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which, like the proton-pumping complex I, is constitutively expressed throughout the Neurospora life cycle. The isolation of double mutants lacking these enzymes clearly indicated that the fungus has additional alternative ways of oxidizing NAD(P)H. The combination of data from several strategies indicated that the NDE1 polypeptide is an intrinsic protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane with its catalytic site facing the intermembrane space. InN. crassa, the protein is probably anchored to the membrane by an N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 73–94), the segment displaying the highest probability of being transmembrane, based on computer prediction analysis. A second predicted transmembrane domain (residues 173–196) is unlikely, because it would place the two dinucleotide binding sites (presumably for FAD and NAD(P)H) on opposite sides of the membrane. It is not clear whether a third predicted transmembrane domain at the C-terminal end is present (residues 620–639). Inactivation of NDE1 was a crucial step in elucidating its function. Comparison of rotenone-insensitive NADH and NADPH oxidation by IO-SMP from the nde-1 mutant and the wild-type strain revealed a similar behavior, and NADH oxidation by intact mitochondria from the two strains was identical. In contrast, NADPH oxidation at physiological pH was lacking in intact mitochondria from thende-1 mutant. Thus, we conclude that NDE1 is the external NADPH dehydrogenase of N. crassa mitochondria. The protein contains two GX GXX G motifs within β sheet-α helix-β sheet structures for binding NAD(P)H and FAD (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We are tempted to speculate that the first segment of NDE1 binds NADPH, because the third Gly in NADPH-binding proteins is generally replaced by Ser, Ala, or Pro, and a conserved negative charge at the end of the second β sheet is missing (52Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and might be substituted by an Asn, avoiding the unfavorable interaction between the negatively charged residue and the negatively charged 2′-phosphate of NADPH (53MØller I.M. Johnston S.P. Palmer J.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These features are present in the first, and absent from the second, dinucleotide-binding motif of NDE1 (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NDE1 protein is homologous to the type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases ofS. cerevisiae (6de Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kotter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.K. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but, in contrast to them, it contains an additional domain predicted to bind calcium (11Melo A.M.P. Duarte M. Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This E-F hand motif is also present in the external NDB protein fromSolanum tuberosum mitochondria (13Rasmusson A.G. Svensson A.S. Knoop V. Grohmann L. Brennicke A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in a putative NADH:ubiquinone reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana(AC006234.3). We found that calcium had a similar effect on NADH oxidation by mitochondria from the nde-1 mutant and wild type, whereas there were significant differences regarding its effect on NADPH oxidation in the two strains. Wild-type mitochondria displayed strong calcium sensitivity, and the presence of the cation was absolutely required for activity at physiological pH. Because oxidation of NADPH by nde-1 mitochondria was not affected by calcium, we demonstrated experimentally that the NADPH oxidation activity of the NDE1 protein is calcium-dependent. Previous work has documented a calcium stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase activities inNeurospora (15Møller I.M. Schwitzguébel J.-P. Palmer J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and plant (53MØller I.M. Johnston S.P. Palmer J.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) mitochondria, although the mechanism by which calcium stimulates activity is not yet clear. It was suggested that this divalent cation has an important role in avoiding electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate groups of NADPH and the catalytic site of the enzyme localized in a net negatively charged environment like the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (54Edman K. Ericson I. MØller I.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is also likely that calcium binding induces conformational changes that increase the enzyme-substrate affinity. Following external NADH and NADPH oxidation from acidic to alkaline conditions (pH 4.7–9.2), two distinct activities were identified inN. crassa mitochondria. One corresponds to NDE1, which oxidizes NADPH and is calcium-dependent. The other, which remains active in mutant nde-1 mitochondria, can be attributed to an NDE2 enzyme that oxidizes NADH throughout the pH range and is also able to oxidize NADPH at acidic pH. The inability of the putative NDE2 to oxidize NADPH at pH higher than 7.2 may explain the need for a separate enzyme, NDE1, to regenerate the cytosolic NAD(P)+ pool required in several biosynthetic pathways.N. crassa also contains at least one internal rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase (14Weiss H. von Jagow G. Klingenberg M. Butcher T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The presence of these nonproton-pumping alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases varies between different organisms. They might be involved in situations of NAD(P)H stress, but their specific role is unclear. In addition to metabolic functions (7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kotter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P.

Vermaas W.F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3994-4003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first time that the gene for a mitochondrial NADPH dehydrogenase has been identified and that evidence for at least two external NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in N. crassa mitochondria has been obtained. The cloning and disruption of the additional rotenone-insensitive NAD(P)H dehydrogenases will help to clarify their function(s) in mitochondrial and cellular metabolism. We are grateful to Dr. Corália Vicente for the statistical analysis and to Drs. Walter Neupert, Rosemary Anne Stuart, and Michael Brunner for helpful discussions and support."

Mutations in tyrosinase lead to albinism due, at least in part, to aberrant retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent degradation by the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. A similar premature degradative fate for wild type tyrosinase also occurs in amelanotic melanoma cells. To understand critical cotranslational events, the glycosylation and rate of translation of tyrosinase was studied in normal melanocytes, melanoma cells, an in vitro cell-free system, and semi-permeabilized cells. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that all seven N-linked consensus sites are utilized in human tyrosinase. However, glycosylation at Asn-290 (Asn-Gly-Thr-Pro) was suppressed, particularly when translation proceeded rapidly, producing a protein doublet with six or sevenN-linked core glycans. The inefficient glycosylation of Asn-290, due to the presence of a proximal Pro, was enhanced in melanoma cells possessing 2–3-fold faster (7.7–10.0 amino acids/s) protein translation rates compared with normal melanocytes (3.5 amino acids/s). Slowing the translation rate with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide increased the glycosylation efficiency in live cells and in the cell-free system. Therefore, the rate of protein translation can regulate the level of tyrosinaseN-linked glycosylation, as well as other potential cotranslational maturation events.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 1: 26-33Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The slower rate of protein translation observed in eukaryotic cells has been proposed to play an important role in the proper folding of proteins in the cell by permitting the sequential folding of individual domains during the translation process (5Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Understanding how proteins acquire their native structure in the cell is of fundamental significance. Because key protein maturation events for eukaryotic cells occur cotranslationally and have a large impact on the fidelity of the overall maturation process, it is important to fully understand these cotranslational processes. For proteins that traverse the secretory pathway, the cotranslational processes include the translocation of the protein across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1membrane, the site of entry into the secretory pathway. In this case, protein folding commences upon emergence of the polypeptide chain into the lumen of the ER. The ER is an organelle that specializes in the efficient folding, modification, and assembly of proteins to their native structures prior to their packaging into transport vesicles. The milieu of the ER is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space, with oxidizing conditions permitting the cotranslational and posttranslational formation of disulfide bonds (1Chen W.

Additional covalent modifications in the ER include the transfer ofN-linked core glycans to Asn residues found in the consensus sequence Asn-X-(Thr/Ser) (10Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). This transfer can occur cotranslationally after the Asn is 12–14 amino acids into the ER lumen, positioning it proximal to the active site of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) (1Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately after its transfer, the glycan side chains are trimmed by glucosidases I and II, generating glycoproteins possessing monoglucosylated glycans that are substrates for the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (12Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 13Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, oligosaccharides play a central role in the quality control system of the ER that determines the fate of the maturing cargo glycoproteins (20Varki A.

Tyrosinase (monophenol, l-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1), is the key melanocyte-specific enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of tyrosine and DOPA to DOPAquinone, and 5,6-dihydroxyindole to indole-5,6-quinone (23Lerner A.B.

Mutational analysis of tyrosinase-positive albinism has identified AP-3 as an important protein involved in the sorting of tyrosinase in thetrans-Golgi to melanosomes (26–28, reviewed in Ref. 29Spritz R.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, additional key sorting decisions for tyrosinase are made in the early secretory pathway that are critical for pigmentation (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M.

Tyrosinase is a membrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the protein to the ER (Fig. 1 A) (33Kwon B.S. Haq A.K. Pomerantz S.H. Halaban R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The human protein possesses 7 putative N-linked glycosylation sites and 15 lumenal Cys residues that can participate in disulfide bond formation. Mutations in tyrosinase are the cause of tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism 1, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by the absence of melanin (reviewed in Refs. 37Oetting W.S. King R.A. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar and 38King R.A. Nordlund J.J. Boissy R. Hearing V.J. King R.A. Ortonne J.-P. The Pigmentary System.

The mutant protein in several tyrosinase-negative albino melanocytes of human and mouse origin is retained in the ER (31Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The essential role of the ER in the regulation of tyrosinase has also been demonstrated in amelanotic melanoma cells in which ER retention of wild type tyrosinase leads to subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the faster rate of translation of tyrosinase in melanoma cells than that of normal melanocytes hampered glycosylation at the inefficient Asn-290 site. This was determined by studying tyrosinase glycosylation and maturation under conditions that altered the rate of translation in normal melanocytes and melanoma cells, as well as in a cell-free system that recapitulated the ER processes. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), wheat germ (WG), dithiothreitol, and RNasin were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Canine pancreas microsomes were a generous gift from Dr. R. Gilmore (Worcester, MA). [35S]Methionine/cysteine (EasyTag) and CHAPS were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Pierce, respectively. Restriction endonucleases and ribonucleotide triphosphates were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). mMessage mMachine and T7 transcription kits were from Ambion (Austin, TX), and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Zysorbin (fixed and killedStaphylococcus aureus) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). All other reagents, including the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, were from Sigma. The plasmid pcTYR carrying the human tyrosinase gene (GenBankTM accession number Y00819) was a gift from Dr. R. Spritz (Denver, CO). The EcoRI tyrosinase fragment excised from pcTYR was subcloned into pGEM 7Zf (Promega). To improvein vitro translation/translocation, the original signal sequence of tyrosinase was exchanged with the murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecule Kbsignal sequence as follows. A XbaI restriction site was introduced at the end of the 18-amino acid signal sequence in pGEM 7Zf-TYR plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The tyrosinase XbaI fragment (encoding the full sequence of tyrosinase minus the signal peptide) was inserted into the XbaI restriction site of pSP72/KbSS-CD3δ plasmid (from Drs. J. Huppa and H. Ploegh, Boston, MA) (40Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This created a hybrid molecule comprising the class I heavy chain H2-Kb signal peptide in frame with the tyrosinase protein downstream of the T7 promoter, termed pSP72/KbSS-TYR. To generate single-site glycosylation deletion mutant proteins, the consensus N-linked glycosylation sites Asn-X-Thr/Ser in pSP72/KbSS-TYR were eliminated or modified in the cDNA by changing threonine or serine to an alanine, except for Thr-373, which was changed to the albino mutation T373K. The site at Asn-290 was modified by exchanging the proline at position 293 to alanine (P293A). The P293A and T292A mutations were also introduced to tyrosinase cDNA in the enhanced green fluorescent protein (enhanced GFP) vector (31Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, the wild type and mutant cDNAs were subcloned from the enhanced GFP plasmids into theKpnI/HindII cloning sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma) to generate FLAG-tagged tyrosinase proteins. In all cases, DNA sequencing of the entire tyrosinase gene verified the inserted mutations. Transfection of plasmids into mouse melanocytes was done as described (31Halaban R. Svedine S. Cheng E. Aron R. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5889-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was prepared by in vitro run-off transcription of the cDNA that was linearized with NdeI or HaeII, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Radioactive35S-labeled tyrosinase was translated for 1 h at 27 °C in RRL (14Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) or in WG and translocated cotranslationally into canine pancreas microsomes. In the latter case, WG lysate (40 μl) was mixed with ribonuclease-treated rough ER (RER) microsomes (6 μl), an amino acid mixture lacking methionine and cysteine (6 μl of a 1 mm solution of each), [35S]Met/Cys (63 μCi), RNase-free water (18.4 μl), RNase inhibitor (1.6 μl), and mRNA (1 μg/μl, 3.5 μl). Samples were alkylated withN-ethylmaleimide (20 mm) to block free sulfhydryls (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Alkylated samples were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (α-TYR) prior to electrophoresis. Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) (0.5 mm) was used to inhibit ER glucosidases when indicated. Half of each sample was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and the other half was reduced by the addition of dithiothreitol (100 mm) and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. Semipermeabilized cells were prepared from subconfluent mouse B10BR melanocytes (41Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Dexter T.J. Devlin L.M. Heasman J. Nester B. Development. 1989; 105: 379-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin using a method described previously by Wilson et al. (42Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Radioactive35S-labeled tyrosinase was translated for 1 h at 27 °C in RRL with semipermeabilized cells (1.3 × 104 cells/μl) replacing the RER microsomes. To separate glycosylated (TYR) from nonglycosylated (untranslocated (UTYR)) proteins, 10 μl of the translation mixture was solubilized in 200 μl of 2% CHAPS buffer (2% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, 200 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5), and glycoproteins were captured on wheat germ agglutinin-bound beads at 4 °C for 2 h under constant rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 × g and washed once with 0.5% CHAPS buffer. The bound proteins were then eluted in SDS-sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Alternatively, untranslocated tyrosinase was separated from the translocated protein by centrifugation of the translation products (10 μl) through a sucrose cushion (100 μl, 0.5m sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) in a Beckman Airfuge ultracentrifuge for 10 min. For protease protection, translation products were digested with proteinase K (0.35 μg/μl) in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice. Protease digestion was stopped with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were added to a 100-μl solution of 0.1m Tris, 1% SDS (pH 8) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Translation mixtures were centrifuged through a sucrose cushion, and pellets were solubilized in a solution containing 0.2% SDS, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA (pH 6.9) at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were cooled to room temperature, diluted with 2% Triton X-100 in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA (pH 6.9), and digested with 0.1–1 μl of 1 units/μl PNGase F at 37 °C for the indicated times. 35S-Labeled tyrosinase was immunoprecipitated with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To determine radioactivity in total proteins, lysates were blotted on filter paper and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min. Samples were washed with ice-cold 100% ethanol. The radioactivity of the blots was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The approximate concentration of TYR in the in vitro translation reactions was determined as described below. Radioactive samples labeled with [35S]Met/Cys were fully resolved by SDS-PAGE to quantify the intensity of the translocated tyrosinase band by phosphorimaging. Equivalent samples were also loaded on the same gel after the run was 70% completed. Therefore, the samples were not resolved and the intensity of the total free label in the reaction could be determined. Because tyrosinase has a total of 28 Met and Cys, its approximate concentration is the following: [Tyr] = (T/F) × [Met/Cys]/28, where Tis the intensity of the tyrosinase band and F is the intensity of the total free label. [Met/Cys] is the sum of the concentrations of endogenous reticulocyte lysate (3.9 μm) and the radioactive [35S]Met/Cys (0.9 μm). Normal human melanocytes were cultured from newborn foreskins in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum and several ingredients required for their proliferation, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dbcAMP (N6, 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3, 5-cyclic monophosphate) and cholera toxin (43Böhm M.

Melanoma cells strains 501 mel and YUSIT1 were grown in Ham's F-10 medium plus serum (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were starved for 2 h in Met/Cys free-RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 3% dialyzed calf serum, 1% glutamine, 0.1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 50 μg/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), were then incubated with [35S]Met/Cys (0.7 mCi/ml) for 10 min, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and lysed in 2% CHAPS buffer. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized tyrosinase from normal melanocytes migrated as a 70-kDa doublet band separated by ∼3 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An [35S]TYR doublet of similar mobility also accumulated in melanoma cells, but the intensities of the individual doublet bands varied. The ratio of the larger TYR to the smaller TYR in melanoma cells was half of that in normal melanocytes (0.4–0.5 compared with 0.8, respectively), indicating that the faster migrating form (TYRS) accumulated more predominantly in the melanoma cells. To identify the cause of the TYR doublet, TYR was expressed in a cell-free system that facilitated experimental manipulation. The translation system consisted of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and mRNA encoding human TYR in the presence and absence of isolated RER membranes (Fig. 2). The native tyrosinase mRNA or a modified message termed KbSS-TYR, in which the TYR signal sequence was exchanged with the corresponding signal sequence from murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecule Kb (KbSS) (40Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Bijlmakers M.J. Neefjes J.J. Wojcik-Jacobs E.H.M. Ploegh H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was used. A 60-kDa protein, recognized by anti-tyrosinase antibodies, was generated in the absence of microsomes that corresponded to untranslocated and unglycosylated TYR (Fig. 2, A, lanes 1 and 5, U TYR). However, a 70-kDa doublet identical to that observed previously in intact melanocytes (30Halaban R. Chang E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B) accumulated in the presence of RER microsomes. This band represented translocated tyrosinase that had received multiple N-linked carbohydrates (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 7). The KbSS-TYR chimera was translated and translocated 4–6-fold more efficiently than native tyrosinase (Fig. 2 A, comparelane 3 to lane 4). The untranslocated KbSS-TYR migrated slightly slower than wild type TYR (Fig.2 A, compare lane 1 to lane 2 andlane 5 to lane 6, U TYR) due to the different sizes of signal sequence (24 amino acids in KbSS and 18 amino acids in TYR). However, the mobility of the translocated products was identical (Fig. 2 A, comparelane 3 to lane 4 and lane 7 tolane 8, TYR) and was similar to newly synthesized tyrosinase produced in intact melanocytes, justifying the use of the KbSS-TYR in all subsequent cell-free experiments. The protein doublet constituted the translocated and glycosylated tyrosinase because it was precipitated with wheat germ agglutinin-bound beads (Fig. 2 B, lane 4, TYR), and it sedimented through a sucrose cushion designed to isolate only membranes decorated with ribosomes (Fig. 2 B, lane 6, TYR). Digestion with proteinase K degraded UTYR but not the TYR form, unless the microsomes were first solubilized by detergent (Fig.2 B, lanes 7–9). The downward mobility shift caused by proteinase K cleavage of the 29-amino acid cytosolic tail of the translocated form is consistent with correct insertion of the type I membrane protein into the microsomal membrane bilayer (Fig.2 B, compare lane 6 to lane 8, TYR). Taken together, the data supported the conclusion that the in vitro translated 70-kDa doublet represented ER translocated and glycosylated forms of tyrosinase. The two translocated ER isoforms of tyrosinase could be generated by heterogeneous glucose or mannose trimming of N-linked glycans in the ER or through differential recognition by the OST generating differences in the total number of attachedN-linked glycans. Differential trimming of glucose residues as the source for this variability was ruled out by the persistent production of doublet protein in the presence of DNJ, although the translated and processed products displayed slower mobility due to inhibition of glucosidases I and II activities (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 5). Likewise, differential ER carbohydrate trimming was excluded by the persistence of the doublet in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (data not shown). Heterogeneity in the carbohydrate side chains as the source of TYR doublet was indicated after digestion with the bacterial endoglycosidase PNGase F. This endoglycosidase removed allN-linked side chains coalescing the doublet into a single band that migrated slightly faster than the untranslocated form (Fig.3 A, lanes 6 and 7). The faster mobility of the PNGase F digested over the untranslocated form of tyrosinase (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2 tolanes 6 and 7) was due to the cleavage of the signal sequence during RER processing. Therefore, we concluded that the doublet represented tyrosinase glycoforms with different numbers ofN-linked glycans. The number of glycans was then resolved by creating a ladder of partially cleaved PNGase F glycosidase products (Fig. 3 B). Tyrosinase was produced in the presence of DNJ to eliminate variation due to glucose trimming. Complete digestion with high concentration of PNGase F generated an unglycosylated protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6, band 0). However, PNGase F at lower concentrations produced a discrete ladder of eight bands corresponding to proteins with seven to zero glycans (Fig. 3 B, lane 3; top andbottom bands, respectively). This analysis revealed that the doublet represented tyrosinase with seven (TYR7) and six (TYR6) N-linked glycans. The partial digestion by PNGase F suggested that the doublet was generated by inefficient glycosylation of one of the consensus sites. The smaller glycoform (TYRS) could be the product of site-specific inefficient glycosylation or random vacancy of any one of the sites. Glycosylation of a consensus site could be suppressed by inefficient transfer of truncated dolichol pyrophosphate precursors, competition with disulfide bond formation, or the presence of inefficient sites (45Turco S.J.

The involvement of truncated dolichol pyrophosphate sugar precursor was excluded because complete glycosylation of a variety of multiglycosylated substrates has been reported with this cell-free system (14Hebert D.N.

Furthermore, we ruled out competition by disulfide bond formation, because the doublet persisted even when tyrosinase was synthesized in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (Fig. 2 and data not shown).

Until recently, the molecular mechanisms regulating chromatid cohesion had not been well understood. However, recent studies, mostly conducted in budding yeast, have outlined the process generally (reviewed in Ref.1Nasmyth K. Peters J.-M. Uhlmann F. Science. 2000; 288: 1379-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Concurrent with DNA replication, the sister chromatids become connected along their entire length. Several distinct groups of proteins are involved in establishing and maintaining chromatid cohesion. The most intensively investigated protein complex, budding yeast cohesin, consists of four subunit proteins, Scc1p/Mcd1p, Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p (2Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 3Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A.

Rad21p in fission yeast and human Rad21 (hRad21) are homologues of Scc1p/Mcd1p (5Birkenbihl R.P. Subramani S.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Smc1p and Smc3p are found in budding yeast, Xenopus, and mammals (7Strunnikov A.V. Larionov V.L. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 9Schmiesing J.A.

They are members of the SMC (structuralmaintenance of chromosome) protein family that is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains and ATPase domains (reviewed in Ref. 10Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Very recently, two Scc3p homologues, SA1 and SA2, have been found in Xenopus and human cells (11Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Xenopus, two distinct classes of cohesin, termed x-cohesinSA1 and x-cohesinSA2, are present. These two complexes share Xenopus (X)SCC1, XSCC2, and XRAD21 and differ via containing either XSA1 or XSA2 (11Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of Xenopus cohesin from egg extracts led to a failure of chromatid cohesion (8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cohesin complex is likely to be conserved in all eukaryotes, including humans. However, the precise roles of cohesin may be different between budding yeast and other eukaryotes. In budding yeast, Scc1p/Mcd1p abruptly dissociates from chromatin at the onset of anaphase (2Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 4Toth A. Ciosk R. Uhlmann F. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In contrast, ∼95% of Xenopus cohesion molecules (XSMC1, XSMC3, and XRAD21) dissociate from chromatin at the entry of mitosis, much earlier than the metaphase-anaphase transition (8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Similarly, in indirect immunofluorescence (IF)1 experiments, it has been found that human Smc1p and mouse Rad21 (called PW29) are mostly excluded from mitotic chromosomes (9Schmiesing J.A. Ball J., A.R. Gregson H.C. Alderton J.M. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12906-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Darwiche N. Freeman L.A. Strunnikov A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, most cohesins are apparently absent on metaphase chromatids in higher eukaryotes. It is not known what molecules or conditions are responsible for the chromatid cohesion immediately before anaphase. Two models have been proposed to explain the apparent inconsistency between the timings of the cohesin-chromatin dissociation and the mitotic chromatid separation (8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The first model proposes that cohesin molecules are responsible for interphase-specific chromatid cohesion and that some yet unidentified mitosis-specific cohesion machinery is responsible for the chromatid cohesion from prophase until the onset of anaphase. The second model hypothesizes that the same cohesin complex is required for both interphase- and mitosis-specific chromatid cohesions. However, in this model, the complex dissociates from chromatin in two steps, whereby most cohesin is released from chromatin at the entry into mitosis. The remaining cohesin connects chromatids in metaphase and dissociates from chromatin at the onset of anaphase. The recent discovery of Xenopus (X)SA proteins revealed that a small population of XSA1 is associated with the metaphase chromosomes formed in Xenopus cell-free extracts, thus supporting the second model (11Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the biochemical and cytological behaviors of hRad21. We aimed to better understand the roles of hRad21 particularly in metaphase. We observed a small but significant population of hRad21 associated with colcemid-induced mitotic chromosomes. These results suggest that the mitotic cohesion is mediated by cohesin, further underscoring the conserved mechanisms regulating chromatid cohesion and separation in eukaryotes. Full-length hRad21 cDNA was isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library by reference to the published hRad21 cDNA sequence (6McKay M.J. Troelstra C. van der Spek P. Kanaar R. Smit B. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cloned cDNA was completely sequenced. The resulting sequence was identical to the published clone. The full-length hRad21 cDNA was then subcloned into pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). glutathione S-transferase-fused hRad21 was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein contained in the inclusion body was denatured and purified using Prep Cell Model 491 (Bio-Rad). The purified protein was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into rabbits to obtain the anti-hRad21 antisera. To generate the anti-C-hRad21 antibodies, an oligopeptide possessing a C-terminal amino acid sequence of hRad21 (QQAIELTQEEPYSD, amino acids 606–619) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanine and was used to immunize the rabbits. The resulting antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography. Mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-PCNA, anti-lamin B, and anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-CENP-B antibody was a kind gift from Dr. H. Masumoto (Nagoya University). Western blotting was performed according to Ref. 13Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar. Briefly, membranes were first pretreated for 1 h in Block-Ace solution (Dai Nippon Pharmaceuticals). Then all subsequent incubations and washes were carried out in 1× TNT buffer (20× TNT: 0.4 m Tris-HCl, 2.8 m NaCl, 1.0% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies at room temperature, followed by three washes. Then membranes were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by three washes. Signals were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro transcription and translation experiments were performed using a TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). 1 μg of template plasmid DNA was used in each reaction. For autoradiography, proteins were labeled by addition of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the reaction mixture. For the Western analyses, cold methionine (0.02 mm) was used during synthesis of the protein. Cells were grown on coverslips. Two fixation protocols were used, producing essentially similar results. In the first protocol, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min at −20 °C. In the second protocol, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Fixed cells were pretreated with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% skim milk and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1.0 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed by PBS three times and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed as above, mounted in mounting solution containing 0.25 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) or TOTO3, and examined by laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss). HeLa cells were synchronized at early S phase by a thymidine and aphidicolin double-block protocol as described in (14Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P.

In the32P-metabolic labeling experiments, cells were incubated in a phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate to a final concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml for 1 h prior to harvesting. Cells were lysed by the modified RIPA buffer. Cell lysates were pretreated with normal rabbit IgG. Then the precleared cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies, and the antigen-antibody complex was immunoprecipitated by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Obtained proteins were fractionated on 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was first subjected to autoradiography. Then the same membrane was analyzed for hRad21 by Western blotting using anti-yhRad21 antibodies. The signals were detected by a peroxidase immunostaining kit (Wako). 1 × 107 HeLa cells were washed with cold PBS, and collected. Cell pellets were suspended in five volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Low speed cell pellets were resuspended in original cell volumes of hypotonic buffer and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer using the tight pestle. Cells were examined with a light microscope to confirm that most cells had been disrupted. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. Cytosolic fractions were obtained from the cytoplasmic fractions following high speed centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Nuclear pellet fractions were washed twice with the hypotonic buffer and extracted by suspending the nuclei in hypotonic buffer containing either salt or detergents for 30 min on ice. Nuclear extract was separated from insoluble materials by high speed centrifugation. DNase I digestion of the crude nuclei was done according to Ref. 15Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A.

To obtain metaphase-like chromosomes, cells were released from the block and cultured for 8 h, followed by an additional culture for 3 h in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml colcemid. To obtain prometaphase-like chromosomes, cells were released from the block and cultured for 8.5 or 9 h, followed by an additional culture for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml colcemid. The cells were harvested, treated with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2) for 15 min, and attached to a glass slides by Cytospin. The cells were fixed using cold methanol for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, pretreated by blocking solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% skimmilk in PBS), and finally incubated with rabbit anti-hRad21 antibodies and mouse anti-CENP-B monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies were detected by Alexia Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively.

Smit B. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first investigated hRad21 protein levels throughout the cell cycle. Full-length human Rad21 (hRad21) cDNA was isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library. Nucleotide sequencing of the obtained cDNA yielded a sequence of complete identity to the published one (6McKay M.J. Troelstra C. van der Spek P. Kanaar R. Smit B. Hagemeijer A. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), thus having an ORF that potentially encodes a protein of 631 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 72 kDa. Two different rabbit antisera were raised, one (anti-hRad21 antibody) against the glutathione S-transferase-fused recombinant full-length hRad21 protein expressed in E. coli and the other (anti-C-hRad21 antibody) against a C-terminal synthetic oligopeptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). These antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using the respective cognate antigens. Following hRad21 cDNA transfection both antibodies recognized the recombinant hRad21 protein that was expressed in the 293T cells (human kidney cells transfected with SV40 T antigen) (Fig.1 A). Both antibodies also recognized an endogenous protein in untransfected 293T cells that showed the same mobility in SDS-PAGE with that of the overexpressed hRad21 (Fig. 1 B). These reactions were specific because preincubating the antibodies with the antigens prior to Western blotting prevented detection of hRad21 (Fig. 1, A andB). The apparent molecular mass of the hRad21 protein (about 120 kDa), as estimated using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, was greater than that predicted from its supposed amino acid sequence. Similar observations were made of budding yeast Scc1p (2Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), fission yeast rad21 protein (16Birkenbihl R. Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7703-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Xenopus Rad21 homologue, XRAD21 (8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To confirm that the 120-kDa band indeed represents hRad21 protein, we transcribed and translated hRad21 cDNA in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Recombinant proteins were synthesized in the presence of either [35S]methionine or cold methionine and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography, whereas unlabeled proteins were subjected to Western blotting with anti-hRad21 and anti-C-hRad21 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the [35S]methionine-labeled hRad21 protein synthesized in vitro was detected as a 120-kDa protein band after SDS-PAGE electrophoretic migration. Because this 120-kDa protein was specifically recognized by both anti-hRad21 and anti-C-hRad21 antibodies (Fig. 1 C), we concluded that it is indeed hRad21 protein. HeLa cells were synchronized using a thymidine and aphidicolin double-block protocol (Fig. 2). The cells were harvested at intervals after release from the block and first extracted by 1% Triton X (Fractions T), followed by 0.5 mNaCl (Fractions N). The insoluble pellet fractions (Fractions P) were also examined. These fractions were analyzed using Western blotting. α-Tubulin served as the control cytoplasmic protein and was efficiently extracted to the T fractions, indicating that soluble proteins were successfully extracted with the Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 2 B). It is known that PCNA is insoluble during S phase (17Li R. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PCNA was detected in Fractions P most strongly at 0–4 h and to a lesser level at 8 h (Fig. 2 C), indicating that most of the cells were in S phase at 0–4 h. In contrast, Cyclin B1 was most abundant at 8 and 10 h and suddenly disappeared at 12 and 14 h (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the cells were in G2/M phase at 8 to 10 h and exited from M phase at 12–14 h. FACscan analysis strongly supported the interpretation of the cell cycle progression inferred from the marker proteins (Fig.2 A). In these cells, the abundance of hRad21, as detected by anti-C-hRad21 antibody, remained essentially unchanged during the cell cycle. It is known that Scc1p/Mcd1p is proteolytically cleaved at the onset of anaphase (18Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). We reproducibly observed some more quickly migrating proteins in hRad21 Western blots. At this moment, we do not know whether these fragments were derived from hRad21 or whether they had any physiological relevance. However, we did not see an increase of these small fragments in M phase, suggesting that they were not related to the chromatid separation event. We found that hRad21 was adequately extracted in 0.5 m NaCl but not in 1% Triton X-100 at all examined stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 2 B). We also found that hRad21 was not present in Fractions P (data not shown). Furthermore, hRad21 was not extracted by DNase I (data not shown). These results indicate that hRad21 is not a soluble protein or a protein loosely binding to chromatin. hRad21 may be associated with nuclear structures at all cell cycle stages including M phase. It has been shown that fission yeast Rad21p and budding yeast Scc1p are phosphorylated from S phase to anaphase (16Birkenbihl R. Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7703-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We next examined whether hRad21 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. For this purpose, HeLa cells were synchronized following a thymidine and aphidicolin double-block protocol. The cells were harvested at intervals after being released from the block. Prior to each harvest, the cells were cultured for 1 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. A parallel culture was used for determining the cell cycle by FACscan analysis. hRad21 was immunoprecipitated using anti-hRad21 antibodies from cell extracts containing approximately the same number of cells. The immunoprecipitates were separated in an SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were blotted onto a membrane. First, the membrane was subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 3 B). Then the same membrane was analyzed for total hRad21 levels using a Western analysis with anti-C-hRad21 antibodies (Fig. 3 C). From these experiments, it was found that hRad21 is phosphorylated most intensely at 10, 12, and 14 h after release from the block. Because the FACscan analysis revealed that these samples were derived mostly from M phase cells, these results imply that hRad21 becomes hyperphosphorylated in M phase. To test the hypothesis that hRad21 is hyperphosphorylated in M phase more vigorously, we repeated the experiment in a quantitative manner. HeLa cells were arrested at G1/S following a thymidine and aphidicolin double-block protocol. A portion of the cells were released from the block and cultured for 8 h and then arrested at the following metaphase by incubating the cells with colcemid for 4 h. These G1/S-arrested and metaphase-arrested cells, along with the control exponentially growing cells, were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h prior to each harvest. FACscan analysis of parallel cultures indicated that the two populations of cells were indeed arrested at G1/S and metaphase, respectively (Fig.4 A). hRad21 was immunoprecipitated from the exponentially growing, G1/S-arrested and metaphase-arrested cell lysates using anti-hRad21 antibodies. Three samples containing different protein amounts (1×, 3×, and 9×; where 3× and 9× samples contained 3- and 9-fold more protein than 1× samples, respectively) were analyzed for each type of immunoprecipitate using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane. The membrane was subsequently subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 4 B), followed by Western blotting with anti-hRad21 antibodies (Fig. 4 C). When the anti-hRad21-positive signals in the Western analysis were quantified, the 3× and 9× samples showed an almost 3-fold difference in their signal intensities, whereas the 1× samples were undetectable. This apparently linear dose-response relationship observed in the Western blotting data for 3× and 9× samples indicates that the intensities reliably reflect protein abundance in this range of protein amounts. In contrast, autoradiography intensities of the 9× samples displayed more than a 3-fold intensity difference relative to the 3× samples and therefore seemed to lack a linear dose-response relationship. Nevertheless, when we calculated relative phosphorylation levels by dividing the autoradiography intensities by the Western blot intensities, we saw consistent cell cycle-specific changes in hRad21 phosphorylation levels both among the 3× samples and among the 9× samples (Fig.4 D). In both comparisons, the colcemid-arrested cells showed 3-fold increases in the specific phosphorylation levels of hRad21 compared with the G1/S-arrested cells. Therefore, we concluded that hRad21 is hyperphosphorylated in M phase. In the autoradiographs of interphase immunoprecipitates, we observed three major and several minor 32P-labeled bands additional to hRad21 (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). The apparent molecular masses of the major bands as determined from SDS-PAGE were about 150, 140, and 80 kDa (Fig. 3 B). Because these three bands were not reactive with anti-hRad21 antibodies in the Western blotting analysis, we concluded that these three bands are not hRad21. We interpret them as being hRad21-associated phosphorylated proteins and have designated them p150, p140, and p80. Interestingly, the phosphorylation levels of hRad21 and its putative associated proteins (p150, p140, and p80) in the metaphase-arrested cells were significantly higher than those found with the interphase cells (Figs.3 B and 4 B). Furthermore, additional phosphorylated proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 180, 95, and 85 kDa, were specifically found in the hRad21 immunoprecipitate derived from the metaphase-arrested cells. Again, these three proteins were interpreted as putative hRad21-associated proteins and designated p180, p95, and p85. Although we do not know the identity of these bands, the results suggest that cohesin components may be coordinately modified and/or regulated by phosphorylation during M phase. We next examined the subcellular localization of hRad21 in the asynchronous HeLa cells by IF experiments using anti-hRad21 antibodies. HeLa cells were fixed with methanol, with or without being permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were stained with TOTO3 to stain the DNA and examined by IF using anti-hRad21 and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. hRad21 was detected in interphase nuclei and was not present in nucleoli (Fig. 5). When the cells were pretreated with Triton X-100 prior to fixation, most of the α-tubulin was extracted to disappearance, whereas hRad21 remained. These results confirm the biochemical results described above and indicate that hRad21 is a nuclear protein associated with nuclear structures. If hRad21 is involved in sister chromatid cohesion, as has been proposed, one would expect the subcellular localization of hRad21 to change in M phase. However, it has been reported that mostXenopus Rad21 is dissociated from prophase-like chromosomes (8Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We therefore were interested in the intracellular distribution of hRad21 in metaphase cells. Two fixation methods, one employing cold methanol and the other involving paraformaldehyde (see “Experimental Procedures”), were used. We found these two protocols essentially gave rise to the same results, and the results obtained from methanol-fixed cells are shown in Fig. 6and described below. Asynchronous HeLa cells stained with DNA dye TOTO3 were examined by IF using anti-α-tubulin and anti-hRad21 antibodies (Fig. 6). Although some hRad21 seemed to be associated with chromatin during early prophase when the two centrosomes are not yet separated, a significant amount was already dissociated from chromatin (Fig. 6,row a). hRad21 was quite heterogeneously distributed in late prophase cells, with some fraction of it still apparently bound to chromatin (Fig. 6, row b). However, in metaphase and anaphase, it seemed that most hRad21 had completely dissociated from the chromatin and was associated with the spindles ("

This suppression could not be accounted for solely by reduced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) responses, thereby implicating uncoupling of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and Ca2+ mobilization (McArdle, C. A., Willars, G. B., Fowkes, R. C., Nahorski, S. R., Davidson, J. S., and Forrest-Owen, W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 23711–23717). In the current study we demonstrate that GnRH causes a homologous and heterologous desensitization of Ca2+signaling in αT3–1 cells that is coincident with a rapid (t 12 < 20 min), marked, and functionally relevant loss of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity and binding. Furthermore, using an αT3–1 cell line expressing recombinant muscarinic M3 receptors we show that the unique resistance of the GnRH receptor to rapid desensitization contributes to a fast, profound, and sustained loss of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity. These data highlight a potential role for rapid Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor down-regulation in homologous and heterologous desensitization and in particular suggest that this mechanism may contribute to the suppression of the reproductive system that is exploited in the major clinical applications of GnRH analogues.

These hormones are central to the regulation of gonadal steroidogenesis and gamete maturation, and GnRH therefore plays a vital role in the control of vertebrate reproduction. GnRH acts on pituitary gonadotropes through a G-protein-coupled receptor that regulates phospholipase C (PLC) via G-proteins of the Gαq/11 family (1Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). GnRH-mediated activation of PLC results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol. These second messengers are able to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activate protein kinase C, respectively (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6186) Google Scholar), thereby propagating a signaling cascade that accounts for the biological effects of GnRH. In contrast to nearly all other known PLC-coupled G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the GnRH receptor does not undergo rapid (seconds to minutes) desensitization following exposure to agonist (3Davidson J.S.

Recent evidence has suggested that this lack of acute regulation is related to the lack of a C-terminal tail and the absence, therefore, of appropriate regulatory phospho-acceptor sites (8Heding A.

From a functional perspective, the resistance of the GnRH receptor to rapid desensitization may serve to maintain cellular sensitivity and responsiveness during events such as the pre-ovulatory gonadotropin hormone surge and allow the frequency-encoded pattern of the hypothalamic pulsatile GnRH release (10Moenter S.M.

Despite the lack of acute regulation of the GnRH receptor, sustained exposure to GnRH is able to reduce GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion, and this form of desensitization underlies the suppression of the reproductive system that is exploited in the major clinical applications of GnRH analogues (12Barbieri R.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 3: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the importance of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation in the mediation of GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion (1Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we have previously explored the potential desensitization of this component of the GnRH receptor-mediated signaling pathway in an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line (αT3–1). Despite no evidence for rapid desensitization of the GnRH receptor in these cells, pre-exposure to GnRH can cause a marked suppression of subsequent GnRH-mediated elevations of [Ca2+]i. Both the spike phase of the response (which reflects Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+) and the sustained phase of the response (which is dependent upon Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels) were attenuated by GnRH pretreatment (4McArdle C.A. Forrest-Owen W. Willars G. Davidson J.S. Poch A. Kratzmeier M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4864-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5McArdle C.A. Willars G.B. Fowkes R.C. Nahorski S.R. Davidson J.S. Forrest-Owen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23711-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Desensitization of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels may account for the desensitization of the plateau phase of the GnRH-mediated response in αT3–1 cells (4McArdle C.A. Forrest-Owen W. Willars G. Davidson J.S. Poch A. Kratzmeier M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4864-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying attenuated mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is unclear. Although pre-exposure to GnRH reduces both the number of plasma membrane GnRH receptors and the ability of GnRH to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3, these effects are insufficient to account for the reduced release of intracellular Ca2+ (5McArdle C.A.

Indeed, this desensitization is heterologous and therefore most probably reflects post-receptor modification(s). Because desensitization of GnRH-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores cannot be attributed to attenuation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation or depletion of hormone-mobilizable intracellular Ca2+ pools, it appears to reflect a reduction in the efficiency with which Ins(1,4,5)P3 mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores (5McArdle C.A.

Thus, if Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor down-regulation underlies desensitization of GnRH-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, it would have to occur unusually rapidly in αT3–1 cells. The current study was therefore undertaken to establish whether GnRH is able to cause Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor down-regulation and whether any such effect underlies desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization in these cells. αT3–1 cells stably transfected with recombinant human M3 muscarinic receptors (7Willars G.B.

(Santa Cruz, CA), with the exception of PLCδ1, which was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The αT3–1 gonadotrope cell line was originally a gift from Dr. P. Mellon, University of California, San Diego, CA, and in the current study we used a cell line (αT3–1/M3) derived from this, which also expresses the recombinant human muscarinic M3receptor. Like the endogenously expressed GnRH receptor, this GPCR also couples to the activation of PLC in this cell line (7Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that muscarinic M3 receptors are subject to rapid but partial desensitization, whereas the endogenously expressed GnRH receptors show no evidence of such regulation (7Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, humidified air and passaged weekly. For experiments, cells were harvested with 10 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, 0.54 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and re-seeded for use 1–2 days later. Cells were always maintained, and the experimental manipulations were always performed, at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. Video imaging of fura-2-loaded cells was performed as described previously (5McArdle C.A. Willars G.B. Fowkes R.C. Nahorski S.R. Davidson J.S. Forrest-Owen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23711-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffer (pH 7.4, composition (mm): NaCl 127, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, NaH2PO4 0.5, NaHCO3 5, glucose 10, HEPES 10 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then washed several times and placed within a heated (37 °C) perfusion stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Image capture was performed using MagiCal hardware following alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm with emission recorded at 510 nm. Values were averaged from 16 or 32 video frames, and background fluorescence was subtracted prior to ratioing. The ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using maximum and minimum values defined by treatment with 5 μm ionomycin in medium with either 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA and assuming a dissociation constant of 225 nm for fura-2 and Ca2+ at 37 °C, as described (14McArdle C.A. Poch A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3567-3574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well multiwell dishes. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed (2 × 1 ml) with medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in a further 1 ml. GnRH was then added at the appropriate concentration, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, humidified air. For immuno-detection of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors, medium was aspirated after the required time, the cell monolayer was washed once with ice-cold Krebs/HEPES (7Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer (10 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was added. Cells were left for 5 min on ice and then scraped from the surface of the plate. Following trituration through a fine gauge needle the resulting suspension was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The supernatant was then aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer. An equal volume of sample buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 200 mm dithiothreitol) was then added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min. Proteins were resolved by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed using isotype-specific Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected with ECL reagents and exposure to Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where required, densitometric analysis of the resulting bands was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer with Molecular Analyst version 1.2 software. For immuno-detection of other proteins (Gαq/11 and PLC isoforms), Western blotting was carried out as above with the exception that the cell monolayers were solubilized in 200 μl of solubilization buffer (10 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide, 100 μg/ml benzamidine) for 30 min on ice before being processed as described above. Details and use of the polyclonal antibody against the type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor and of the monoclonal antibodies against the type II and type III Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors have been described previously (26Mackrill J.J. Wilcox R.A. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other antibodies were at dilutions according to the instructions of the suppliers. Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor binding was determined in membranes of αT3–1 cells as described (16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22234-22241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were for 45 min at 4 °C in 200 μl of incubation buffer with 2–10 μg of membrane protein, 10 nCi of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and 0 or 10−9–10−5m unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3. The incubations were terminated by centrifugation and removal of supernatants by aspiration. Pellets were then solubilized in NaOH and transferred to scintillant for β-counting. 45Ca2+ release assays were performed in cytosol-like buffer (composition (mM): KCl 120, KH2PO4 2, (CH2COONa)25, MgCl2 2.4, HEPES 20, ATP 2, pH 7.2) using a previously described method (27Wilcox R.A. Fauq A. Kozikowski A.P. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+] of the cytosol-like buffer was determined using fura-2 (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and buffered to 120–190 nm with EGTA. Cells (2 ml containing 4–6 mg of protein) were permeabilized by the addition of β-escin (25 μg/ml). The suspension was then centrifuged (500 × g, 2 min) and resuspended in 6 ml of cytosol-like buffer, and45Ca2+ was added (equivalent to 0.4 μl/ml45Ca2+ at 1.98 mCi/ml). After gentle vortexing, the cells were left for 15–20 min at room temperature. To initiate release of loaded 45Ca2+, 50 μl of cells were added to 50 μl of Ins(1,4,5)P3. After 60 s, 500 μl of silicon oil was added, and the cells were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The aqueous phase and most of the silicon oil phase were aspirated, the tubes were inverted, and the remaining oil was allowed to drain. The pellets were solubilized in scintillant, and the unreleased 45Ca2+ was determined. Release was calculated as a percentage of the total45Ca2+ loaded. The size of the rapidly releasable pool was also determined using 10 μm ionomycin to indicate the amount of 45Ca2+ loaded into the intracellular stores. This was ∼80% of the total45Ca2+. Pretreatment of αT3–1/M3 cells for 1 h with maximal concentrations (7Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of either GnRH (1 μm) or methacholine (1 mm) resulted in both homologous and heterologous desensitization of agonist-mediated Ca2+signaling (Fig. 1, a andb). The homologous and heterologous loss of Ca2+signaling as a result of GnRH or methacholine pretreatment were maximal following 30–60 min of pretreatment and were sustained at this level for at least 24 h of pretreatment (Fig. 1 c). Expression of type I, II, and III Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors was examined by Western blotting of solubilized αT3–1/M3cells using isoform-specific antibodies (26Mackrill J.J. Wilcox R.A. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of all three isoforms was detected, although bands representing type II and III Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors were faint and then only apparent after exposure of the Western blot to film for longer periods of time (data not shown). Although we are unable to quantitate precisely the relative levels of the different types of Ins(1,4,5)P3receptors, the predominant expression of type I is consistent with that in the pituitary, which expresses type I, II, and III Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors at 73, 24, and 3% of the total receptor population, respectively (19Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Challenge of αT3–1/M3 cells with 1 μm GnRH resulted in a rapid and marked loss of type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor immunoreactivity (Fig. 2,a and c), which had a half-time of ∼20 min, was maximal by 60 min (<20% of immunoreactivity remaining), and sustained for at least 24 h in the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 2,a and c). Comparable data were obtained using 100 nm GnRH (Fig. 2 c). Challenge of αT3–1/M3 cells with 1 mm methacholine also resulted in a marked loss of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity, albeit with a rate and magnitude that was less than that observed with GnRH (Fig. 2, b and c). In contrast to treatment with 1 μm GnRH, there was some recovery of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity during 24-h treatment with methacholine (Fig. 2, b andc). The GnRH-mediated loss of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity was concentration-dependent, with an EC50 of −9.91 ± 0.61 (log10, m;n = 4; 0.12 nm) (all data with errors are mean ± S.E.) at 60 min of treatment (data not shown). In experiments designed to examine the rate of recovery of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity, cells were first treated with 1 μm GnRH for 1 h to induce down-regulation. Agonist activation of GnRH receptors was then stopped by washing the cell monolayer and continuing the incubation in the presence of the GnRH receptor antagonist, antide (1 μm). Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity was then examined over the subsequent 24 h. The 1-h pretreatment with GnRH resulted in a marked loss of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity that was further reduced after 1 h of “recovery” time (Fig. 2, d and e). Levels of receptor immunoreactivity then increased back to basal levels by 24 h (Fig. 2, d and e). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with 1 μm GnRH and washed, but antagonist was not added (data not shown). In binding experiments, pretreatment of intact cells for 60 min with 1 μm GnRH reduced the binding of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to αT3–1 membranes to 51 ± 7% (n = 4) of control without measurably altering the K d (Fig.3). Permeabilization of αT3–1/M3 cells with β-escin allowed intracellular Ca2+ stores to be loaded with tracer45Ca2+, which could then be released by the addition of Ins(1,4,5)P3. This exogenous Ins(1,4,5)P3 was able to release a maximum of ∼60% of the 45Ca2+ that had been loaded over a 15-min period, with an EC50 of −6.8 ± 0.2 (log10, m; n = 4; 0.16 μm) (Fig. 4). Treatment of cells for 1 h with 1 μm GnRH significantly reduced the magnitude of Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated release of45Ca2+ from the intracellular stores (p < 0.001, two way analysis of variance) but had no significant effect on the EC50 for Ins(1,4,5)P3, which was −6.5 ± 0.3 (log10, M; n = 4; 0.32 μm) (Fig. 4). Thimerosal has been reported to increase Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor sensitivity (29Thrower E.C. Duclohier H. Lea E.J. Molle G. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In naive αT3–1/M3 cells, 100 μm thimerosal increased the spike [Ca2+]i response to a sub-maximal (5 nm) (Fig. 5 a) but not maximal (1 μm) (Fig. 5 c) concentration of GnRH when cells were challenged in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (to assess the effects on Ca2+ release only). This suggests that the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor does not limit the magnitude of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release in naive cells stimulated with a maximal concentration of GnRH but can limit the response to submaximal agonist concentrations. When cells were pretreated for 1 h with 100 nm GnRH (in the presence of extracellular Ca2+), thimerosal had little effect on the subsequent response (again in the absence of extracellular Ca2+) to a submaximal concentration of GnRH but markedly potentiated the response to a maximal concentration (Fig. 5, b and d), suggesting that, in GnRH-pretreated cells, Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor activation is rate-limiting for GnRH-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization. Although challenge of cells with 1 μm GnRH resulted in a dramatic reduction in type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity (see above), exclusion of Ca2+ from the extracellular buffer prevented the GnRH-mediated loss of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors but had no significant effect on the basal (nonagonist-stimulated) levels over a 1-h period (Fig.6 a). Furthermore, the absence of extracellular Ca2+ partially prevented the homologous desensitization of GnRH-mediated spike and plateau Ca2+signaling (Fig. 6, b and c). Incubation of cells for 4 h with the cysteine protease (and proteasome) inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN, 100 μg/ml) (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem.

Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) prior to and during a 1-h incubation with 1 μm GnRH also markedly attenuated the agonist-induced loss of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity (Fig.7 a). The effects of ALLN on the desensitization of the agonist-mediated Ca2+ response were, however, difficult to interpret. Thus, even in the absence of GnRH pretreatment, ALLN markedly inhibited the spike and plateau [Ca2+]i responses to GnRH (data not shown), and we therefore used the more specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm, 4 h) (22Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lactacystin also markedly protected type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity against GnRH-mediated down-regulation (control (untreated), 100%; 1 h, 1 μm GnRH, 44.6 ± 4.5%; lactacystin, 80.6 ± 23.0%; 1 h, 1 μm GnRH + lactacystin, 102.5 ± 34.1%). Furthermore, lactacystin attenuated, but did not completely prevent, GnRH-mediated desensitization of [Ca2+]i mobilization (Fig. 7, b andc). There was also some inhibition of GnRH-mediated spike [Ca2+]i signaling in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 7 b), although the plateau was unaffected (data not shown).Figure 7The influence of protease inhibition on GnRH-mediated down-regulation of type I Ins(1,4,5)P3immunoreactivity and homologous desensitization of [Ca2+] i signaling in αT3–1/M3 cells. For determination of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor immunoreactivity (a), cells were incubated with (+) or without (−) the cysteine protease inhibitor ALLN (100 μg/ml) for 4 h. Agonist (1 μm GnRH or 1 mm methacholine) was then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Western blotting for the type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor was then performed. The densities of the bands representing the type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor were quantified and expressed as a percentage of that under basal conditions (no ALLN or agonist). The data shown are the mean ± S.E.; n = 4. For determination of [Ca2+]i signaling (b and c), cells were pretreated for 3 h in buffer with 0 (control, filled symbols) or 10 μm (open symbols) lactacystin with 0 (b) or 100 nmGnRH (c) added for the final 60 min of"

This reaction is catalyzed by a methylthiol:coenzyme M methyltransferase composed of two polypeptides, MtsA (a methylcobalamin:coenzyme M methyltransferase) and MtsB (homologous to a class of corrinoid proteins involved in methanogenesis). Recombinant MtsA was purified and found to be a homodimer that bound one zinc atom per polypeptide, but no corrinoid cofactor. MtsA is an active methylcobalamin:coenzyme M methyltransferase, but also methylates cob(I)alamin with dimethylsulfide, yielding equimolar methylcobalamin and methanethiol in an endergonic reaction with aK eq of 5 × 10−4. MtsA and cob(I)alamin mediate dimethylsulfide:coenzyme M methyl transfer in the complete absence of MtsB. Dimethylsulfide inhibited methylcobalamin:coenzyme methyl transfer by MtsA. Inhibition by dimethylsulfide was mixed with respect to methylcobalamin, but competitive with coenzyme M. MtbA, a MtsA homolog participating in coenzyme M methylation with methylamines, was not inhibited by dimethylsulfide and did not catalyze detectable dimethylsulfide:cob(I)alamin methyl transfer. These results are most consistent with a model for the native methylthiol:coenzyme M methyltransferase in which MtsA mediates the methylation of corrinoid bound to MtsB with dimethylsulfide and subsequently demethylates MtsB-bound corrinoid with coenzyme M, possibly employing elements of the same methyltransferase active site for both reactions.

During methylotrophic methanogenesis, substrate methyl groups are reduced to methane with reducing power derived from the simultaneous oxidation of methyl groups to carbon dioxide (1Ferry J.G.

In recent years, it has been found that methylated thiols such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) and methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA) are also methylotrophic methanogenic precursors (3van der Maarel M.J.E.C.

Since emission of DMS over the open ocean is thought to influence cloud formation, the metabolism of these compounds has wide-ranging implications (15Charlson R.J. Lovelock J.E. Andreae M.O.

Methanosarcina species such as Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina siciliae will couple growth to methane production from the methylated thiols DMS and MMPA (3van der Maarel M.J.E.C.

In contrast, Methanosarcina barkeri was long thought not to utilize methylthiols as methane precursors (18Boone D.R. Whitman W.B. Rouviére P. Ferry J.G. Methanogenesis. Ecology, Physiology, Biochemistry, and Genetics. Chapman & Hall, New York1993: 35-80Google Scholar). However, it was found that this species differentially expressed enzymes to produce methane from DMS or MMPA depending upon its growth substrate (19Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J.

During growth on acetate, but not methanol, cells of M. barkeri MS will convert either methylated thiol to methane. Cell-free extracts of these cells will catalyze methylation of coenzyme M (CoM) with either DMS or MMPA. Methyl-CoM is the precursor of methane with all known methanogenic substrates, and its reduction is the major site of energy conversation in methanogens (1Ferry J.G. FEMS Microbiol.

This methylthiol:CoM methyltransferase is a 480-kDa corrinoid protein that is comprised of equimolar amounts of 40- and 30-kDa subunits termed, respectively, MtsA and MtsB. One corrinoid cofactor is bound per MtsA:MtsB pair, and six or seven MtsA:MtsB pairs comprise the 480-kDa protein (21Kremer J.D. Cao X. Krzycki J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4824-4833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corrinoid cofactor in the Co(I) state is methylated by DMS, while the methylated Co(III) corrinoid can in turn be demethylated by CoM, regenerating the Co(I) corrinoid cofactor (19Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6902-6911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that protein-bound corrinoid serves as an intermediate in the methylation of CoM with DMS or MMPA. The methylation of CoM with methylated thiols such as DMS by a two-subunit protein (19Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6902-6911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) stands in contrast with the three component systems effecting CoM methylation with methanol (22van der Meijden P. te Brömmelstroet B.W.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 846-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, panel A). In the latter CoM methylation pathways, a corrinoid-binding protein sequentially interacts with two methyltransferases. Substrate:corrinoid methyltransferases initiate the demethylation of the methanogenic substrate and methylation of a cognate corrinoid protein that specifically interacts with that methyltransferase (25Burke S.A.

Each cognate corrinoid protein is then demethylated by a methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase. In the case of the methylamines, the methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferase is a single protein, MtbA (29Ferguson Jr., D.J. Krzycki J.A. Grahame D.A. J. Biol.

Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 and accompanying legend). MtsA is 50% similar over its entire length to the methylcorrinoid:CoM methyltransferases of the methylamine (MtbA) and methanol (MtaA) pathways. Consistent with this, the methylthiol:CoM methyltransferase has a methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity, which is significantly enhanced in the presence of SDS (34Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity staining of SDS-PAGE gels revealed that MtsA catalyzes methylcobalamin:CoM methyl transfer, while MtsB did not display this activity (34Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of MtsB itself is on the average 50% similar to the entire lengths of each of the cognate corrinoid proteins of the methanol- and methylamine-dependent CoM methylation pathways (Fig. 1). The methylamine cognate corrinoid proteins each bind one corrinoid per polypeptide (21Kremer J.D. Cao X. Krzycki J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4824-4833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ferguson Jr., D.J. Gorlatova N. Grahame D.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4410-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these proteins as a group are homologous to the cobalamin binding domains of methionine synthase, as well as coenzyme B12-dependent enzymes (30Paul L. Ferguson D.J. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2520-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Paul L. Krzycki J.A. J.

MtsB contains all expected signature residues for binding corrinoid (33Paul L. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and is therefore the likely corrinoid binding subunit of methylthiol:CoM methyltransferase. Thus, a clear route for the demethylation of methylated MtsB corrinoid protein and methylation of CoM can be proposed, in that MtsA mediates the demethylation of MtsB and methylation of CoM (Fig. 1, panel B). It is striking, however, that MtsA:MtsB complex is capable of demethylating DMS without a third polypeptide initiating methyl transfer from DMS, such as seen in the otherwise completely analogous pathways for CoM methylation from methanol or the methylamines, such as MMA (Fig. 1,panel A). This leaves the manner by which the methylthiol:CoM methyltransferase effects demethylation of DMS an open question. Unfortunately, efforts to physically separate the two subunits using denaturants and chromatography to search for the sites of the relevant subreactions have not yielded active preparations of either subunit. 2T. C. Tallant, unpublished results. To resolve this problem, we expressed MtsA as a recombinant protein, and tested its ability to interact with CoM, DMS, and free cobalamin. We find that MtsA acts both to demethylate DMS and to methylate CoM using non–protein-bound cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier. Thus, this subunit carries out both CoM methylation and DMS demethylation and can account for both corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase activities of the methylthiol:CoM methyltransferase. This appears to not be a universal property of methylcorrinoid:CoM methylases, since a representative homologous CoM methylase, MtbA, does not interact with DMS in any detectable manner. N2 was purchased from Linde Specialty Gases (Columbus, OH) and passed through catalyst R3-11 (Chemical Dynamics Corp., South Plainfield, NJ) to remove O2 prior to use. MOPS, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (CoM), dithiothreitol (DTT), hydroxycobalamin, methylcobalamin, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), EDTA, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), acrylamide, 2-mercaptoethanol, bromthymol blue, and Coomassie R-250 were purchased from Bio-Rad. Titanium(III) chloride (10% aqueous solution), 3-thiopropionic acid, and methyl-3-(methylthio)propionate were purchased from Aldrich. Titanium(III) citrate was prepared from titanium(III) chloride (38Seefeldt L.C. Ensign S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MMPA was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of methyl-3-(methylthio)propionate (39Wackett L.P. Honek J.F. Begley T.P. Wallace V. Orme J.W.H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6012-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DMS was purchased from Spectrum Chemical (Gardenia, CA). Guanidine hydrochloride was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The tandemmtsA and mtsB genes characterized previously were cloned as two separate restriction fragments inserted into pUC19. Subclones of these restriction fragments were used as described below to assemble the complete gene in an expression vector (Fig.2). The 5′ end of the gene was generated from pPT1500 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One of the primers used to generate the PCR fragment introduced a Nde I site overlapping the ATG start codon ofmtsA. Primer 40ex1 (ATGGATCCCATATGGTAAGTGAAATGACTCC) corresponded to the region +1 to +20 on the coding strand ofmtsA and had an additional 11 base pairs at the 5′ end to accommodate a Bam HI and a Nde I site. Primer 40ex2 (CCAATCAAGCTTGCATCCCAAAACC) corresponded to +267 to +243 (relative to the translational start) on the noncoding strand of mts A and had a Hin dIII site which was also present in the template. The amplification reaction contained 5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 3.0 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 200 nm each primer, and 2.0 ng of template DNA (pPT1500) in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was carried out for 30 cycles of 96 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2.0 min. The amplified fragment was introduced into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) yielding pGEM-4. The latter construct was digested withHin dIII and Sal I and ligated simultaneously with a Hin dIII/Pst I fragment of pPT600 and aPst I/Sal I fragment of pCO300 yielding pGEM-4HS. ANde I/Ssp I fragment from pGEM-4HS beginning with the 5′ end of mtsA and ending 61 base pairs downstream of the translational mtsA stop was introduced into the pET-17b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with Nde I andEco RV and cloned into the stringent expression hostEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). This generated an expression vector for MtsA (pET-40ex) driven from the IPTG-induciblelac UV5 promoter and without the T7 tag that is otherwise present in the pET-17b vector. The mtsA insert and flanking vector regions were sequenced. The mtsA gene in the insert was found to be identical to the previously characterizedmtsA sequence (GenBank™ U36337) and correctly oriented in the expression vector. Cultures of E. coli with pET-40ex were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm and induced with 0.4 mm IPTG at 37 °C with aeration. Samples were removed at 1-h intervals for analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cultures were harvested 3 h after induction, washed with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 2 mmEDTA. Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 pounds per square inch. Cell debris was removed from the extract by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then the inclusion bodies were pelleted by subsequent centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The inclusion bodies were then washed with 0.5, 1, and 2 m urea and again collected by centrifugation before solubilization in anoxic 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm DTT, and 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol. MtsA was refolded by rapid dilution of 1 part solubilized inclusion bodies into 59 parts anaerobic 1 mKCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm ZnCl2, in 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0. The solution was stirred for 20 h at 20–24 °C. All anoxic solutions were prepared by repeated evacuation and flushing with N2. The refolded MtsA was concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, and further purified by anion exchange chromatography using an Uno column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. Proteins binding to the column were eluted with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. MtsA eluted at ∼130 mm NaCl. MtbA, the methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase of methylamine catabolism, (formerly known as MT2-A) was purified from M. barkeri as described previously (35Burke S.A. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4410-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MtsA was dialyzed to equilibrium against 2 liters of 10 mm TES, pH 7.0, and 0.7 mg (2 ml) dialyzed MtsA submitted for metal analysis. MtsA and a sample of the dialysis buffer were analyzed for the content of 30 metals by plasma emission on a Thermo Jarrell-Ash 965 inductively coupled argon plasma spectrometer by the Chemical Analysis Laboratory (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). The metal content for MtsA was determined by subtraction of the metal content of the dialysis buffer from the metal content of the dialyzed protein sample. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide) was performed with the buffer system of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1% SDS, using a Mini-slab electrophoresis system (Idea Scientific Co., Minneapolis, MN). Samples for electrophoresis were prepared with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromthymol blue and were heated to 80 °C for 15 min prior to electrophoresis. Molecular size markers (Bio-Rad) were β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and hen egg white lysozyme (14.4 kDa). Gels were stained with Coomassie R-250. The molecular mass of renatured recombinant MtsA was estimated with a Biologic medium pressure chromatography unit (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Superose 6HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Molecular mass standards (Sigma) for the Superose 6HR column included β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). CoM methylation with methylcobalamin was measured by either the cyanide derivatization assay or by direct spectral assay. For the cyanide derivatization assay, samples (300 μl) were prepared in nitrogen-flushed vials at 4 °C containing 1–20 μg of MtsA or MtbA, 1 mm methylcobalamin, and 20 mm CoM in MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, unless otherwise stated. Concentrations of methylcobalamin and CoM were varied for determination of apparentK m values. Reactions were initiated by transfer of the vials to 37 °C, and methyltransferase activity and the reaction rates determined by periodic removal of aliquots that were subjected to the cyanide derivatization (42Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12890-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cyanide derivatization procedure, hydroxycobalamin reacts with cyanide to generate dicyanocobalamin while methylcobalamin does not react with cyanide (42Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12890-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43Pol A. Gage R.A. Neis J.M. Reijnen J.W.M. Van D.D.C. Vogels G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 797: 83-93Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rates were determined with a minimum of three linear time points. The apparent K m value reported in the paper were the average of two determinations that varied by no more than 6%, the only exception being the apparent K m value for CoM in the methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase reaction, which is an average of five separate determinations with S.D. Methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity was also quantified by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm upon methylcobalamin demethylation (10Kreft J.U. Schink B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 226: 945-951Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2 mmmethylcobalamin in N2-flushed cuvets (1-cm pathlength) under dim red light at 22 °C. Samples (750 μl) were prepared with 5 μg of MtbA and 40 μm CoM in MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. Cob(I)alamin methylation was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 540 nm upon methylation (10Kreft J.U. Schink B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 226: 945-951Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Methyl transfer was performed in N2-flushed cuvets (2-mm pathlength) under dim red light at 22 °C. Assays were performed with 0.18–1.2 mg/ml MtsA or MtbA, 0.5–2.5 mmcob(I)alamin, and 20–200 mm soluble DMS. Cob(I)alamin was generated from an equal amount of hydroxycob(III)alamin and 6-fold greater concentration of titanium(III) citrate. Methanethiol (MSH) generated from the cob(I)alamin-dependent demethylation of DMS was measured by gas chromatography using a model 8A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 0.5-meter Poropak R column (Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). The column, injector, and detector were at 130 °C. The carrier gas was nitrogen at flow rate of 20 ml/min. It was determined that, under the conditions of the assay, 84% of total MSH in the closed vial was in the liquid phase of the reaction mixture at equilibrium. MtsA catalyzed CoM methylation with DMS in the presence of 1 mm cob(I)alamin was measured by monobromobimane derivatization of thiols and analysis of bimane derivatives by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (19Tallant T.C. Krzycki J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6902-6911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and based on the procedures of Fahey and co-workers (44Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Dorian R. Kosower E.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 45Newton G.L. Dorian R. Fahey R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 383-387Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in N2-flushed vials under dim red light at 37 °C. Reactions contained 0.53 mg/ml MtsA or 1.2 mg/ml MtbA, 10 mm CoM, 100 mm DMS, and 1 mmcob(I)alamin generated from the reduction of 1 mmhydroxycobalamin by 6 mm titanium(III) citrate. Samples were removed at 30-min intervals for monobromobimane derivatization. Reactions were performed in duplicate. Methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity was quantified in cells of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with pET-40ex using an assay based on cyanide derivatization of the hydroxycobalamin produced from oxidation of the cob(I)alamin generated by demethylation of methylcobalamin (42Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12890-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30,000 × g supernatant of extracts made with pET-40x-transformed cells catalyzed CoM-dependent demethylation of 16 nmol of methylcobalamin min−1 mg−1 total protein with 1 mm methylcobalamin and 20 mmCoM. No methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity was detectable in extracts of cells transformed with pET-17b lacking themtsA insert. Although no increase in soluble methyltransferase activity was observed following induction with IPTG, a notable increase in a prominent 41-kDa polypeptide, the expected size of MtsA, was found upon electrophoresis of SDS extracts of induced cells (Fig. 3). Microscopic examination of the induced cells revealed the presence of inclusion bodies, indicating that MtsA had been expressed largely in an insoluble form. The inclusion bodies were harvested from cells 3 h after induction and solubilized using 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm DTT, and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The solubilized protein was diluted 60-fold with a variety of refolding buffers, pH 8.0, and methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity was measured at 1, 4, and 24 h after dilution. Optimal activity was achieved by protein refolding at room temperature for 24 h in refolding buffer consisting of 500 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1m KCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm ZnCl2. Refolding buffers containing 500 mm guanidine hydrochloride, 33 mm CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm SDS, or 20% glycerol did not produce active methyltransferase, nor did refolding at 4 °C in the optimal refolding buffer. Preparations of recombinant MtsA made without addition of zinc typically had 3-fold lower methylcobalamin:CoM methyltransferase activity than MtsA refolded in the presence of added zinc. The solubilized and refolded MtsA was further purified by a subsequent anion exchange chromatography step. SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant MtsA preparation revealed a single homogenous polypeptide with a molecular mass of 41 kDa (Fig. 3). Approximately 40 mg of purified MtsA was obtained from 1 liter of induced recombinant cells. The purified recombinant enzyme catalyzed methylcobalamin:CoM methyl transfer at 1"

In epithelial cells, a nascent spectrin skeleton assembles in regions of cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact, and conversely, cytoskeletal assembly is required to complete the cell-adhesion process. The molecular interactions guiding these processes remain incompletely understood. We have examined the interaction of spectrin with α-catenin, a component of the adhesion complex. Spectrin (αIIβII) and α-catenin coprecipitate from extracts of confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney, HT29, and Clone A cells and from solutions of purified spectrin and α-catenin in vitro. By surface plasmon resonance and in vitro binding assays, we find that α-catenin binds αIIβII spectrin with an apparent K d of ≈20–100 nm. By gel-overlay assay, α-catenin binds recombinant βII-spectrin peptides that include the first 313 residues of spectrin but not to peptides that lack this region. Similarly, the binding activity of α-catenin is fully accounted for in recombinant peptides encompassing the NH2-terminal 228 amino acid region of α-catenin. Anin vivo role for the interaction of spectrin with α-catenin is suggested by the impaired membrane assembly of spectrin and its enhanced detergent solubility in Clone A cells that harbor a defective α-catenin. Transfection of these cells with wild-type α-catenin reestablishes α-catenin at the plasma membrane and coincidentally recruits spectrin to the membrane. We propose that ankyrin-independent interactions of modest affinity between α-catenin and the amino-terminal domain of β-spectrin augment the interaction between α-catenin and actin, and together they provide a polyvalent linkage directing the topographic assembly of a nascent spectrin-actin skeleton to membrane regions enriched in E-cadherin.

Best understood are linkages involving the adapter protein ankyrin. Ankyrin binds spectrin with high affinity (≈10–100 nm), linking spectrin to a variety of transmembrane proteins including ion channels or pumps, such as the anion exchanger AE1, the voltage-gated Na+ channel, Na+/K+-ATPase, H+/K+-ATPase (9Davis L.H.

Direct interactions of spectrin with the membrane are mediated by at least three distinct regions of β-spectrin, termed membrane association domains 1, 2, and 3 (MAD1,1MAD2, and MAD3). MAD1 is located in repeat unit 1 of both βI and βII spectrin (5Lombardo C.R. Weed S.A. Kennedy S.P. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29212-29219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contains a constitutive targeting signal that together with sequences in region 1 of spectrin can direct spectrin to either the Golgi or plasma membrane of MDCK cells (18Devarajan P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4409-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)3; its function remains uncharacterized, although it has been proposed to interact with a membrane calmodulin-binding protein (24Steiner J.P. Walke H.T.J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2783-2791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other modes of attachment and other adapter proteins almost certainly exist; their identification remains central to a complete understanding of spectrin assembly and function. In epithelial cells, assembly of the nascent cortical spectrin skeleton occurs at zones of cell-cell contact, regions where there is productive Ca2+-mediated homophilic adhesion between surface E-cadherin molecules (8Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3161-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Associated with E-cadherin is a group of cytoplasmic proteins that include α- and β-catenin (or γ-catenin) and p120 (for review see Refs. 25Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar and 27Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). β-Catenin (or in some cells γ-catenin) directly binds the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin; α-catenin joins the membrane complex via a direct association with β-catenin or γ-catenin (28Koslov E., R. Maupin P. Pradhan D. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27301-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). α-Catenin binds and bundles F-actin, an activity that presumably facilitates the attachment of actin filaments to the adhesion complex (29Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). α-Catenin also binds α-actinin, a distant member of the spectrin gene superfamily; this interaction may facilitate the docking of actin at the adhesion complex (30Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catenins, and their assembly with the cortical cytoskeleton, are closely linked to the regulation of cadherin function (25Peifer M. McCrea P.D. Green K.J. Wieschaus E. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Gumbiner B.M. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17 (suppl.): 155-158Crossref Google Scholar, 32Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Spectrin assembles with the adhesion complex soon after productive cell-cell contact is established (26McNeill H. Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The interactions guiding this process remain undefined. We now report a direct interaction of spectrin with α-catenin, and we demonstrate that α-catenin is required for spectrin assembly at the plasma membrane in Clone A cells, a human intestinal cell line. These studies thereby identify α-catenin as a novel adapter protein mediating spectrin-membrane association, suggest that this association is necessary for maturation of at least some types of cadherin-mediated junctions, and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which spectrin participates in the establishment of specialized membrane domains in polarized cells. Molecular biological procedures followed standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Recombinant peptides were prepared in Escherichia coli as before using one of the pGEX vector systems (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, also see Refs. 29Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar and 34Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Inserts of cDNA encoding selected regions of α(E)-catenin were isolated from a human colon cDNA library (GenBankTMaccession number L23805, see Ref. 35Rimm D.L. Kebriaei P. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The desired region of the cDNA was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases; the inserts were purified from agarose gels with the Qiaex gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into pGEX-2T. The alignment with the α-catenin constructs used in relation to the full sequence is shown in Fig. 2 and as used previously (29Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli strains HB101 and DH5α. For peptides particularly sensitive to proteolysis, strain CAG-456 was used. The expressed peptides were purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-agarose columns (36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). Purified α-catenin-GST fusion proteins were utilized as antigens for the generation of polyclonal antibodies that were subsequently affinity purified by absorption to immobilized immunogen. αIIβII spectrin was purified by low ionic strength extraction of fresh demyelinated bovine brain membranes, followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl-S-500 HR (37Bennett V. Baines A.J. Davis J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A subcloned line of high resistance type II strain of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured as before (38Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The human colon carcinoma cell line Clone A (39Breen E. Clarke A. Steele Jr., G. Mercurio A.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was provided as a gift by Dr. A. Mercurio, Harvard Medical School. Clone A cells were maintained in RPMI-H 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.3% l-glutamine. The human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 was provided by Dr. X-Y. Fu (Yale University). HT-29 cells were maintained in McCoy's modified medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.3% l-glutamine. Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (35-mm plates) were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in 600 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) by gentle rocking for 30 min. The lysate was spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was cleared by treatment with normal rabbit serum (50 μl/ml lysate) and protein A-Sepharose for 30 min on ice. The lysate (100 μl) was then incubated with 1 μl of anti-spectrin antibody (RAF-A) for 1 h at 4 °C and precipitated with 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed briefly 2× with RIPA buffer, followed by 2 washes with 400 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Confluent cells were extractedin situ with Triton X-100 as before (40Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with 0 °C phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and extracted with buffer 1 (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Perabloc SD) for 10 min, yielding the detergent-soluble cytoplasmic fraction. Extraction with buffer 2 (buffer 1 with 250 mmNH4SO4 in lieu of NaCl) for 10 min yielded the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Affinity purified anti-GST antibodies were used to precipitate quantitatively 125I-labeled spectrin bound to GST-α-catenin fusion proteins. Binding assays were performed in BSA-coated polypropylene tubes (41Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant α-catenin peptides N576 or C447 (1 μg) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled αIIβII spectrin for 2 h at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.8) containing 3% BSA. Anti-GST antibody (10 μg) was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Protein A-Trisacryl beads (100 μl of a 10% final suspension) were added for an additional hour. The bound and free samples were separated by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 5,000 rpm. Bound spectrin was quantified by γ-counting using a 1282 Compugamma CS (LKB instruments). Control experiments ensured that the GST fusion proteins were completely precipitated. Binding to GST alone or to protein-A beads in the absence of fusion protein was used as controls for nonspecific binding and were subtracted from all results to obtain specific binding data. GST was cleaved from recombinant α-catenin by thrombin digestion (28Koslov E., R. Maupin P. Pradhan D. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27301-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GST-spectrin peptides (1, 0.5, and 0.1 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) , pH 7.5, and overlaid for 1 h with 0.5 mg/ml recombinant α-catenin. After five brief rinses with TBS, a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal antibody 3H4 was overlaid for 1 h at RT. After five additional washes, goat anti-mouse antibody at a 1:10,000 tagged with horseradish peroxidase was used with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to detect the bound α-catenin. Binding detection by surface plasmon resonance was implemented using a BiacoreTM 1000 or 2000 instrument (Biacore AB). This technique of detecting protein-protein interactions is fully described in several publications (e.g. see Refs. 42Canziani G. Zhang W. Cines D. Rux A. Willis S. Cohen G. Eisenberg R. Chaiken I. Methods. 1999; 19: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43Panayotou G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zhou M. Felder S. Rubinstein M. Hurwitz D.R. Ullrich A. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8193-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Purified αIIβII spectrin was immobilized onto a carboxymethylated dextran gold surface of the BiacoreTM chip in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, and 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. Several chip surfaces were prepared, ranging from 350 to 1500 RUs of bound spectrin. Purified recombinant human α-catenin or expressed α-catenin subdomains were injected onto the spectrin surface, and the binding was measured as an increase in the resonance units (RU). The kinetic constants, k a andk d, for the binding of α-catenin to spectrin were determined as described (45Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) from a plot of dRU/dt versus R (s−1)versus concentration. The slope of these plots are equal tok a and the abscissa intercept equal tok d. The equilibrium dissociation value is determined from the equation K D =k d/k a. Alternatively, the sensograms were fit using the nonlinear fitting algorithms for multisite binding provided by Biacore AB. Residuals were evaluated for systematic divergences from the fitting algorithms as a measure of the appropriateness of the binding model. The spectrin binding surfaces were regenerated between determinations with 10 mm HCl or 10 mm NaOH. Control studies established the stability of the binding surfaces over the course of these experiments. Binding buffer conditions were 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, pH 6.8. Clone A cells (≈5 × 105) were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes, incubated overnight, and transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 3–6 μg of the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) carrying full-length human α1(E)-catenin (pcDNA3-α-catenin) (35Rimm D.L. Kebriaei P. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The manufacturer's transfection protocol was followed without modification. When stable lines were desired, neomycin-resistant clones were isolated by selective growth in medium containing 0.6 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subclones were identified on the basis of their assumption of a more sheet-like morphology, a phenotypic change in Clone A cells characteristic of full-length wild-type α-catenin expression (46Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alternatively, since stable lines often proved unstable, transiently expressing cells were used for most experiments. The expression of α-catenin was verified by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Cells were plated onto glass chamber slides and grown to subconfluence. Cells were washed five times in TBS, pH 8.0, and fixed in methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. After fixation, cells were washed again and blocked with 0.3% BSA/TBS for 1 h at RT. After blocking, cells were washed and incubated with various primary antibodies (diluted in 0.3% BSA/TBS) for 1 h at RT. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: monoclonal antibodies α-catenin (3H4) and 7A11 were used as undiluted culture supernatants; polyclonal antibody (RAFA) to αII spectrin was used at 1:500 dilution. After incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed and incubated with CY3- or CY2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:500 in 0.3% BSA/TBS for 1 h at RT. Cells were finally washed, mounted, and viewed by phase and epifluorescence using an Olympus AX-70 microscope. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Ampicillin and HEPES were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared by the Yale Critical Technologies Laboratory. Other reagents and their suppliers were Pfu polymerase from Stratagene; Taq polymerase from Cetus Corp.; Sephacryl S-500 HR and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography media from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Na125I from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Enzymobeads from Bio-Rad; sucrose from ICN; and protein-A Trisacryl-2000 beads from Pierce. Calf brain was obtained immediately after death from a local abattoir, transported at 0 °C, washed in 0.32 m sucrose, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. αIIβII spectrin was labeled with125I by immobilized lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase using Enzymobead reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. Final specific activity of the labeled proteins ranged between ≈0.01 and 1 mCi/mg. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue Protein Assay reagent (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. When needed for purposes of precise quantitation, protein concentrations were verified by triplicate amino acid analysis at the Keck Biotechnology Laboratory (Yale University). Several studies have established the coincidence at the light microscopic level of plasma membrane-associated spectrin and the cadherin-catenin adhesion complex along zones of cell-cell contact. A comparison of the pattern of spectrin staining in Clone A cells and HT29 cells (a closely related colonic epithelial cell line) suggests that α-catenin may mediate the linkage of spectrin to the adhesion complex. In poorly confluent HT29 cells, spectrin is largely cytoplasmic, as is α-catenin (Fig. 1, A–C). When these cells become more confluent and establish effective intercellular cadherin-mediated junctions, α-catenin is recruited to zones of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1 D). Coincident with this recruitment of α-catenin, there is recruitment of spectrin from cytoplasmic to membrane pools, in a distribution indistinguishable from α-catenin (Fig. 1, D and E; Fig.2). Conversely, in Clone A cells, an internal deletion of exons 4 and 5 in the transcribed cDNA of α-catenin generates a shortened and mutated α-catenin transcript (Fig. 3, also see Refs. 46Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and 47Furukawa Y. Nakatsuru S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Muto T. Nakamura Y. Horii A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 74-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clone A α-catenin is unstable and fails to associate with the cadherin-based adhesion complex (39Breen E. Clarke A. Steele Jr., G. Mercurio A.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 46Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), even though its ability to associate with β-catenin and actin appear qualitatively unimpaired (46Roe S. Koslov E.R. Rimm D.L. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As a result, intercellular adhesion in Clone A cells is impaired. Also impaired is the assembly of spectrin to the plasma membrane. This is evident both by its persistent cytoplasmic intracellular distribution even in confluent monolayers of Clone A cells (Fig.2 A), as well as by its reduced resistance to extraction with Triton X-100 (compared with HT29 cells, an intestinal line with normal α-catenin, Fig. 2 B). α-Catenin can also be directly demonstrated in immunoprecipitates of αIIβII spectrin solubilized from confluent MDCK, HT29, and Clone A cells (Fig. 2 C); MDCK cells are an epithelial line with well documented spectrin association at cadherin-based junctions (e.g. see Ref. 8Piepenhagen P.A. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3161-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Collectively, these in vivo observations indicate a tight and possibly direct linkage between spectrin and α-catenin and also suggest that these two proteins may associate both in the cytosol and at the membrane.Figure 3βII spectrin binds directly to the NH2-terminal 228 amino acids (aa) of α-catenin.

On the right is shown an SDS-PAGE analysis, Coomassie Blue-stained, of the purified αIIβII spectrin (S) and each of the α-catenin peptides (with GST removed). Their M r ÷ 1000 is shown. B, surface plasmon resonance analysis of the interaction of GST-α-catenin with immobilized αIIβII spectrin. A representative analysis is shown. Binding was evaluated on sensor chips containing three different concentrations of spectrin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each curve (from bottom totop) represents the sensogram trace of the binding of 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 1.2, and 2.4 μm recombinant GST-α-catenin, respectively. Similar experiments carried out with different levels of immobilized spectrin, and with recombinant α-catenin in which the GST moiety had been removed by thrombin treatment, gave comparable results. Interestingly, analysis of recombinant α-catenin representing the form found in Clone A cells, with the internal deletion of sequences encoded by exons 4 and 5, did not change its affinity for spectrin (data summarized in Table I).

https://openalex.org/W1985118265,"Minor group human rhinoviruses (exemplified by human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2)) use members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family for cell entry; all these receptors possess clathrin-coated pit localization signals. Viral infection should thus be inhibited under conditions of impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, Madshus et al. reported an increase in the cytopathic effect of HRV2 infection in HEp-2 cells upon suppression of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by hypotonic shock and potassium depletion (Madshus, I. H., Sandvig, K., Olsnes, S., and van Deurs, B. (1987) J. Cell. Physiol. 131, 14–22.) To resolve this apparent contradiction, we investigated the binding, internalization, conformational changes, and productive uncoating of HRV2 in HeLa cells subjected to hypotonic shock and potassium depletion. This treatment led to an increase in HRV2 binding, with internalization being barely affected. The generation of C-antigenic particles requiring pH ≤5.6 was strongly reduced due to an elevation of the pH in endosomal compartments. However, K+depletion only slightly affected de novo viral protein synthesis, suggesting that productivity of viral RNA in the cytoplasm is enhanced and thus compensates for the reduction in C-antigenic particles. The distinct steps in the entry pathway of HRV2 are thus differently influenced by potassium depletion. Viral internalization under conditions of inhibited clathrin-dependent endocytosis without the need to disturb the ionic milieu was confirmed in HeLa cells overexpressing the nonfunctional dynamin-1 mutant K44A. Unexpectedly, overexpression of dynamin-1 K44A resulted in elevated endosomal pH compared with overexpression of wild-type dynamin.

These small RNA-containing viruses constitute a large genus within the family Picornaviridae. The >100 serotypes are divided into two groups based on their receptor specificity (1Abraham G.

Internalization intobona fide endosomes has been demonstrated for the minor group virus HRV2 and the major group virus HRV14 (8Schober D. Kronenberger P. Prchla E. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1354-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All receptors of the LDLR family, including LDLR, LDLR-related protein (LRP), and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), contain tyrosine- and dileucine-based internalization signals in their cytoplasmic tails that direct them into clathrin-coated pits (9Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least for LDLR, it has been explicitly shown that ligand internalization depends on functional clathrin coats (10Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although specific binding of HRV2 to these receptors is well characterized (6Hofer F. Gruenberger M. Kowalski H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33835-33840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is so far unknown whether any of them is preferentially used by HRV2 for productive infection of HeLa cells. Soon after cell entry, native infectious viral particles undergo a conformational change induced by the low pH (≤5.6) prevailing in endocytic carrier vesicles and late endosomes (13Bayer N. Schober D. Prchla E. Murphy R.F. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9645-9655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Prchla E. Kuechler E. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3713-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications account for the formation of subviral “A-particles” sedimenting at 135 S that still contain the genomic viral RNA. Release of the RNA from the protein shell creates subviral “B-particles” that sediment at 80 S. Both particles are detected early in infection and are probably intermediates (A-particles) and remainders (B-particles) of the uncoating process (15Lonberg-Holm K. Korant B.D. J. Virol. 1972; 9: 29-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the native virus is “D-antigenic,” the subviral particles expose other epitopes and are “C-antigenic” (16Lonberg-Holm K. Yin F.H. J. Virol. 1973; 12: 114-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that inhibition of endosomal acidification by the specific vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 completely blocks the conformational modification from D- to C-antigenicity and prevents viral infection by HRV2 (14Prchla E. Kuechler E. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3713-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated by size-selective release of fluid-phase markers, which were co-internalized with the virus into endocytic compartments, pores are opened in response to the low pH in the presence of the virus (17Prchla E. Plank C. Wagner E. Blaas D. Fuchs R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that the viral RNA enters the cytosol through a pore in the endosomal membrane. The acid-induced conformational change thus either precedes or is directly coupled to the transfer of the RNA through the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. Modified subviral particles are in part digested in lysosomes and in part recycled to the cell surface and can therefore be found in the cell supernatant early after infection. Upon arrival of the genomic RNA in the cytosol, synthesis of new virus is initiated. Although the endocytic subcompartment where HRV2 uncoating takes place has been characterized, the initial pathway of HRV2 entry is not completely resolved. All receptors that have been demonstrated to mediate HRV2 attachment contain clathrin localization signals, and viral infection via clathrin-dependent endocytosis would appear most likely. However, in 1987, when the nature of the minor group rhinovirus receptor was unknown, Madshus et al. (18Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. van Deurs B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by K+ depletion results in an increase in the cytopathic effect of HRV2 in human epidermoid HEp-2 cells, a finding that is strongly suggestive of clathrin-independent viral internalization. HeLa cells stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin-1 (dynaminK44A) have been generated (19Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The mutation results in loss of the GTPase activity, inhibition of clathrin-coated pit constriction, and arrest of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Using these cells, it was recently shown that productive infection by the major group virus HRV14 is dependent on functional dynamin (20DeTulleo L. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4585-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), although the receptor for the major group of human rhinoviruses, ICAM-1, lacks internalization signals (21Staunton D.E. Gaur A. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3271-3274PubMed Google Scholar). We used this genetic defect in dynamin to exclude nonspecific ion concentration effects as occur under K+ depletion to obtain internalization data for HRV2. These seemingly irreconcilable data on the entry of rhinoviruses and, in particular, on that of the minor group virus HRV2 prompted us to investigate in detail the early events in viral infection. In particular, we dissected the effect of hypotonic shock/K+depletion on the binding, internalization, conformational changes, and productive uncoating of HRV2. The results thereof, together with data obtained with cells expressing mutant dynamin-1, demonstrate that viral internalization can occur via LRP and/or VLDLR by a clathrin-independent pathway. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Bafilomycin A1, kindly provided by Dr. K. H. Altendorf (University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany), was dissolved in Me2SO at 20 mm and stored at −20 °C.

Lyophilized Staphylococcus aureus cells (IgG-sorb) were obtained from the Enzyme Center (Malden, NM). Leibovitz L-15 medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The following buffers were used: isotonic KCl-free buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), isotonic KCl buffer (10 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), hypotonic medium (serum-free Leibovitz L-15 medium or DMEM diluted 1:1 with water), PBS2+ (PBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2), lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100) (27Collett M.S.

Rueckert, University of Wisconsin) were grown as monolayers in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids or as a suspension culture in Joklik's DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated 7% horse serum. For K+ depletion, HeLa cells (2.5 × 106/plate) were grown in 12-well plates. HeLa cells stably expressing dynaminK44A or dynaminwt were kindly supplied by Dr. S. L. Schmid (Department of Cell Biology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cells were cultivated in DMEM with high glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FCS, 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 ng/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were dislodged from subconfluent cultures with trypsin/EDTA, and 1.5 or 3.5 × 105 cells/well were plated on 12- or 6-well plates (Falcon), respectively, in the absence of tetracycline for 48 h (induction) before use; at that time, the cells finally were 60% confluent. HRV2 was propagated, labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine, and purified as described (28Skern T. Sommergruber W. Blaas D. Pieler C. Kuechler E. Virology. 1984; 136: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (Wisconsin strain, a subclone selected for increased capacity to replicate human rhinoviruses) were incubated in serum-free Leibovitz L-15 medium for 30 min at 37 °C and K+-depleted as described (10Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in hypotonic medium for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation in isotonic KCl-free buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. For control incubations, cells were maintained in Leibovitz L-15 medium as indicated above, and all incubations were carried out in isotonic KCl buffer. Control or K+-depleted HeLa cells were cooled to 4 °C and incubated with 50 μg/ml FITC-transferrin in K+-containing or K+-free buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS2+ and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The FITC fluorescence in the supernatant was measured in a CytoFluor 2300 (Millipore Corp.) using a standard filter set (excitation, 485 nm (20-nm slit width); emission, 530 nm (25-nm slit width)). After subtraction of the background fluorescence (unlabeled cells), the amount of cell-associated FITC-transferrin was calculated using a calibration curve derived from serial dilutions of FITC-transferrin in lysis buffer. To determine the internalization of plasma membrane-bound transferrin, an aliquot of the cells was washed with PBS2+ and incubated in the respective K+-containing or K+-free buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. To halt internalization, cells were again cooled, and membrane-bound transferrin was removed by washing the cells with 25 mmacetic acid containing 150 mm NaCl for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by washing with ice-cold PBS2+ for 15 min. This treatment completely removes plasma membrane-bound transferrin (23van Renswoude J. Bridges K.R. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). After cell lysis, internalized transferrin was determined as described above. Control or K+-depleted HeLa cells were incubated in the respective K+-containing or K+-free buffers containing 10 μg/ml 125I-labeled β-VLDL for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were cooled to 4 °C and washed with PBS2+. Plasma membrane-bound β-VLDL was removed by incubation in the same buffers containing 10 mg/ml suramin for 2 × 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer; nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min; and radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific uptake of 125I-labeled β-VLDL was determined by incubation in the presence 10 mg/ml suramin. Control or K+-depleted cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml FITC-labeled dextran (70 kDa) dissolved in K+-containing or K+-free buffer, respectively, for 20 min at 37 °C. Excess FITC-dextran was removed by washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS2+. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The FITC fluorescence in the supernatant was measured as described for FITC-transferrin. To determine viral binding, control or K+-depleted cells grown in 12-well plates were incubated in isotonic K+-containing or K+-free buffer, respectively, in the presence of ∼25 × 103 cpm/well 35S-labeled HRV2 for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with the same ice-cold buffers, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured in cell lysates using a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubation in the respective buffer in the presence of 10 mm NaEDTA (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. The efficiency of removal of HRV2 bound to the cell membrane at 4 °C was assessed using the following methods: (i) extensive washing with K+-free buffer without CaCl2 and MgCl2, but supplemented with 10 mm NaEDTA; (ii) incubation with 20 mm MES titrated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide to pH 5.0, 10 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose for 2 × 5 min, followed by washing with ice-cold PBS2+; (iii) incubation with 2.5% trypsin (100 μl/well) for 60 min (as cells were detached from the plastic dishes by the latter treatment, they were collected and washed with PBS2+ by low speed centrifugation); and (iv) determination of 35S-labeled HRV2 remaining accessible at the cell surface after immunoprecipitation by incubation with the virus-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8F5 (29Hewat E.A. Blaas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For Method iv, cells were incubated with 200 μl/well 8F5 hybridoma supernatant for 2 h, washed with PBS2+, and lysed in RIPA buffer (500 μl/well). Virus-antibody complexes were then precipitated by addition of 30 μl of a 10% (w/v) IgG-sorb suspension for 3 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 5 min. One-hundred μl of 8F5 was then added to the supernatant; and incubation, immunocomplex formation, and pelleting were repeated. Pellets were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS and suspended in 10 volumes of scintillation mixture (Ready-Value, Beckman Instruments) for counting. Finally, for viral uptake experiments, control or K+-depleted cells were incubated with 25 × 103 cpm 35S-labeled HRV2 for 20 min at 34 °C in the respective buffer; cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm NaEDTA and pelleted; and cell-associated radioactivity was determined in the cell lysates as described above. S. aureus mAb 2G2 and S. aureus rabbit anti-HRV2 antiserum immunocomplexes were made as described (30Neubauer C. Frasel L. Kuechler E. Blaas D. Virology. 1987; 158: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After incubation of the cells with HRV2, cell supernatants and cells were processed separately. Cell pellets were lysed in 300 μl of RIPA buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell debris were removed, and C-antigenic particles were recovered by incubation with the mAb 2G2 immunocomplexes. D-antigenic particles remaining in the supernatant were then precipitated with rabbit antiserum against HRV2 and S. aureus cells. Precipitates were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS and then analyzed on SDS-12% polyacrylamide minigels. Gels were soaked in 1m sodium salicylate for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Quantification was by laser densitometry (Ultrascan XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of the fluorographs. All incubations were carried out at 34 °C. Control or K+-depleted HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells/ml for each time point) were incubated in isotonic K+-containing or K+-free buffer, respectively. After 20 min, cells were resuspended in the respective buffers containing 200 nm bafilomycin A1 to dissipate the low intravesicular pH. After 40 min, cells were transferred to methionine-free MEM with 2% FCS (containing bafilomycin A1) and incubated further for 4, 6, 8, and 17 h. Cellular proteins were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 1 h (10Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and incorporated [35S]methionine was measured after protein precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Protein synthesis in K+-depleted cells at a given time point was related to that in the control cells, which was set to 100%. The efficiency of K+ depletion was always verified by quantitation of FITC-transferrin internalization (see above). All incubations were at 34 °C. Infection of control or K+-depleted HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) was carried out in K+-containing or K+-free buffer, respectively, for each time point. HRV2 was added at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 for 20 min. To halt uncoating of input virus, cells were transferred to fresh buffers supplemented with 200 nm bafilomycin A1 and further incubated for 40 min. The drug was also present during all subsequent incubations. To allow for recovery of protein synthesis, which is reduced under K+-depleted conditions, control and K+-depleted cells were transferred to methionine-free MEM with heat-inactivated 2% FCS. Seven h post-infection, 20 μCi/ml [S35]methionine was added. Seventeen hours post-infection, the cells were pelleted and lysed in 300 μl of RIPA buffer. Virus was immunoprecipitated with anti-HRV2 antiserum and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The intensity of the viral protein bands was determined from fluorographs by laser densitometry. HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged dynaminK44A or dynaminwt were plated at low density on 8-well chamber glass slides and cultivated in tetracycline-free DMEM for 48 h prior to the experiment. Inhibition of transferrin internalization into dynaminK44Acells was verified by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were depleted of endogenous transferrin by incubation in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then incubated in fresh medium containing 50 μg/ml FITC-transferrin for 20 min at 37 °C and cooled. Plasma membrane-bound transferrin was removed by acid wash (see above), followed by a wash with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin, and incubated with rhodamine-labeled anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:80 dilution). For HRV2 internalization, cells were then incubated with HRV2 at a m.o.i. of 100 in DMEM for 20 min at 34 °C. This high m.o.i. was found to be necessary for HRV2 detection. To study the influence of GST-RAP on HRV2 internalization, cells were preincubated in DMEM containing GST-RAP (100 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. GST-RAP was also present during HRV2 internalization. Cells were then transferred to 4 °C and washed with ice-cold PBS2+, and plasma membrane-bound virus was masked by incubating the cells with rabbit anti-HRV2 antiserum (preadsorbed with non-infected cells and diluted 1:10) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS2+, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin. First, internalized D- and C-antigenic HRV2 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using mAb 8F5 at 6 μg/ml and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500). Then, cells overexpressing HA-dynaminwt and HA-dynaminK44Awere identified using a rhodamine-labeled monoclonal antibody specific for the HA epitope. It should be mentioned that a punctate fluorescence appeared in cells devoid of HA-dynamin expression, but with internalized HRV2. This resulted from interaction of the mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody with residual binding sites present on the secondary anti-mouse antibody used to detect mAb 8F5 attachment to HRV2. Various attempts to block these free binding sites failed, but the appearance of the staining pattern allowed a clear differentiation. Cells were mounted in Moviol and viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Digital images were processed with the Zeiss KS400 imaging program. Confocal images were taken with a Leica TCS NT Universal confocal microscope. Impaired clathrin-dependent internalization directly correlates with the number of transferrin receptors at the plasma membrane. The percentage of dynaminK44A-expressing cells was thus determined via fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of FITC-transferrin binding (31Boleti H. Benmerah A. Ojcius D.M. Cerf Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induced cells were incubated for 30 min in serum-free DMEM, cooled to 4 °C, and incubated with 50 μg/ml FITC-transferrin in DMEM for 1 h. Excess transferrin was removed by washing; cells were scraped off the dish, resuspended in PBS, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. From the two peaks seen, the one with higher fluorescence intensity was taken to correspond to those cells that had a higher density of transferrin receptors as a result of dynaminK44A expression. From these measurements, it was inferred that 70% of the induced cells (subpopulation with high FITC intensity) were positive for exogenous dynamin expression. To investigate the effect of K+ depletion on endosomal pH, control or K+-depleted HeLa cells were incubated in K+-containing or K+-free buffer, respectively, containing 4 mg/ml FITC-dextran (70 kDa) and 1 mg/ml Cy5-dextran (70 kDa) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (32Murphy R.F. Powers S. Cantor C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To measure the endosomal pH in dynaminwt and dynaminK44A cells, they were incubated at 37 °C in DMEM containing 4 mg/ml FITC-dextran (70 kDa) and 1 mg/ml Cy5-dextran (70 kDa) either for 20 min or for 5 min, followed by incubation in dextran-free DMEM for 15, 55, and 115 min, respectively. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Standard buffers with pH values between 5.0 and 7.5 were obtained by mixing 50 mm HEPES with 50 mmMES, both containing 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm ammonium acetate, and 40 mm sodium azide. A pH calibration curve of internalized FITC/Cy5-dextran was generated using aliquots of the labeled cells (24Rybak S.L. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were divided into eight aliquots, pelleted, resuspended in the various buffers, and equilibrated at 4 °C for 10 min prior to analysis. Under these conditions, cells are depleted of endogenous ATP; vacuolar ATPases do not function; and equilibration of intravesicular and external media is accomplished by weak acid-base buffers (24Rybak S.L. Murphy R.F. J. Cell. Physiol."

This induction requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) comprised of four glucocorticoid accessory factor (AF) elements and two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites. We show that the AFs that bind the gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 elements (hepatocyte nuclear factor [HNF]4/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 and HNF3β) all interact with steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1). This suggests that the AFs function in part by recruiting coactivators to the GRU. The binding of a GAL4-SRC1 chimeric protein completely restores the glucocorticoid induction that is lost when any one of these elements is replaced with a GAL4 binding site. Thus, when SRC1 is recruited directly to gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3, the requirement for the corresponding AF is bypassed. Surprisingly, glucocorticoid receptor is still required when SRC1 is recruited directly to the GAL4 site, suggesting a role for the receptor in activating SRC1 in the context of the GRU. Structural variants of GAL4-SRC1 were used to identify requirements for the basic-helix-loop-helix and histone acetyltransferase domains of SRC1, and these are specific to the region of the promoter to which the coactivator is recruited.

Hormones such as glucocorticoids control transcription of genes that encode enzymes that help provide the adaptive response to these environmental changes (3Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M.

These hormone responses were originally thought to be mediated through a direct interaction of the hormone receptor and a simple DNA element, the hormone response element (HRE)1 (6Lucas P.C.

Hormone response units, comprised of HREs and accessory factor (AF) elements have been found in many genes involved in metabolic regulation (9Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Zimmermann P.L. Pierreux C.E. Rigaud G. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P.

AFs are DNA binding transcription factors that act in concert with the hormone receptor to provide the flexible regulation of gene transcription required for metabolic homeostasis (5Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In addition to their function in hormone-mediated gene transcription, AFs also play a central role in determining how metabolites regulate transcription. For instance, glucose-stimulated transcription of the L-PK gene requires a glucose response element that binds transcription factors of the upstream stimulating factor family. This glucose response, however, is regulated positively or negatively by the binding of HNF4 or COUP-TF, respectively, at an adjacent accessory element (17Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Diaz Guerra M.J. Bergot M.O. Martinez A. Cuif M.H. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell.

In addition, Osborne and co-workers show that, in the absence of cholesterol, SREBP activates transcription of the low density lipoprotein receptor and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene promoters (21Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An SREBP response element (SRE) alone, however, is not sufficient for activation of either gene. The activation of the low density liproprotein receptor gene promoter by SREBP requires not only a sterol response element but also an SP1 binding element (21Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene expression by SREBP requires both a sterol response element and an element that binds nuclear factor Y (9Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Osborne T.F. Gil G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The role of AFs is well characterized in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids. In adipose tissue, where PEPCK is involved in glycerogenesis, glucocorticoids repress basal and cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription (25Franckhauser S. Antras F.J. Robin P. Robin D. Forest C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 723-729PubMed Google Scholar, 26Franckhauser V.S. Antras F.J. Robin D. Robin P. Forest C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PEPCK gene is stimulated by glucocorticoids in the liver, where PEPCK is an important control point for gluconeogenesis (16Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 27Granner D.K. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 365-369Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the liver, glucocorticoids induce an ≈10-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene through a multicomponent glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) located in the promoter region (28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The GRU consists of a tandem array of four AF elements (gAF1–3 and the cAMP response element) that bind HNF4/COUP-TF, HNF3β, COUP-TF, and C/EBPβ, respectively, and two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GR1, GR2) (13Wang J.-C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither HNF3 nor HNF4 is expressed in adipose tissue, whereas both are expressed at high levels in the liver (33Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 34Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Thus, the accessory factors HNF3 and HNF4 appear to play an additional important role in facilitating tissue-specific induction of PEPCK gene transcription. A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50–60% reduction of glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Any combination of two mutations of gAF1/gAF3 or gAF2 nearly abolishes the response (28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 37Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The physiologic importance of these gAFs is evident in their role in glucose production. Overexpression of an HNF3 variant that reduces the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids by ∼50% nearly abolishes glucocorticoid-induced glucose production in hepatoma cells (14Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These gAF elements are not all functionally equivalent in the context of the PEPCK gene promoter (28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 31Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). gAF1 and gAF3 can be exchanged, a finding consistent with the observation that COUP-TF binds to both elements. However, gAF1/gAF3 cannot be replaced with gAF2 andvice versa (37Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the spacing between gAF2 and GR1 must be maintained, whereas this is not as important for gAF1 and gAF3 (37Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HNF3, the AF that binds gAF2, interacts with GR in vitro (37Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, direct contact between HNF3 and GR may be important for stabilizing GR binding to the GR1 and GR2 elements of the PEPCK gene promoter, which bind GR with low affinity relative to a consensus GRE (36Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In fact, these nonconsensus elements (GR1 and GR2), either alone or in combination, cannot by themselves mediate a glucocorticoid response when placed in the context of a heterologous promoter (36Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene is completely dependent on the gAF elements and the factors that bind to these sites. However, the mechanism by which AFs control the direction and magnitude of PEPCK gene transcription in response to glucocorticoids remains largely unknown. The recruitment of coactivator molecules provides a crucial step in the integration of the functions of steroid hormone receptors and AFs with the basal transcription machinery (2Wang J. Stafford J. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). Coactivators generally do not bind DNA, but instead associate with DNA-bound activator proteins. Some coactivators such as CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) mediate the functions of a diverse group of transcription factors. Others, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein (GRIP1), are functionally more specific in that they interact with activator proteins involved in steroid hormone-mediated gene transcription (41Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar,42Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the AFs bound to the gAF1 and gAF2 elements of the PEPCK gene promoter recruit the coactivator molecule SRC1. HNF4 and COUP-TF interact with SRC1 through the domains required for their AF activity (1Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Wang J. Stafford J. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We show here that HNF3 also interacts with SRC1 through the same domain required for its AF activity in the PEPCK gene promoter. Mutations of either gAF1 or gAF2 that prevent HNF4/COUP-TF or HNF3β from binding, including replacement of the gAF element with a GAL4 binding site (gAF→GAL4), result in a 50–60% reduction of the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids (43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of a GAL4-SRC1 chimeric protein to a gAF1→GAL4 or a gAF2→GAL4 element in a PEPCK luciferase reporter gene construct completely restores the glucocorticoid induction. Thus, when SRC1 is recruited directly to gAF1 or gAF2, the requirement for the corresponding AF is functionally bypassed. Surprisingly, even when SRC1 is recruited to the PEPCK gene promoter in this manner, active involvement of ligand-bound GR is still required, suggesting a role of the receptor in activating SRC1 in the context of this enhanceosome. Finally, we show that the bHLH and HAT domains of SRC1 function differently according to the component of the PEPCK gene GRU to which the coactivator is recruited. The reporter construct PEPCK-LUC was made by excising the PEPCK gene promoter (from −467 to +65) from pPL32-CAT (44Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with Afl III/Bgl II and inserting it into the Mlu I/Bgl II sites of pGL3 basic (Promega). The same procedure was used to generate the gAF1→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC, gAF2→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC, and gAF3→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC reporter constructs from their respective chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporters, as described previously (43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). The gAF1→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC constructs with block mutations in the GR1 and GR2 elements were constructed using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The GAL4-SRC1 deletion constructs were also made by the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit using a GAL4-SRC1 construct as the template. Oligonucleotides used to generate these constructs were made by an Expedite 8909 oligonucleotide synthesizer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in TableI. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The reporter plasmid (GAL4)5-E1b-LUC has been described previously (1Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

The GAL4-HNF3β constructs were also described previously and are expressed at approximately equal levels in transient transfection experiments (43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The maintenance and transfection of H4IIE cells and the measurements of luciferase activity were performed as described previously (44Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K.

Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated overnight in serum-free medium with or without 500 nm dexamethasone, as described in the figure legends. In experiments performed with H4IIE cells, the glucocorticoid response varied from 7- to 20-fold (with dexamethasone/without dexamethasone). The variation is passage- and batch-dependent. For this reason, we expressed the data in each experiment as a percentage of the wild-type glucocorticoid response, which allowed for comparison of experiments done in cells grown at different times. For experiments that involved mapping the domains of GAL4-SRC1 required for accessory factor activity, 5 μg of the reporter construct (gAF1→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC or gAF2→GAL4 PEPCK-LUC) were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of GR expression vector and 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 μg of expression plasmid encoding the various GAL4-SRC1 structural variants. The total amount of DNA transfected in each experiment was kept constant by using varying amounts of the empty vector. These experiments were repeated 3–5 times, and the optimal hormonal responses from each titration experiment were pooled for the results shown in Figs. 5 a and 6. The optimal concentration of GAL4-SRC was consistently 0.25 μg, but the optimal concentration of the structural variants varied from 0.25 to 1.0 μg. Luciferase activity was determined using the Promega luciferase assay system and normalized to the protein concentration of whole cell extracts. Transient transfections of HeLa and COS cells were performed as described previously (2Wang J. Stafford J. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector for GAL4-SRC1 was provided by Dr. Peter Kushner, University of California, San Francisco. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, assuming two-tailed variance.Figure 6The HAT domain of SRC1 is required for the glucocorticoid response at gAF2, but the bHLH domain is not.Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 3, except that equal amounts of GAL4-DBD (+G4-DBD), GAL4-SRC1 (+G4-SRC1), or the structural variants indicated were used. This result demonstrates element-specific requirements of SRC1 in the PEPCK gene GRU, and it further confirms that GAL4-SRC-ΔbHLH is not transcriptionally inactive. Results are represented relative to the fold induction of wild-type PEPCK-LUC by glucocorticoids, which is taken as 100%. These results represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments. The asterisk represents a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) from GAL4-SRC1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously, except that 7.5 μg of nuclear extracts were used for incubations rather than whole-cell extracts (43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (30Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 46Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were incubated in the presence or absence of GAL4-DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD) antibody or Lex A antibody as a control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 15 min at room temperature in a 10-μl reaction and then mixed with 10 μl of a reaction buffer containing 30,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled DNA probe (5′-CACACGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGACCA-3′), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnS04, 6% glycerol, 0.6 μg poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA for another 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA and electrophoresed at 20 mA for 150 min at room temperature. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Previous studies of the PEPCK gene GRU show that each gAF element is specifically required and that a precise organization of these elements in the GRU is necessary for a full glucocorticoid response (28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 37Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids cause a 15-fold induction of reporter enzyme activity when a PEPCK gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct that contains all of the gAF elements is expressed transiently in H4IIE hepatoma cells (Fig.1). H4IIE cells have significant amounts of endogenous accessory factors and potential coregulators such as SRC1 to provide for this response. 2J. M. Stafford, M. Waltner-Law, and D. K. Granner, unpublished observation. The presence of large amounts of these wild-type proteins, however, makes it difficult to analyze the effects of their transiently expressed variants on PEPCK gene transcription. Mutations of the gAF1 element that prevent HNF4/COUP-TF from binding, including replacement of gAF1 with a GAL4 binding site (gAF1→GAL4), result in a 50–60% reduction of the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids, as noted previously (Fig. 1 and Refs. 28Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and 43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). The GAL4 binding site can bind chimeric proteins that contain domains of interest and, thus, can serve as a surrogate gAF element. This is useful because the endogenous PEPCK AFs cannot function through this surrogate gAF element; thus, they are effectively removed from the analytical system. The reduction of the glucocorticoid response caused by replacement of the gAF1 element with a GAL4 element cannot be restored by expression of the GAL4-DBD, indicating that the GAL4-DBD cannot act as an AF through this surrogate gAF1 element (Fig. 1 and Ref. 43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of chimeric proteins consisting of the GAL4-DBD and either HNF4 or COUP-TF restores the glucocorticoid response (1Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Wang J. Stromstedt P. Sugiyama T. Granner D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that HNF4 and COUP-TF recruit coactivator molecules to form a glucocorticoid-specific enhanceosome, whereas the GAL4-DBD does not. These coactivators, in turn, could stabilize the enhanceosome complex and/or provide necessary activation to the promoter region (47Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In support of this model, we have shown that HNF4 and COUP-TF (AFs which bind gAF1 and gAF3) interact with SRC1 through the domains demonstrated to be required for their accessory factor activity (1Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Wang J. Stafford J. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30847-30850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, if the role of HNF4/COUP-TF at gAF1 is to recruit coactivators such as SRC1, then direct recruitment of the latter to the gAF1 element by making a chimeric protein with the GAL4-DBD and full-length SRC1 (GAL4-SRC1) should also mediate the glucocorticoid response."

To investigate the protective role of catalase against CYP2E1-dependent cytotoxicity, E47 cells, a transfected HepG2 cell line overexpressing CYP2E1, were infected with adenoviral vectors containing human catalase cDNA (AdCat) and catalase cDNA with a mitochondrial leader sequence (AdmCat).

Overexpression of catalase in the cytosol (AdCat) and in mitochondria (AdmCat) was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Cell death caused by arachidonic acid plus iron was considerably suppressed in both AdCat- and AdmCat-infected E47 cells as determined by assays of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide absorbance, lactate dehydrogenase release, and morphology changes. AdCat- and AdmCat-infected cells were also more resistant to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and to the increase in lipid peroxidation induced by arachidonic acid and iron.

In the presence of transition metals such as ferric and copper, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide generate hydroxyl radical by the Fenton reaction or the metal-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction (9Michiels C.

Hydroxyl radical is able to cause the degradation of most biological macromolecules, e.g. peroxidation of lipids, oxidation of sugars and protein thiols, DNA base damage, and strand breakage of nucleic acids (11Dringen R. Hamprecht B. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), the ethanol-inducible form, is of interest because of its ability to metabolize and activate many toxicologically important substrates to more toxic products (12Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar,13Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). There is considerable interest in the mechanism by which ethanol is hepatotoxic (14Dianzani M.U. Alcohol Alcohol. 1985; 20: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bondy S.C. Toxicol. Lett. 1992; 63: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the intragastric model of ethanol feeding, prominent induction of CYP2E1 occurs, and significant alcohol liver injury occurs only in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (16Castillo T.

In these models, large increases in lipid peroxidation have been observed, and the ethanol-induced liver pathology has been shown to correlate with CYP2E1 levels and elevated lipid peroxidation. In our laboratory, stable HepG2 cell lines that express human CYP2E1 were established; ethanol, arachidonic acid (AA), or iron was toxic to cells expressing CYP2E1, but not to control cells lacking CYP2E1 (19Wu D.

Mitochondria are an important organelle in the cell and are not only a major source of generation of ROS from the mitochondrial respiratory chain (22Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), but also a critical target of ROS that are generated either in the mitochondria or derived from outside of the mitochondria. ROS, including superoxide radical or hydrogen peroxide and especially hydroxyl radical, attack a variety of molecules present within the mitochondria that subsequently cause loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decrease in ATP generation, and release of cytochrome c, events that lead cells to undergo necrosis or apoptosis (23Kowaltowski A.J.

Catalase is a very efficient enzyme to protect cells from the accumulation of H2O2, catalyzing the conversion of H2O2 to H2O and O2; catalase is effective at high levels of H2O2(9Michiels C. Raes M. Toussaint O. Remacle J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Catalase is mainly located in the cytoplasm (erythrocyte) and peroxisomes (most cells, especially liver). With the exception of rat heart (26Radi R. Turrens J.F. Chang L.Y. Bush K.M. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), catalase is not normally present in the mitochondria. Another major system that catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 is glutathione peroxidase, which is localized in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. This system also requires NADPH plus glutathione reductase to catalyze the reduction of GSSG back to reduced GSH. In a previous study, we established HepG2 cells with overexpressed catalase in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments by transfection with plasmids containing catalase cDNA and catalase cDNA linked to the leader sequence of manganese-superoxide dismutase (27Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cell lines that constitutively expressed catalase in the mitochondrial as well as cytosolic compartments were protected from cytotoxicity or apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide and antimycin A (27Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the present study, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was used to compare the effect of overexpression of human catalase in the cell cytosol with that in the mitochondria on the ability to protect HepG2 cells from CYP2E1-dependent cytotoxicity induced by arachidonic acid and iron. It was hoped that studies with these adenoviral constructs and cell culture would be useful for eventual in vivo studies employing catalase localized in different cellular compartments. Rhodamine 123, propidium iodide (PI), and MitoTracker® Red were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against human catalase was obtained from Calbiochem. Arachidonic acid, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, minimal essential medium, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. Ad5 adenoviral vector with compensating deletions in the early region 1 (E1), as developed by Graham and co-workers (28McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L.

Human catalase cDNA and catalase cDNA with a manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondria leader sequence were obtained by digestion of plasmids pZeoSV-CAT and pZeoSV/MSP-CAT, respectively (kindly provided by Dr. J. Andres Melendez, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). The plasmid shuttle vectors pAd5-CMV-Cat and pAd5-CMV-mCat were constructed by inserting catalase cDNA or catalase cDNA with a manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondria leader sequence, respectively, into the Ad5 shuttle vector pCA13. These adenoviral shuttle plasmids together with the Ad5 genomic DNA JM17 were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which provide the E1A gene product necessary for viral replication during transfer. After transfection, plates were overlaid with agar, and initial plaques were harvested, amplified, and screened for enzymatic activity. Adenovirus containing no cDNA (AdNull) was used as a control. Virus possessing cytosolic catalase (AdCat) and mitochondrial catalase (AdmCat) as well as AdNull were plaque-purified two times and amplified in 293 cells. Purified high titer stocks of recombinant adenovirus were generated by two sequential rounds of CsCl density purification. The preparations were dialyzed and stored in dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 10% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. The titer of each viral stock was determined by plaque assay on 293 cells; titers were consistently ∼1× 1011plaque-forming units/ml. The concentration of recombinant adenovirus was quantified also by absorbance, and the ratio of particles to plaque-forming units consistently ranged between 20 and 30. E47 cells, a HepG2 cell line overexpressing CYP2E1, and C34 cells, a HepG2 cell line transfected with empty plasmid (pCI-neo) (30Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before infection, E47 cells were seeded onto dishes or plates; grown to 60% confluence; and infected with AdCat, AdmCat, and AdNull at m.o.i. = 100. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were collected and assayed for catalase expression or treated with pro-oxidants. Cell lysates were prepared by sonicating cells, followed by centrifugation. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured (DC protein assay reagent, Bio-Rad), and 10 μg of denatured protein was resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human catalase polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution). Detection by the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out for 1 min using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film. To validate expression of functional catalase, the catalase activity of fresh sonicated cell extracts was determined at 25 °C according to Claiborne and Fridovich (31Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase was followed by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 240 nm. The reaction was performed using a solution of 20 mm hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm K2HPO4 containing 10 μg of total cellular protein in a final volume of 1 ml. The specific activity of catalase was calculated from the following equation: specific activity (units/mg of protein/min) = ΔA 240 nm(1 min) × 1000/43.6 × mg of protein. E47 cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum on glass coverslips and infected with AdCat, AdmCat, or AdNull adenovirus. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were incubated for 30 min with 50 nm MitoTracker® Red. The incubation medium was removed, and the cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min with freshly prepared 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed three times for 10 min in 0.3 m glycine prepared in PBS and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of a rabbit anti-human erythrocyte catalase polyclonal antibody, followed by three washes in PBS, and incubated with a 1:160 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, followed by an additional three washes in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on slides and examined by confocal microscopy. Cell viability was measured by vital dye reduction using the cell titer 96 non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). Cells (1 × 105) were seeded onto 24-well plates and infected with adenovirus, followed by treatment with different concentrations of AA (0, 10, 20, and 30 μm) plus 30 μm Fe-NTA. Similarly treated uninfected E47 cells were used as a control. The medium was removed, and cell viability was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (27Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). LDH activity was measured as another index of cytotoxicity. E47 cells were plated onto 6-well plates and infected with AdNull, AdCat, or AdmCat adenovirus, followed by treatment with different concentrations of AA (0, 10, 20, and 30 μm) plus 30 μm Fe-NTA. Similarly treated uninfected E47 cells were used as a control. The culture medium was collected to measure LDH activity as LDHout. Cells were harvested by scraping, washed in PBS, suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and sonicated for 10 s. The lactate dehydrogenase assay kit (Sigma) was used for the quantitative kinetic determination of LDH activity. The LDH activity of the cell suspension was measured as LDHin. The percentage of LDH release was calculated by the formula LDHout/(LDHout + LDHin) × 100% and used to express the cytotoxicity. Changes in the integrity of the plasma membrane and in the mitochondrial membrane potential were examined by monitoring the cells after double staining with PI and rhodamine 123. E47 cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto 6-well plates and infected with adenovirus. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were incubated with 20 μm AA for 16 h, followed by incubation with 30 μm Fe-NTA for an additional 6 h. The cells were then incubated with medium containing 5 μg/ml rhodamine 123 for 1 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 1 ml of minimal essential medium containing 5 μg of PI. The intensity of fluorescence from PI and rhodamine 123 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Lipid peroxidation of the cells was measured with the thiobarbituric acid assay using minor modifications of the method described by Niehaus and Samuelsson (32Niehaus Jr., W.G. Samuelsson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Briefly, C34 and uninfected E47 cells as well as E47 cells infected with AdNull, AdCat, or AdmCat adenovirus were incubated in the absence of any addition or treated with 20 μm AA for 16 h, followed by incubation with 30 μm Fe-NTA for an additional 6 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped from the dishes, and then suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mm trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid). Cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing 0.5 mm trolox. Fifty microliters of cell suspension and 100 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid, 0.375% thiobarbituric acid, and 0.25 n hydrochloric acid were mixed in a Vortex mixer and incubated for 15 min at 100 °C, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 535 nm. The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 105m−1cm−1. To examine the capacity of AdCat and AdmCat to enhance the expression and activity of catalase in cells, E47 cells were infected with AdCat and AdmCat as well as the empty adenovirus AdNull at m.o.i. = 100. Using an adenovirus containing thelacZ gene to infect E47 cells followed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assay, it was determined that >98% of the E47 cells were infected with the adenovirus under these reaction conditions. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig.1 A shows the expression of catalase in the total cell extract from these cells. Results from densitometric analyses of the intensity of the various bands indicated that the expression of catalase in total cell extracts of cells infected with AdCat and AdmCat was 2-fold higher than that in uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull. Catalase levels in the uninfected E47 cells were 2-fold higher than those in C34 cells; this may reflect an up-regulation of catalase expression to remove ROS generated from CYP2E1. Similar results were obtained by measuring catalase activity (Fig. 1 B). In total cell extracts of E47 cells infected with AdCat and AdmCat, catalase activity was 2-fold higher than that in uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull virus and 4-fold higher than that in C34 cells. To localize where the catalase is found inside the cells, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with detection by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). Catalase in cells was labeled by green fluorescence, whereas the mitochondria were stained red using a mitochondrion-specific dye, MitoTracker® Red. Catalase in E47 cells infected with AdNull was located in the peroxisome, as shown by the punctate staining that did not overlap with the MitoTracker (Fig. 2, upper panels). This likely reflects the localization of the endogenous catalase. Catalase in cells infected with AdmCat was located in mitochondria, as shown by the overlay (yellow) of the green fluorescence color of fluorescein isothiocyanate with the red color from MitoTracker® Red in mitochondria, with no green fluorescence in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2, lower panels). This validates that the manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial signal peptide successfully transported catalase into the mitochondria. Cells infected with AdCat showed a high intensity of green fluorescence in the cytosolic fraction with more diffuse staining. There was no overlay with the MitoTracker (Fig. 2,middle panels). These results indicate that the increased expression of catalase in E47 cells infected with AdmCat was localized to the mitochondria, whereas catalase in E47 cells infected with AdCat was localized to the cytosol. Arachidonic acid plus iron can induce cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 by a process involving increased lipid peroxidation (20Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Sakurai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether mitochondrial or cytosolic catalase can protect against AA- plus iron-induced cytotoxicity, E47 cells were infected with AdCat, AdmCat, and AdNull adenovirus at m.o.i. = 100 for 48 h, followed by incubation with different concentrations of AA (0, 10, 20, and 30 μm) for 16 h and 30 μm Fe-NTA for an additional 8 h. The viability of the cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and by LDH release. The percentage of surviving cells decreased in an AA concentration-dependent manner, and this decrease was similar for uninfected E47 cells and E47 cells infected with AdNull virus (Fig. 3 A). E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of AA plus iron than were uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull virus (Fig. 3 A). There was no significant difference between E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat in protecting against the toxicity induced by AA plus Fe-NTA. Essentially similar results were obtained using the LDH release assay to determine the cell viability in the same treatment protocol as described above (Fig. 3 B). Large amounts of LDH were released from untreated E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull virus into the medium when cells were treated with different concentrations of AA plus 30 μm Fe-NTA. However, little LDH was detected in the medium of E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat. The morphology of uninfected E47 cells and E47 cells infected with AdNull, AdCat, or AdmCat adenovirus in the absence and presence of treatment with different concentrations of AA (0, 10, 20, and 30 μm) for 16 h, followed by incubation with 30 μm Fe-NTA for 8 h and 24 h, was recorded by visualizing cells under a light microscope. Fig.4 shows the results obtained with control cells (a, c, e, and g) and cells treated with 30 μm AA plus Fe-NTA for 24 h (b, d, f, and h). Almost all of the uninfected E47 cells and E47 cells infected with AdNull lost normal morphology when treated with AA plus Fe-NTA, whereas most of the E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat retained their shape and structure (Fig. 4).Figure 4Morphology of uninfected E47 cells and E47 cells infected with AdNull, AdCat, or AdmCat adenovirus in the absence and presence of arachidonic acid plus iron. E47 cells were infected with AdNull, AdCat, or AdmCat adenovirus at m.o.i. = 100. After 48 h, cells were treated with AA plus Fe-NTA. Cell morphology was visualized under a light microscope. Shown is the morphology of uninfected E47 cells (a and b) and E47 cells infected with AdNull (c and d), AdCat (e and f), and AdmCat (g andh) adenovirus in the absence (a, c,e, and g) and presence (b,d, f, and h) of 30 μmarachidonic acid for 16 h, followed by incubation with 30 μm Fe-NTA for 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Forty-eight hours after infection with adenovirus, E47 cells were incubated with or without 20 μm AA for 16 h and then incubated with 30 μm Fe-NTA for an additional 6 h. Cells not treated with AA plus Fe-NTA were predominantly located in the PI-negative and high ΔΨ (strong rhodamine 123 fluorescence) field (PI(−)-ΔΨ high), reflective of viable, intact cells (Fig.5, a, c,e, and g and respective insets). A small percentage of cells were located in the PI(+)-ΔΨ low field, reflective of damaged cells (Fig. 5, a, c,e, and g). Uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull that were treated with AA plus Fe-NTA moved to the PI(−)-ΔΨ low and PI(+)-ΔΨ low fields, and 67.3 and 82.5% of the cells displayed low rhodamine 123 intensity, respectively (Fig. 5,b and d, M1), compared with 30.8% of uninfected E47 cells and 40.4% of E47 cells infected with AdNull, but not treated with AA plus Fe-NTA (Fig. 5,a and c). However, after treatment with AA plus Fe-NTA, less cells were in the PI(+) field, and only 40.2 and 32.4% of E47 cells infected with AdCat and AdmCat were present in the ΔΨ low field, respectively (Fig. 5, f and h). These results indicate that both cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase protected the cells from loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and loss of membrane integrity caused by AA plus iron. Uninfected E47 cells and E47 cells infected with AdCat, AdmCat, and AdNull virus were treated with 20 μm AA for 16 h, followed by incubation with 30 μm Fe-NTA for 6 h, and lipid peroxidation was measured by detecting the concentration of MDA. C34 cells without CYP2E1 expression were used as a control. There was no significant difference in MDA production among all these cells in the absence of AA plus Fe-NTA treatment. The MDA concentration in E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat was significantly lower than that in uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull virus when cells were treated with AA plus Fe-NTA (p < 0.01, AdCat compared with E47 or AdNull; p < 0.05, AdmCat compared with E47 or AdNull). Lipid peroxidation in C34 cells was lower than that in E47 cells (p < 0.05) or E47 cells infected with AdNull (p < 0.01) due to the lack of CYP2E1. There was no significant difference in MDA production between E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat (Fig. 6). Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, high levels of catalase could be expressed in E47 cells as determined by Western blot and catalase activity assays. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that catalase with a manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial signal peptide, which was encoded by the recombinant adenovirus AdmCat, localized to the mitochondria. Thus, the manganese-superoxide dismutase leader sequence could be used to successfully import catalase into mitochondria. Catalase in AdCat-infected E47 cells was localized in the cytosol in a more diffused manner. Why the cytosolic catalase distributes in the whole cytosol, but not the peroxisome as the endogenous catalase does, is not clear, but might be due to accumulation of catalase in the cytosol in excess of available peroxisomal content. Alcohol liver disease has been associated with oxidative stress (14Dianzani M.U. Alcohol Alcohol. 1985; 20: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar,15Bondy S.C. Toxicol. Lett. 1992; 63: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although CYP2E1 is not the only primary source of ROS, CYP2E1 is a major producer of ROS, including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. HepG2 cell lines overexpressing CYP2E1 were developed in our laboratory by stably inducing or transfecting human CYP2E1 cDNA into HepG2 cells (30Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Compared with the HepG2 cells line transfected with empty plasmid vector, HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 are more sensitive to arachidonic acid-, l-buthionine sulfoximine (which lowers cellular GSH levels)-, iron-, and ethanol-induced toxicity and apoptosis (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Ascorbic acid, the iron chelator desferrioxamine, and several typical inhibitors of lipid peroxidation produce efficient protection against arachidonic acid toxicity in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells (20Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) probably by quenching or preventing formation of powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radical or other initiators of lipid peroxidation. These studies indicate that ROS are responsible for the CYP2E1-dependent cytotoxicity. The overexpression of catalase in the cytosol or mitochondria protected the E47 cells from cytotoxicity caused by AA and iron. The cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase appear to be equally effective in protecting the cells from cytotoxicity induced by AA plus iron. Because CYP2E1 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, CYP2E1-derived H2O2 would be generated in the endoplasmic reticulum and diffuse into the cytosol. Therefore, cytosolic catalase might be anticipated to readily perform its function to reduce H2O2. Since catalase in mitochondria was equally protective against CYP2E1-dependent AA- plus iron-induced toxicity, it is likely that some of the H2O2 diffuses into the mitochondria, and perhaps damage to the mitochondria may be an important factor contributing to AA- plus iron-induced toxicity. Catalase in mitochondria might act as a sink for H2O2 and promote H2O2 movement down its concentration gradient, thereby decreasing lipid peroxidation in the cells and protecting mitochondria from damage. Mitochondrial permeability transition and mitochondrial membrane potential are markers for mitochondrial damage and dysfunction (34Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Elmore S.P. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Herman B.

Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by ROS, especially H2O2, can lead not only to necrosis by depleting ATP, but also to apoptosis by inducing the release of cytochrome c, which activates caspases together with other mitochondrial factors such as Apaf-1 (37Tada-Oikawa S. Oikawa S. Kawanishi M. Yamada M. Kawanishi S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12766-12769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We determined the mitochondrial membrane potential in cells treated with 20 μm AA and incubated with 30 μm Fe-NTA. The decline in ΔΨ caused by these agents was much less in E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat than in uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull. These results suggest that both cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase protected cells from oxidant-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which may play an important role in the overall protection against oxidant-induced cytotoxicity. The mechanism of AA- plus iron-induced cytotoxicity is thought to be due to lipid peroxidation as a consequence of CYP2E1-derived ROS such as superoxide and especially H2O2. Addition of AA increases the content of polyunsaturated fatty acid. Supplementation of iron enhances the Fenton reaction, by which superoxide radical and H2O2 are transformed into the more toxic hydroxyl radical or other ferryl-type oxidants that catalyze the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid. Although human CYP2E1 has been shown to metabolize arachidonic acid to ω − 1-hydroxyarachidonic acid (40Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 41Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Falck J.R. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a CYP2E1 inhibitor (4-methylpyrazole) could not prevent the toxicity of arachidonic acid at concentrations that prevented toxicity of ethanol, CCl4, and acetaminophen (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Ther. 1995; 273: 1497-1505PubMed Google Scholar), and CYP2E1 substrates such as ethanol did not effectively inhibit the arachidonic acid toxicity (20Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the direct metabolism of arachidonic acid to potentially toxic products by CYP2E1 does not contribute significantly to the polyunsaturated fatty acid toxicity, but rather metabolism of AA by CYP2E1-derived oxidants is likely to be responsible for the ensuing lipid peroxidation and loss of cell viability. This explains the effectiveness of H2O2-degrading enzymes such as catalase in protecting the E47 cells from the AA- plus Fe-NTA-induced toxicity. Indeed, the lipid peroxidation assays showed that, after treatment with AA plus iron, the concentration of MDA in E47 cells infected with AdCat or AdmCat was significantly lower than that in uninfected E47 cells or E47 cells infected with AdNull. The catalase expression in E47 cells lowered MDA levels to those in C34 cells. In summary, this study suggests that mitochondria are an important target for oxidative damage and that both catalase in the cytosol and catalase in mitochondria are capable of protecting HepG2 cells against CYP2E1-dependent cytotoxicity induced by arachidonic acid plus iron. It is hoped that these adenoviral constructs may prove to be effective in preventing oxidative damage caused by alcohol or other xenobiotics under in vivo conditions, and future studies evaluating the in vivo expression of these constructs have been initiated. We thank Dr. J. Andres Melendez for the generous provision of the catalase plasmids."

YopH is translocated into host mammalian cells via a type III protein secretion system. Translocation of YopH into human epithelial cells results in dephosphorylation of p130Cas and paxillin, disruption of focal adhesions, and inhibition of integrin-mediated bacterial phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal 129 amino acids of YopH comprise a bifunctional domain. This domain binds to the SycH chaperone in Yersinia to orchestrate translocation and to tyrosine-phosphorylated target proteins in host cells to mediate substrate recognition. We used random mutagenesis in combination with the yeast two-hybrid system to identify residues in the YopH N-terminal domain that are involved in substrate-binding activity. Four single codon changes (Q11R, V31G, A33D, and N34D) were identified that interfered with binding of the YopH N-terminal domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas but not to SycH. These mutations did not impair YopH translocation into HeLa cells infected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Introduction of the V31G substitution into catalytically inactive (substrate-trapping) forms of YopH interfered with the ability of these proteins to bind to p130Cas and to localize to focal adhesions in HeLa cells. In addition, the V31G substitution reduced the ability of catalytically active YopH to dephosphorylate target proteins in HeLa cells. These data indicate that the substrate- and SycH-binding activities of the YopH N-terminal domain can be separated and that the former activity is important for recognition and dephosphorylation of substrates by YopHin vivo.

Microbiol. 1998; 5: 1263-1274Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been identified as substrates of YopH in cultured human epithelial cells. A region within the PTP domain (residues 223–226) has been shown to be important for targeting of YopH to focal adhesion complexes (19Persson C. Nordfelth R. Andersson K. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 828-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 129 residues of YopH comprise a second modular domain that is bifunctional. This domain binds to the SycH chaperone inYersinia to orchestrate type III-mediated translocation of YopH into host cells (20Wattiau P. Woestyn S. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A binding site for SycH has been localized between residues 20 and 69 (20). The N-terminal domain also binds to Cas and paxillin in vitro in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (11Black D.S. Montagna L.M. Zitzmann S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 5: 1263-1274Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The efficiency of substrate dephosphorylation by YopH in vitro is diminished by removal of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that it is important for substrate recognition (11Black D.S. Montagna L.M. Zitzmann S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 5: 1263-1274Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a first step toward elucidating the mechanism of substrate recognition mediated by the YopH N-terminal domain, we have identified several residues that are critical for this activity. The plasmid pLP15 (21Palmer L.E. Pancetti A.R. Greenberg S. Bliska J.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 708-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contains a DNA fragment coding for YopH fused to a C-terminal M45 epitope tag inserted between the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pGEX-2T. Here, pLP15 is designated pGEX2T-YopHM45. A Nde I site overlaps the initiation codon of the YopH reading frame, and anXba I site is present at the point of fusion between the YopH and M45 sequences in pGEX2T-YopHM45. The plasmid pGEX-YopH1–129M45 was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment encoding the first 129 residues of YopH flanked by 5′ and 3′ restriction sites was synthesized by PCR. The PCR was performed using pYopH (22Bliska J.B. Black D.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 681-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template and PTP18 (11Black D.S. Montagna L.M. Zitzmann S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 5: 1263-1274Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and PTP23 (5′-GATCCCGGGACCCCCTCGCTCCCGACTCTTG-3′) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The primers were designed to incorporateBam HI and Nde I restriction sites into the 5′ end of the product and an Xba I site into the 3′ end. The PCR product was digested with Bam HI and Xba I. The pGEX2T-YopHM45 vector was digested with Bam HI andXba I, and the region coding for full-length YopH was removed and replaced with the PCR product encoding YopH1–129. This resulted in a translational fusion between the codons specifying residues 1–129 of YopH and the 12-amino acid C-terminal M45 epitope tag. The structure of pGEX-YopH1–129M45 was verified by sequencing. The plasmids pBDMI and pADMI were derived from the yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424 (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), respectively, by the insertion of new polylinker regions. The polylinker regions of pGBT9 or pGAD424 were removed by digestion with Eco RI and Sal I. Two complementary oligonucleotides, MIsiteF (5′-AATTGGGATCCCCGGGAATTCGCGGCCGCG-3′) and MIsiteR (5′-CCCTAGGGGCCCTTAAGCGCCGGCGCAGCT-3′), were annealed and inserted between the Eco RI and Sal I sites in pGBT9 and pGAD424. The polylinker regions of pBDMI and pADMI were confirmed by sequencing. A segment of DNA coding for YopH1–129M45 was removed from pGEX-YopH1–129M45 by digestion with Bam HI andEco RI. This DNA was inserted between the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pBDMI, yielding pBD-YopH1–129M45. The plasmid pAD-Src was constructed from pADMI by the insertion of a DNA fragment that encodes a mutant form of c-Src (Y416F/Y527F) (23Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding c-Src was removed from pBTM116 (23Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with Bam HI and inserted into the unique Bgl II site in pADMI. A DNA fragment encoding Cas was removed from pEBG-p130Cas (24Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) by digestion with Bam HI andNot I and inserted between the Bam HI andNot I sites of pADMI or pAD-Src, yielding pAD-Cas and pAD-Cas+Src, respectively. Codon substitutions isolated in the two-hybrid assay (see below) were introduced into the full-length YopHM45 reading frame by restriction fragment subcloning. DNA fragments containing the various codon substitutions were removed from pBD-YopH1–129M45 by digestion withNde I and Sna BI and substituted for the corresponding Nde I-Sna BI fragment of pGEX2T-YopHM45. A standard restriction fragment subcloning procedure was used to combine the V31G mutation with either the C403S or the R409A substitutions. DNA fragments coding for full-length YopH proteins with the various codon substitutions were removed from the pGEX-2T backbone by digestion with Nde I and Eco RI and inserted between the Nde I and Eco RI sites in the plasmid pPROH for expression in Y. pseudotuberculosis. The plasmid pPROH was generated by the insertion of the yopH promoter region into the polylinker region of pMMB67HE (25Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene. 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). TheyopH promoter region was amplified by PCR using virulence plasmid pIB1 as template and the primers PTP26 (5′-CGGATCCGCTGCGCGATGTACTGACCCG-3′) and PTP27 (5′-TTACATTAGGAATTCATATGTCCCTCCTTAATTAAATACACGCC-3′). The primers were designed to incorporate a Bam HI site into the 5′ end of the product and Nde I and Eco RI sites into the 3′ end. The PCR product was digested with Bam HI andEco RI, inserted between the Bam HI andEco RI sites of pMMB67HE, and verified by sequencing. The DNA sequence coding for the first 129 residues of YopH was subjected to random mutagenesis using a PCR under suboptimal conditions (26Spee J.H. de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 21: 777-778Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The PCR was performed using pBD-YopH1–129M45 as template and the oligonucleotides 5′PBD2H (5′-CCGTCACAGATAGATTGGCTTCAGTGG-3′) and 3′PBD2H (5′-CCTGAGAAAGCAACCTGACCTACAGGA-3′) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The resultant PCR product contained the YopH1–129M45 coding region flanked on either side by ∼100 base pairs of sequence derived from pBDMI. The PCR product was introduced into pBDMI via homologous recombination in yeast cells. For this purpose, pBDMI was digested with Bam HI, and the linear plasmid was mixed with the PCR product and supercoiled pAD-Cas+Src. The mixture was used to transform the yeast two-hybrid reporter strain Y153 to Trp and Leu prototrophy on synthetic dextrose media lacking Trp and Leu (SD-Trp-Leu) (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Mutations that interfered with binding of the YopH N-terminal domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas were identified by screening ∼1500 Trp+ Leu+ colonies of Y153 on filters for reduced expression of β-galactosidase activity (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Colonies that displayed reduced β-galactosidase activity were tested for the production of BD-YopH1–129M45 fusion protein by immunoblotting. Yeast cell lysates were prepared from 25 ml of culture grown to anA 600 value of ∼0.68 (equivalent to 2.5 × 108 cells) in SD-Trp-Leu media. After centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold ddH2O, 250 μl of glass beads, and 200 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were vortexed at high speed for 1 min and then chilled on ice for 30 s. This procedure was repeated twice. Samples were boiled for 3 min and briefly centrifuged prior to loading. Samples of 10 μl were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-M45 (see below). The two-hybrid assay was repeated with reconstructed binding domain vectors to verify that reduced expression of β-galactosidase was specific to mutations in the YopH1–129M45 coding region. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 53 Y153 colonies that produced full-length BD-YopH1–129M45 protein. The plasmid DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli strain MH4 to Leu prototrophy to select for the LEU2 gene carried by the pBD-YopH1–129M45 plasmid (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from Leu+ colonies of MH4 and digested with Bam HI and Eco RI to remove the YopH1–129M45 coding regions. The regions coding for mutant YopH1–129M45 proteins were inserted between the Bam HI andEco RI sites of pBDMI, and the resulting plasmids were introduced into Y153 along with the pAD-Cas+Src plasmid. Colonies of Leu+ Trp+ transformants on filters were tested for expression of β-galactosidase as described above. This procedure was repeated using pAD-SycH in place of pAD-Cas+Src to identify mutations that selectively interfered with binding of the YopH N-terminal domain to Cas. The regions coding for YopH1–129M45 in purified pBD-YopH1–129M45 plasmids were sequenced to identify mutations that resulted in reduced binding to Cas. The G41S and D106G codon substitutions were separated by a standard restriction fragment subcloning procedure. β-galactosidase activity in Y153 strains containing mutant pBD-YopH1–129M45 plasmids was quantitated using a colorimetric liquid assay as described previously (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cultures of Y153 strains containing mutant pBDMI-YopH1–129M45 plasmids and pAD-Cas+Src were grown in selective media (SD-Trp-Leu) to an A 600 value of ∼1.0. Yeast cells in 5 ml of culture were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 35 min. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity in yeast cells containing mutant pBDMI-YopH1–129M45 plasmids and pAD-SycH was performed using cells derived from 0.1 ml of culture and the substrate O- nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 15 min. Units of β-galactosidase activity were calculated as described (27Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatant containing monoclonal anti-M45 antibody was provided by Dr. P. Hearing (State University of New York at Stony Brook). Anti-M45 recognizes the 12-amino acid epitope SRDRLPPFETET. Anti-M45 was purified from the supernatant using protein A-Sepharose as described (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310Google Scholar). Anti-M45 was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblotting and at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for immunofluorescence labeling. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1.0 μg of M45 per sample. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-pTyr antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblotting and at final concentration of 5 μg/ml for immunofluorescence labeling. Monoclonal anti-Cas (P27820) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories and used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1.0 μg of anti-Cas per sample. The rabbit anti-YopH antibody SB360 was prepared in a commercial facility (Calico Biologicals, Inc.) using a purified glutathione S-transferase-YopH fusion protein as antigen. SB360 was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for immunoblotting. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma and used at dilutions of 1:1000 or 1:15,000, respectively. Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. and used at a dilution of 1:250. The Y. pseudotuberculosis serogroup III strains YP17 (yopHyopE) and YP19 (yopHyopEyopB) and their growth conditions have been described previously (21Palmer L.E. Pancetti A.R. Greenberg S. Bliska J.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 708-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both strains carry a naturally occurring deletion in the plasmid-borne yopT gene and are devoid of YopT activity. 2J. Zitzler and J. Bliska, unpublished results. Expression plasmids derived from pPROH that produce wild-type or mutant YopH proteins were introduced into these strains from E. coli by conjugation (10Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For infection assays, bacteria were grown overnight at 26 °C with shaking in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were subcultured into Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2.5 mm CaCl2 to anA 600 value of 0.1. Cultures were shaken at 37 °C for 2 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in warm (37 °C) Hanks' balanced salt solution to anA 600 value of 1.0 (∼1 × 109colony-forming units/ml). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 mm sodium pyruvate in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. For the immunofluorescence experiments, 1 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded in 1 ml of media onto sterile glass coverslips placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate and cultured overnight. For the translocation, immunoprecipitation, and in vivo dephosphorylation assays, 2 × 106 HeLa cells in 10 ml of media were seeded into 100-mm tissue culture dishes and cultured overnight. HeLa cells were overlaid with fresh media 30 min prior to bacterial infection. Cells were left uninfected or infected with bacteria grown as described above at a multiplicity of infection of 50:1 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. All steps following a 2-h infection (see above) were performed at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (anti-pTyr or anti-M45) diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA. Coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA. Coverslips were washed well with PBS before mounting on slides in 10% Airvol (Air Products, Inc.), 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 25% glycerol, and 2.5% DABCO anti-fade (Sigma). The stained cell samples were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss AxioPlan 2 microscope equipped with a 100× Plan-NeoFluar (numerical aperture 1.4) oil immersion objective. Epifluorescent images were captured with a Spot CCD camera and Adobe Photoshop, version 5.5 software running on a Macintosh G4 computer. After a 2-h infection, the dishes were placed on ice and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) for 15 min on ice with occasional rocking. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples of 20 μl containing 5 μg of total cell protein each were separated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-M45. After 2 h of infection the dishes were placed on ice and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 200 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1 μmpepstatin) for 15 min on ice with occasional rocking. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates were adjusted to contain 450 μg of protein in a volume of 1 ml. 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each lysate sample, and the tubes were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation as a pre-clearing step. After the protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes and mixed with anti-M45. The tubes were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were recovered by addition of 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose, followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of 4 °C lysis buffer, resuspended in 60 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Cas, anti-pTyr, or anti-YopH antibodies as described below. HeLa cells were left uninfected or infected for 15, 30, 60, or 120 min. Dishes were placed on ice and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 15 min on ice with occasional rocking. Cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Supernatant samples containing 50 μg of protein in a volume of 20 μl were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The resulting samples were separated on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-pTyr or anti-YopH as described below. Proteins separated in SDS polyacrylamide gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll). Unless indicated all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The nitrocellulose filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 1% BSA for 1 h. Filters were incubated with primary antibody (see above) diluted in TBST for 1 h. Filters were washed four times in TBST and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted (1:1000 for anti-mouse and 1:15,000 for anti-rabbit) in TBST. The filters were washed four times in TBST and developed using the Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) chemiluminescence system. In some cases, the blots were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50–55 °C for 30 min. After the filter was extensively washed in TBST, the immunoblotting procedure was then repeated starting with the blocking step. A modified yeast two-hybrid system (23Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect association of the YopH N-terminal domain with tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas. A yeast strain carrying a lacZ reporter gene under control of the Gal4p transcription factor was transformed with two expression vectors. One vector produced the DNA binding domain of Gal4p fused to residues 1 to 129 of YopH adjoined to a C-terminal M45 epitope tag (BD-YopH1–129M45). The second vector produced a modified form of the Src tyrosine kinase and the activation domain of Gal4p fused to Cas (AD-Cas). Based on previous studies (23Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar), ectopic expression of Src was expected to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of the AD-Cas fusion protein in yeast cells. β-galactosidase activity was detected when both fusion proteins and Src were produced in the yeast reporter strain (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, β-galactosidase activity was not detected when both fusion proteins were expressed in yeast cells in the absence of Src (data not shown). Thus, a specific two-hybrid interaction between the N-terminal domain of YopH and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas was detected. Random mutagenesis was used to identify amino acid substitutions in the YopH N-terminal domain that interfere with binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas in the two-hybrid system. The DNA sequence encoding the first 129 residues of YopH was amplified using a PCR and Taq DNA polymerase under suboptimal conditions (26Spee J.H. de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 21: 777-778Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The resulting DN"

BDV is noncytopathic, and the mechanisms underlying neuronal pathology are not well understood. One hypothesis is that infection affects the response of neurons to factors that are crucial for their proliferation, differentiation, or survival. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the response of PC12 cells persistently infected with BDV to the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). PC12 is a neural crest-derived cell line that exhibits features of neuronal differentiation in response to NGF. We report that persistence of BDV led to a progressive change of phenotype of PC12 cells and blocked neurite outgrowth in response to NGF. Infection down-regulated the expression of synaptophysin and growth-associated protein-43, two molecules involved in neuronal plasticity, as well as the expression of the chromaffin-specific gene tyrosine hydroxylase. We showed that the block in response to NGF was due in part to the down-regulation of NGF receptors. Moreover, although BDV caused constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, activated ERKs were not translocated to the nucleus efficiently. These observations may account for the absence of neuronal differentiation of persistently infected PC12 cells treated with NGF.

Neonatal infection also results in a lifelong persistent infection associated with a variety of behavioral abnormalities but without generalized meningitis or encephalitis (10Narayan O. Herzog S.

Therefore, this second model allows studying the consequences of persistent BDV infection on neuronal functions in the absence of inflammation. Many lines of evidence suggest that BDV persistence per secan cause damage to specific neuronal populations. For example, infection of adults with BDV disrupts cortical cholinergic innervation prior to encephalitis (16Gies U. Bilzer T. Stitz L. Staiger J.F. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas neonatal infection causes alterations in postnatal development of the cerebellum and hippocampus as well as synaptic pathology (13Bautista J.R.

In particular, neonatal infection causes Purkinje cell death, dentate gyrus granule neuron degeneration, and a progressive loss of cortical neurons (14Bautista J.R. Rubin S.A. Moran T.H. Schwartz G.J. Carbone K.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 90: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,17Eisenman L.M. Brothers R. Tran M.H. Kean R.B. Dickson G.M. Dietzschold B. Hooper D.C. J.

A. 1999; 96: 12102-12107Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). BDV is a noncytopathic virus, and the mechanism whereby it causes neuronal pathology is still not understood. Neonatal infection leads to variations in the level of proinflammatory cytokines and to changes in monoamine tissue content as well as in the expression of molecules regulating central nervous system plasticity (18Gonzalez-Dunia D. Watanabe M. Syan S. Mallory M. Masliah E. de la Torre J.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3441-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Hornig M. Weissenbock H. Horscroft N. Lipkin W.I. Proc. Natl.

Although these changes might be responsible for part of the pathology, they, however, appear quite late after infection (i.e. at least 3 weeks post-inoculation). A recent study showing that cerebellar damage is observed only if infection occurs before postnatal day 15 suggests that BDV also interferes with early events of postnatal brain development (23Rubin S.A. Bautista J.R. Moran T.H. Schwartz G.J. Carbone K.M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 112: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that infection may affect the response to neurotrophic factors that play key roles in early differentiation and survival of neurons. In particular, we decided to investigate whether BDV infection interferes with the response to nerve growth factor (NGF), the prototypic member of the neurotrophin family (24Levi-Montalcini R. Skaper S.D. Dal Toso R. Petrelli L. Leon A. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). As a first step to test this hypothesis, we studied the response to NGF of PC12 cells infected by BDV. The PC12 cell line is a neural crest-derived adrenal chromaffin cell line obtained from a rat pheochromocytoma. PC12 cells exhibit several features of neuronal differentiation following treatment with NGF. They extend neurites, become post-mitotic, and resemble sympathetic neurons (25Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). Binding of NGF to its receptor, a tyrosine kinase, triggers a cascade of protein phosphorylation events, leading to the activation of several genes. This signal transduction cascade and the genes involved have been studied extensively (26Sassone-Corsi P. Der C.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3174-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Here, we show that persistent infection of PC12 cells with BDV leads to dramatic changes in cell morphology and expression of genes implicated in synaptic plasticity. Moreover, infection causes a complete block in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and several changes in the NGF signal transduction cascade. PC12 cells (CRL-1721; American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax II (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum and 1× Bufferall (Sigma). Cells were passaged once or twice a week using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma). Cells were replated at a 1:4 to 1:6 ratio in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks or transferred to culture dishes or glass coverslips coated with collagen (Sigma). PC12 cells were infected with BDV CRP4 as described (13Bautista J.R. Schwartz G.J. de la Torre J.C. Moran T.H. Carbone K.M. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 34: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and subcultured 3 days after the initial infection to establish a persistently infected line (PC12-BV). PC12-BV cells were subcultured (1:5) every 4–6 days under the same conditions as the noninfected control cells. Infected and noninfected PC12 cells were plated on collagen-coated supports, grown in complete medium for 16 h, and starved in medium containing 1% serum for 16 h. They were then treated with 100 ng/ml NGF (Life Technologies, Inc.), for the indicated times before analysis. Total RNA was isolated using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), size-fractionated by 2.2 mformaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred by capillarity with 20× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015m sodium citrate) to MagnaGraph nylon membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA), and UV cross-linked. The blots were hybridized for 2.5 h at 65 °C in Quikhyb buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing 100 μg/ml and 5 ng/ml of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA and DNA probe, respectively. DNA probes were labeled with [α32P]dCTP using random hexamers (Prime-it II; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After high stringency washes (0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C, twice), the blots were exposed to Biomax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.). After each hybridization, the blots were stripped by boiling twice in stripping buffer (2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS) before being rehybridized. The following probes were used: cDNA fragments from the BDV nucleoprotein (NP), rat synaptophysin, GAP-43, and tyrosine hydroxylase (28Grima B. Lamouroux A. Blanot F. Faucon Biguet N. Mallet J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) genes, as well as cDNA fragments from rat p75 and TrkA receptors (gifts from C. Tuffereau and M. Barbacid, respectively). The signals were compared with those obtained with a cDNA probe corresponding to the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Cells were rapidly lysed in a buffer (29Sgambato V. Pages C. Rogard M. Besson M.J. Caboche J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8814-8825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μm ZnCl2, 100 μmNa3VO4, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), and protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Cells lysates (30, 20, or 10 μg/lane depending on the antibody used) were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex, La Jolla, CA) before transfer onto Hybond C-extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), supplemented with 5% of either bovine serum albumin or nonfat dry milk. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After washing with TBST, the blots were incubated for 1 h with either biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (diluted 1:1000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a Streptavidin-peroxydase complex (diluted 1:1000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washes in TBST and TBS, peroxydase activity was revealed by incubating with Pierce Super signal substrate (Interchim) and exposing to Biomax MS films (Kodak). When detecting the phosphorylated and the total form of a protein, the blots were first probed with the antibody specific for the phosphorylated form. After revelation, the blot was stripped by incubating in 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5 (20 min, twice), blocked as described above, and reprobed with the antibody recognizing all forms of the protein. Photographic films were scanned on a flatbed Agfa scanner and processed using Adobe Photoshop and Canvas softwares. We used the following antibodies: a monoclonal antibody recognizing specifically the phosphorylated (activated) form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1 and ERK2 (anti-phospho-Thr183-Tyr185 ERK, Sigma; diluted 1:10000); a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing total ERK1 and ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Berverly, MA; diluted 1:500); rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing phosphorylated CREB (anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB) and total CREB protein (New England Biolabs; both diluted 1:750); rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated forms of MEK (anti-phospo-Ser217/221 MEK1/2) and p90RSK(anti-phospho-Ser381 p90RSK) proteins (New England Biolabs; both diluted 1:500); a monoclonal antibody recognizing the phosphorylated form of Elk-1 (anti-phospho-Ser383Elk-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:1000); and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the BDV NP (diluted 1:25000) described previously (6de la Torre J.C. Gonzalez-Dunia D. Cubitt B. Mallory M. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Grässer F.A. Hansen L.A. Masliah E. Virology. 1996; 223: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by methanol-acetone (50/50) and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (30Gonzalez-Dunia D. Cubitt B. Grässer F.A. de la Torre J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3208-3218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after blocking with 2% normal goat serum and 2% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature, cells were stained with primary antibodies. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were stained with secondary antibodies,i.e. fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Interchim; diluted 1:500) and Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Interchim; diluted 1:500). Cells were extensively washed as described for primary antibodies, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and sealed with nail polish. The primary antibodies were monoclonal antibodies to synaptophysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; diluted 1:5), microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 (Sigma; diluted 1:200), βIII-tubulin (Sigma; diluted 1:200) and NGF receptor molecule p75 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; diluted 1:10). We also used a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the Tau protein (Sigma; diluted 1:200), as well as the antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of ERK-1/ERK2 (diluted 1:200) and to BDV NP (diluted 1:300) described above. When performing double staining, primary and secondary antibodies were used simultaneously. After staining, cells were examined with a TCS4D Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. Digitalized images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Canvas softwares. PC12 cells were infected with BDV as described above and analyzed at each passage after infection (Fig.1). Early after infection, infected cells were morphologically undistinguishable from control noninfected PC12 cells. After three passages, over 96% of the cells were infected, as determined by detection of the viral nucleoprotein using immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (not shown). After four to five passages, cells in infected cultures changed morphology. PC12-BV cells became flat and nonrefractile, and their adhesion to the support increased (Figs. 1 and2). After eight to 12 passages (depending on the experiment), the changes concerned the whole cell population.Figure 2NGF does not induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells persistently infected with BDV (PC12-BV). PC12 or PC12-BV cells (passage 10 after infection) were grown on collagen-coated plates for 3 days in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml NGF. The cells were fixed and briefly stained with Giemsa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined the response of infected PC12 cells to NGF. NGF blocks the proliferation of noninfected PC12 cells and induces neurite outgrowth. As shown in Fig. 2, PC12-BV cells treated with NGF failed to develop neurites and continued to proliferate. By contrast, control PC12 cells passaged in parallel remained unchanged and responded normally to NGF (Fig. 2). Five independent experiments gave similar results. The infection did not impair cell viability, as determined by trypan blue staining (not shown). Infected cells did not lose BDV upon passaging, and viral infection did not impair cell growth. The doubling time of PC12-BV cells under normal serum conditions was slightly shorter than that of control cells (44 ± 2 h.versus 65 ± 3 h., n = 9,p < 0.0005 by Mann-Whitney test). We next asked whether NGF-treated PC12-BV cells still expressed neuronal markers. Cells were grown on coverslips, treated with NGF, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence. Compared with control PC12 cells, PC12-BV cells expressed comparable levels of MAP-2, Tau protein, and neuron-specific βIII-tubulin. The expression of MAP-2 appeared even higher in PC12-BV cells than in the control cells (Fig.3). In contrast, the expression of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle marker, was lost in PC12-BV cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, synaptophysin expression was lost progressively as PC12-BV cells were passaged. Loss of synaptophysin expression correlated with the morphological alterations linked to BDV persistence (Fig. 4). At later passages, very few cells still expressed synaptophysin and responded to NGF. These cells were, in fact, not infected (Fig. 4, bottom panels). All experiments described in the rest of this study were performed on persistently infected cells that had undergone all of the above-described phenotypic changes.Figure 4BDV infection causes a progressive down-regulation of synaptophysin expression. Control PC12 cells and cells infected with BDV and passaged 1, 6, and 9 times (P1, P6, and P9) are shown. PC12 and PC12-BV P9 cells were treated with NGF for 4 days. PC12-BV P1 and P6 were left untreated. All cells were doubly stained for synaptophysin (red) and BDV NP (green). The higher density of PC12-BV (P9) cells is due to the fact that these cells do not become post-mitotic in response to NGF. Infected cells stained with the BDV NP antibody exhibit a characteristic punctuate staining of the nucleus (better seen on Z series scans; not shown), together with a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Note the progressive decrease of synaptophysin in infected cells. At passage 9, synaptophysin is not detected in PC12-BV cells, except for a single cell that is not infected (see merged images).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the level of mRNA coding for synaptophysin in PC12 and PC12-BV cells, together with the level of mRNA encoding another plasticity-related protein, the GAP-43 (31Gispen W.H. Nielander H.B. De Graan P.N. Oestreicher A.B. Schrama L.H. Schotman P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We also examined the expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, a delayed-early gene induced by NGF in PC12 cells (32Leonard D.G. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). TH is an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway leading to dopamine synthesis. It is expressed in catecholaminergic neurons as well as in neural crest-derived chromaffin cells. Finally, Northern blots were also probed for the housekeeping gene GAPDH and for viral RNA. As shown in Fig. 5, PC12 cells expressed relatively high constitutive levels of synaptophysin, and exposure to NGF was accompanied by the characteristic increase (33de la Torre J.C. Mallory M. Brot M. Gold L. Koob G. Oldstone M.B. Masliah E. Virology. 1996; 220: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in GAP-43 RNA levels. Likewise, TH mRNA was readily detected in untreated PC12 cells, and expression increased following NGF treatment. In contrast, mRNAs for synaptophysin, TH and GAP-43 were not, or barely, observed by Northern blotting in PC12-BV cells and were not up-regulated in response to NGF (Fig. 5), whereas mRNA levels for GAPDH remained unaffected. As expected, we only detected BDV-specific RNAs in PC12-BV cells. Hence, BDV persistence in PC12 cells specifically alters the expression of genes coding for molecules involved in synaptic plasticity as well as in catecholamine biosynthesis. We next investigated whether the absence of response of PC12-BV cells to NGF could be due to a down-regulation of the expression of the NGF receptors. Two structurally unrelated NGF receptors are known (34Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that also binds the other neurotrophins BDNF, NT3 and NT4/5. NGF also binds and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA, and it has been suggested that both p75 and TrkA may be required for the formation of the high affinity NGF-binding site and for the full NGF-mediated effect (34Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 35Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression of mRNAs encoding p75 and TrkA using Northern blot (Fig.6 A). In PC12 cells, we observed a significant increase in the level of mRNAs encoding p75 and TrkA molecules following NGF treatment. In contrast, in PC12-BV cells, mRNAs levels were greatly decreased for p75 and were below the threshold of detection for TrkA. We next studied the expression of p75 by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 6 B). The p75 molecule was strongly expressed after NGF treatment in PC12 cells, whereas expression was uneven in BDV-infected PC12 cells. In the latter, some cells had levels of p75 comparable with those of the noninfected cells, whereas others had levels that were barely detectable. Levels of p75 did not appear to correlate with viral nucleoprotein load. TrkA expression was below the threshold of detection by immunofluorescence, even in the control PC12 cells. The block in neuronal differentiation observed in PC12-BV can be explained in part by the down-regulation NGF receptor expression. However, results from Northern blot and immunofluorescence showed that some PC12-BV cells still expressed low levels of receptor (at least for p75) and nevertheless did not differentiate in response to NGF. Moreover, analysis of mRNA expression with a sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay showed that infected cells still expressed low levels of TrkA mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to examine the effects of BDV infection on the NGF signal transduction cascade (27Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). Binding of NGF to the TrkA receptor triggers sequential phosphorylations that propagate the signal to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of the MAP/ERK kinases (MEK) isoforms (the 45-kDa MEK1 and the 46-kDa MEK2) stimulates the mitogen activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (p42 and p44 MAPK). Following their activation, the ERKs phosphorylate a large number of regulatory proteins including the transcription factor Elk-1 that will subsequently bind to serum response elements located in several promoters (36Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In addition, the ERKs will phosphorylate the p90RSK kinase (37Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar), that will in turn phosphorylate targets such as CREB and activate the transcription of immediate early genes such as c-fos by binding to cAMP response element-binding sites (38Bohm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The existence of commercially available antibodies specific for activated MAPK proteins (antibodies that will only recognize double-phosphorylated substrates) allowed us to study in detail the effects of BDV infection on the NGF signal transduction cascade. Because most events occur within minutes after addition of NGF, PC12 and PC12-BV cells were rapidly lysed at different times after adding NGF, and equal amounts of proteins (as determined by Bradford assays) were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of the above-mentioned activated kinases. In some cases, the blots were stripped after detection of the activated form of the kinase and reprobed with an antibody that detects all forms of the kinase (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated). This experiment was repeated at least five times, and the results were consistently similar to those shown in Fig.7 B. We observed no basal expression of activated MEK or ERK in control PC12 cells prior to adding NGF and only minimal CREB phosphorylation at this point. After adding NGF, both MEK and ERK were rapidly and strongly induced. This was followed by activation of Elk1 and of the p90RSK/CREB cascade and ultimately by transcription of c-fos, the latter being analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 7 B). Several marked differences were observed in PC12 cells persistently infected with BDV (Fig.7 B). First, we observed that MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were constitutively activated, even in the absence of NGF. This was consistently observed, even if cells were serum-starved for long periods of time (not shown). It should be emphasized that activated forms of MEK and ERK were never"

The positions for the cysteines were: 1) in part of the primary RNA-binding site in the N terminus (Cys-82 Rho); 2) in a connecting polypeptide proposed to be on the outside of the hexamer (Cys-153 Rho); and 3) near the proposed secondary RNA-binding site in the ATP-binding domain (Cys-325 Rho). Results from the cross-linking of the modified Rho proteins to a series of λ cro RNA derivatives showed that Cys-82 Rho formed cross-links with all transcripts containing the Rho utilization (rut) site, that Cys-325 Rho formed cross-links to transcripts that had therut site and 10 or more residues 3′ of the rut site, and that Cys-153 did not form cross-links with any of the transcripts. From a model of the quaternary structure of Rho, which is largely based on homology to the F1-ATPase, amino acid 82 is located near the top of the hexamer, and amino acid 325 is located on a solvent-accessible loop in the center of the hexamer.

Nature. 1969; 224: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 4Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DC1996: 822-848Google Scholar). Rho can also act as a helicase to dissociate a DNA molecule that is base paired to a 3′-segment of an RNA with a Rho attachment site (5Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7993-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The motive power for these actions comes from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. The mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis to these dissociation reactions is not known. The Rho polypeptide contains two major domains: an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (residues 1–130) and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain (residues 131–419) (7Bear D.G. Andrews C.L. Singer J.D. Morgan W.D. Grant R.A. von Hippel P.H. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1911-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Dolan J.W. Marshall N.F. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5747-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-binding domain contains an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding domain (OB-fold) (9Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rho forms strong binding interactions with single-stranded C-rich RNA molecules, and RNA segments with these characteristics form the attachment sites (known as the rut or Rho utilization sites) used by Rho to mediate termination of a transcript. The structure of a complex of the RNA-binding domain of Rho with oligo(rC)9, determined by x-ray crystallography, shows that a cytidylate residue forms H bonds with Arg-66 and Glu-78 and a π-bond stacking interaction with Phe-64 (10Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Evidence for a second RNA-binding site distinct from that in the RNA-binding domain has come from a detailed analysis of the polynucleotide requirements for activation of ATP hydrolysis by Rho (11Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from the finding that mutant forms of Rho with changes in certain residues in the ATP-binding domain are defective in their interactions with RNA that are coupled to ATP hydrolysis (12Richardson J.P. Carey III, J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5767-5771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Pereira S. Platt T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Large parts of the Rho polypeptide are similar to the corresponding parts of the α and β subunits of the F1-ATPase (15Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the hexameric Rho protein is morphologically similar to the α3β3 sub-component of that ATPase (1Oda T. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). These similarities have led to proposed models of a tertiary structure for the ATP-binding domain of the Rho polypeptide and a quaternary structure of the hexamer, both based on the structure of the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (13Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1299-1307Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A striking feature of these models is that mutational changes in Rho that affect secondary RNA-binding site interactions are found primarily in residues that face into the center of the hexameric hole (13Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the proposal of a model for the interactions of Rho with RNA that cause transcript termination (19Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this model, the nascent transcript first binds to an extensive site composed of the RNA-binding domains on the six subunits arranged around one pole of the hexamer. This binding occurs in a way that allows the RNA that is on the 3′-side of the attachment segment to pass through the hole of the hexameric ring, perhaps by assembly of the hexamer on the RNA (20Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Once bound, concerted cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release can cause structural motions in the hole of the hexamer that could act to pull the transcript through and away from its biosynthetic complex with RNA polymerase. Previously, Rho was identified as being related to a subclass of DNA helicases (superfamilies IV and V) (21West S.C. Cell. 1998; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Bird L.E. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All the proteins in this group contain seven common sequence motifs, possess a hexameric quaternary structure, and couple NTP hydrolysis to 5′- to 3′-translocation along a nucleic acid. Biochemical evidence obtained with two members of this subclass, DnaB (23Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowska D. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10515-10529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the T7 gene 4 product (24Egelman H.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicate that they migrate along single-stranded DNA by pulling the DNA through the center of their respective hexameric ring structures. Because Rho is structurally related to these proteins, it could readily have a similar mechanism for nucleic acid translocation. To probe the points of interaction of Rho with RNA, several mutational derivatives of Rho-containing single cysteine residues were prepared. The positions of the cysteines were chosen based on the known structure of the RNA-binding domain and the proposed structural model of the hexameric ATP-binding domains of Rho (17Wood T.C. Theory and Application of Protein HomologyPh.D. Dissertation. University of Virginia, 1999Google Scholar). The mutants were then modified with the cysteine-specific, photo-activable cross-linkerN-[4-(p-azidosalicylamidobutyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (APDP),1 and the interactions of these modified proteins with various forms of λ cro RNA was analyzed by measuring yields of cross-linked complexes. All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 RNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England BioLabs Inc. APDP and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) were purchased from Pierce Chemicals. The oligonucleotides were purchased from either Life Technologies, Inc. or Integrated DNA Technologies. All deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and Proteinase K were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Bio-Rex 70 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. T7 RNA polymerase was provided by Lislott Richardson (Indiana University). MGP1-2 helper phage was a gift from Stanley Tabor (Havard University Medical School). The p39-AS plasmid containing the C202S mutation was a gift from Terry Platt (University of Rochester). pA4 and pB3 were gifts from Bill Scott (University of California, Santa Cruz). pCB111, a plasmid containing the E. coli rho gene under control of the T7 promoter (25Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. Gene. 1992; 118: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and a p39-AS derivative, containing the E155K and C202S mutations in the rho gene (26Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were partially digested with Pst I. The resulting 5926-base pair fragment from pCB111 and the 567-base pair fragment from the p39-AS derivative were ligated overnight at 17 °C with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmid, pBB-1, contains rho with a C202S mutation. This and all subsequent mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. To create a plasmid that can be used to express C202S,S325C Rho (Cys-325 Rho), pBB-1 was transformed into competent CJ236 (dut −, ung −) cells, and these cells were infected with helper phage M13KO7. The uracil-containing single-stranded DNA template was recovered by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspension in water. The mutagenic primer (3′-CGATACCGGTTGTAAAATGGACG-5′) was annealed to the purified uracil-containing single-stranded DNA, followed by addition of 1 unit of T4 DNA polymerase, 3 units of T4 DNA ligase, 0.4 mm each of dGTP, dCTP, dATP, and dTTP, and 0.75 mm ATP, which completed synthesis of the second strand. The newly synthesized DNA was transformed into the dut+ , ung + strain DH5αF′, and the cells were plated on LB-ampicillin (50 mg/ml) plates and grown overnight at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated from several of the plate colonies via standard plasmid mini-prep procedure. A 341-base pair Bst XI to Kpn I restriction fragment from a plasmid with the desired mutation was ligated to the 6152-base pair Bst XI to Kpn I restriction fragment from the parental pBB-1 plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pBB-2, contained therho gene with both the C202S and S325C mutations. Plasmids that could express C202S,S82C Rho (Cys-82 Rho) and C202S,S153C Rho (Cys-153 Rho), respectively, were created using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Two complementary DNA oligonucleotides containing the required nucleotide changes were used to introduce the respective mutations into the pBB-1 rho gene which contains the C202S mutation as follows: primer 1, 5′-GATGACATCTACGTTTGCCCTAGCCAAATCCG-3′, and primer 2, 5′-CGGATTTGGCTAGGGCAAACGTAGATGTCATC-3′ for the S82C mutation; primer 3, 5′-CGTGGTAACGGTTGTACTGAAGATTTAACTGCTCGC-3′, and primer 4, 5′-GCGAGCAGTTAAATCTTCAGTACAACCGTTACCACG-3′ for the S153C mutation. The plasmids containing Cys-82 Rho and Cys-153 Rho were named pBB-4 and pBB-6, respectively. DH5αF′ cells containing one of the mutant plasmidrho genes were infected with the M13 phage derivative mGP1-2 (27Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). mGP1-2 contains a gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase under control of the E. coli lac promotor. Production of high levels of mutant Rho protein was achieved by induction of a 500-ml LB culture at an A 600 nm = 0.6 with 1.0 mmisopropylthiogalactoside and mGP1-2 (multiplicity of infection of 20–30). The culture was grown at 37 °C for 3 h after induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall RC2-B centrifuge (GS3 rotor). The cells were washed with ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), pelleted as above, and stored at −20 °C. The mutant Rho proteins were purified as described by Nowatzke et al. (28Nowatzke W. Richardson L. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with one modification. The purification of the protein was stopped after the Bio-Rex 70 column. Analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels indicated that the protein(s) were greater than 95% pure. Proteins were kept in Rho storage buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, and 50% glycerol) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The modification reactions were done using 1:1 molar mixtures of the Cys-0 Rho to Cys-82 Rho, Cys-153 Rho, and the Cys-325 Rho mutant Rho polypeptides. A 100-μl reaction containing 17 μm (monomer) of both the Cys-0 Rho and one of the mutant Rho polypeptides were mixed in TGES buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl) and allowed to equilibrated on ice for 30 min. This 30-min incubation allows for formation of mixed hexamers (30Richardson J.P. Ruteshouser E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mixed hexamer solutions were then spun through a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 spin column equilibrated in TGES buffer to remove residual dithiothreitol. The eluate from the G-50 column was then mixed with 10 μl of a 50 mm APDP solution in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated at 22 °C for 3 h in the dark. The unreacted APDP was removed by centrifugation of the solution through a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 spin column. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. The modified protein was stored at −80 °C and was active for up to a month. Reaction of free sulfhydryl groups with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) results in the release of the 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion, which can be detected by its characteristic absorbance at 412 nm (molar absorptivity of 13,600 m−1 cm−1) (31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The various proteins were modified with APDP as above, with the exception that no Cys-0 Rho protein was added to the cysteine-containing mutants. The reactions were done in a total volume of 105 μl. Protein solutions containing at least 25 μg of cysteine-containing residues (final Cys residue concentration of 3.5 μm or higher) in a volume ≤ 40 μl was filled to 50 μl with TGES buffer. 50 μl of detection buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1.34 mm EDTA, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 8.0) and 5.0 μl of freshly prepared DTNB buffer (10.1 mmDTNB, and 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) were added and mixed. The solution was incubated at 22 °C for 25 min. After 25 min, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 412 nm, and the concentration of free sulfhydryl was determined using the Beer-Lambert law. For values in Table III (see below), the assay was performed as described previously by Nowatzke and Richardson (32Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the modification that 20 ng of Rho protein was used per 100-μl reaction. For values in Table IV (see below), the ATPase reaction buffer was TGES buffer, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 3.6 nm wild type Rho hexamer, and 10 nm RNA (100-μl reaction volume). This buffer was chosen to more closely resemble the buffer conditions of the cross-linking experiments. The concentration of ATP used for these assays was one-fifth the concentration used in the cross-linking studies due to the high background in the colorimetric assay when using 5 mm ATP, thus the MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to one-fifth (2 mm) the amount used in the cross-linking studies.Table IIIEffects of poly(A) and poly(C) on the crosslinking of cro(1–380) to APDP-modified Cys-82 and Cys-325 RhosAPDP-modified RhoCompetitorNonePoly(A)Poly(C)% cro(1–380) cross-linkedCys-821.83 ± 1.500.60 ± 0.030.15 ± 0.11Cys-3251.03 ± 0.390.79 ± 0.290.14 ± 0.11Polynucleotide concentrations were 0.1 μg/μl.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and pB3 was described by Gan and Richardson (20Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmid pA4, constructed by Dr. William Scott, contained DNA base pairs 210–362 of the λ cro gene flanked by sequences encoding hammerhead ribozymes between theXba I and Hin DIII restriction sites in pUC18. The sequence of the A4 insert (underlined) and the flanking hammerheads is as follows: 5′-CTAGAATGCTACTGATGAGGTTCGCCGAAACGTTCGCGTCTAGCATAAATAACCCCGCTCTTACACATTCCAGCCCTGAAAAAGGGCATCAAATTAAACCACACCTATGGTGTATGCATTTATTTGCATACATTCAATCAATTGTTATCTAAGGAAATACTTACATATGGTTCGTGCAAACAAACGCAACGTCTACCGAAAGGTACTGATGAGGTTCGCCGAAACGTTGCGTTA-3′. The plasmid pA4 was maintained in E. coli DH5αF′. DNA templates were prepared for T7 transcription by linearization of the plasmid with a restriction enzyme as indicated. After digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme, 25 μg of Proteinase K and 0.2 volume of 5× Proteinase K buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm EDTA, and 5% SDS) were added and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then treated with an equal volume of phenol, then treated with an equal volume of chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (24:1), and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in water. The DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. T7 transcription was carried out in a 100-μl mixture containing 5 pmol of linearized DNA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 30 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 4 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.02 n NaOH, and 8 μg of T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The RNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of 8 m LiCl and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, followed by 30 min at −80 °C. The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 150 μl of 70% ethanol, and recentrifuged. The pellet was dried and subsequently resuspended in 20 μl of formamide loading dye (98% formamide, 2 mmEDTA, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.03% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The resuspended RNA was loaded onto a 6%/7m urea polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis, 19:1) containing 1× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mmEDTA) and run in 1× TBE buffer at 30 watts. The RNA was detected by UV shadowing, excised using a sterile razor blade, and placed into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of phenol, 200 μl of chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (24:1), and 250 μl of passive elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA). The gel slice was incubated for 10–12 h at 4 °C. The RNA was recovered by removing the aqueous layer, performing two chloroform extractions, followed by ethanol precipitation and 70% ethanol wash. The dried pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of the RNA was determined by its absorbance at 260 nm. To label the 5′-end of the T7 transcripts from the linearized pB3 and pA4 plasmids, which have a free 5′-hydroxyl as a result of cleavage with the 5′-hammerhead, 1 μm RNA was mixed with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 2.8 μm[γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) in 50 μl of PNK buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The RNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed, and resuspended in 20 μl of formamide loading dye. The RNA was loaded onto a 6%/7 m urea polyacrylamide gel and run at 30 watts in 1× TBE buffer. The RNA was isolated as above. All RNAs were stored in TE buffer at −80 °C (see Fig. 1). Taq I and Bgl II pIF2 T7 transcripts were 3′-end-labeled using [5′-32P]cytidine-3′,5′-bisphosphate, which was prepared by mixing 50 pmol of 3′-CMP, 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) in 50 μl of T4 PNK buffer. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. T4 polynucleotide kinase was inactivated by boiling the reaction solution for 1 min at 95 °C. This solution was stored at −20 °C. To 3′-end label the RNA, 1 μm RNA, 50 μm ATP, 12 units of T4 RNA ligase, and 2 μm[5′-32P]cytidine-3′,5′-bisphosphate were incubated at 4 °C for 10–12 h in 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 20 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 ng/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture was mixed with 10 μl of formamide loading dye then loaded and run at 30 watts on a 6%/7 murea polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer. The RNA was located by UV shadowing and purified as above). The APDP-modified Rho proteins were diluted to 10 ng/μl in Rho dilution buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The cross-linking reactions, prepared under subdued light, contained 20 ng of modified Rho, 10 nm32P-labeled RNA, and 5 mm adenine nucleotide (if present) in 20 μl of TGES buffer with 10 mmMgCl2 and were incubated for 2 min at 22 °C. The samples were then placed onto a piece of Parafilm, directly under a mid-range UV 302-nm lamp (Model UVM-57, UVP Products). A polystyrene filter was placed over the samples during irradiation; this helped to filter out shorter wavelength UV light, which can induce nonspecific protein-nucleic acid cross-linking. The samples were irradiated for 2 min at 4 °C. The samples were then mixed with 0.2 volume of SDS loading dye (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol), and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bis, 29:1) at 25 mA in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Rho-RNA cross-linked species were detected by using a 20- × 25-cm Storage Phosphor Screen and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The computer program ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics) was used to quantify the cross-linked products. Coordinates for the N-terminal 125 amino acids of Rho were downloaded from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, accession code 1A62 (9Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P.

The coordinates for the C-terminal region (amino acids 126–419) of Rho were downloaded from the web site of the Department of Biotechnology, University of Virginia (17Wood T.C. Theory and Application of Protein HomologyPh.D. Dissertation. University of Virginia, 1999Google Scholar). Modeling of the Rho monomer was performed using the InsightII visualizer software obtained from Molecular Simulations, Inc. Variants of Rho protein containing single cysteine residues at different positions were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type Rho contains a single cysteine at position 202. Dombroski and Platt (26Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that it could be changed to a serine or an alanine without affecting the function of Rho. Starting with a rho gene containing the C202S mutation, derivatives with single cysteines at other positions were made. The positions were chosen based on the proposed quaternary structure of E. coli Rho (Fig.2) (17Wood T.C. Theory and Application of Protein HomologyPh.D. Dissertation. University of Virginia, 1999Google Scholar). All the residues changed were predicted to be solvent-exposed serines. The changes were thus expected to have minimal perturbation of wild-type function and allow for a high potential for modification with a cysteine-reactive cross-linking moiety. Position 325 is in a section called the R loop and is believed to be near a proposed secondary RNA-binding site located in the center of the Rho hexamer (13Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Position 82 is in close proximity to the RNA-binding cleft in the RNA-binding domain (9Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M.

The mutant proteins were purified and tested for retention of normal function by measuring their ATPase activity with λ cro mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1968880823,"Mature core I and core II proteins of the bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complex were individually overexpressed in Escherichia coli as soluble proteins using the expression vector pET-I and pET-II, respectively. Purified recombinant core I and core II alone show no mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) activity. When these two proteins are mixed together, MPP activity is observed. Maximum activity is obtained when the molar ratio of these two core proteins reaches 1. This indicates that only the two core subunits of thebc(1) complex are needed for MPP activity. The properties of reconstituted MPP are similar to those of Triton X-100-activated MPP in the bovine bc(1) complex. When Rieske iron-sulfur protein precursor is used as substrate for reconstituted MPP, the processing activity stops when the amount of product formation (subunit IX) equals the amount of reconstituted MPP used in the system. Addition of Triton X-100 to the product-inhibited reaction mixture restores MPP activity, indicating that Triton X-100 dissociates bound subunit IX from the active site of reconstituted MPP. The aromatic group, rather than the hydroxyl group, at Tyr(57) of core I is essential for reconstitutive activity."

The receptor for HGF/scatter factor was identified as c-Met tyrosine kinase, and activation of the receptor induces multiple signaling cascades. To gain further insight into c-Met-mediated multiple events at a molecular level, we isolated several signaling molecules including a novel binding partner of c-Met, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1).

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3341-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Binding of the growth factors causes activation of their inherent receptor tyrosine kinases leading to autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains at multiple tyrosine residues. The newly formed phosphotyrosines constitute binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain- and/or phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing cytoplasmic proteins. Met tyrosine kinase was reported to interact with several substrates including the growth factor receptor-bound protein (Grb) 2 (20Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S.

Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all these proteins associate with c-Met via a multiple substrate binding site. The c-Met-mediated signaling was well studied in the epithelial cell system, MDCK cells. On planar culture surfaces, sub-confluent MDCK cells normally form coherent islands of relatively flattened cells. HGF has been shown to alter this morphology by promoting the initial expansion of colonies followed by dispersion of the cells that make up these colonies and an increase in their motility (cell scattering) in liquid cell culture medium (25Stoker M. Perryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 77: 209-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of a number of tyrosine kinase receptors including Neu, Ros epidermal growth factor receptor, and keratinocyte growth factor receptor induced cell scattering in MDCK cells (26Sachs M. Weidner K.M. Brinkmann V. Walther I. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Royal and Park (27Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (229) Google Scholar) reported that PI 3-kinase and Ras are required for cell scattering. In addition, stimulation with HGF induces the formation of tubular structures from MDCK cells grown in a three-dimensional collagen matrix (11Montesano R. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 67: 901-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). For this, the epithelial cells are grown for several days in collagen, in which they form cysts. When HGF/scatter factor is added, individual cells dissociate and form continuous tubules (28Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a number of signaling molecules including Gab1(24), Grb2 (29Royal I. Fournier T.M. Park M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), PLCγ (30Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and STAT3 (21Boccaccio C. Andò M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) are required for this process. The underlying mechanisms of these multiple molecular events, however, are still poorly understood. In the present study we identified SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) 1 as a novel binding partner of c-Met by yeast two-hybrid screening using a rat brain library. SHIP-1 binds to one of the tyrosine residues at the multiple substrate binding site, 1356pYVNV, which is also the binding site for Grb2. Interestingly, the YVNV motif is identical to the common binding site of Shc to SHIP and Grb2. Furthermore, we show that PI 3-kinase was not able to bind c-Met in the presence of Grb2, Gab1, or SHIP-1. Overexpression of SHIP-1 in MDCK cells drastically enhanced the branching potency of c-Met without affecting the mitogenic and scattering potency. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant SHIP-1 lacking catalytic activity impaired HGF-mediated branching tubulogenesis. The construction of LexA fusion genes encoding the cytoplasmic domains of c-Met, c-Fms, TrkA, insulin receptor, and c-Kit downstream of LexA and the expression inSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 were described previously (24Weidner K.M.

Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A single colony, selected for expression of the LexA fusion protein, was tested for autophosphorylation and used for transformation with the VP16 cDNA library derived from an 8-day rat brain (33Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). GST·Grb2, GST·SHIP, GST·Gab1, GST·PI 3-kinase fusion proteins were generated in the pGex system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-tagged SHIP, Grb2, and PI 3-kinase were generated in pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant SHIP-1 were generated using pcDNA3.1Myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of various two-hybrid protein/protein interactions were described previously (31Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. HGF was from Sigma. Scattering and branching tubulogenesis assays were performed as described by Gual et al. (30Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10) and c-Met were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibody against Myc and rabbit IgG against c-Met and SHIP-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). These assays were performed as published (31Mancini A. Niedenthal R.

After incubation for 8 h with medium containing 0.02% FCS, MDCK cells were stimulated with HGF (60 ng/ml) for 5, 10, or 30 min. Cells were extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% trasylol, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 400 μm sodium orthovanadate. One aliquot of each clarified lysate (5 × 106 cells) was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-SHIP or anti-Met antibody preabsorbed on Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain. After washing, materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot analysis using the appropriate antibodies. GST fusion proteins and His-tagged proteins were produced as recommended by the manufacturer. Purified GST fusion proteins were bound for 1 h at 4 °C to glutathione-agarose beads (40 μl slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) suspended in the binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% trasylol, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate). After incubation with 32P-labeled autophosphorylated c-Met overnight, beads were washed five times with binding buffer, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To identify neuronal proteins that specifically interact with the cytoplasmic domain of c-Met, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screening using an 8 day-old rat brain library (24Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 33Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

A total of 800 cDNA clones of various length were obtained, together encoding seven different proteins. Five of these proteins were previously identified as c-Met-binding proteins including Gab1, PI 3-kinase, Grb2, PLCγ, and c-Src. Furthermore, we detected the interaction with a novel c-Met-interactive zinc finger-containing protein; however, the biological significance of this association remains to be studied. In addition to these molecules, we isolated SHIP-1 as a novel c-Met binding partner. SHIP-1 was originally identified as a signaling molecule in cytokine-stimulated hematopoietic cells such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated cells (36Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and has been clearly demonstrated to participate in the signaling pathways in hematopoietic cell systems (37Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To determine whether SHIP-1 is a relevant signaling molecule in other cell systems, we next analyzed SHIP-1 expression in various cell lines such as colon carcinoma CACO-2; MDCK cells; two human breast carcinoma cell lines, EFM-19 and EFM-192A; and Raji cells. For a control, we applied a cell lysate derived from myeloid projenitor cell line FDC-P1Mac11 cells (38Gliniak S.C. Rohrschneider R.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous report (36Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), SHIP-1 is expressed at high levels in myeloid progenitor cell line FDC-P1Mac11 cells. In addition, SHIP-1 was also detected in the epithelial cell lines, MDCK, both human breast carcinoma cell lines, and Raji cells (Fig.1). To demonstrate the protein/protein interaction between SHIP and c-Metin vivo, MDCK cells were incubated for 8 h with medium containing 0.02% FCS, then stimulated with HGF (60 ng/ml) for 5, 10, and 30 min, and studied by immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells from each preparation were lysed for immunoprecipitations using the SHIP-specific or c-Met-specific antibodies. Precipitated material was analyzed for the presence of c-Met or SHIP by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using SHIP-, c-Met-, or phosphotyrosine (4G10)-specific antibodies (Fig.2). Following HGF stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was observed throughout the experiment. Prior to HGF stimulation (0 min), no c-Met was detectable in the SHIP-specific immune complexes. In contrast, between 5 and 30 min after HGF stimulation, c-Met was coprecipitated with SHIP (Fig. 2). To determine whether the SHIP-1-c-Met interaction relied on the presence of particular phosphotyrosine residues of c-Met, we employed a set of c-Met mutants in which established binding sites for defined binding partners were destroyed (24Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These mutants included Y1349F (Y14F), Y1356F (Y15F), the double mutant Y14F/Y15F, and the kinase negative mutant K1110A. We examined the binding of these mutants with the SH2 domain of SHIP-1, PI 3-kinase, Grb2, Grb10, PLCγ, and c-Src, the Met binding domain (MBD) of Gab1, and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc. As shown in Fig.3, Grb2, Grb10, and SHIP-1 did not associate with the Y15F mutant, suggesting that phosphotyrosine 1356 at the multifunctional docking site is the only binding site for these proteins. On the other hand, PI 3-kinase, Gab1, PLCγ, c-Src, and Shc bind to both Y14F (Y1349F) and Y15F (Y1356F) (Fig. 3). Signaling molecules that bind to the multifunctional docking site such as PI 3-kinase, Shc, and PLCγ associate with most receptor tyrosine kinases. Because SHIP-1 binds at the same site in c-Met with these molecules, we performed similar binding analyses with four additional activated receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Fms, c-Kit, TrkA, and the insulin receptor. Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clearly demonstrated that these receptor moieties were phosphorylated on tyrosine in the yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). As expected, c-Fms binds to SHIP-1; however, SHIP-1 did not bind other tyrosine kinase receptors such as c-Kit, TrkA, or the insulin receptor (Fig.4). In agreement with previous data (39Reedijk M.

It is noteworthy that both of the PI 3-kinase binding sites of c-Met, tyrosine 1349 and 1356, and their following amino acid sequences are different from this motif (Table I).Table IpYVNV in c-Met and Shc binds to both SHIP and Grb2Tyrosine kinase substrateSHIP binding sitePI 3-kinase binding siteGrb2 binding sitec-MetpYVNVpYVHV (20)pYVNV (20, 56)pYVNV (20)ShcpYVNV (44)pYVNV (57)c-Fms?pYVEM (39)pYKNI (58)pYTNL (31)c-KitpYMDM (40)pYKNL (59)pYSNL (59)Insulin receptorpYHTM (41) Open table in a new tab The multifunctional docking site of c-Met provides binding sites for many substrates including PI 3-kinase, Grb2, Gab1, and SHIP. As shown in Fig. 3, PI 3-kinase and Gab1 bind at both phosphotyrosine 1349 and phosphotyrosine 1356, whereas SHIP and Grb2 bind only at phosphotyrosine 1356. This observation raises the question whether two of these molecules bind to c-Met simultaneously or sequentially. To answer this question, we have generated the GST·SH2 domain of Grb2 (Grb2(SH2)), p85 of PI 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase(SH2)), and SHIP (SHIP(SH2)) fusion proteins and GST·MBD of Gab1 (Gab1(MBD)), which were incubated with tyrosine-autophosphorylated c-Met in the presence and absence of His-tagged PI 3-kinase(SH2), Grb2(SH2), or SHIP(SH2). Firstly, we compared the binding of c-Met to PI 3-kinase and SHIP. When equal amounts of both molecules were incubated with c-Met, SHIP bound predominantly to c-Met. Secondly, Grb2 bound to c-Met preferentially over PI 3-kinase and Gab1 (Fig. 5). Thirdly, SHIP did not compete with the c-Met-Gab1 interaction. Taken together, these results indicate that when phosphotyrosine 1356 binds to either Grb2 or SHIP, phosphotyrosine 1349 does not provide a binding site for PI 3-kinase and that when Grb2 binds to phosphotyrosine 1356, even Gab1 does not bind to c-Met, suggesting that in vivo these molecules may bind to a single molecule of c-Met sequentially. To investigate the biological role of SHIP-1 in c-Met-mediated signaling, we overexpressed the Myc-tagged SHIP-1 gene in MDCK cells and isolated 19 different clones, each constitutively expressing distinct levels of an Myc-tagged SHIP-1. The two clones (clones 15 and 21) employed in these studies expressed equally high levels of SHIP-1 (Fig.6 A). Using these mutant cell lines together with the wild-type MDCK cells as control, we examined cell dissociation (scattering), cell proliferation, and branching tubulogenesis induced by HGF stimulation. Firstly, the scattering effect of HGF to both transfectants was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Fig. 6 B). Secondly, in agreement with data obtained from the fibroblast system (36Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), the overexpression of SHIP-1 showed no influence on [3H]thymidine incorporation, suggesting that overexpression of SHIP-1 did not affect cell growth of MDCK cells (Fig. 6 C). Finally, we tested the ability of these cells to form tubules in semi-solid collagen. To our surprise, both transfectants that overexpressed Myc-tagged SHIP started to form branching tubules within 24 h after HGF treatment. Two days after HGF stimulation, transfectants formed long branching tubules (Fig.7), whereas wild-type MDCK cells formed branching tubules only 6–7 days after HGF treatment (Fig. 7). Furthermore, in agreement with previous data (43Maroun C.R. Holgada-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), even 7 days after HGF treatment, about 70% of wild-type cells formed tubules; however, almost all transfectants formed tubules. In the absence of HGF, none of the transfectants formed any branching tubules throughout a time period of 2 weeks (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that overexpression of SHIP clearly enhances HGF-mediated tubulogenesis.Figure 7Overexpression of SHIP in MDCK cells potentiates HGF-mediated branching tubulogenesis. Wild-type (wt) and SHIP-overexpressing MDCK cell lines, clones 15 and 21, were grown in collagen for 5 days, and then medium containing HGF (40 ng/ml) was added and changed every 2 days. After 2, 4, and 7 days, the branching tubulogenesis response was evaluated. Photomicrographs by Hoffman modulation contrast microphotometry show a representative experiment that had been performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown above, SHIP-1 overexpression accelerated tubulogenesis. This fact raised the question whether this phenotype results from enhanced phosphoinositol phosphatase activity or from displacement of protein binding to the receptor at the SHIP-1 binding site. To answer this question, we next generated a mutant SHIP-1 lacking catalytic activity by deleting amino acid residues 666–680 (44Vollenweider P. Clodi M. Martin S.S. Imamura T. Kavanaugh W.M. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using pcDNA3.1Myc-His, and we overexpressed this mutant in MDCK cells. Twelve different clones were isolated, and the two clones (clones 1 and 4) employed in this study expressed equally high levels of mutant SHIP-1 (Fig. 8 A). Using these mutant cell lines together with the pcDNA3.1Myc-His-transfected MDCK cells as control, we examined branching tubulogenesis induced by the HGF stimulation. In agreement with previous experiments using wild-type MDCK cells, the control transfectant formed branching tubules within 7 days after the HGF treatment. Two clones that overexpressed a mutant SHIP-1, however, failed to form branching tubules over 9 days (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that the effects of SHIP-1 overexpression to accelerate tubulogenesis are due to the enhanced phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. The results presented above can be summarized as follows. Firstly, we have identified SHIP as a novel binding partner of c-Met. Secondly, SHIP binds to tyrosine 1356 at the multifunctional docking site of c-Met. Thirdly, we showed here that this site, which contains two phosphotyrosine residues, binds in vitro to only one signaling molecule at a time. Fourthly, overexpression of SHIP drastically enhanced the tubulogenesis potency of c-Met without altering the c-Met-mediated cell scattering and cell proliferation. Cells that overexpressed a mutant SHIP-1 lacking catalytic activity, however, failed to form branching tubules in the presence of HGF, suggesting that the effects of SHIP-1 overexpression to accelerate tubulogenesis are due to the enhanced phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. c-Met signaling is mediated by a multifunctional docking site comprising two phosphotyrosines arranged in tandem (20Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Most tyrosine kinase receptors including c-Fms, c-Kit, and epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylate at multiple sites that bind several signaling molecules, suggesting that one receptor molecule is able to simultaneously associate with multiple signaling molecules. In addition, we showed here that the multifunctional docking site of c-Met binds to only one signaling molecule and that when several effector molecules are present simultaneously, one can observe in vitro the hierarchical binding of proteins, such as Grb2, Gab1, SHIP, and PI 3-kinase. Our competition assay reveals that PI 3-kinase did not compete with c-Met-Grb2 and c-Met-SHIP interactions; however, Grb2 competed with all of these interactions, suggesting that the binding order of these effector molecules is crucial for the c-Met-mediated multiple signal transduction. In vivo binding of full-length molecules, however, may be dependent upon their allosteric interactions. It is therefore also possible that multiple complexes of signaling molecules are assembled to the activated receptor. Furthermore, we have to take into account that the number and the subcellular distribution of each of the signaling molecules expressed in a given cell are different. For instance, when HGF-treated cells are grown in a three-dimensional collagen matrix, cells form tubules that have a lumen surrounded by well polarized epithelial cells, with a smooth basal surface in contact with the collagen matrix and an apical surface rich in microvilli that faces the lumen (11Montesano R. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 67: 901-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of c-Met and substrates differs in these cells from nonpolarized cells that are tested for cell scattering. For the cell-scattering assay, cells were incubated in liquid culture medium without collagen. We show here that the SHIP-1 binding site, tyrosine 1356, is also a binding site for Grb2 with the YX NX motif. Does SHIP-1 regularly share the binding site with Grb2? In the case of c-Fms, tyrosine 696 and tyrosine 921 provide the binding sites for Grb2 with the YX NX motif, 696YKNI and921YTNL, respectively (31Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutation of both sites, however, did not exert an influence on the SHIP-1-c-Fms association, indicating that none of these sites acts as a binding site for SHIP-1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the second or fourth flanking position is also important for binding. Interestingly, the SH2 domains of SHIP and Grb2 also share the binding site 317pYVNV of Shc (45Wada T. Sasaoka T. Ishii M. Hori H. Haruta T. Ishihara H. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4585-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the sequence of which is identical to the1356pYVNV of c-Met, indicating that YVNV is a consensus sequence for the SHIP binding site (Table I). Interestingly, the point mutation of asparagine 1358 into histidine abolished the branching potential of c-Met (29Royal I. Fournier T.M. Park M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A most striking observation of our studies regards the fact that overexpression of SHIP-1 drastically enhanced the HGF-mediated branching tubulogenesis without altering cell growth and cell scattering in response to HGF (Figs. 6 and 7). Here, both transfectants that overexpressed Myc-tagged SHIP started to form branching tubules within 24 h after the HGF treatment. SHIP plays a role in inositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism (46Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SHIP-1 displays 5-phosphatase activity specifically with both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate as substrate. Phee et al. (47Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeschall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported that enzymatic activity of SHIP is regulated by a plasma membrane localization and, as a result of this regulation, significant reduction in the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate level was observed. Furthermore, a striking correlation was observed between phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate production and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-1, as well as its relocation to the cytoskeleton upon thrombin stimulation in human blood platelets (48Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer L.A. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26857-26863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate may bind to pleckstrin homolog domains of still undefined enzymes, which may promote relocalization to the membrane and provide enzyme access to new lipid substrates or regulatory kinases. Indeed, the serine/threonine kinase B, also known as Akt has been shown to bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. In addition, the members of the protein kinase C family, PKCε and PKCζ, are activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (49Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the platelet system, Hartwig et al. (50Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate inhibits actin filament severing and capping by human gelsolin in vitro, suggesting that the product of SHIP-1 plays a role in the cytoskeleton rearrangement that is important for morphogenesis. On the other hand, Maroun et al. (51Maroun C.R. Moscatello D.K. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31719-31726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that the ability of Gab1 to bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is crucial for subcellular localization of Gab1 and for efficient morphogenesis mediated by c-Met. However, the same authors (43Maroun C.R. Holgada-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) reported that Gab1 phosphorylationper se is not sufficient to induce branching tubulogenesis and suggested that a Met-specific substrate, in addition to Gab1, is required for branching tubulogenesis. Recently, it has been reported that SHIP interacted with the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1, PIAS1 (52Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). Another member of the STAT family, STAT3, was reported to be an important molecule for c-Met-mediated branching tubulogenesis (21Boccaccio C. Andò M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Here, SHIP-1 may also participate in the STAT pathway. Recently, both amplification of PI 3-kinase and loss of function of a 3′-lipid phosphatase, PTEN, have been shown in multiple human tumors (53Kong D. Suzuki A. Zou T.T. Sakurada A. Kemp L.W.

At the moment, the molecular mechanism of potentiation of HGF-mediated branching by SHIP-1 overexpression remains unclear; however, inositol phosphate and/or phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolisms play a key role in epithelial cell dissociation, reassociation, and formation of continuous tubules.

Removal of the C2 domain of the Aplysia nPKC Apl II allows activation of the enzyme at lower concentrations of phosphatidylserine, suggesting an inhibitory role for the C2 domain in enzyme activation. However, the mechanism for C2 domain-mediated inhibition is not known. Mapping of the autophosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) Apl II reveals four phosphopeptides in the regulatory domain of PKC Apl II, two of which are in the C2 domain at serine 2 and serine 36. Unlike most PKC autophosphorylation sites, these serines could be phosphorylated in trans. Interestingly, phosphorylation of serine 36 increased binding of the C2 domain to phosphatidylserine membranes in vitro. In cells, PKC Apl II phosphorylation at serine 36 was increased by PKC activators, and PKC phosphorylated at this position translocated more efficiently to membranes. Moreover, mutation of serine 36 to alanine significantly reduced membrane translocation of PKC Apl II. We suggest that translocation of nPKCs is regulated by phosphorylation of the C2 domain.

We have studied the regulation of PKC inAplysia, an important model system for synaptic plasticity, where PKC plays several important roles in regulating synaptic strength (2Manseau F. Sossin W.S. Castellucci V.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Ghirardi M. Braha O. Hochner B. Montarolo P.G. Kandel E.R. Dale N.

Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of PKCs is conserved in Aplysia. Ca2+-activated PKCs (cPKCs) in vertebrates (α, β, γ) and invertebrates (PKC Apl I in Aplysia) have two C1 domains and a C2 domain. Ca2+-independent or novel PKCs (nPKCs) in vertebrates (δ, ε, η, and θ) and invertebrates (PKC Apl II inAplysia) also have two C1 domains and a C2 domain. However, the C2 domain in these kinases is N-terminal to the C1 domains and lacks several of the critical aspartic acids necessary for the coordination of Ca2+ ions (7Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In cPKCs, the C2 domain mediates Ca2+-dependent binding to the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) (8Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This binding is believed to be the primary step in kinase activation. First, it transiently recruits the enzyme to the membrane where its physiological activator, diacylglycerol (DAG), resides. Second, in conjunction with the C1 domain interacting with DAG, binding of the C2 domain to PS induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme (10Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Finally, the C2 domain binds to the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK), and this binding is important for the location of PKC translocation and for cellular functions of PKC (12Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In contrast to cPKCs, a detailed model for the role of the N-terminal C2 domain in nPKC activation is not available. C2 domains of nPKCs do not bind constitutively to lipids and are not regulated by calcium (13Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, similar to cPKCs, C2 domain-derived peptides from nPKCs act as isoform-specific inhibitors and activators in cells, implicating the C2 domain in the regulation of enzymatic activity (14Gray M.O.

Removal of the C2 domain of PKCη does not perturb the substrate specificity or response of the enzyme to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (17Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le G.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, removal of the C2 domain of PKC Apl II decreases the amount of PS necessary for kinase activity, implicating the C2 domain in kinase regulation (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, PKC Apl II is activated more poorly than PKC Apl I, even when calcium is removed from PKC Apl I, suggesting a requirement of additional activators for stimulation of PKC Apl IIin vivo (13Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons between PKCε and PKCα also indicate that nPKCs require additional factors to bind efficiently to lipid membranes (20Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PKC Apl II can be activated under a number of physiological conditions in cells, usually after prolonged activation of signal transduction pathways (6Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sossin W.S. Chen C.S. Toker A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation also induces autonomous activity of PKC Apl II (22Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This activation is specific, as PKC Apl I does not become autonomous under these conditions. The autonomous activity does not result from proteolysis to form a protein kinase M but probably results from post-translational modifications in the regulatory domain of PKC Apl II (22Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PKCs are regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation in the activation loop by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase I (PDK-1) is required for subsequent PKC “maturation” by autophosphorylation at two residues critical for enzyme stability and activity (8Newton A.C.

Phosphorylation of PKCδ on tyrosine residues is thought to be important for activation of the kinase (25Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lorenzo P.S. Baskin L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Upon activation, PKCs additionally phosphorylate themselves on several residues. The roles for these phosphorylations are still unknown. Autophosphorylation at a conserved site in the C-terminal domain has been associated with persistent activation of PKC and may be involved in removal of the enzyme from the membrane (28Nakhost A.

A phosphorylation site has also been identified in the C2 domain of vertebrate PKCα that is correlated with PKC activation (30Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the ε-η family of novel PKCs, which includes the invertebrate kinases PKC Apl II in Aplysia, Drosophila PKC98F, andCaenorhabditis elegans PKCIB, has not been investigated. In this paper we identify two autophosphorylation sites, serine 2 and serine 36, in the C2 domain of the nPKC Apl II. Phosphorylation at serine 36 increases lipid binding to the C2 domain and increases translocation of PKCs in cells. We suggest that phosphorylation of C2 domains in novel PKCs is important for regulating their translocation. 4-β-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was from LC Services; dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS) and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL; Triton X-100 was from Avanti; prestained molecular weight markers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; andN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (TPCK) was from Worthington. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Full-length clones of PKC Apl II were present in Bluescript SK and the baculovirus vector BB3 (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, PKC Apl II was excised from baculovirus BB3 usingSac I/Sal I and inserted into the new vector BB4 (Invitrogen) at Sac I/Sal I. The C2 domain S36A and S36E mutations were generated with a two-step mutagenic procedure using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). First round PCR used the C2 domain of PKC Apl II in the pMALC-C2 plasmid (New England Biolabs) as a template and either the outside 5′ primer (O5) and the inside 3′ primer (I3) or the inside 5′ primer (I5) and the outside 3′ primer (O3) (see Table I for primers). The products from the first round synthesis were combined and used as the template for second round synthesis using O5 and O3. The resultant product was cut with appropriate enzymes (Table I) and inserted into PKC Apl II in the BB4 vector. A new site was formed by the mutagenesis (Table I) and was used to confirm the cloning. The mutations were also made in the pMAL-C2 vector encoding the MBP-C2 fusion protein using a similar procedure. The final product was cut with appropriate enzymes (Table I) and inserted into the MBP-C2 domain at the indicated cloning sites (Table I). Ser-68 → Ala and Ser-2 → Ala were made with a similar strategy using different inside primers and the same outside primers (Table I). A clone of human PKCε was a kind gift of A. Toker (Harvard Medical School). The construct was amplified with PCR using VENT DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and inserted into BB4 atKpn I and BamHI. The construct lacking the C2 domain used an alternative 5′ primer containing the initiating methionine of PKCε followed by amino acid 145.

Open table in a new tab Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9, Sf21; Invitrogen) cells were grown in suspension cultures with supplemented Grace's media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The baculovirus transfer vectors were cotransfected with linearized baculovirus (Invitrogen), and the resultant blue colonies were plaque-purified. Positive colonies were confirmed by PCR and by immunoblotting with anti-PKC Apl II or anti-PKCε antibodies ((31) Calbiochem). High titer viral stocks (108–1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml) were generated as described (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical purification of all Aplysia PKCs, human PKCε, and mutants was performed as described previously (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, 250 ml of Sf21 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with 1 × 109 pfus of baculovirus and incubated for 64 h for optimal PKC expression. Cells were pelleted, resuspended, sonicated, and centrifuged as described. The supernatant solution was passed through a 0.22-μm filter, diluted to 50 ml with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a Mono-Q column (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated in buffer A. The remaining steps were performed following previous protocols (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All baculovirus expressed enzymes were aliquoted and stored frozen at −70 °C until needed. Both a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein were expressed in bacterial DH5α cells from either a pMAL-C2 plasmid (New England Biolabs) or a pGEX 5x.1 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These plasmids contained an insert of PKC Apl II amino acids 1–155 corresponding to the C2 domain (13Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Sossin W.S. Chen C.S. Toker A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The MBP-C2 domain and GST-C2 domain fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose (New England Biolabs) or GST resin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. We synthesized a peptide (CRLQKG(pS)TKEK; where pS is phosphoserine) corresponding to amino acids 30–40 of the C2 domain of PKC Apl II with Ser-36 converted to phosphoserine (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, MA) to generate a phosphopeptide antibody. The peptide was conjugated to bovine serum albumin maleimide (Pierce) via the cysteine and was injected intramuscularly into rabbits along with TitreMax Gold (Cytrx, Norcross, GA) three times at 4-week intervals. Serum was affinity purified and used in Western blots as described (32Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Yanow S.K. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29469-29474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with the phosphorylated peptide antibody at 1 μg/ml dilution and goat anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1 μg/ml. The phosphopeptide antibody was preabsorbed using the nonphosphorylated form of the peptide at 1 μg/μl for 30 min prior to its addition to the immunoblot. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles containing trace [3H]PC were prepared. Briefly, lipid mixtures in chloroform were dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 170 mm sucrose). They were then subjected to 5 freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and extruded through two stacked 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters using a Liposofast microextruder (Avestin, Inc., Ontario, Canada) as described (33Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine liposomes were prepared by resuspending dried lipids in buffer and vortexing (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (5 nm) activity was assayed using phorbol esters or the mixed micelle assay as described (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCs (200–500 nm) or PKC-derived C2 domain fusion proteins (2 μm) were incubated in reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA) with 50 μg/ml dioleoyl phosphatidylserine, 20 nmPMA, and [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi in 50 μmATP) for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphorylation was quenched by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled. Membrane binding of C2 domain constructs was determined by measuring the binding to sucrose-loaded vesicles (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30787-30792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MBP fusion proteins on amylose beads were phosphorylated by PKC as described above. PKC, ATP, and lipids were removed by sedimenting the beads at low speeds (3000 × g for 1 min) followed by three washes with sedimentation buffer (0.3 mg ml−1 ovalbumin, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with sedimentation buffer containing 10 μm maltose. The purified fusion proteins were prespun to pellet aggregates for 30 min at 100,000 × g and 15 °C in a TLA-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Soluble fusion proteins (1–2 μm) were incubated with sucrose-loaded vesicles (20 μm lipid) for 10 min at 15 °C. The proteins associated with the sucrose-loaded vesicles were then separated from free protein by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C. Pelleting of lipids was confirmed using scintillation counting of [3H]PC which was included as a tracer in the sucrose-loaded vesicles or liposomes. Membrane-bound (pellet fraction) and free (supernatant fraction) C2 domain fusion protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Total protein was visualized by Ponceau-S staining and phosphorylated protein by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film on the membrane. In some cases quantitation of the Ponceau-S staining was confirmed by immunoblotting using an antibody to the maltose-binding protein. In some experiments, the fusion protein was excised from the gels, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated was calculated by scintillation counting with correction for quenching. This experiment demonstrated that less than 5% of the total fusion protein was phosphorylated under these conditions. Recombinant baculovirus encoding wild type, S36A, or S36E PKC Apl II was incubated with Sf-21 cells in media at 27 °C. After 72 h of infection, cells were incubated with vehicle (control) or 4-β-PDBu (experimental) for 1 h at 27 °C. Cells were then harvested and lysed in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm benzamadine, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.5, and 1 μm microcystin). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) from the membrane/cytoskeleton fraction (pellet). Equal fractions of the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide gels), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the PKC Apl II antibody and the phospho-Ser-36 antibody. Purified PKC Apl II or PKC Apl IIΔC2 was autophosphorylated as described (19Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction contained 10 pmol of PKC Apl II or PKC Apl IIΔC2, 50 μm ATP, reaction buffer (80 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 40 nm PMA, and 150 μg/ml dioleoyl phosphatidylserine) and proceeded for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation was quenched by the addition of 5 μm inhibitory peptide. The 75-μl proteolysis reaction contained 10 pmol of either phosphorylated PKC Apl II or PKC Apl IIΔC2 and 0.1% Triton X-100. The phosphorylated kinase component was incubated for 3 min at 30 °C, and proteolysis was initiated by addition of 2 μg/ml ofN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and incubated for an additional 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7% gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were subjected to autoradiography to visualize phosphate incorporation into proteins and immunoblot with the anti-C2 domain antibody for identification of C2 domain containing protein fragments (13Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed as described with several modifications (32Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Yanow S.K. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29469-29474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Boyle W.J., van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Membrane fragments containing protein bands were preblocked in 0.5% PVP-360 in 100 mm acetic acid, washed, and subsequently digested overnight with 10 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5% acetonitrile. An additional 10 μg of trypsin was added to each band for 3 h the following day, and the supernatant solution containing desired peptides was lyophilized to completion. Peptides were resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer (0.6 m formic and 1.4m acetic acid) and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC using a Hunter-3000 HTLC. Labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film on the plate. Predicted migrations of phosphopeptides were calculated as described (36Boyle W.J., van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). After tryptic digestion and lyophilization, PKC Apl II or C2 fusion protein peptides derived fromin vitro phosphorylations were hydrolyzed to constituent amino acids using constant boiling 6 n HCl for 2.5 h at 110 °C. Sample amino acids were mixed with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards prior to running the mixture in the primary TLC dimension using standard buffers (36Boyle W.J., van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid standards were stained with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, and autoradiography was performed on the completed plate. Immunoblots and autoradiograms were scanned, and analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). We calibrated the program with the uncalibrated OD feature of NIH Image, which transforms the data using the formulay = log10 (255/(255 − x)), where x is the pixel value (0–254). Control experiments demonstrated that after this calibration, values were linear with respect to the amount of protein over a wide range of values (37Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To measure translocation, the relative percentage was calculated by first determining the percentage on the pellet in control and experimental (PDBu-treated) conditions. The percentage change between these two conditions (experimental − control/control)·100 was determined. To determine whether the C2 domain of PKC Apl II is regulated by autophosphorylation, we compared tryptic phosphopeptide maps generated after autophosphorylation of purified PKC Apl II or a purified mutant lacking the C2 domain (PKC Apl IIΔC2). PKC Apl II had 5 reproducible phosphopeptides (Fig.1 A). Two of these phosphopeptides (2 and 3) were not found in the enzyme lacking the C2 domain (Fig. 1 B). Removing the C2 domain generated no additional or modified sites (Fig. 1 C). The absence of phosphopeptides 2 and 3 could be due to their location in the C2 domain or conformational changes due to the loss of the C2 domain. To obtain further evidence these sites were actually located in the C2 domain, we obtained tryptic phosphopeptide maps of C2 domain-containing regions of PKC Apl II after partial tryptic digests of autophosphorylated PKC Apl II and PKC Apl IIΔC2 (Fig.2 A). The C2 domain containing fragments were identified based on immunoreactivity to a C2 domain-specific antibody (Fig. 2 B) and by their absence in partial tryptic digests of PKC Apl IIΔC2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Three bands were isolated from the gel and completely digested with trypsin for phosphopeptide mapping analysis (Fig. 2 C). The largest C2 domain fragment, corresponding to the size of the intact regulatory domain contained phosphopeptides 2–5 suggesting that all four of these sites are present in the regulatory domain (Fig.2 C, upper panel). Phosphopeptide 1 was not further investigated but based on predicted mobility it may correspond to the C-terminal fragment that contains two predicted phosphorylated sites (28Nakhost A. Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The C2 domain core itself is quite resistant to tryptic digestion (13Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19040-19048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide mapping of the smallest C2 domain fragment corresponding to the size of the core exhibited only phosphopeptide 3 (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). Thus, phosphopeptide 3 is contained in the C2 domain, whereas phosphopeptide 2 is either near the end of the C2 domain and is sensitive to tryptic digestion or is outside the C2 domain, and its phosphorylation is decreased by C2 domain removal.Figure 2Phosphopeptide 3 originates in the core of the C2 domain. Proteins were phosphorylated, digested, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, PKC Apl II wild type (lane 1) and PKC Apl IIΔC2 (lane 2) were phosphorylated in vitro for 30 min in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were partially digested with 2 μg/ml trypsin for 5 min at 30 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, tran"
https://openalex.org/W2085347170,"CP2-related proteins comprise a family of DNA-binding transcription factors that are generally activators of transcription and expressed ubiquitously. We reported a differential display polymerase chain reaction fragment, Psc2, which was expressed in a regulated fashion in mouse pluripotent cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report further characterization of the Psc2 cDNA and function. The Psc2 cDNA contained an open reading frame homologous to CP2 family proteins. Regions implicated in DNA binding and oligomeric complex formation, but not transcription activation, were conserved. Psc2 expression in vivo during embryogenesis and in the adult mouse demonstrated tight spatial and temporal regulation, with the highest levels of expression in the epithelial lining of distal convoluted tubules in embryonic and adult kidneys. Functional analysis demonstrated that PSC2 repressed transcription 2.5-15-fold when bound to a heterologous promoter in ES, 293T, and COS-1 cells. The N-terminal 52 amino acids of PSC2 were shown to be necessary and sufficient for this activity and did not share obvious homology with reported repressor motifs. These results represent the first report of a CP2 family member that is expressed in a developmentally regulated fashion in vivo and that acts as a direct repressor of transcription. Accordingly, the protein has been named CP2-Related Transcriptional Repressor-1 (CRTR-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2058676400,"Recently, we characterized the rat epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promoter and demonstrated that TCC repeat sequences are required for the down-regulation of EGFR by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 cells. In this study, we report that the Wilms' tumor gene product WT1, a zinc finger transcription factor, is able to enhance the activity of the rat EGFR promoter in cotransfection assays. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that WT1 binds to the TCC repeat sequences of the rat EGFR promoter. Overexpression of WT1 resulted in up-regulation of the expression levels of endogenous EGFR in PC12 cells. Interestingly, NGF down-regulated the expression levels of WT1 and EGFR in PC12 cells, but not in the p140trk-deficient variant PC12nnr5 cells or in cells expressing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. Most importantly, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of antisense WT1 RNA on EGFR expression, and we found that antisense WT1 RNA could substantially reduce EGFR repression in either histochemical staining study or immunoblot analysis. These results indicate that NGF-induced down-regulation of the EGFR in PC12 cells is mediated through WT1 and that WT1 may play an important role in the differentiation of nerve cells.

Some years ago, we reported that PC12 cells respond to both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), but that the response to epidermal growth factor is mitogenic, whereas the response to nerve growth factor leads to differentiation (2Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine what would happen if the cells were exposed to both stimuli at the same time. The answer was that the cells simply did not respond to EGF after they had been treated with NGF, and the reason that they did not respond is that the EGFR is markedly down-regulated by treatment of the cells with NGF (3Lazarovici P. Dickens G. Kuzuya H. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Our studies have focused on the molecular mechanism by which NGF down-regulates the EGFR. Previous studies have demonstrated that NGF-induced down-regulation of the EGFR was at the transcriptional level (4Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of down-regulation of EGFR by NGF in PC12 cells, it is important to study the possible interaction between WT1 and EGFR during the differentiation of PC12 cells.Here, we report that the Wilms' tumor gene product WT1 activates the activity of the rat EGFR promoter through binding to the TCC repeat sequences. Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF decreases the expression levels of WT1 and EGFR. However, the down-regulation of WT1 by NGF, like the EGFR, is not seen in PC12nnr5 cells or in cells expressing either dominant-negative Ras or dominant-negative Src. As another approach, we have studied the inhibitory effect of antisense WT1 RNA on EGFR expression and found that antisense WT1 RNA could substantially reduce EGFR repression. These data strongly suggest that WT1 is involved in the NGF-induced down-regulation of the expression levels of EGF receptor in PC12 cells.DISSCUSSIONEGFR, the prototypical member of the superfamily of receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, is widely expressed on many cell types. Upon activation by its ligand, the intrinsic kinase phosphorylates its own tyrosines and numerous intermediary effector molecules, including closely related c-erbB receptor family members. This initiates numerous signaling pathways. The integrated biological responses to EGFR signaling are pleiotropic, including mitogenesis, apoptosis, enhanced cell motility, and differentiation. In addition to being implicated in organ morphogenesis, unregulated EGFR signaling has been correlated in a wide variety of tumors with invasion and metastasis. Thus, regulation of EGFR signaling including its own expression has potential impact on the integrity of cells.The Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) is one of at least three genes that are involved in the development of Wilms' tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer. Wilms' tumor has been the subject of intense clinical and basic scientific research because it presents a model for cancer treatment and for the relationship between development and cancer, and it illustrates the impact of genetic alterations on development and tumorigenesis. The products of WT1 have been implicated in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In agreement with the diverse functions of WT1, the number of candidate target genes is rapidly mounting (10Menke A.L. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 181: 151-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR has been shown to be one of potential targets of WT1 (17Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar).The PC12 cell line is a good model for the study of NGF action and responds to NGF by differentiating into a postmitotic cell type with neuronal characteristic (18Togari A. Dickens G. Kuzuya H. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). Although both EGF and NGF stimulate a common set of signaling pathways, NGF induces differentiation in PC12 cells, whereas EGF induces proliferation in PC12 cells. We have previously shown that EGFR is down-regulated by NGF treatment and controlled transcriptionally (4Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6878-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Liu X.-W. Katagiri Y. Jiang H. Gong L.-J. Guo L.-Y. Shibutani M. Johnson A.C. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7280-7288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the WT1 protein is directly involved in the down-regulation of EGFR in PC12 cells. First, rat EGFR promoter activity is enhanced by expression of WT1. Second, deletion and mutation of TCC repeat sequences within the EGFR promoter abolish the enhancing effect of WT1. Third, WT1 binds to TCC repeat sequences in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, and mutations in TCC repeat sequences diminish the binding, consistent with the result of the reporter gene assays. Fourth, overexpression of the WT1 protein increases the expression level of endogenous EGFR. Fifth, the expression level of endogenous WT1 is concomitantly decreased along with NGF treatment in PC12 cells, suggesting that WT1 regulates the transcription of EGFR. Supportive evidence is that neither the EGFR nor WT1 expression level is altered when NGF is added to the culture of cells lacking p140trk and expressing dominant-negative forms of Ras and Src. Finally, antisense WT1 RNA substantially reduces WT1 and EGFR expression, indicating that endogenous WT1 is contributing to regulation of EGFR expression. These data strongly demonstrate that down-regulation of rat EGFR by NGF in PC12 cells is mediated by WT1. It is likely that the down-regulation of EGFR is a consequence of down-regulation of WT1 by NGF. Both events are dependent on p140trk, Ras, and Src, which is consistent with this possibility.Although it had been shown that WT1 protein could activate or repress the expression of a number of promoters in cotransfection experiments (17Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sekiya M. Adachi M. Hinoda Y. Imaim K. Yachi A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Englert C.

Holmes G. Walsh P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, our data include not only cotransfection assays of the reporter plasmids and an increased expression of endogenous EGFR in PC12 cells but also the endogenous WT1 effect on EGFR repression. Englert et al. (21Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have reported that WT1 suppresses synthesis of the human EGFR and induces apoptosis by binding to two TC-rich repeat sequences in certain cell lines (Saos-2 and U2OS), but not in all types of cells. Our result supports the notion that cellular environment is a key aspect for the function of WT1 in vivo.Because WT1 protein is expressed mainly in developing kidney, testis, and ovary, indicating that it is involved in the differentiation of genitourinary tissues, it is of interest that WT1 protein is decreased along with neuronal differentiation of cells. Once neurotrophin is provided and cells are committed to being differentiated into neurons, there is suppression of a specific set of genes. Given that EGFR is a crucial factor for proliferation of cells, WT1 could have the potential to regulate differentiation. Studies using a variety of leukemic cell lines suggest that wild-type WT1 is acting to promote cellular proliferation rather than differentiation (24Little M. Holmes G. Walsh P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family, was found to be a major target of WT1 and activated by WT1 (25Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V., B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Harber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This also indicates that genes whose transcription is activated by WT1 may be critical for biological activity.In summary, down-regulation of WT1 by NGF appears to mediate down-regulation of EGFR during the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF. The molecular mechanism for the down-regulation of WT1 by NGF in PC12 cells will help us to understand details about the down-regulation of EGFR and cell differentiation. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 is a member of the ErbB family of ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors, which play a central role in the proliferation, differentiation, and/or oncogenesis of epithelial cells, neural cells, and fibroblasts (1Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D. Thomason A. Yoshinaga S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3884-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Some years ago, we reported that PC12 cells respond to both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), but that the response to epidermal growth factor is mitogenic, whereas the response to nerve growth factor leads to differentiation (2Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine what would happen if the cells were exposed to both stimuli at the same time. The answer was that the cells simply did not respond to EGF after they had been treated with NGF, and the reason that they did not respond is that the EGFR is markedly down-regulated by treatment of the cells with NGF (3Lazarovici P. Dickens G. Kuzuya H. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our studies have focused on the molecular mechanism by which NGF down-regulates the EGFR. Previous studies have demonstrated that NGF-induced down-regulation of the EGFR was at the transcriptional level (4Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6878-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that the down-regulation is p140trk-, Ras-, and Src-dependent (5Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D.

Recently, we isolated and characterized the rat EGFR promoter region and found that TCC repeat sequences in the promoter region of the rat EGFR are required for the down-regulation of rat EGFR by NGF during the differentiation of PC12 cells (6Liu X.-W.

WT1, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, is located at chromosome locus 11p13 and encodes a zinc finger protein that is one of several transcription factors that have been found to interact with TCC repeat sequences (7Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E.

Experimental evidence has indicated that WT1 not only plays a role during kidney development but is also involved in the development and homeostasis of other tissues. The products of WT1 have been implicated in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Menke A.L. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Int. Rev.

Here we report that overexpression of the Oct-2 transcription factor and octamer coactivator BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B, both of which are induced in T cells following T cell receptor signaling, synergistically up-regulates CCR5 promoter activity via interaction with an octamer motif on the promoter. We also show that the octamer transcription factors can increase cell surface expression of CCR5 and fusogenicity of the cells with R5 HIV-1 Env.

These results suggest that octamer transcription factors may play a critical role in the induction of CCR5 expression on, and thereby susceptibility to, R5 HIV-1 of T cells following antigenic stimulation. interleukin regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted human immunodeficiency virus polymerase chain reaction amphotropic murine leukemia virus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate recombinant vaccinia virus(es) Oct-2 is a transcription factor that binds specifically to octamer motifs on its target promoter and/or enhancer regions including immunoglobulin and interleukin (IL)1-2 genes (1Matthias P.

Oct-2 is expressed predominantly in the B-cell lineage; however, recent studies demonstrated that B cell-restricted gene regulation is dependent on B cell-specific coactivator BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B (2Gstaiger M.

We have recently cloned and characterized the promoter region of CCR5 and identified an octamer motif on the promoter region (19Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5441-5449PubMed Google Scholar); however, it remained to be determined whether the octamer motif has a role in the regulation of CCR5 expression on T cells or macrophages, the two major target cells for HIV-1. In this study, we demonstrate that the octamer motif plays a critical role in the induction of CCR5 expression in activated T cells and that octamer-mediated overexpression of CCR5 increases susceptibility of the cells to R5 HIV-1 infection. Plasmid pGL-CCR5 WT contains the CCR5 promoter sequence spanning −770 to +61 relative to the transcription start site (19Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J.

Plasmid pGL-CCR5 ΔOct has mutations (shown in boldface letters below) on the octamer motif (indicated by underline) around −230 relative to the transcription start site (ATGAATGTAAATGTTC → ATGAATGTATACGTTC), which was generated by PCR-oriented site-directed mutagenesis (20Moriuchi H.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy volunteers (Department of Transfusion Medicine, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health and Red Cross Blood Center in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan), and CD4+ T cells were isolated as described previously (25Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Combadiere C. Murphy P.M. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15341-15345Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Where indicated, CD4+ T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm) plus ionomycin (1 μm) or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies immobilized by immunomagnetic beads for 8 h. CCR5-expressing PM1 lymphoid cells were propagated as described previously (19Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5441-5449PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cell pellets according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNeasy Mini; Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). RNA was reverse transcribed in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 mm each dNTP, 1 unit of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 100 pmol of random hexamer oligonucleotides, 2 μg of RNA sample, and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and quick-chilled on ice. The cDNA corresponding to whole coding sequence of Oct-2 or BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B was amplified by PCR for 30 cycles in a 50-μl reaction containing 1 μl of cDNA product and 1.25 units of Taq BeadTMHot Start Polymerase (Promega). MgCl2 concentration in the reaction was 3.0 mm for Oct-2 amplification and 2.0 mm for OCA-B amplification. Primers used for PCR were 5′-ATGTCTAAGCCCCTGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATCAAGGCAGGTAAGGG-3′ (antisense) for Oct-2 and 5′-CACAGCTCCGGAGCAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAAAAGCCTTCCACAGAG-3′ (antisense) for OCA-B. A thermal cycle profile was denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, and elongation for 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. Primers used for amplification of CCR5 cDNA were 5′-TACCAGCCTCCGTATTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTACTATTCCCTCACCTTACC-3′ (antisense). Control amplification was performed for β-actin cDNA. Amplification was performed at denaturation for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 50 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C for 20 cycles, followed by a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products (10 μl for Oct-2, BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B, or CCR5 and 2 μl for β-actin) were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Transfections and luciferase assays for transient expression assays were performed as described previously (26Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of CCR5 or CXCR4 was determined by staining cells with monoclonal anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 phycoerythrin conjugate or anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 phycoerythrin conjugate (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), respectively, and by analyzing in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry, San Jose, CA), as described previously (27Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Arthos J. Hoxie J. Fauci A.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9664-9771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) were propagated as described previously (27Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Arthos J. Hoxie J. Fauci A.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9664-9771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). rVV expressing Oct-2 (vOct2) was a generous gift of Dr. P. C. van der Vliet (28Verrijzer C.P. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fusion assays were performed as described previously (28Verrijzer C.P. van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, 293T cells were seeded onto 60-mm diameter tissue culture plates, transfected with 10 μg of an Env expression vector plasmid using calcium phosphate method, infected with vCB21R (a rVV encoding thelacZ gene under the control of T7 promoter) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 on the following day, and served as fusion effectors. Primary CD4+ T cells obtained from healthy volunteers were infected with vTF7–3 (a rVV expressing T7 RNA polymerase) along with vWT or vOct2 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 each and served as fusion targets. After a 10-h culture at 37 °C, both fusion effectors (293T cells) and fusion targets (CD4+T cells) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, and the mixed cell culture lysates were subjected to β-galactosidase assays. Since we have recently identified an octamer motif on the CCR5 promoter, we wanted to investigate whether this motif plays a role in CCR5 expression on CD4+ T cells, a target for HIV-1. First, we examined whether T cell activation can induce expression of Oct-2 (a B cell-specific octamer factor) and BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B (a B cell-specific octamer coactivator). As shown in Fig. 1, mRNA specific for Oct-2 and BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR in CD4+ T cells treated with PMA plus ionomycin or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, stimuli mimicking T cell receptor signaling or antigenic stimulation. As previously shown, CCR5 mRNA in activated CD4+ T cells but not that in unstimulated cells was easily detectable under the PCR conditions used (Fig. 1). Thus, these octamer factors may be able to influence expression from octamer motif-bearing promoter (e.g. that for CCR5) in activated CD4+T cells. To investigate whether octamer transcription factors can regulate CCR5 promoter activity, PM1 cells were transfected with pGL-CCR5 WT along with various amounts of an expression vector for Oct-2. As shown in Fig. 2 A, overexpression of Oct-2 up-regulated CCR5 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin synergistically increased Oct-2-mediated transactivation of CCR5 promoter (data not shown). To determine whether an octamer motif on the CCR5 promoter is critical for Oct-2-mediated activation of the promoter, the octamer motif was mutated in plasmid pGL-CCR5 WT, and the construct was tested for its reporter activity. Mutation of the octamer motif had minimal effect on the CCR5 promoter activities induced by either GATA1 (Fig.2 C) or NF-κB p65 (data not shown); however, it almost abolished the promoter activity induced by Oct-2 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the octamer motif plays a crucial role in the Oct-2-induced activity of the CCR5 promoter. The octamer coactivator BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B plays a critical role in octamer-dependent transcriptional activation in B cells and activated T cells (2Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Strubin M.

Science. 1997; 277: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B plays a crucial role in the induction of CCR5 promoter activity, Oct-2 and BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B were expressed in PM1 cells individually or in combination. Either Oct-2 or BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B alone had a minimal effect on the CCR5 promoter activity at the concentration used; however, expression of both factors markedly enhanced the promoter activity (Fig.3). As shown above, octamer transcription factors can up-regulate the CCR5 promoter. To demonstrate whether cell surface expression of CCR5 is also up-regulated by octamer transcription factors, we overexpressed Oct-2 by infecting CD4+ T cells with vOct2 (a rVV expressing Oct-2), and determined cell surface CCR5 expression by flow cytometry. CCR5 expression in CD4+ T cells that were infected with vWT (a wild type rVV) was modest (3%) but was significantly induced (30%) by infection of CD4+ T cells with vOct2 (Fig. 4 A). Thus, overexpression of Oct-2 appears to induce cell surface expression of CCR5. In contrast, overexpression of Oct-2 did not induce cell surface CXCR4 expression (Fig. 4 B). Levels of CCR5 expression appear to correlate well with infectability of CD4+ T cells by R5 HIV-1 (18Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether up-regulation of CCR5 expression by Oct-2 can increase efficiency of fusion/entry of R5 HIV-1. Primary CD4+ T cells (fusion targets) were infected with vWT or vOct2 as well as vTF7–3 (expressing T7 RNA polymerase). 293T cells (fusion effectors) were transfected with a plasmid expressing HIV-1 JR-FL (R5) Env or HIV-1 HXB2 (X4) Env or a plasmid expressing AMLV Env and infected with vCB21R (encoding thelacZ gene under the control of the T7 promoter). Fusion efficiency between the two cells was assayed by β-galactosidase activity in the mixed cell culture lysates. Overexpression of Oct-2 markedly increased fusogenicity of CD4+ T cells with R5 HIV-1 Env (Fig. 5), and pretreatment of the cells with AOP-RANTES (a CCR5 ligand) abolished R5 HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion (data not shown), indicating that CCR5 is required for the Oct-2-mediated effect. Fusogenicity with X4 HIV-1 Env was modestly increased upon overexpression of Oct-2 at a level comparable with that with unrelated AMLV Env (Fig. 5), suggesting that Oct-2 has no effect on CXCR4-mediated cell fusion per se, although it may somehow increase cellular fusogenicity in a nonspecific manner. Thus, the octamer transcription system may play a critical role in R5 HIV-1 infection by up-regulating expression of CCR5. In this study, we have demonstrated that octamer transcription system can up-regulate expression of CCR5 at the promoter level, leading to increased efficiency of R5 HIV-1 entry into CD4+T cells. Levels of CCR5 expression appear to correlate well with infectability of CD4+ T cells by R5 HIV-1 (18Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W.

Furthermore, CCR5 expression in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage appears to increase upon differentiation into a more mature phenotype (34Tuttle D.L. Harrison J.K. Anders C. Sleasman J.W. Goodenow M.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4962-4969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the promoter level, several transcription factors have been demonstrated to regulate CCR5 expression, including p65 (RelA) (35Liu R. Zhao X. Gurney T.A. Landau N.R. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and GATA-1 (36Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Fauci A.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1433-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study has extended our understanding of molecular mechanism of regulation of CCR5 promoter activity by demonstrating that Oct-2 and BOB.1/OBF/OCA-B, both of which are induced by antigenic stimulation of T cells (6Kang S.M Tsang W.

Science. 1997; 277: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), synergistically transactivate the CCR5 promoter. Antigenic stimulation has been associated with increased viral load in HIV-infected individuals (37Fauci A.S. Nature. 1996; 384: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 38Wahl S.M. Orenstein J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated that most HIV-1 strains isolated from patients who were stimulated with tetanus toxoid, a common recall antigen, were R5 (39Ostrowski M.A. Krakauer D.C. Li Y. Justement S.J. Learn G. Ehler L.A. Stanley S.K. Nowak M. Fauci A.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7772-7784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that antigenic stimulation may provide a favorable environment for replication of R5 HIV-1. Therefore, one mechanism that renders antigenically stimulated CD4+ T cells highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection is probably up-regulation of CCR5 expression by the octamer transcription system. Further investigation to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate expression of HIV coreceptors is warranted. We thank Anthony S.

Tyrosine- or dileucine-based motifs have been reported to bind to medium chain subunits (μ) of AP-1, AP-2, or AP-3. In the present study, we have examined the interaction of the entire 67-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR46-CT) containing tyrosine- as well as dileucine-based motifs with μ2 and μ3A chains using the yeast two-hybrid system. Both μ2 and μ3A bind specifically to the MPR46-CT. In contrast, μ3A fails to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Mutational analysis of the MPR46-CT revealed that the tyrosine-based motif and distal sequences rich in acidic amino acid residues are sufficient for effective binding to μ2. However, the dileucine motif was found to be one part of a consecutive complex C-terminal structure comprising tyrosine and dileucine motifs as well as clusters of acidic residues necessary for efficient binding of μ3A. Alanine substitution of 2 or 4 acidic amino acid residues of this cluster reduces the binding to μ3A much more than to μ2. The data suggest that the MPR46 is capable of interacting with different AP complexes using multiple partially overlapping sorting signals, which might depend on posttranslational modifications or subcellular localization of the receptor.

The data suggest that the MPR46 is capable of interacting with different AP complexes using multiple partially overlapping sorting signals, which might depend on posttranslational modifications or subcellular localization of the receptor. mannose 6-phosphate receptor with molecular mass of 46 kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor mannose 6-phosphate receptor with molecular mass of 300 kDa cytoplasmic tail DNA binding domain activation domain glutathioneS-transferase trans-Golgi network adaptor protein complex medium chain of AP-2 medium chain of AP-3 phosphate-buffered saline The 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR46)1 mediates the transport of newly synthesized soluble lysosomal enzymes from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal-prelysosomal compartment. Following the pH-induced dissociation of the complexes, the MPR either return to the TGN or undergo cycling via the plasma membrane (1Braulke T. Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Subcellular Biochemistry: Biology of the Lysosome. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-49Google Scholar). Targeting information contained within the 67-residue cytoplasmic domain of this type I integral membrane glycoprotein is responsible for the directed intracellular transport of MPR46 between TGN, endosomes, and the plasma membrane as well as for retention from lysosomal delivery. Mutational analyses have identified several signals including a tyrosine (Tyr45-Arg-Gly-Val48) and dileucine-based motif (Leu64-Leu65), and two aromatic residues (Phe13 and Phe18) required for efficient sorting in the TGN or rapid internalization at the plasma membrane (2Johnson K.F.

Additionally, the di-aromatic Phe18-Trp19 motif and the phosphorylation of Ser57 have been reported to be important for endosomal sorting (5Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Finally, Cys34 has been shown to be a reversible palmitoylated residue that might anchor the tail to the lipid layer and form a cytoplasmic loop (7Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both the intact palmitoylation site and the correct length of the loop are critical to prevent targeting of MPR46 to degrading compartments (7Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J.

The signal structures in the cytoplasmic tail of the MPR46 form selective recognition sites for cytosolic proteins facilitating the incorporation of the receptors into transport vesicles. The best studied class of these cytosolic proteins comprises the family of adaptor proteins (AP; Ref. 9Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). AP-1 and AP-2 are heterotetramers comprising two large ∼100-kDa chains (β1 and γ-adaptin for AP-1; β2 and α-adaptin for AP-2), a medium subunit of ∼50 kDa (μ1 and μ2) and a small polypeptide of ∼20 kDa (ς1 and ς2). AP-1 is involved in protein sorting at the TGN, whereas AP-2 mediates endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Recently, heterotetrameric AP-3 and AP-4 complexes have been identified (10Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S.

The AP-3 complex containing a μ3A isoform is ubiquitously expressed, whereas μ3B is a component of the neuronal-specific AP-3 variant. Biosensor analysis has demonstrated the presence of several distinct binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2 in the cytoplasmic tail of the MPR46, which do not depend on dileucine signals (12Höning S.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, μ1, μ2, and μ3 chains have been demonstrated to interact with triple repeat sequences of tyrosine-containing sorting signals of several integral membrane proteins (13Ohno H.

However, the composition of residues surrounding the tyrosine residue and the position of the tyrosine motif within the tail relative to the membrane appear to be important in determining μ chain specificity (13Ohno H.

In the present study we have examined the interaction of the entire cytoplasmic tail of the MPR46 (MPR46-CT) and various tail mutants with μ2 and μ3A using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results have revealed that both μ2 and μ3A bind to the MPR46-CT. The interactions are specific and depend on the presence of a complex configuration of different signals comprising not only the tyrosine and dileucine motif but also acidic amino acid residues localized between these motifs.

Truncations of the MPR46-CT were generated by PCR introducing TGA stop codons at the respective sites using the following oligonucleotide primers: MPR46-CT-StopH63, ST63-F (5′-CGGGATCCCGCAGCGACTGGTAGTGGGA-3′) and ST63-R (5′-CGGGATCCCGTCAATGGTCATCCCTTTCTT-3′); MPR46- CTStopV48, ST63-F and ST48-R (5′-CGGGATCCCGTCACACACCACGATATGCTGC-3′); MPR46-CT StopA44, ST63-F and ST44-R (5′-CGGGATCCCGTCATGCTGCAGGCACATTTCG-3′); MPR46-CT Δ1–16, ST1–16-F (5′-CGGGATCCCGGCCTTCTGGCAGGATCTT-3′) and ST1–16-R (5′-CGGGATCCCGCTACATTGGTAATAAATG-3′). The polymerase chain products were cloned in frame with the Gal4-DBD into theBam HI site of pAS2. Point mutations were generated by means of the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following oligonucleotide probes: MPR46-CT-E55A/E56A, E55-F (5′-GATGACCAGCTGGGGGCGGCGTCAGAAGAAAGGGAT-3′) and E55-R (5′-CATCCCTTTCTTCTGACGCCGCCCCCAGCTGGTCATC-3′). The following mutations, MPR46-CT-E55A/E56A/E58A/E59A and MPR46-CT-E55A/E56A/E58A/E59A/D61A/D62A, were introduced successively using the mutagenized MPR46-CT-cDNA as a template with primers: MPR46-CT-E55A/E56A/E58A/E59A, E58-F (5′-GGGGAGGAGTCAGCAGCAAGGGATGACCAT-3′) and E58-R (5′-ATGGTCATCCCTTGCTGCTGACTCCTCCCC-3′); MPR46-CT-E55A/E56A/E58A/E59A/D61A/D62A, D61-F (5′-TCAGCAGCAAGGGCTGCCCATTTATTACCA-3′) and D61-R (5′-TGGTAATAAATGGGCAGCCCTTGCTGCTGA-3′). The mutation MPR46-CT-Y45A/V48A was introduced using the wild type MPR46-CT cDNA as template with primers Y45-F (5′-GTGCCTGCAGCAGCTCGTGGTGCGGGGGATGACCAG-3′) and Y45-R (5′-CTGGTCATCCCCCGCACCACGAGCTGCTGCAGGCAC-3′). For the MPR46-CT-StopH63-Y45A/V48A mutation, the MPR46-CT-StopH63 cDNA was used as template with primers Y45-F and Y45-R. All mutations were verified by sequencing the final products. The full coding regions of μ2 and μ3A were amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: μ2-F (5′-GAAGATCTTCATGATCGGAGGCTTATTCAT-3′) and μ2-R (5′−GAAGATCTTCCTAGCAGCGGGTTTCATAAA-3′), μ3A-F (5′−GGAATTCATGATCCACAGTCTATTTC-3′) and μ3A-R (5′−CGGGATCCCGTCATGTCCTCACTTGGAA-3′). The μ2 and μ3A PCR products were digested with Bgl II andEco RI/Bam HI, respectively, and cloned in frame with the Gal4AD into the corresponding restriction sites of the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD424. The yeast reporter strain HF7c was cotransformed with wild type and mutant pAS2-MPR46-CT or pAS2-MPR300-CT-constructs and the pGAD424-μ2 and -μ3A constructs, respectively, using a lithium acetate-base method. To examine specificity of the interaction, HF7c cells were cotransformed with the plasmids pAS2 (Gal4DBD alone) and pAS2 lamin and the pGAD424-μ2 and -μ3A constructs. The double transformants were grown on SD agar medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His (+ 5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, Sigma) for 5 days at 30 °C before positive colonies were picked, restreaked onto triple minus plates, and assayed for the lacZ phenotype. GST fusion constructs were made by ligation of wild type MPR46-CT-cDNA into the Eco RI- and Sal I- restriction sites of the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Europe). The MPR300-CT-cDNA (amino acids 1–164) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using PfuTurbo™ DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with primers MPR300CT-F (5′-GGAATTCCGCAAGAAGAAGAGGAGGGAAACAGTG-3′) and MPR300CT-R (5′-GGAATTCCTCAGATGTGTAAGAGGTC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into the Eco RI site of pGEX-4T-1. For GST-MPR46-CT fusion protein expression, E. coli BL-21 cells were transformed with the pGEX-4T-1-MPR46-CT construct and grown to anA 600 of 0.6 followed by induction of GST fusion protein expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 4 h of additional growth at 37 °C, E. coli BL-21 cells were pelleted and lysed by sonification in 10 mmphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 25% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml (50% v/v) glutathione-agarose (Sigma), equilibrated in PBS, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with 20 bead volumes of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 15 mm reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight against PBS and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. For MPR300-CT fusion protein expression, E. coli BL21 cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.1 and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C (19Orsel J.G. Sincock P.M. Krise J.P. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9047-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Lysis of E. coli BL21 cells, affinity purification, and elution of MPR300-CT fusion proteins were carried out as described above. The μ2 and μ3A cDNA was subcloned into Bg/II restriction site of the pSPUTK vector. The pSP64-luciferase construct was obtained fromPromega. In vitro translation was carried out by using the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of 40 μCi of [35S]methionine in a final volume of 50 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. 35S-Labeled,in vitro translated products were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble materials. The GST-MPR46-CT and GST-MPR300-CT fusion proteins (25 μg) were incubated with the35S-labeled μ2, μ3A, or luciferase translation product (5 μl) at 4 °C for 2 h in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) followed by the addition of 50 μl (50% v/v) glutathione-agarose in binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. The bound proteins were extracted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide), and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji Photo Co., Japan). Reporter yeast cells were first transformed with a plasmid encoding a fusion protein between the wild type MPR46-CT or MPR300-CT and the Gal4 DNA binding domain (pAS2-MPR46/300-CT). The strain was subsequently transformed with a plasmid encoding the μ2 or μ3A adaptor subunit fused to the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 (pGAD424-μ2 or -μ3A). After an incubation period of 5 days in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (5 mm), the cells expressing the MPR46-CT fusion protein with either μ2 or μ3A exhibited a strong growth in a medium lacking histidine, and positive galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). The MPR300-CT failed to interact both with μ2 and μ3A. To confirm the results obtained with the two-hybrid system, the interaction of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled μ2 and μ3A with MPR46-CT and MPR300-CT expressed and purified as GST fusion protein was examined. Densitometric evaluation of the coprecipitated μ2 subunit and correction by unspecific binding to GST alone revealed that about 4.3% of total μ2 was specifically recovered on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 2 A). About 17% of the total μ3A was coprecipitated with the MPR46-CT fusion protein, whereas the in vitro translated [35S]methionine labeled luciferase used as a control was not. In coprecipitation experiments with the MPR300-CT fusion protein, 4.2% of total μ2 but almost no μ3A (1%) was recovered (Fig.2 B). To define the specificity and the site responsible for the interaction with μ2 in more detail, several plasmids encoding mutant forms of MPR46-CT (Fig. 3) and control constructs were cotransformed with the pGAD424-μ2-plasmid. The N-terminal deleted MPR46-CT Δ1–16 and the C-terminal truncated MPR46-CT-StopH63, which lacks the dileucine motif, caused growth on histidine-free medium and activation of the lacZ reporter gene similar to the wild type MPR46-CT (Fig. 3; TableI). Further C-terminal truncation resulting in cytoplasmic domains still containing the tyrosine-based signal (MPR46-CT-StopV48) or lacking both the dileucine and tyrosine motives (MPR46-CT-StopA44) reduced the interaction to 25 and 4%, respectively, of wild type MPR46-CT. The replacement of Tyr45 and Val48 by alanine in the entire cytoplasmic tail (MPR46-CT-Y45A/V48A) decreased β-galactosidase activity to 75% of the wild type tail. When these two residues were replaced in addition to the deletion of the dileucine motif (MPR46-CT-StopH63-Y45A/V48A), the β-galactosidase activity was reduced to 60% of the wild type tail. The inability of cells cotransformed with Gal4-binding domain alone, lamin C, and μ2, to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 3) or to activate β-galactosidase (Table I) confirmed the specificity in the interaction between MPR46-CT and μ2. The lack of β-galactosidase activity in cells coexpressing the wild type MPR300-CT fusion protein and μ2 corresponded to the failure to grow on histidine-free medium (Fig. 1).Table IInteraction between pGAD424-μ2 and various pAS2-Gal4 DBD fusions determined by a liquid quantitative β-galactosidase assayDNA-binding domainActivation domainβ-Galactosidase activity1-aData are means ± S.D. of three independent transformants in duplicate.Miller unitsMPR46-CT wild type1-bSingle plasmid transformation.0.4 ± 0.1μ21-bSingle plasmid transformation.0.5 ± 0.1MPR46-CT wild typeμ217.6 ± 1.0MPR46-CT Δ1–16μ220.7 ± 2.4MPR46-CT StH63μ216.6 ± 1.0MPR46-CT StV48μ24.4 ± 0.6MPR46-CT StA44μ20.7 ± 0.2MPR46-CT Y45A/V48Aμ213.0 ± 0.5MPR46-CT StH63μ210.4 ± 2.2Y45A/V48ALamin Cμ20.5 ± 0.0Gal4μ20.3 ± 0.1MPR300-CT wild typeμ20.5 ± 0.01-a Data are means ± S.D. of three independent transformants in duplicate.1-b Single plasmid transformation. Open table in a new tab When the various MPR46-CT mutants were coexpressed with μ3A in SFY 526 cells, quantification of the interaction measured by lacZ reporter gene activity revealed that the deletion of the dileucine motif (MPR46-CT StopH63) reduced β-galactosidase activity by 42% (Fig.4). The MPR46-CT StopV48 and StopA44 mutants as well as the alanine substitution (Y45A/V48A) in the entire or in the truncated receptor tail (StopH63-Y45A/V48A) interacted weakly with μ3A (10–27% of β-galactosidase activity of the wild type MPR46-CT). The N-terminal deleted mutant MPR46-CT Δ1–16 activated β-galactosidase similarly to the wild type tail. In control cells coexpressing lamin C, no interaction with μ3A was observed (Fig.4). To determine whether the cluster of acidic amino acids (residues 50–62) is responsible for the reduced binding of mutant MPR46-CT StopV48 to μ2 and μ3A in comparison with the StopH63 mutant as well as for residual adaptor subunit binding in the StopH63-Y45A/V48A mutant, substitutions of acidic residues in the context of the entire tail were tested (Fig.5). The coexpression of the mutant MPR46-CT containing double substitution of Glu55, Glu56, and the quadruple substitution of Glu55, Glu56, Glu58, and Glu59 by alanine with μ2 reduced β-galactosidase activity by 22 and 31%, respectively (Fig. 5 C). These mutations impaired the interaction with μ3A more strongly (20 and 18% of β-galactosidase activity of the wild type MPR46-CT). The substitution of Glu55, Glu56, Glu58, Glu59, Asp61, and Asp62 by alanine reduced the interaction both with μ2 and μ3A to 26 and 5%, respectively, of wild type MPR46-CT. Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system have established that tyrosine-based sorting signals in cytoplasmic domains of membrane receptors are important for the interaction with μ1, μ2, and μ3 subunits of adaptor complexes AP-1, -2, and-3, respectively (10Dell'Angelica E.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the full-length cytoplasmic tail of the MPR46 containing several independent signal structures including tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs (residues 45–48 and residues 64 and 65, respectively), aromatic residues (residues 13, 18, and 19), and clusters of acidic amino acids (residues 50–62) for its capability to interact with medium chains of AP-2 and AP-3 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report that the tyrosine motif and a distal cluster of acidic amino acid residues but not the dileucine signal within the MPR46 tail are sufficient for effective binding to μ2. In contrast, the interaction of the receptor tail with μ3A depends on a complex C-terminal structure comprising tyrosine and dileucine motifs as well as a strong hydrophilic sequence. The phenylalanine residues 13 and 18 as well as the tyrosine-based motif 45YRGV48 have been shown to mediate the internalization of the MPR46 from the cell surface (3Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whereas the former signal overlaps with the specific endosomal sorting signal18FW19, the tyrosine motif has the characteristics of the consensus motif YXXφ (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) which can be found within the cytoplasmic domains of many endocytic transmembrane proteins recognizing μ2 (13Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar,20Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recently, crystallization studies of μ2 complexed with tyrosine-containing internalization signal peptides have revealed that the peptides are bound to an extended conformation with separate pockets for both Y and φ residues (21Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consistent with the prediction that the dileucine signals, which are characteristically surrounded by polar and/or charged residues, will not be able to bind to the hydrophobic pocket structure of μ2 (21Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), the dileucine signals of CD 3γ have been proposed to interact with β2 adaptor subunits (16Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, surface plasmon resonance data have demonstrated the binding of dileucine-based sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail of the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain to the μ2 chain of AP-2 (18Oshima A. Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the dileucine motif of the MPR46 tail is not critical for the interaction with μ2 in agreement with studies testing the binding of AP-2 to MPR46 tail peptides (15Hofmann M.W. Höning S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present data with C-terminal truncated MPR46 tails or with substitution of Tyr45 and Val48 by alanine in the context of the entire tail showed that, in addition to the tyrosine motif, a second signal in the stretch of amino acids 49–63 is required for efficient μ2 binding. Indeed, this study demonstrates that the substitution of six acidic residues within the compact cluster of acidic amino acids in this region (50DDQLGEESEERDD 62) prevents the interaction with μ2. The positive electrostatic surface potential near the YXXφ binding site of μ2 (21Owen D.J. Evans P.R.

Additionally, the acidic residues may also be important in vivo for the binding of the MPR46-CT to μ2 because these amino acids are part of a casein kinase-2 phosphorylation site at Ser57 (23Körner C. Herzog A. Weber B. Rosorius O. Hemer F. Schmidt B. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16529-16532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the nonphosphorylated MPR46 are not cycled via the plasma membrane (6Breuer P. Körner C. Böker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these receptors should fail to interact with AP2. Both a tyrosine-based motif and a cluster of acidic residues have also been reported to function as independent signals within the cytoplasmic tail of furin to mediate TGN localization and internalization from the cell surface (24Schäfer W.

Residues 2–16 of the MPR46 tail, which have been reported to affect AP-2 binding (12Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are not important for MPR46 tail binding to the μ2 chain, suggesting that these juxtamembrane residues may be involved in the binding of other AP-2 subunits. In contrast to the coprecipitation of μ2 with the MPR300-CT, this interaction could not be demonstrated in the two-hybrid assay. The reason for these discrepancies is unclear. AP-3 has been shown to be involved in a clathrin-independent transport of membrane proteins to lysosomes in mammalian cells or to the vacuole in yeast, and to lysosome-related storage granules arising from the endocytic pathway like melanosomes in melanocytes, synaptic vesicles in neurons, as well as synaptic-like microvesicles in neuroendocrine cells (26Cowles C.R.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, tyrosine-based sorting motifs YXXφ of LAMP I and CD63 have been shown to interact with μ3A and μ3B chains (10Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E.

Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 28Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K.

Interestingly, we show for the first time the requirement for multiple C-terminal motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of the MPR46 comprising tyrosine- and dileucine-based signals, and clustered acidic amino acid residues to interact efficiently with μ3A. Quantification of μ3A interactions with various MPR46 tails by measurement of lacZ reporter gene activities revealed that the different signals were not additive but appeared to function in a cooperative manner. In addition, the data showed that the acidic residues Glu55, Glu56, Glu58, and Glu59 are more critical for efficient binding to μ3A than to μ2. At least two signals located in the cytoplasmic tail of LIMP II, tyrosinase and synaptotagmin, have also been reported to be critical for correct intracellular sorting (28Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hewitt E.W. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol.

It is likely that the structural distance between the tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs and the acidic cluster in the cytoplasmic tail of MPR300 as well as their position with respect to the membrane (33Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 34Ohno H. Fournier M.-C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) compared with the MPR46 tail may be responsible for the failure of the MPR300 tail to bind to μ3A. Our present data are in contradiction to studies in which the MPR46 tail peptide immobilized on a sensor surface fails to bind AP-3 complexes (28Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, similar discrepancies have been reported for the μ3A/AP-3 binding to the LAMP I tail (27Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 28Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The different results obtained with our two-hybrid approach and with the plasmon resonance technique using the MPR46 tail (28Höning S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) might be explained by the usage of μ3A compared with purified AP-3 complexes from brain cytosol containing μ3B. Another possibility might be the formation of receptor tail dimers in the two-hybrid system resembling prevalent dimeric MPR46 forms present in membranes (35Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which might facilitate the binding of μ3A dimers. The physiological significance of MPR46 binding to μ3A, which preferentially interacts with lysosomal membrane proteins, is unclear. However, substitution of Cys34 or deletion of amino acid residues 20–23 or 24–29 as well as of the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail interfere with endosomal sorting processes (7Schweizer A.

The protein showed a preference toward DNA containing two Escherichia coli-like DnaA boxes in a head-to-head arrangement (consensus sequence TTATCCACA, whereas the consensus sequence of the DnaA boxes found in theStreptomyces oriC region is TTGTCCACA). In quantitative band shift experiments, the kinetics of the StreptomycesDnaA-DnaA box interaction was characterized. The DnaA protein can form dimers while binding to a single DnaA box; dimer formation is mediated by the domain III of the protein, and the dissociation constant of this process was between 35 and 115 nm. Streptomycesinitiator protein DnaA interacts in a cooperative manner with DNA containing multiple binding sites. For the cooperativity effect, which seems to be independent of the distance separating the DnaA boxes, domain I (or I and II) is responsible.

The interaction of DnaA protein with its chromosomal origin (oriC) is best understood in Escherichia coli. The E. coli DnaA protein (52 kDa) binds to five nonpalindromic, nonamer sequences, the DnaA boxes. Binding of 10–20 DnaA monomers promotes a local unwinding of an adjacent AT-rich region. The unwound region provides an entry site for the DnaB/DnaC helicase complex followed by other proteins required to form a replication fork (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H.

Apart from its primary function as a replisome organizer, the DnaA protein acts as a transcription factor that represses or activates several genes or terminates transcription, depending on the location and arrangement of DnaA boxes (5Messer W. Weigel C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both functions of the DnaA protein, replisome organizer and transcription factor, are mediated by its interaction with target DNA. The DNA binding domain of E. coli DnaA has been localized in the 94 C-terminal amino acids. A potential helix-loop-helix motif has been reported within this part of the protein (6Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, because x-ray high resolution structure analysis is not yet available for DnaA proteins, the detailed interaction with the DNA is still poorly understood. The consensus sequence of the E. coli DnaA box differs depending on the method used for its evaluation. The most stringent definition for the DnaA box sequence comes from a determination of binding constants: 5′-TT(A/T)TNCACA-3′ (7Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). T2, T4, T7′, and T9′were found to be directly involved in DNA-protein interaction (8Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).E. coli DnaA does not dimerize in solution and interacts with a single DnaA box as a monomer, as measured by gel retardation (7Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and by surface plasmon resonance (9Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, binding to DnaA boxes that differ from the stringent consensus sequence by one or two base pairs requires two such boxes and an interaction of DnaA proteins bound to them (9Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). DnaA binds ATP and ADP with high affinity. Both forms of DnaA protein, ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA, recognize DNA in a similar fashion; however, only ATP-DnaA is active in the DNA replication process. Recently, it has been shown that E. coli ATP-DnaA protein recognizes also a hexamer sequence, the ATP-DnaA box 5′-AGATCT-3′ or close match of it (9Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Streptomycetes (Gram-positive soil bacteria) differ from other prokaryotic organisms in their mycelial life cycle and in possessing a large (8-megabase pair), linear and GC-rich (about 72%) chromosome (10Kutzner H.J. Starr M.P. Stolp H. Trüper H.G. Balows A. Schlegel H.G. The Prokaryotes. Springer, Berlin1981: 2028-2090Google Scholar, 11Lin Y.S. Kieser H.M. Hopwood D.A. Chen C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent discoveries suggest that replication of the linear chromosome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) proceeds bidirectionally from the centrally located oriC region toward the ends of the chromosome (12Musialowski M.S. Flett F. Scott G.B. Hobbs G. Smith C.P. Oliver S.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5123-5125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The key elements of initiation of the Streptomyceschromosome replication, oriC region and DnaA protein, show higher complexity than those of E. coli. TheStreptomyces oriC region contains numerous DnaA boxes, which are grouped into two clusters (13Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Schrempf H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2688-2693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jakimowicz D. Majka J. Messer W. Speck C. Fernandez M. Martin M.C. Sanchez J. Schauwecker F. Keller U. Schrempf H. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The StreptomycesDnaA protein consists, like all other DnaA proteins, of four domains. In contrast to the other bacteria, the Streptomyces DnaA protein is larger (70–73 kDa), since it comprises an additional stretch (∼230 amino acids) of predominantly acidic or hydrophobic amino acids within domain II. The residues lower the isoelectric point of the entire Streptomyces DnaA protein (pI = 5.7) (15Majka J. Messer W. Schrempf H. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Majka J. Jakimowicz D. Messer W. Schrempf H. Lisowski M. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As it was shown for the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis DnaA proteins, domain III and the C-terminal part (domain IV) of the Streptomyces DnaA protein are responsible for binding of ATP and DNA, respectively (15Majka J. Messer W. Schrempf H. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Majka J. Characterization of the Streptomyces lividans initiator protein DnaA, Ph.D. thesis. Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland1997Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of the Streptomyces DnaA box in oriC is 5′-TTGTCCACA-3′, which differs at the third position (A′G) from theE. coli DnaA box (13Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Schrempf H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2688-2693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli, the Streptomyces DnaA protein can form a dimer when binding to a single DnaA box. Recently, it has been shown that the domains I and III are independently involved in dimerization of theStreptomyces lividans DnaA protein molecules. The interaction of Streptomyces DnaA protein with two DnaA boxes is cooperative and accompanied by strong DNA bending (16Majka J. Jakimowicz D. Messer W. Schrempf H. Lisowski M.

J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we do not know the contribution of the different domains of theStreptomyces DnaA protein to cooperative binding. In this work, we apply a combined PCR-EMSA1 technique (19Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) to elucidate DNA sequence requirements for Streptomyces DnaA protein binding. Using EMSA, we define details of the binding of theStreptomyces wild type DnaA and its truncated forms to DNA. We reveal that the domain I participates in cooperative DnaA protein-DNA interactions. Quantitative analysis of gel mobility shifts allowed us to determine binding constants for dimerization and cooperative DNA protein interactions. In addition, we have varied the spacing between two DnaA boxes and examined the consequences on dimerization and cooperative binding of DnaA protein to these boxes. The His-tagged wild type DnaA proteins ofS. lividans and its truncated mutants DnaA(III-IV) comprising the domain III and the DNA binding domain were purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) as described earlier (15Majka J. Messer W. Schrempf H. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of the DnaA protein DnaA(BD) was expressed as a C-terminal glutathioneS-transferase fusion and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by factor Xa cleavage as described earlier (16Majka J. Jakimowicz D. Messer W. Schrempf H. Lisowski M. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. For the kinetic analysis of DnaA protein binding complementary nucleotides were annealed by heating at 95 °C for 10 min and gradually cooling to room temperature. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified from 5%nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The recognition motif of the DnaA protein was determined using several cycles of amplification and selection, essentially as described previously (19Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The library of 58-bp oligonucleotides for the first selection cycle was prepared by PCR using template oligonucleotides: 5′-GGCGGATCCTCGACTAGCGN20GCTACGAGCTGAGCTCGCG-3′ and the primer pair 5′-GGCGGATCCTCGACTAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGAGTCTAGCTCGTAGC-3′ (restriction sitesBamHI and SacI are in italic type). The amplification reaction was carried out in 100 μl using 1 pmol of template oligonucleotide (1 pmol corresponds to the number of all possible combinations of 20 degenerated bases) and 100 pmol of each primer for 20 cycles, with each cycle consisting of 15 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were separated on 3%agarose gels, electroeluted for 1 h to TBE buffer, and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and glycogen-ethanol precipitation. The oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then incubated with DnaA protein in concentrations of 5 or 50 nm in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2%Triton X-100, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm ATP) The reaction was carried out in 20 μl for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of competitor, poly(dI-dC), at a concentration of 2.5 μg/μl. The complexes were separated on 5%nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE. The bands corresponding to DNA-protein complexes were excised, and the DNA was eluted into gel elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 3 h at 60 °C and recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by glycogen-ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then amplified by PCR at conditions described above and subjected to five additional selection cycles of binding and amplification. The subsequent cycles differed only in the amount of competitor added to binding reactions (for cycles 2–6, we used 5, 7.5, 20, 50, and 100 μg/μl, respectively). Selected oligonucleotides after the fourth, fifth, and sixth round were digested with BamHI and SacI and cloned into a pUC19 vector. The DNA from independent clones was recovered using a Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to sequencing using32P-5′-end-labeled “−47” primer (New England Biolabs) and the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For binding assays, 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA (TableI; ≤0.01 nm) was incubated with different amounts of the DnaA proteins (concentration range indicated in the legend to Fig. 2) in the presence of a competitor (poly(dI-dC), 10 ng/μl) at 20 °C for 30 min in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2%Triton X-100, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm ATP). The free DNA and complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5%native polyacrylamide gels, prerun for 1 h (0.25× TBE, 6 V/cm, 20 °C). Following electrophoresis, the radioactive gel was dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The variation in experimental data was evaluated by repeating each experiment three or four times. Different protein titration experiments showed variations up to 15%. Equilibrium constants were determined using the modified statistical mechanical model (20Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with the protein dimerization module. For the DNA substrate containing a single binding site A, the concentration of each species in the gel was expressed by the following equations (model 1),Table IOligonucleotides used in the gel retardation experimentsThe black arrow shows the strong Streptomyces DnaA box; the white arrow shows the E. coli DnaA box R1/R4; the grey arrow shows the box2 found by the in vitro DNA binding sites selection assay; and the crossed out arrow shows the scrambled DnaA box.

For the DNA containing binding sites A and B, the concentrations of the species presented in the gel are described by the following equations (model 2), S=1/Z2Equation 5 SL=(kA+kB)L/Z2Equation 6 SL2=(kDi[kA+kB]+kAkBkAB)L2/Z2Equation 7 Z2=1+(kA+kB)L+(kDi(kA+kB)+kAkBkAB)L2Equation 8 where kB is the intrinsic affinity constant for the binding site B, and kAB is the cooperativity constant describing interaction of protein molecules occupying both binding sites. Experimental data were simultaneously fitted to the equations using Scientist® for WindowsTM software (MicroMath). The consensus sequence of the DnaA box identified within theStreptomyces oriC region is 5′-TTGTCCACA-3′. TheStreptomyces oriC region contains a higher number of the DnaA boxes (19 boxes) than the E. coli oriC region (five boxes). A DNase I footprint of the oriC region with DnaA showed protection of all boxes. However, when analyzed individually by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), only some DnaA boxes were specifically recognized by the DnaA protein (14Jakimowicz D. Majka J. Messer W. Speck C. Fernandez M.

Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2426-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize in detail the recognition properties of the Streptomyces DnaA protein, we applied a binding site selection technique based on the combined EMSA and polymerase chain reactions (Fig.1 A; Ref. 19Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The purified DnaA protein was incubated with a substrate pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides, in which a random 20-bp region was flanked by defined 19-bp sequences containing restriction sites to facilitate subsequent cloning. The protein-DNA complexes were separated from the unbound DNA on a 5%polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel. Only one protein-bound fraction was visible. The DNA recovered from the complex was amplified by PCR with the pair of primers complementary to the defined sequences of the oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B) and used as a substrate for the renewed binding assay. In the third selection cycle, we observed a second retarded band with a higher electrophoretic mobility than the previous one.

The sequences selected from the “dimer” band after four rounds reveal remarkable features: 63 out of the 67 oligonucleotides analyzed carry two DnaA boxes, one complete 9-bp DnaA box, the “box 1,” and one incomplete DnaA box, the “box 2” (“box” as defined by sequence). The incomplete box 2 consists of 4–7 bp (3′-part of the DnaA box). Both boxes face each other and are adjacent (except for a few oligonucleotides). 80%of the boxes 1 exhibit the E. coli type of DnaA box (T or A at the third position), and only 20%of them exhibit the Streptomyces type (G at the third position). During the next two rounds, the selection progressively narrowed the spectrum of observed oligonucleotide sequences; after six rounds the box 1 is exclusively represented by the E. coliDnaA box R1/R4 (5′-TTATCCACA-3′), and the partial box 2 contains in nearly all cases the essential T nucleotides at the 7′- and 9′-positions. More than half of the oligonucleotides selected from the monomer band after four rounds contained also two boxes. However, the monomer band had only appeared after the third round of the selection (Fig.1 C), and therefore it still contained traces of the oligonucleotides from the dimer band that were subsequently amplified. After the next two selection rounds, only one out of the 44 oligonucleotides contained two boxes. All of the boxes 1 from the monomer band exhibit the E. coli type DnaA box (R1/R4). The data show that under the conditions of the assay, theStreptomyces DnaA protein interacts only with DnaA boxes; no other consensus sequences (e.g. the newly identified 6-bp ATP-DnaA box (9Speck C. Weigel C. Messer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6169-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) have been found. The results, presented in Tables IIand III, show that DnaA protein from Streptomyces possesses a higher affinity toward DnaA boxes from E. coli than toward those from its own oriC region. Binding of the DnaA protein as a dimer apparently requires “head-to-head” orientation of the boxes. Upstream of the promoter region of the Streptomyces dnaA gene are two closely spaced DnaA boxes: a strong one (with the preferredStreptomyces sequence: 5′-TTGTCCACA-3′) and a weak one (5′-TTGTCCCCA-3′) in head-to-head arrangement with 3 bp in between (21Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Nardmann J. Schrempf H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interaction of the DnaA protein with these boxes creates an autoregulatory circuit similar to that known for the E. coli dnaA gene (21Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Nardmann J. Schrempf H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that binding of the DnaA protein to both DnaA boxes exhibits a cooperative character (16Majka J. Jakimowicz D. Messer W. Schrempf H. Lisowski M. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Domains I and III independently participate in the dimerization of the DnaA protein molecules (18Jakimowicz D. Majka J. Konopa G. Wgrzyn G. Messer W. Schrempf H. Zakrzewska-Czerwiñska J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To evaluate in detail the kinetics of binding of the DnaA protein to DnaA boxes from the dnaA gene promoter region, we applied gel mobility shift assays to determine the binding constants for cooperativity as well as for dimerization (20Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay permits the quantitative analysis of the individual protein-DNA complexes. In our gel retardation experiments, we used the wild-type DnaA protein and its truncated forms, the DnaA(III-IV) lacking the two N-terminal domains (I and II) and the DnaA(BD) containing only the DNA binding domain IV. As a prerequisite for the kinetic studies, two DNA substrates containing either a single strong DnaA box, 1s-0 (the weak DnaA box was scrambled), or two DnaA boxes, 2s , derived from the promoter region of the dnaA gene were designed in such a way that the DnaA box(es) i"

Some mutations occur in splicing sites and result in transcripts encoding wild-type and mutant proteins. These mutants lack the tumor necrosis factor homologous (TNFH) domain and consequently fail to trimerize. Given that the TNFH domain is responsible for trimerization, one may predict that the TNFH mutant can not participate in the assembly of wild-type CD154. Thus, it was puzzling why these patients exhibit XHIM phenotype, presumably resulting from a lack of functional CD154. One possibility is that the TNFH mutant exhibits a dominant negative effect over the wild-type protein. To investigate this, we coexpressed the wild-type protein and a TNFH mutant and examined the biochemical and functional properties of the resulting CD154 products. We demonstrate that despite the lack of the TNFH domain, the TNFH mutant can associate with the wild-type protein. Furthermore, such an association compromises the ability of the wild-type protein to mature onto the cell surface. These results provide a mechanism for the defect of CD154 in XHIM patients producing both wild-type and TNFH variants and suggest that besides the TNFH domain, the stalk region participates in the assembly of CD154 trimers.

The interaction of CD154 with its receptor, CD40, is critical for the functions of T helper cells to induce differentiation, proliferation, and Ig isotype switching in B cells (for review see Refs. 1Foy T.M.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). The CD154 gene, located at Xq2.6–2.7, spans over 12 kilobase pairs and consists of five exons (3Villa A. Notarangelo L.D.

The second and third exons encode the extracellular stalk region. The fourth and fifth exons encode the C-terminal 147 amino acids (3Villa A. Notarangelo L.D. Santo J.P.D. Macchi P.P. Strina D.

The x-ray structure of the CD154 TNFH domain reveals that it contains a sandwich-like fold of two β sheets with jellyroll or Greek key topology and forms a trimer similar to that seen in TNF and lymphotoxin-α (4Karpusas M.

Given the facts that for CD154, the TNFH domain alone is capable of forming trimers (4Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D.

Mutations in the CD154 gene can prevent the expression of functional CD154 protein, which lead to an immunodeficiency characterized by an elevated IgM and low IgG and IgA levels in serum called X-linked hyper-IgM (XHIM) syndrome (7Allen R.C.

Over 70 unique mutations in the CD154 gene have been identified in more than 100 patients (12Notarangelo L.D. Peitsch M.C. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 511-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These mutations are very heterogeneous and include insertions, deletions, and point mutations. Thus, it is conceivable that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the functional defects of CD154 protein in these patients are quite different (6Garber E. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33545-33550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Gangsaas I. Hollenbaugh D. Pabst H.F. Aruffo A. Ochs H.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the CD154 gene is X-linked, each cell from normal individuals or XHIM patients makes a single species of CD154-encoding transcript. However, in some XHIM patients mutations in the donor splicing sites (see Ref. 13Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Gangsaas I. Hollenbaugh D. Pabst H.F. Aruffo A. Ochs H.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein) or the acceptor splicing sites (14Ameratunga R. McKee J. French J. Prestidge R. Fanslow W. Marbrook J. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1996; 3: 722-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lead to generation of multiple species of mRNAs consisting of the wild-type and one or more aberrantly spliced transcripts within a single cell. In each of these cases, the mis-spliced mRNA transcript encodes a variant of CD154 protein lacking either a major portion of, or the entire, TNFH domain (13Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Gangsaas I. Hollenbaugh D. Pabst H.F. Aruffo A. Ochs H.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ameratunga R. McKee J. French J. Prestidge R. Fanslow W. Marbrook J. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1996; 3: 722-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the TNFH domain appears to be responsible for the assembly of trimeric CD154 protein, variants lacking the TNFH domain (TNFH(−) mutant) were predicted not to participate in the assembly of CD154 trimers and therefore not affect the functional activity of the wild-type protein. Thus, it is unclear why these patients exhibit the XHIM syndrome, presumably resulting from a lack of functional CD154 protein. One possibility, which may explain this seemingly conflicting observation, is that the TNFH(−) mutant may interact with the wild-type protein and affect the assembly of the functional trimeric wild-type protein. To directly test the effect of a TNFH(−) mutant on CD154 function, we coexpressed wild-type protein and a TNFH(−) mutant and analyzed the biochemical and functional properties of the CD154 protein products. Our data revealed that the mutant protein still interacts with the wild-type protein despite the lack of the TNFH domain, thus defining a previously unrecognized structural element that contributes to CD154 trimer assembly. BJAB, a human B cell line, was a gift from Dr. George Mosialos (Harvard Medical School) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 4 mm glutamine. 9E10 monoclonal antibody was produced and purified from culture supernatant of the hybridoma (ATCC). Procedures for engineering, producing, and purifying CD40-Fc fusion protein, humanized 5c8, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies, Rb779 and Rb784, were described previously (15Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Procedures for constructing mutants of CD154 were described previously (6Garber E. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33545-33550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wild-type and mutant cDNAs (encoding CD154 residues 1–96 followed by an in-frame Myc epitope tag) were subcloned or reconstructed from restriction fragments with confirmed sequence into a unique NotI site in a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter-driven expression vector containing an SV40 origin for amplification in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were transfected with supercoiled plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Plasmid DNA lacking the CD154 gene was used as a negative control, and a vector containing wild-type CD154 was used as a positive control in all experiments. Expression of CD154 and its variants were analyzed in cells harvested 72 h after transfection. Metabolic labeling, biotinylation of cell surface proteins, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting analysis were performed as described (15Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Preparation of membrane fractions from transfected COS7 cells and the procedures for analysis of lymphotoxin-α up-regulation were described previously (6Garber E. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Karpusas M.

Total protein content in membrane fractions was determined by the Lowry method (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify the CD154 protein present in the membrane fractions, aliquots from membrane fractions containing 25 μg of total protein were analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit antiserum specific for the C-terminal peptide of CD154, Rb779 (15Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by integration of the intensities of CD154 obtained by a densitometer (Model PDSI, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A reference standard curve was established in parallel using purified soluble human CD154 (4Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of TNFH(−) mutant on the expression of wild-type protein, lysates of metabolically labeled COS7 cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding these proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using CD154-specific antibodies. Fig.1 shows that when wild-type CD154 was expressed alone, immunoprecipitates of anti-N-terminal peptide antiserum, Rb784 (lane 3), and anti-CD154 mAb, 5c8 (lane 4), contained primarily the full-length p33 protein, some p31 protein, and a small amount of p18. This is consistent with our previous observation (15Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These components were not observed in the immunoprecipitates of anti-Myc mAb, 9E10 (lane 1), or control rabbit antiserum (lane 2). When the Myc-tagged TNFH(−) mutant was expressed by itself, a p17 component, corresponding to the mutant protein, was immunoprecipitated by 9E10 and Rb784 but not by 5c8 or control rabbit antiserum (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8). When mutant and wild-type proteins were coexpressed, immunoprecipitates of 9E10 contained not only the p17 Myc-tagged mutant protein but also the p33, p31, and p18 wild-type proteins (lane 9). Similar protein patterns were found in immunoprecipitates of Rb784 and 5c8 but not for the control serum (lanes 10–12). These results reveal three important findings. First, the mutant protein is stably produced and can be readily detected. Second, the mutant protein, missing the TNFH domain, can associate with the wild-type CD154. Third, at least some of the wild-type protein, while associated with the mutant form, can still interact with 5c8. Because the TNFH(−) mutant lacks the receptor-interacting domain, it is conceivable that the wild-type protein associated with the mutant protein may have a reduced receptor-interacting activity. To examine this in detail, we coexpressed a constant amount of wild-type protein in the presence of a varying amount of the TNFH(−) mutant. Wild-type proteins immunoprecipitated by Rb784 were quite comparable irrespective of the amounts of TNFH(−) DNA used for transfection (Fig.2, bottom panel) indicating that, under the transfection conditions used, the total amount of the wild-type protein expressed is not affected by the introduction of TNFH(−) mutant. In contrast, the amount of wild-type protein recognized by CD40-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 2, upper panel) or by 5c8 (Fig. 2, middle panel) is inversely related to the amount of TNFH(−) DNA used for transfection. Only a small portion of the total TNFH(−) protein expressed (Fig. 2, bottom panel) was immunoprecipitated by either CD40-Fc (Fig. 2, upper panel) or 5c8 (Fig. 2, middle panel). These results show that the expression of the TNFH(−) mutant affects the receptor- and 5c8-interacting activities of the wild-type CD154 in a dose-dependent fashion. To determine whether the association of TNFH(−) mutant with the wild-type protein affects the ability of the wild-type protein to trigger CD40-mediated functions, BJAB cells were treated with membranes prepared from COS7 cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the wild-type and/or mutant protein at the ratio indicated (Fig. 3). FACS analysis was used to determine the up-regulated lymphotoxin-α on the surface of BJAB cells, a downstream response to CD154-dependent signaling. Fig. 3 shows that the coexpressed TNFH(−) mutant protein reduced the lymphotoxin-α up-regulated by the wild-type CD154 protein in a dose-dependent manner. When the amount of wild-type cDNA used for transfection is one-third of the mutant cDNA, the functional activity of CD154 was reduced by 80%. We also quantified the CD154 in these membrane fractions by Western blotting analysis using a rabbit antiserum that specifically recognizes the C-terminal peptide of CD154. Results show that 25 to 50% of wild-type CD154 protein is lost when mutant protein was coexpressed (Fig. 3,lower table). These results indicate that the TNFH(−) mutant reduces the functional activity of the coexpressed wild-type, and this effect is dose-dependent for the mutant protein expressed. Because total wild-type CD154 produced is not affected by the coexpressed TNFH(−) mutant (Fig. 2), the reduction of wild-type protein in membrane fractions from cotransfected cells (Fig. 3,lower table) suggests that mutant protein may affect the surface maturation of the wild-type CD154. To rule out the possibility that the reduction of functional CD154 in membrane fractions may be because of a selective loss of the wild-type protein caused by the coexpressed TNFH(−) mutant protein during membrane fractionation processes, we examined CD154 proteins on the surface of intact cells. COS7 cells cotransfected with cDNA encoding for wild-type and mutant proteins were surface-labeled with biotin, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. We found that CD40-Fc fusion protein, Rb784, and Rb779, but not 9E10, immunoprecipitated the biotin-labeled wild-type proteins (Fig.4). In addition, the amount of wild-type protein detected was inversely related to the ratio of wild-type cDNA to mutant cDNA used for cotransfection (Fig. 4,lanes 2–4). Thus, the expression of TNFH(−) mutant protein prevents the surface expression of the wild-type protein in a dose-dependent fashion. Importantly, we did not detect biotin-labeled TNFH(−) mutant protein in immunoprecipitates of CD40-Fc fusion protein, Rb784, and Rb779 (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5), which suggests that the TNFH(−) mutant associated with the wild-type protein (Figs. 1 and 2) is not present on the cell surface. Furthermore, unlike the metabolic labeling experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), 9E10 failed to immunoprecipitate biotin-labeled wild-type proteins, as well as the TNFH(−) mutant (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This result demonstrated that all wild-type proteins associated with the TNFH(−) mutant are not present on the cell surface. Together, our data show when TNFH(−) mutant and wild-type proteins are coexpressed, the wild-type protein present on the cell surface is not associated with the mutant protein. In contrast, wild-type proteins complexed with TNFH(−) mutant are retained inside the cell, indicating that the association with TNFH(−) mutant protein prevents wild-type CD154 from being expressed on the cell surface. Results from these analysis are summarized schematically in Fig. 5.Figure 5Schematic for how surface maturation of wild-type CD154 is compromised by the coexpressed TNFH (−) mutant.When wild-type proteins (in blue) and the TNFH(−) proteins (in red) are coexpressed, trimeric wild-type protein can be found associated with or without the TNFH(−) mutant. Wild-type protein not complexed with TNFH(−) mutant are transported to the cell surface, and some are in heterotrimeric forms (15Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Wild-type CD154 associated with mutant protein are retained inside the cell. Although the stoichiometry of TNFH(−) mutant to wild-type CD154 may be varied in these complexes, it is clear that at least some of the TNFH(−) mutant-associated wild-type CD154 proteins retain their receptor-interacting activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the effects of the TNFH(−) mutant on the wild-type CD154, we coexpressed a truncated form of CD154 lacking the TNFH domain and wild-type CD154 in COS cells and examined their biochemical and functional properties. Our results indicate that the mutant and wild-type proteins are expressed efficiently, but by forming a complex with the wild-type protein, the mutant protein prevents the cell surface expression of the wild-type CD154. This observation is significant in at least two aspects. First, it indicates that whereas patient's cells are capable of making both wild-type and TNFH(−) mutant CD154 protein, they may fail to produce sufficient functional CD154 on the surface of activated T cells, consequently leading to the hyper-IgM phenotype. Second, it suggests that, in addition to the TNFH domain, other region(s) of the CD154 structure may contribute to the assembly of CD154 trimers. Because CD154 is transiently expressed on the cell surface of activated T lymphocytes, it is conceivable that the reduced level of the functional CD154 expressed on the surface, caused by association with the TNFH(−) mutant protein, may be too low to trigger a productive signaling through CD40 and consequently lead to hyper-IgM syndrome. As the inhibitory effect of the TNFH(−) mutant requires the physical association of the wild-type CD154 with the mutant protein, the extent of the inhibitory effect is directly dependent on the stoichiometry of the mutant versus wild-type proteins. This is in line with the observation that patients carrying this mutation seem to have varied clinical syndromes. The low surface expression of functional CD154 protein is reminiscent of the biochemical properties of two other CD154 mutations associated with XHIM, the M36R and G38R, reported recently (6Garber E. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33545-33550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, these splicing mutations, along with the M36R and G38R, can be categorized as a subgroup of XHIM. Mutations in this subgroup all lead to low or no cell surface expression of the otherwise functional proteins, and the inability to produce sufficient functional CD154 protein on the surface of activated T lymphocytes ultimately leads to the hyper-IgM syndrome. Importantly, our results clearly show that the TNFH(−) mutant is capable of association with the wild-type CD154 protein, and by doing so it blocks the latter from being expressed on the cell surface. It should be mentioned that this TNFH(−) CD154 variant was reported to reduce the functional activity of the coexpressed wild-type protein by forming complexes with the latter (17Seyama K. Osborne W.R. Ochs H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11310-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it was concluded that the functional defect is because of a reduced receptor-interacting ability of the mutant·wild-type CD154 complexes expressed on the cell surface (17Seyama K. Osborne W.R. Ochs H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11310-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, we show that the mutant·wild-type complexes are retained inside the cell and therefore do not participate in any functional CD154 activity. Because only wild-type protein not associated with mutant protein can be expressed on the cell surface we reason that the reduced CD154 functional activity is simply due to a reduced abundance of the wild-type CD154 protein present on the surface for interaction with CD40. One possibility for the discrepancy between our results and the results published earlier is related to the experimental procedures for biotin labeling of cell surface proteins. Rather than detaching the transfected cells and performing the surface biotin labeling in cell suspensions, we maintained the transfected cells on the culture plate throughout the labeling process. It is conceivable that the detaching step may break some cells and result in biotinylation of intracellular components. In addition, our observation indicates that the stalk may participate in the assembly of CD154. Thus, for CD154 there are at least two structural elements, the TNFH domain and the extracellular stalk region, that can contribute to subunit oligomerization. Although our data suggests that the interactions between the stalk regions may lead to formation of higher order oligomers of wild-type·TNFH(−) mutant complexes (Fig. 5), it is not clear how, during the assembly of the wild-type CD154 in a normal individual, the TNFH-TNFH interaction coordinates with the stalk-stalk interaction to produce uniform trimers and to avoid formation of larger aggregates. Because the stalk regions vary greatly in size and in amino acid sequences among the members of TNF ligand family, it would be important to determine whether the interaction between stalk regions also occurs for other family members. This is particularly relevant to other TNF family members, because their genes are located in somatic chromosomes, and the coexpression of mutant and wild-type proteins is expected within a single cell from heterozygous individuals. It is not clear why the wild-type CD154 protein complexed with the TNFH(−) variant(s) fails to mature onto the cell surface. Although more extensive studies are warranted to understand the molecular mechanism of the intracellular retention, our observation implicates an ectopical introduction of the non-TNFH region of CD154 as a therapeutic opportunity to effectively block the expression of functional CD154 on the cell surface.
