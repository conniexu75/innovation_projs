An exception is provided by certain parasites: the eggs and larvae of ichneumonid parasitoids develop in their usual hosts without causing any such reaction. The ability of eggs of Nemeritis canescens to avoid a defence reaction in caterpillars of Ephestia kuehniella was investigated by Salt1, who found that a property of the surface acquired by the egg during its passage through the genital ducts of the adult parasite enabled the egg to escape a haemocytic reaction. Salt traced the source of this protective property to a particular region of the genital tract, the calyx."

https://openalex.org/W2053482012,"Pigeons and goldfish were trained in red-green discrimination in daily sessions, with the rewarded color changed every 2 days. Improvement in the performance of the pigeons could be traced to decrements in retention from each day to the next. The goldfish showed no improvement and no decrements in retention. The results suggest that progressive improvement in habit reversal is a product of proactive interference, and that the absence of improvement in the fish is due, not to the lack of some higher-order process which operates to produce improvement in higher vertebrates, but to a difference in learning-retention mechanisms."

Extracellular water in the centrifuged cellular layer was measured with inulin labeled with 14C. The cells were suspended in a Krebs-Ringer-0.025 m bicarbonate buffer or a Krebs-Ringer-0.025 m phosphate buffer. On addition of the fermentable sugars d-glucose, d-fructose, and d-mannose, the fall of pH in the medium corresponded to the lactate concentration. Lactate production was about the same in the two buffers, but the fall of pH was greater in the phosphate buffer because of the greater buffering efficiency of the bicarbonate. In the bicarbonate buffer, intracellular pH fell only slightly until the extracellular pH fell below 6.8. In the phosphate buffer, intracellular pH fell by a considerably greater amount. On addition of nonmetabolized sugars d-galactose, l-arabinose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, and methyl-α-d-glucoside, no significant change in either extracellular or intracellular pH was seen. On addition of 2-deoxy-d-arabino-hexose (2-deoxyglucose), there was no significant change in extracellular pH, but intracellular pH fell and remained low. d-arabino-Hexosulose (glucosone) itself caused no significant change in extracellular or intracellular pH. When glucose was added to cells previously incubated with glucosone, lactate production was largely blocked, and the fall in intracellular pH was correspondingly much less than in the absence of glucosone. Prior incubation with glucosone entirely prevented the fall of intracellular pH when 2-deoxyglucose was added."

As characterized by electrophoresis, substrate inhibition, and subunit dissociation-recombination experiments, it is identical to mouse lactate dehydrogenase 1."

https://openalex.org/W2067469600,"The figures in Table 1 yield some interesting results. The total annual value of food and mineral resources taken from the ocean is $8.3 billion, in contrast to $309 billion from the land. Using the land value as the yardstick, if the annual value of produce from the ocean were in ratio to the area relationship of ocean and land, the ocean potential would be $750 billion; the actual recovery for 1964 was only 1.1 percent of that potential. This very low percentage is the basis for either great optimism for the future development of the ocean (on the basis of unrealized potential), or great pessimism (on the basis of high costs compared with further development of land resources, or present exploitation to near the limit of productivity)."

The seeds and corms germinate after the first autumn rains; and in some circumstances these plants provide valuable autumn feed for stock."

https://openalex.org/W2088860632,"IN 1962, rolling disease appeared epidemically for the first time among the laboratory rats of the Research Laboratories of the Finnish State Alcohol Monopoly (Alko). (By reason of the vague aetiology of the disease, the term “rolling disease” is used here in preference to “labyrinthitis”. The symptoms described for these two, possibly different, diseases are almost the same.) Within a short period, the disease developed into a serious problem, particularly in genetic experiments, and in experiments involving long-term administration of alcohol. In the trials made to save scientifically valuable material, use was made of penicillin, a mixture of streptomycin and sulpha, and tetracycline. Of the treatments, that with tetracycline was found to be the most effective. Similar observations have been published by Dolowy et al.1 but their report seems to be little known, and there seems to be justification for a brief presentation of our observations, with some notes on the disease."
