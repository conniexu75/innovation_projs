https://openalex.org/W2085189255,Individual carbocyanine dye molecules in a sub-monolayer spread have been imaged with near-field scanning optical microscopy. Molecules can be repeatedly detected and spatially localized (to ∼λ/50 where λ is the wavelength of light) with a sensitivity of at least 0.005 molecules/(Hz)1/2 and the orientation of each molecular dipole can be determined. This information is exploited to map the electric field distribution in the near-field aperture with molecular spatial resolution.
https://openalex.org/W1973696945,"The tip-surface region of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) emits light when the energy of the tunneling electrons is sufficient to excite luminescent processes. These processes provide access to dynamic aspects of the local electronic structure that are not directly amenable to conventional STM experiments. From monolayer films of carbon-60 fullerenes on gold(110) surfaces, intense emission is observed when the STM tip is placed above an individual molecule. The diameter of this emission spot associated with carbon-60 is approximately 4 angstroms. These results demonstrate the highest spatial resolution of light emission to date with a scanning probe technique."
https://openalex.org/W2085719706,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers part of its Ti plasmid, the transferred DNA (T-DNA), to plant cells during tumor induction. Expression of this T-DNA in plant cells results in their transformation into tumor cells. There are similarities between the process of T-DNA transfer to plants and the process of bacterial conjugation. Here, the T-DNA transfer machinery mediated conjugation between bacteria. Thus, products of the Vir region of the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, normally involved in transfer of DNA from bacteria to plants, can direct the conjugative transfer of an IncQ plasmid between agrobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2059400512,"In the optical Kerr effect, the electric field of light incident on a transparent sample induces an anisotropic refractive index, which is measured by its effect on the passage of a second light beam. The advent of lasers powerful enough to generate a measurable effect, and which can be pulsed on femtosecond time scales, has made the optical Kerr effect into a practical technology for investigating the molecular structure and interactions of condensed systems such as pure liquids, liquid solutions, and plastic crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2016851692,"An important question in ecology is the extent to which populations and communities are governed by general rules. Recent developments in population dynamics theory have shown that hosts' refuges from their insect parasitoids predict parasitoid community richness patterns. Here, the refuge theory is extended to biological control, in which parasitoids are imported for the control of insect pests. Theory predicts, and data confirm, that the success of biological control is inversely related to the proportion of insects protected from parasitoid attack. Refuges therefore provide a general mechanism for interpreting ecological patterns at both the community level (their species diversity) and population level (their dynamics)."
https://openalex.org/W2044748067,"Chemical-specific x-ray linear dichroism was observed in an x-ray microscope as evidenced by changes in relative contrast upon azimuthal rotation of the sample. As a demonstration, thin sections of a partially ordered polymer fiber were examined with a transmission x-ray microscope near the carbon K-shell absorption edge to provide chemical-specific imaging at 50-nanometer spatial resolution. The observed dichroism and change in contrast upon rotation arise from the polarization dependence of the near-edge x-ray absorption cross section and can be used to image the orientation of specific chemical bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2056485931,"Hyper-Rayleigh scattering has been used to determine the nonlinear optical properties of a chromophore-containing protein in solution. Because the technique of hyper-Rayleigh scattering allows the measurement of hyperpolarizabilities in an isotropic solution without the application of an electric field, this method is ideally suited for the study of proteins that carry a net charge. The observed orientational correlation between the nonlinear optical chromophores in incompletely solubilized protein molecules suggests that guidelines from protein structures can be used for the engineering of supramolecular structures with high optical nonlinearity."
https://openalex.org/W2062999754,"Cloud albedo plays a key role in regulating Earth's climate. Cloud albedo depends on column-integrated liquid water content and the density of cloud condensation nuclei, which consists primarily of submicrometer-sized aerosol sulfate particles. A comparison of two independent satellite data sets suggests that, although anthropogenic sulfate emissions may enhance cloud albedo immediately adjacent to the east coast of the United States, over the central North Atlantic Ocean the variability in albedo can be largely accounted for by natural marine and atmospheric processes that probably have remained relatively constant since the beginning of the industrial revolution."
https://openalex.org/W2069134247,"Optical astronomy is crucial to our understanding of the universe, but the capabilities of ground-based telescopes are severely limited by the effects of telescope errors and of the atmosphere on the passage of light. Recently, it has become possible to construct inbuilt corrective devices that can compensate for both types of degradations as observations are conducted. For full use of the newly emerged class of 8-meter telescopes, such active corrective capabilities, known as active and adaptive optics, are essential. Some physical limitations in the adaptive optics field can be overcome by artificially created reference stars, called laser guide stars. These new technologies have lately been applied with success to some medium and very large telescopes."

https://openalex.org/W2076440941,"With photon tunneling microscopy it is possible to image polymeric and other dielectric surfaces by means of the unusual properties of photon tunneling or evanescent waves. Vertical resolution is 1 nanometer, limited by the detector, over a vertical range of half a wavelength. Lateral resolution is better than a quarter of a wavelength over a field of view up to 125 micrometers. Samples can be surveyed in real time in air, with no need for metallization, and without shadowing or the intrusive effects of electrons or scanning probes. The use of this technique to study single crystals of polyethylene and processes such as latex film formation and the evolution of polystyrene topography while dewetting above the glass transition temperature are described."
https://openalex.org/W1978548216,"The effect of isotopic substitution on the superconducting transition temperature, T(c), in alkali-doped C(60) has been examined. Paradoxically, it is found that a substantial decrease in T(c) with the increasing isotopic mass is possible even when the attractive interaction is not mediated by phonons but is instead of purely electronic origin. In particular, it is shown that the experimentally measured isotopic shifts are consistent with a recently proposed electronic mechanism. Further predictions are presented that can be tested by experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2050541900,"Sagittarius (Sgr) A(*) is a unique radio source located at the center of our galaxy. The radiation from Sgr A(*) may be generated in matter accreting onto a massive black hole. In observations at long wavelengths, the apparent angular size of Sgr A(*) decreases in the manner expected for emission from a point source scattered by electron density fluctuations along the line of sight. Measurements at a wavelength of 7 millimeters with the nearly completed Very Long Baseline Array indicate a size of 0.7 milliarc seconds, which is consistent with an extrapolation from results at longer wavelengths. The true size of Sgr A(*) must be less than 0.4 milliarc seconds, or 3.3 astronomical units. The inferred black hole mass is less than 1.5 x 10(6) solar masses according to a recent model for the emission."
