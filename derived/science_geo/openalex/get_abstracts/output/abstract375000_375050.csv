Costanzo et al. (p. 425 ) performed a pairwise fitness screen covering approximately one-third of all potential genetic interactions in yeast, examining 5.4 million gene-gene pairs and generating quantitative profiles for ∼75% of the genome. Of the pairwise interactions tested, about 3% of the genes investigated interact under the conditions tested. On the basis of these data, a reference map for the yeast genetic network was created."

Current typing methods for bacterial pathogens focus on a limited set of characteristics providing data with limited resolving power. Harris et al. (p. 469 ) used a high-throughput genome sequencing approach to show that isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are precisely differentiated into a global geographic structure. The findings suggest that intercontinental transmission has occurred for nearly four decades. The method could also detect individual person-to-person transmission events of MRSA within a hospital environment."
https://openalex.org/W1970310457,"Stormy Weather One of the most active questions about the effects of global warming is whether, and how, it might affect the frequency and the strength of hurricanes. Some studies have suggested that warming will bring fewer, and less energetic, hurricanes, while others have claimed that we can expect more intense storms. Bender et al. (p. 454 ; see the news story by Kerr ) explore the influence of global warming on hurricane dynamics over the Atlantic Ocean with a state-of-the-art hurricane prediction model. The model predicts that the annual total number of hurricanes in the 21st century will be less than now, but also that the number of the most intense storms per year will increase. The largest increase of the most intense hurricane frequency is predicted in the western Atlantic, which suggests that Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and the Southeast coast of the United States could be at greater risk."

As it explores, it links previously found food sources with tubular structures. Tero et al. (p. 439 ) report that if food sources are deposited on a plate in a pattern corresponding in miniature to the positions of the cities that surround Tokyo, the resulting network of Physarum tubules that develops is rather similar in structure to the railroad network that connects the Japanese cities. A model was produced that describes the adaptive network development displayed by the slime mold. This biologically inspired model might provide insight into how to implement properties like resistance of transport systems to local failures into similar human-designed systems."
https://openalex.org/W2065415433,"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is important in stem cell biology, embryonic development, and disease, including cancer. However, the mechanism of Wnt signal transmission, notably how the receptors are activated, remains incompletely understood. We found that the prorenin receptor (PRR) is a component of the Wnt receptor complex. PRR functions in a renin-independent manner as an adaptor between Wnt receptors and the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex. Moreover, PRR and V-ATPase were required to mediate Wnt signaling during antero-posterior patterning of Xenopus early central nervous system development. The results reveal an unsuspected role for the prorenin receptor, V-ATPase activity, and acidification during Wnt/beta-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2057039052,"Activation of the inflammasome generates the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and -18, which are important mediators of inflammation. Abnormal activation of the inflammasome leads to many inflammatory diseases, including gout, silicosis, neurodegeneration, and genetically inherited periodic fever syndromes. Therefore, identification of small molecule inhibitors that target the inflammasome is an important step toward developing effective therapeutics for the treatment of inflammation. Here, we show that the herbal NF-κB inhibitory compound parthenolide inhibits the activity of multiple inflammasomes in macrophages by directly inhibiting the protease activity of caspase-1. Additional investigations of other NF-κB inhibitors revealed that the synthetic IκB kinase-β inhibitor Bay 11-7082 and structurally related vinyl sulfone compounds selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages independent of their inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity. In vitro assays of the effect of parthenolide and Bay 11-7082 on the ATPase activity of NLRP3 demonstrated that both compounds inhibit the ATPase activity of NLRP3, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of these compounds on inflammasome activity could be mediated in part through their effect on the ATPase activity of NLRP3. Our results thus elucidate the molecular mechanism for the therapeutic anti-inflammatory activity of parthenolide and identify vinyl sulfones as a new class of potential therapeutics that target the NLRP3 inflammasome.

https://openalex.org/W2109511371,"Stability and localization of p53 is essential for its tumor suppressor function. Ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is the major regulatory mechanism of p53, which induces p53 nuclear export and degradation. However, it is unclear whether ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p53 can be recycled. Here, we report that USP10, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin-specific protease, deubiquitinates p53, reversing Mdm2-induced p53 nuclear export and degradation. After DNA damage, USP10 is stabilized, and a fraction of USP10 translocates to the nucleus to activate p53. The translocation and stabilization of USP10 is regulated by ATM -mediated phosphorylation of USP10 at Thr42 and Ser337. Finally, USP10 suppresses tumor cell growth in cells with wild-type p53, with USP10 expression downregulated in a high percentage of clear cell carcinomas, known to have few p53 mutations. These findings reveal USP10 to be a novel regulator of p53, providing an alternative mechanism of p53 inhibition in cancers with wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W2014643937,"Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the introduction of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Among these four factors, Oct4 is critical in inducing pluripotency because no transcription factor can substitute for Oct4, whereas Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc can be replaced by other factors. Here we show that the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 (also known as Lrh-1) can replace Oct4 in the derivation of iPSCs from mouse somatic cells, and it can also enhance reprogramming efficiency. Sumoylation mutants of Nr5a2 with enhanced transcriptional activity can further increase reprogramming efficiency. Genome-wide location analysis reveals that Nr5a2 shares many common gene targets with Sox2 and Klf4, which suggests that the transcription factor trio works in concert to mediate reprogramming. We also show that Nr5a2 works in part through activating Nanog. Together, we show that unrelated transcription factors can replace Oct4 and uncovers an exogenous Oct4-free reprogramming code."
https://openalex.org/W2013538977,"The Long and Short of It Semi-arid forests cover close to 18% of Earth's land surface. If climate change were to stimulate carbon accumulation in these areas, resulting changes in the forests could both promote climate cooling and warming: On one hand, forest growth would draw CO 2 from the atmosphere, providing a cooling effect on climate; on the other, as forests grew and became more dense, their albedo would decrease, which would warm climate. Rotenberg and Yakir (p. 451 ; see the Perspective by Schimel ) now report that a shift in peak photosynthetic activities from summer to early spring would, indeed, cause carbon accumulation by the forests, but that a suppression of reflected longwave radiation effect would complement the better-known (shortwave) albedo effect, doubling the amount of potential warming. Several decades of carbon accumulation would thus be necessary to counteract these radiative changes."
https://openalex.org/W2091990362,"Whereas the role of adipose tissue in glucose and lipid homeostasis is widely recognized, its role in systemic protein and amino acid metabolism is less well-appreciated. In vitro and ex vivo experiments suggest that adipose tissue can metabolize substantial amounts of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). However, the role of adipose tissue in regulating BCAA metabolism in vivo is controversial. Interest in the contribution of adipose tissue to BCAA metabolism has been renewed with recent observations demonstrating down-regulation of BCAA oxidation enzymes in adipose tissue in obese and insulin-resistant humans. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we observe alterations in adipose-tissue BCAA enzyme expression caused by adipose-selective genetic alterations in the GLUT4 glucose-transporter expression. We show that the rate of adipose tissue BCAA oxidation per mg of tissue from normal mice is higher than in skeletal muscle. In mice overexpressing GLUT4 specifically in adipose tissue, we observe coordinate down-regulation of BCAA metabolizing enzymes selectively in adipose tissue. This decreases BCAA oxidation rates in adipose tissue, but not in muscle, in association with increased circulating BCAA levels. To confirm the capacity of adipose tissue to modulate circulating BCAA levels in vivo, we demonstrate that transplantation of normal adipose tissue into mice that are globally defective in peripheral BCAA metabolism reduces circulating BCAA levels by 30% (fasting)-50% (fed state). These results demonstrate for the first time the capacity of adipose tissue to catabolize circulating BCAAs in vivo and that coordinate regulation of adipose-tissue BCAA enzymes may modulate circulating BCAA levels."

https://openalex.org/W2043826213,"Slip, Tripped, and Faulted Earthquake risk assessment can be improved if we were able to quantify the recurrence and magnitude of slip events. Until recently though, a lack of sophisticated seismometers has forced us to rely on anecdotal evidence from those who survived major earthquakes or to look for clues in the landscape. Zielke et al. (p. 1119 , published online 21 January; see the Perspective by Scharer ) analyzed high-resolution images of the San Andreas Fault in southern California. The data showed that major surface ruptures, such as the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, resulted from slips of only about 5 meters; much less than previously thought. In a study that lends support to this discovery, Grant Ludwig et al. (p. 1117 , published online 21 January; see the Perspective by Scharer ) suggest from analysis of the geomorphic features of this region that several smaller earthquakes have occurred during recent centuries rather than infrequent but larger movements. The Perspective by Scharer (p. 1089 ) discusses how paleoseismological studies like these may be valuable for feeding data into earthquake prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2053813270,"It's All About Self-Renewal The Lmo2 oncogene was identified as a contributing factor in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) nearly two decades ago, but the gene rose to prominence in 2003 when its inadvertent activation by a retroviral vector was shown to cause leukemia in two patients in a gene therapy trial. The cellular mechanism by which the gene product of Lmo2 , a transcriptional regulator, induces T-ALL is poorly understood. Studying transgenic mice, McCormack et al. (p. 879 , published online 21 January) now show that Lmo2 confers self-renewal activity to committed T cells in the thymus without affecting their capacity for T cell differentiation. These self-renewing cells, which were detectable 8 months prior to the onset of overt leukemia in the mice, expressed genes in common with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that Lmo2 might reactivate an HSC-specific transcriptional program."
https://openalex.org/W2020009024,"Viral Superspreaders Viruses are thought to spread across a lawn of cells by an iterative process of infection, replication, and release. If this were the case, the rate of spread would be limited by the viral replication kinetics. Now, Doceul et al. (p. 873 , published online 21 January; see the Perspective by Pickup ) describe a spreading mechanism used by vaccinia virus that is not restricted by viral replication kinetics and that causes a dramatic acceleration of spread. Early after infection, vaccinia virus proteins A33 and A36 are expressed as a complex on the cell surface. This marks the cell as infected and causes superinfecting virions to be repelled by the formation of actin projections beneath the virus particle. Virions are repelled from infected cells repeatedly until an uninfected cell is reached and are thus pushed further away from the origin of infection to accelerate dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W1736526707,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is initiated at the cell surface by association of secreted Wnt with its receptors Frizzled (Fz) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6). The study of these molecular interactions has been a significant technical challenge because the proteins have been inaccessible in sufficient purity and quantity. In this report we describe insect cell expression and purification of soluble mouse Fz8 cysteine-rich domain and human LRP6 extracellular domain and show that they inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cellular assays. We determine the binding affinities of Wnts and Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) to the relevant co-receptors and reconstitute in vitro the Fz8 CRD·Wnt3a·LRP6 signaling complex. Using purified fragments of LRP6, we further show that Wnt3a binds to a region including only the third and fourth β-propeller domains of LRP6 (E3E4). Surprisingly, we find that Wnt9b binds to a different part of the LRP6 extracellular domain, E1E2, and we demonstrate that Wnt3a and Wnt9b can bind to LRP6 simultaneously.

Since its discovery more than 30 years ago, the Wnt signaling pathway has captured the interest of researchers due to its role in development, progression of cancer, and self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells (1.Nusse R.

Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). This results in stabilization of intracellular β-catenin (“Wnt/β-catenin pathway”) and its translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin then initiates T-cell factor-dependent transcription of downstream Wnt target genes (6.Clevers H.

Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Underscoring the central role that these receptors play in Wnt signaling, suppression of either Fz or LRPs has been shown to generate phenotypes associated with Wnt mutations (10.He X. Semenov M. Tamai K. Zeng X. Development. 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mechanisms have evolved to regulate the Wnt·Fz·LRP complex through secreted proteins that interfere with these extracellular interactions. One such example is Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to LRP6 (9.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 11.Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat.

Dkk1 has been shown to play a crucial role in bone formation, vertebrate embryogenesis, and suppression of cancer cell proliferation (13.Niehrs C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 14.Aguilera O. Fraga M.F. Ballestar E. Paz M.F. Herranz M. Espada J. García J.M. Muñoz A. Esteller M. González-Sancho J.M.

Bone. 2007; 41: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, Wnt ligands, receptors Fz and LRP, and their natural inhibitors are all of great therapeutic interest. Indeed, recent findings show that the soluble extracellular domain of Fz8 interferes with Wnt-driven tumor growth in vivo (16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Frizzled low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein Dickkopf-1 cysteine-rich domain LDL type A repeat full-length extracellular domain. The detailed molecular arrangement of the Wnt·Fz·LRP ternary complex at the cell surface is still unknown, although it has been established that Fz binds to LRP6 in a Wnt-mediated fashion (5.Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) and that this interaction is inhibited by conditioned media containing Dkk1 (12.Semënov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kühl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Importantly, there is no evidence to date that supports formation of the ternary complex from purified extracellular domains, leaving open the possibility that other factors are required. Given that there are 19 Wnts, 10 Fzs, and 2 LRPs in mammals, it is likely that many different ternary complexes form. The combinatorial nature of this system makes it suitable for spatiotemporal control of development in an organism, a well established function of the Wnt pathway. However, there is still ambiguity about whether all of the Wnt·Fz·LRP combinations are biologically relevant (17.van Amerongen R. Nusse R. Development. 2009; 136: 3205-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 18.Wu C.H. Nusse R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the specificity of physical interactions among different Wnts and their corresponding Fz and LRP5/6 receptors remains largely unaddressed. Several domains can be predicted with high confidence for the protein components that make up the Wnt signaling complex. Wnt molecules are lipid-modified proteins, possibly associated with lipoproteins and/or lipid vesicles in the extracellular environment (21.Morrell N.T. Leucht P. Zhao L. Kim J.B. ten Berge D. Ponnusamy K. Carre A.L. Dudek H. Zachlederova M. McElhaney M. Brunton S. Gunzner J. Callow M. Polakis P. Costa M. Zhang X.M. Helms J.A. Nusse R.

Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Fz proteins are hepta-span transmembrane receptors with an additional conserved N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) responsible for Wnt binding (3.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). LRP5/6 receptors are single-span transmembrane proteins composed of a large extracellular domain of four predicted β-propellers, each followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain. After this segment is an LDL type A repeat (LDLa) that is in close proximity to the transmembrane region. Finally, there is a short intracellular sequence that potentiates the Wnt signal (4.Pinson K.I. Brennan J. Monkley S. Avery B.J. Skarnes W.C. Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 5.Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X.

Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of Fz and LRP5/6 receptors are difficult to produce in good yields by utilizing common prokaryotic expression systems. In part, this is because they contain a large number of cysteines that form disulfide bonds in the folded protein. Mammalian expression systems have been used to obtain Fz8 CRD; in the case of LRP6, it is necessary to co-express with the chaperone mesoderm development (MESD) protein to ensure appropriate protein folding (24.Hsieh J.C. Lee L. Zhang L. Wefer S. Brown K. DeRossi C. Wines M.E. Rosenquist T. Holdener B.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 355-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25.Koduri V. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, methods for producing high yields of soluble Wnt receptor proteins are needed to enable biochemical investigation of Wnt·Fz·LRP interactions and to facilitate future structural characterization. Because of the current difficulty in obtaining purified protein, researchers have used indirect methods to examine the role of LRP6 domains, such as assessing the effects of overexpression of truncated LRP6 forms on cellular Wnt signaling (9.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 12.Semënov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kühl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). These studies provide important information but stop short of determining which interactions are direct and what the relevant binding affinities for LRP6 with Wnt or Dkk1 might be, both precursors to a full understanding of the signaling mechanism. To dissect Wnt signaling at the cell surface, we examined the physical interactions of LRP6, Wnt3a, Wnt9b, Fz8, and Dkk1. Human Dkk1, mouse Fz8 CRD, and various truncated forms of the LRP6 extracellular domain were purified in high yield from insect cells. We established that the proteins are properly folded by showing that, as expected, they can inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We then measured binding constants for a number of binary complexes, providing clear evidence that the interactions are direct. Using these purified proteins, we reconstituted a Fz8·Wnt3a·LRP6 ternary complex, reflective of a complex that may indeed form at the cell surface. Formation of this complex is inhibited by binding of Dkk1 to LRP6, which blocks the Wnt3a-LRP6 interaction. Remarkably, Wnt3a and Wnt9b can bind to LRP6 simultaneously at distinct sites located within the E3E4 and E1E2 regions, respectively. The relatively straightforward process we describe here could be used, in principle, to characterize every possible Wnt·Fz, Wnt-LRP, and Fz-Wnt-LRP combination and to identify those likely to be biologically most relevant. Furthermore, our assays could be used as a screening platform for identifying ligands that inhibit the formation of Wnt signaling complexes. Highly pure human Wnt3a and mouse Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt9b were obtained as carrier-free proteins (R&D Systems) for use in the binding assays. Mouse Wnt3a was purified from L-cells as described previously (22.Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar) for use in cell-based assays, unless otherwise indicated. For cloning and construct boundaries, see the supplemental data. Trichoplusia ni cells were maintained in suspension in ESF921 (Expression Systems LLC) at 27 °C as recommended by the vendor. Cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in ESF921 and infected at an estimated multiplicity of infection of 1. Scale-up production of 5 liters or more was performed using a Wave Bioreactor (GE Bioscience). LRP6, Fz8 CRD, or Dkk1 proteins were expressed as secreted extracellular proteins. At 48 h post-infection, the medium was adjusted with 50 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 ml of 0.25 m CaCl2, and 1 ml of 1 m NiCl2 per liter of medium. After an incubation period of 30 min, cells and debris were spun down at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant containing the proteins was subsequently filtered (0.22 μm). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (1 ml, Qiagen) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl was used for processing of 1 liter of insect cell media containing the His6-tagged proteins. The medium was passed twice through the column to increase the yield of purified protein. The column was washed twice with 20 ml of Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the resin by the addition of 4 × 1 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The collected fractions were concentrated and resolved on a Superdex S200 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions were collected and concentrated to 10 μm stocks. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Experiments were conducted with mouse fibroblast L-cells as previously described (26.Hannoush R.N. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and detailed in the supplemental data. Binding kinetics were measured by biolayer interferometry on an Octet Red instrument (ForteBio). Streptavidin high binding FA or anti-hIgG-Fc capture (AHC) biosensors were loaded with biotinylated hLRP6 or mFz8 CRD-Fc (16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. The loaded biosensors were washed in the same buffer before carrying out association and dissociation measurements for the indicated times. Kinetic parameters (kon and koff) and affinities (KD) were calculated from a nonlinear fit of the data using the Octet software Version 6.1; data were then plotted in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Each reported value represents an average of three or more experiments at different concentrations, with a fitted experimental curve for which the correlation coefficient (R2) is above 0.96. To study the biochemical interactions of Fz8, LRP6, Wnt3a, and Dkk1, we generated the extracellular domains of human LRP6 and mouse Fz8 as well as full-length human Dkk1. Rather than using transfected mammalian cells that produce low amounts of LRP6, we chose insect cells infected with AcNPV baculovirus to produce the 156-kDa, 47 cysteine-containing extracellular domain of LRP6 (FL ECD) (27.Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 28.Smith G.E. Summers M.D. Fraser M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We designed five constructs, choosing domain boundaries based on sequence alignment of the protein from different species, primary sequence analysis using programs such as SMART (29.Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar), and secondary structural prediction (Quick2D, MPI toolkit (30.Biegert A. Mayer C. Remmert M. Söding J. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W335-W339Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) (supplemental Fig. S1A). To test the roles of the various LRP6 domains in Wnt signaling, we expressed the full-length extracellular domain of LRP6 (LRP6 FL ECD) as well as subfragments of this domain, which include E1E4 (the first four β-propellers with the epidermal growth factor-like domains that follow each of them), E1E2 (the first two β-propellers), and E3E4 (the third and fourth β-propellers) (supplemental Fig. S1A). For Fz8, we cloned and expressed the CRD (31.Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar); this domain has been shown both to be sufficient to bind Wnt3a and to be necessary for signaling (3.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After testing expression in two insect cell lines and comparing the LRP6 native secretion signal to the secretion signal of the baculovirus coat protein GP67 (supplemental Fig. S1B), we selected Tni Pro cells and the GP67 secretion signal for expressing LRP6 and Fz8 proteins. Purification was on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column followed by size-exclusion chromatography. As a representative example, the purity of LRP6 E3E4 is shown at every step in the protocol (supplemental Fig. S1C). Proteins were purified to a high degree of homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (supplemental Fig. S1D), and their identities and glycan content were determined by mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1, A and E). Overall yields ranged from 2 mg (LRP6 FL ECD) to 10 mg (Fz8 CRD) of purified protein per liter of expression medium. Thus, we have developed a method allowing access to significant quantities of LRP6 FL ECD and fragments without co-expression of the mesoderm development (MESD) chaperone. To study the interaction between LRP6 and Wnt3a, we developed a binding assay based on biolayer interferometry (32.Abdiche Y. Malashock D. Pinkerton A. Pons J. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 377: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Site-specifically biotinylated LRP6 E1E4 was obtained by co-expressing a C-terminal His6-Avi-tagged (33.Smith P.A. Tripp B.C. DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Lu Z. LaVallie E.R. McCoy J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) version of LRP6 E1E4 with biotin ligase in insect cells. This version of LRP6 expressed at similar levels as the non-biotinylated form and was easily purified from insect cells. We loaded biotinylated LRP6 E1E4 at 20 μg/ml onto streptavidin biosensors and transferred the sensor tip to Wnt3a solutions of various concentrations. We observe direct binding between LRP6 E1E4 and Wnt3a with a KD of 9 ± 4 nm (Fig. 1A, Table 1), suggestive of a tight complex between LRP6 and Wnt3a on the cell surface. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of direct binding between purified LRP6 and Wnt3a.TABLE 1Binding affinities and kinetic constants for various Wnts and Dkk1 binding to LRP6 E1E4, E1E2, E3E4, and Fz8 CRD, as measured by biolayer interferometryKDKonKoffnmm−1.s−1.104s−1.10−4Binding to LRP6 E1E4 Wnt3a9.1 ± 3.83.62 ± 0.013.31 ± 0.01 Wnt5aaNo binding.

Open table in a new tab Next, we tested the biological activity of soluble LRP6 ECD in mouse fibroblast L-cells. For this, we used a cell-based infrared imaging assay recently developed in our laboratory (26.Hannoush R.N. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We treated L-cells with Wnt3a in the presence or absence of the various LRP6 fragments and monitored quantitatively β-catenin stabilization. To account for any variations in cell number, the β-catenin signal was normalized to the DNA signal. Our results show that purified soluble LRP6 FL ECD and E1E4 inhibit Wnt signaling in L-cells with IC50 values of 480 ± 50 and 360 ± 90 nm, respectively (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the LDLa domain of LRP6 is not important for Wnt binding. E1E2 (first two β-propellers) and E3E4 fragments (last two β-propellers) did not inhibit Wnt3a signaling at low concentrations in the cell-based assay. However, at concentrations higher than 2 μm, they start to exhibit an inhibitory effect, indicating that their IC50 values may fall in the 10–20 μm range (Fig. 1B). Altogether, the biochemical and cellular results are consistent with a model in which soluble LRP6 directly competes with the cell surface LRP6 receptor for binding to Wnt3a, hence disrupting Fz/Wnt/LRP6 complex formation and resulting in inhibition of cellular β-catenin stabilization. Although Dkk1 is established as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling (9.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 12.Semënov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kühl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), a direct interaction with LRP6 has not been demonstrated with purified proteins. Instead, earlier reports utilized Scatchard analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and overexpression of LRP6 deletion mutants to demonstrate that Dkk1 interacts with LRP6 on the cell surface (9.Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 11.Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 12.Semënov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kühl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). By using biolayer interferometry, we show that full-length soluble Dkk1 does indeed bind directly to LRP6 with a KD of 3 ± 1 nm (Fig. 2A and Table 1). We further demonstrate that Dkk1 inhibits Wnt3a binding to LRP6 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). These data are in agreement with a previous study utilizing Dkk1-conditioned media to study Fz8-Wnt1-LRP6 interactions (12.Semënov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kühl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support a model in which Dkk1 antagonism of Wnt3a signaling is due to direct competition with Wnt3a for binding to the LRP6 receptor. Using the β-catenin imaging assay, we show that Dkk1 inhibits Wnt3a-mediated stabilization of cellular β-catenin with an IC50 of 100 ± 5 nm (Fig. 2C). The difference observed between the cellular IC50 and the biochemical KD for Dkk1 and LRP6 may reflect differences in assay sensitivity and readout. Additionally, differences in LRP6 receptor occupancy or organization at the cell surface may decrease sensitivity to these inhibitors. To quantitatively measure the Fz8-Wnt3a interaction, we used a Fz8 CRD-Fc fusion protein (16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and immobilized it onto anti-human Fc biosensors. In this format we observed tight binding between Wnt3a and Fz8 CRD-Fc with a KD of 4 ± 1 nm (supplemental Fig. S3). Using the β-catenin imaging assay, we found that Fz8 CRD (monomer, see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Fig. S4) potently inhibits Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling with an IC50 of 0.8 ± 0.2 nm (supplemental Fig. S3B), in agreement with a previously reported IC50 value (16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, consistent with earlier reports on Fz8 CRD interactions with Wnt ligands (16.DeAlmeida V.I. Miao L. Ernst J.A. Koeppen H. Polakis P. Rubinfeld B. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5371-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19.Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Fz8 CRD is due to direct competition with the endogenous Fz receptors for Wnt3a binding. It is now commonly accepted that Wnt3a, Fz8 CRD, and LRP6 form a ternary signaling complex at the cell surface (10.He X. Semenov M. Tamai K. Zeng X. Development. 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 34.Angers S. Moon R.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated that the purified proteins can form this complex. First we sought to reconstitute the Fz8 CRD·Wnt3a·LRP6 complex in solution by mixing Fz8 CRD-Fc, Wnt3a, and LRP6 E1E4. Fz8 CRD-Fc was precipitated with protein G beads, and the precipitate was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3A). In the absence of Wnt3a, LRP6 does not coprecipitate with Fz8 CRD. However, in the presence of Wnt3a, we observe coprecipitation of LRP6, suggesting formation of a Fz8 CRD·Wnt3a·LRP6 ternary complex. In agreement with the result above (Fig. 2B), LRP6 E1E4 coprecipitation does not occur in the presence of added Dkk1. These findings are consistent with a model in which Fz8 CRD forms a Wnt3a-mediated complex with LRP6, and Dkk1 prevents LRP6 binding to Wnt3a. Having demonstrated that Wnt3a binds to both LRP6 E1E4 and Fz8 CRD by using biolayer interferometry (Figs. 1A and supplemental S3A), we investigated the formation of the ternary complex in the same manner. Fz8 CRD-Fc was loaded onto anti-human Fc biosensors. We then established the formation of a Fz8 CRD·Wnt3a binary complex (Fig. 3B) in the presence of Wnt3a (100 nm). Next, the binary complex was exposed to LRP6 E1E4 (800 nm) while maintaining a constant concentration of Wnt3a (100 nm). The observation of a second binding event demonstrates that LRP6 forms a ternary complex with Wnt3a that is already bound to Fz8 CRD (Figs. 3B and supplemental Fig. S5). As a control, we conducted the above steps without adding Wnt3a and detect no interaction between LRP6 and Fz8 CRD (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that LRP6 and Fz8 CRD must bind to different locations on Wnt3a and that LRP6 does not bind to Fz8 CRD in the absence of Wnt3a, in agreement with the immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 3A). It is worth noting that we could not perform this experiment in the reverse format, i.e. by coating LRP6 first on the biosensor tip and measuring Fz8 CRD binding as a function of prebound Wnt3a. This could be due to the display of LRP6 on the biosensor tip hindering binding of Fz8 CRD-Fc. Nevertheless, our studies establish formation of a Fz8 CRD·Wnt3a·LRP6 ternary complex with purified components, both in solution and on a biosensor tip. Having established a biophysical assay for probing the interactions of Wnt3a with its receptors, we investigated the binding of other representative Wnts to LRP6 and to Fz8 CRD. Our results demonstrate that Wnt5a and Wnt5b bind with lower affinity than Wnt3a to Fz8 CRD (Wnt5a, KD = 50 nm; Wnt5b, KD = 36 nm; Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S6), whereas Wnt9b only binds very weakly. On the other hand, Wnt5a and Wnt5b do not interact with LRP6, whereas Wnt9b binds tightly to LRP6 with a KD of 11 ± 3 nm (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S7A). Furthermore, we found that Dkk1 inhibit"
https://openalex.org/W2032122594,"Thermodynamic properties of matter generally depend on the details of interactions between its constituent parts. However, in a unitary Fermi gas where the scattering length diverges, thermodynamics is determined through universal functions that depend only on the particle density and temperature. By using only the general form of the equation of state and the equation of force balance, we measured the local internal energy of the trapped gas as a function of these parameters. Other universal functions, such as those corresponding to the Helmholtz free energy, chemical potential, and entropy, were calculated through general thermodynamic relations. The critical parameters were also determined at the superfluid transition temperature. These results apply to all strongly interacting fermionic systems, including neutron stars and nuclear matter."
https://openalex.org/W2058008662,"Human lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Not only can these cells support the growth of SARS-CoV infection, but they are also capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines to initiate and, eventually, aggravate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune-mediated pathology within the lungs. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signaling to SARS-CoV is crucial for paving the way to better understand SARS pathogenesis. Based on microarray-based functional genomics, we report here the global gene response of 2B4 cells, a cloned bronchial epithelial cell line derived from Calu-3 cells. Specifically, we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor (NF)κB, activator protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3/7 in infected 2B4 cells at 12-, 24-, and 48-hrs post infection (p.i.), resulting in the activation of many antiviral genes, including interferon (IFN)-β, -λs, inflammatory mediators, and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We also showed, for the first time, that IFN-β and IFN-λs were capable of exerting previously unrecognized, non-redundant, and complementary abilities to limit SARS-CoV replication, even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2B4 bronchial epithelial cells until 48 hrs p.i. Collectively, our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by SARS-CoV in bronchial epithelial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies, aiming at advancing strategies against SARS."
https://openalex.org/W2017930303,"Carnosine (β-alanyl-l-histidine) and homocarnosine (γ-aminobutyryl-l-histidine) are abundant dipeptides in skeletal muscle and brain of most vertebrates and some invertebrates. The formation of both compounds is catalyzed by carnosine synthase, which is thought to convert ATP to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate, and whose molecular identity is unknown. In the present work, we have purified carnosine synthase from chicken pectoral muscle about 1500-fold until only two major polypeptides of 100 and 90 kDa were present in the preparation. Mass spectrometry analysis of these polypeptides did not yield any meaningful candidate. Carnosine formation catalyzed by the purified enzyme was accompanied by a stoichiometric formation, not of AMP, but of ADP, suggesting that carnosine synthase belongs to the “ATP-grasp family” of ligases. A data base mining approach identified ATPGD1 as a likely candidate. As this protein was absent from chicken protein data bases, we reconstituted its sequence from a PCR-amplified cDNA and found it to fit with the 100-kDa polypeptide of the chicken carnosine synthase preparation. Mouse and human ATPGD1 were expressed in HEK293T cells, purified to homogeneity, and shown to catalyze the formation of carnosine, as confirmed by mass spectrometry, and of homocarnosine. Specificity studies carried out on all three enzymes were in agreement with published data. In particular, they acted with 15–25-fold higher catalytic efficiencies on β-alanine than on γ-aminobutyrate.

The identification of the gene encoding carnosine synthase will help for a better understanding of the biological functions of carnosine and related dipeptides, which still remain largely unknown. Carnosine, a dipeptide consisting of β-alanine and l-histidine, was extracted for the first time from Liebigs meat extract in 1900 to become the first ever peptide isolated from animal tissue (1.Gulewitch W. Admiradzibi S. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1900; 33: 1902-1903Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Carnosine is the best known representative of a series of imidazole dipeptides such as homocarnosine (γ-aminobutyryl-l-histidine), anserine (β-alanyl-N-π-methyl-l-histidine), and balenine (β-alanyl-N-τ-methyl-l-histidine), which have long been reported to be present at high concentrations in skeletal muscle and the central nervous system of vertebrates. The β-alanyl containing peptides are mainly found in skeletal muscle, whereas the γ-aminobutyryl containing peptides are typical of the central nervous system, probably due to the availability of its precursor γ-aminobutyric acid in this tissue. The concentration of carnosine in skeletal muscle of vertebrates varies according to the species from 0.6 mm (mouse) up to 10 and 30 mm (human and horse, respectively) (2.Crush K.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 34: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the dipeptide is also present at high (1–2 mm) concentrations in the olfactory bulb of the mammalian brain and has been detected in muscles of some invertebrates such as crabs, shrimp, and oysters (Ref. 3.Cameron J.N. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 143: 543-548Google Scholar, for review see Ref. 4.Boldyrev A.A. Carnosine and Oxidative Stress in Cells and Tissues. Nova Scientific Publisher, New York2007Google Scholar). Homocarnosine is detected at concentration of 0.3–1.5 mm in different regions of the human brain (5.Kish S.J. Perry T.L. Hansen S. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anserine is abundant in rabbit leg muscle (17 mm) and chicken pectoral muscle (43 mm), whereas balenine is mainly found in muscles of marine mammals such as whales and dolphins (up to 45 mm) (2.Crush K.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 34: 3-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The biological function(s) of carnosine and related dipeptides is still mysterious, although several theories have been proposed. Because of its abundance and its pKa close to the physiological pH, carnosine is thought to act as a buffer, neutralizing lactic acid produced in a working muscle (4.Boldyrev A.A. Carnosine and Oxidative Stress in Cells and Tissues. Nova Scientific Publisher, New York2007Google Scholar). It has also been proposed to be an anti-glycation agent (for review, see Ref. 6.Hipkiss A.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2009; 44: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and a blood glucose regulator (7.Sauerhöfer S. Yuan G. Braun G.S. Deinzer M. Neumaier M. Gretz N. Floege J. Kriz W. van der Woude F. Moeller M.J. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2425-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas the dipeptide present in the olfactory system might be either a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator (for review, see Ref. 8.Bonfanti L. Peretto P. De Marchis S. Fasolo A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Carnosine and anserine have been shown to be efficient chelators of copper ions in vitro (9.Brown C.E. Antholine W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and all carnosine-related dipeptides have been postulated to be potent endogenous antioxidants (10.Kohen R. Yamamoto Y. Cundy K.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 3175-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). However, none of these putative physiological functions has been definitively verified yet. Similarly, information on the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of carnosine and related dipeptides remains highly deficient. Carnosine is known to be synthesized from β-alanine and l-histidine by an ATP-dependent synthase (EC 6.3.2.11), which has been partially purified from different sources (11.Kalyankar G.D. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3210-3218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Stenesh J.J. Winnick T. Biochem. J. 1960; 77: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Skaper S.D. Das S.

The fate of ATP in the reaction has never been directly demonstrated, but based on indirect arguments, the nucleotide triphosphate is thought to be converted to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate. Two proteins encoded by different genes were shown to degrade carnosine in humans and other mammals (15.Teufel M. Saudek V. Ledig J.P. Bernhardt A. Boularand S. Carreau A. Cairns N.J. Carter C.

The first one (CN2, formerly named human tissue carnosinase, EC 3.4.13.18) is a Mn+2-dependent cytosolic enzyme ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. This enzyme is now named “cytosol nonspecific dipeptidase,” because it does not degrade homocarnosine and exhibits a rather broad specificity toward various dipeptides. The second one (CN1, EC 3.4.13.20) is a genuine carnosinase (former human serum carnosinase), which breaks down both carnosine and homocarnosine and is found in serum and brain tissue. Interestingly, deficiency of this enzyme leads to hypercarnosinemia and hypercarnosinuria and was associated with neurological symptoms (16.Murphey W.H. Lindmark D.G. Patchen L.I. Housler M.E.

Further progress on the role of carnosine and homocarnosine would benefit highly from the identification of the enzyme that synthesizes it and this was the purpose of the present work. We chose to purify this enzyme from chicken muscle, a rich source of carnosine synthase, and succeeded to identify it by combining protein purification and mass spectrometry analysis with a data base mining approach. Reagents, of analytical grade whenever possible, were from Sigma, Acros (Geel, Belgium), Roche Applied Science, or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). [3H]β-Alanine and [14C]γ-aminobutyric acid were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). DEAE-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, Superdex-200 resins, 1-ml HisTrap HP (Ni2+ form) and PD-10 columns were obtained from GE Healthcare. ATP-Sepharose was a kind gift (to D. V.) from Serenex. AG50W-X4 (100–200 mesh) resin came from Bio-Rad, and Vivaspin-15 centrifugal concentrators were from Sartorius (Stockport, United Kingdom). Enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes as well as the TurboFect transfection reagent were obtained from Fermentas (St-Leon-Rot, Germany). FirstChoice® human brain RNA was from Applied Biosystems (Halle, Belgium). Carnosine synthase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of either [3H]β-alanine or [14C]γ-aminobutyric acid into the corresponding dipeptide. The standard incubation mixture (0.11 ml) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolATPGD1ATP-grasp domain-containing protein 1Ap5AP1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphateESTexpressed sequence tagHsp90heat shock protein 90MSmass spectrometryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. 3 mm MgATP, 3 mml-histidine (or other acceptors), either 1 μm [1H + 3H]β-alanine (about 600 × 103 cpm) or 23.4 μm [12C + 14C]γ-aminobutyric acid (about 300 × 103 cpm). The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme preparation and carried out at 37 °C for 20 min unless otherwise described. Dipeptide production was linear for at least 30 min under all conditions studied. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of the reaction medium to 0.2 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) HClO4. The samples were diluted with 0.12 ml of H2O and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. After neutralization of the supernatant with 3 m K2CO3, the salts were removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) and the clear supernatant was diluted 5 times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2 ml were applied to AG50W-X4 columns (1 ml, Na+ form), equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The unreacted radiolabeled substrate was removed by washing the columns with 10 ml of the same buffer and carnosine or homocarnosine were eluted with 5 × 2 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl. To elute dipeptides that were more positively charged, the columns were washed with 5 × 2 ml of 1 m NH4OH. In all cases, the samples to be counted were mixed with 5 volumes of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the incorporated radioactivity was analyzed with a Packard Tri-Carb 2300 TR liquid scintillation counter. dithiothreitol ATP-grasp domain-containing protein 1 P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate expressed sequence tag heat shock protein 90 mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography. Chicken pectoral muscle (250 g) was homogenized with 4 volumes (w/v) of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of antipain) with a Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g and the supernatant (550 ml) split into two equal halves. One-half was immediately utilized and the other was frozen at −70 °C and subjected to the same procedure a few days later. The supernatant (250 ml) was diluted with buffer A to 375 ml and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (200 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 400 ml of buffer A, developed with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m in 1000 ml) in buffer A, and fractions (7 ml) were collected. The most active fractions of the two columns were pooled (55 ml), diluted to 334 ml with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of antipain), and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (12 ml) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 36 ml of buffer B containing 35 mm NaCl, and the retained protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient (35–500 mm in 300 ml in buffer B). The most active fractions (23 ml) were pooled, concentrated to 2.3 ml in 2 Vivaspin-15 ultrafiltration devices, and loaded on a Superdex-200 16/60 column (120 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The most active fraction (1.5 ml) was diluted 3-fold with buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml of antipain) and loaded onto an ATP-Sepharose column (0.2 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was first washed with 2 ml of buffer C and 2 ml of the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The retained proteins were eluted (6 fractions of 0.4 ml) with buffer C containing 5 mm MgATP. Fifty μl were kept for the MS/MS analysis, and the remaining 0.35 ml were supplemented with 0.7 mg of bovine serum albumin. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C and the enzymatic preparation was stored at −70 °C between steps. The complete purification procedure was performed twice with similar results. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Protein content in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel bands, which co-eluted with carnosine synthase activity in the last purification step (ATP-Sepharose), was quantitated by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software (NIH). The total amount of protein in the ATP-Sepharose fractions, as determined densitometrically, was in perfect agreement with the data obtained with the Bradford assay. To determine the changes in adenine nucleotide concentration taking place during carnosine synthesis, a sample (25 μg of protein) of Superdex 200-purified chicken carnosine synthase was incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 1 mm β-alanine and 3 mml-histidine in a reaction mixture (0.33 ml) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgATP, 1 mm Na3VO4 (a nonspecific inhibitor of ATPases), and 100 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A, a potent inhibitor of adenylate kinase (19.Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Neither Na3VO4 nor Ap5A affected the formation of carnosine at the concentrations used. To confirm the complete inhibition of adenylate kinase activity by Ap5A, the enzyme was incubated in the same reaction mixture in which β-alanine and l-histidine had been replaced by 100 μm AMP. After 0, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C, 0.1 ml of the reaction mixture was removed and mixed with 30 μl of ice-cold 20% (w/v) HClO4 to stop the reaction. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatants (0.12 ml) immediately withdrawn and neutralized with 20 μl of 3 m K2CO3. The salt precipitate was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) and the clear supernatants (0.1 ml) were analyzed in an Agilent 1100 HPLC. Separation of adenine nucleotides was achieved by chromatography on a Whatman Partisphere SAX column (4.6 × 125 mm, 5-μm particle size) in a gradient of 0.01–0.5 m NH4H2PO4, pH 3.7, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min (20.Van Den Neste E.

The detection of nucleotides was performed with a diode-array detector at λ = 254 nm. Quantification was achieved using external standards of ATP, ADP, and AMP. The bands co-eluting with carnosine synthase activity in the ATP-Sepharose purification step were cut from a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel and digested with trypsin. In-gel digestions and desalting of the peptides were performed as described in Ref. 21.Vertommen D. Ruiz N. Leverrier P. Silhavy T.J. Collet J.F. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 2432-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. Peptides were analyzed by LC-tandem mass spectrometry in a LTQ XL ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fitted with a microelectrospray probe. The results were analyzed using X-calibur software (Thermo Scientific) and the proteins were identified using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific) with a False Discovery rate ≤5%, as delivered by a target-decoy data base search. To identify chicken ATPGD1, the downloaded chicken data base of the MS/MS software (IPI Chicken, version 3.47) was updated with an amino acid sequence of chicken ATPGD1 as determined in the present work. Chicken total muscle RNA was prepared from 200 mg of pectoral muscle with the use of TriPure reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Muscle cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, St-Leon-Rot, Germany), with random hexamers and 2 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 5′ primer containing the putative ATG codon (GCAGCATGATATCGGTGGAC) and a 3′ primer containing the putative stop codon (CCGCCGTGGTTATTTGAAGTG) were used to PCR amplify the open reading frame encoding chicken ATPGD1. The sequences of 5′ and 3′ primers were chosen, based on chicken expressed sequence tags (ESTs) BM487018.1 and BM490056.1 and chicken trace sequence TI:26256606 from the Whole-Genome Shotgun reads (trace-WGS) collection in the NCBI trace archive. These sequences were identified by BLAST searches as being homologous to human ATPGD1. The reaction was performed in the presence of 1 m betaine with the use of Pfu DNA polymerase and chicken total muscle cDNA as template. A PCR product of the expected size (about 2.7 kb) was obtained, purified, and sequenced. A full-length protein-coding chicken atpgd1 sequence (cDNA) was deposited in GenBankTM with accession number GU453679. The sequence of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) atpgd1 was reconstituted from ESTs CD648102.1, CD648025.1, CD647140.1, CD649213.1, and CV089447.1 (GenBank accession number BK007044). Other ESTs provided at least 2-fold additional coverage of the entire sequence and confirmed the deduced peptide sequence. Human brain and mouse muscle and brain cDNA were used to PCR amplify the open reading frames encoding human and mouse Atpgd1 (GenBank accession numbers NM_001166222 and NM_134148, respectively) using Pfu DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 m betaine. Human brain ATPGD1 was amplified using a 5′ primer containing the initiator codon (GTGGAATTCTATGCTCTCCCTGGATCCATCG) preceded by an EcoRI site and a 3′ primer containing the stop codon (CAGGCGGCCGCCTATTTGAAGTGAGACAGGAAG) flanked by a NotI site. Similarly, a 5′ primer containing the initiator codon (GTGGAATTCTATGCTCTGCCTGGATCCACTG) and a 3′ primer containing the stop codon (CAGGCGGCCGCCTATTTGAAATGAGACAGGAAATG) were used for amplification of mouse muscle and brain Atpgd1. The amplified DNA products of the expected size were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the pEF6/HisB expression vector (Invitrogen), which allows the production of proteins with an N-terminal His6 tag, and was verified by sequencing. The sequences of mouse brain and muscle Atpgd1 were the same, and only the construct derived from muscle was used in further experiments. For transfections, HEK-293T cells were plated in 85-mm Petri dishes at a cell density of 2.1 × 106 cells/plate in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and grown in a humidified incubator under 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 24 h, each plate was transfected with 6 μg of the appropriate vector using the TurboFect transfection reagent (Fermentas) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After 48 h the culture medium was removed, the cells were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of antipain. The cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and after thawing and vortexing, the extracts were incubated on ice with 125 units/ml of DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C (15,000 × g for 30 min) to remove insoluble material. For the purification of mouse and human recombinant ATPGD1, the supernatant (17 ml) was diluted 2-fold with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of antipain) and applied on a HisTrap HP column (1 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A and the retained protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole (60–300 mm, 60 ml) in buffer A. Both human and mouse ATPGD1 were eluted with 150–300 mm imidazole in homogeneous form as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The enzyme preparations were desalted on PD-10 columns equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to Bradford (18.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. 0.5 (mouse) or 1 mg (human) of pure recombinant enzyme was obtained from 40 or 70 mg of soluble HEK293T cell protein, respectively. The purified enzymes were supplemented with 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and stored at −70 °C. To obtain a sufficient amount of the dipeptide formed in the reaction catalyzed by recombinant mouse ATPGD1 for mass spectrometry analysis, the reaction mixture was scaled up 10-fold. Briefly, 14 μg of mouse ATPGD1 were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 μg of bovine serum albumin derived from the enzyme preparation, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm β-alanine, 3 mml-histidine, in the absence or presence of 3 mm MgATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 30% (w/v) HClO4. After neutralization with 3 m K2CO3, the salts were removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) and the clear supernatant was diluted 5 times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The sample (6 ml) was applied to AG50W-X4 column (1 ml, Na+ form), the unreacted substrates were removed by washing with 12 ml of the same buffer, and the dipeptide was eluted with 2 ml of 1 m NH4OH. The purified dipeptide was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 1 ml of 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and N-acetylated with 10% acetic anhydride (Ac2O, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Carnosine and N-acetylcarnosine were further purified by HPLC on a Hypercarb 2.1 × 150-mm column (ThermoHypersil) in a 5–50% gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column eluent was monitored with a UV detector at λ = 210 nm. All mass spectral analyses were performed on a LCQ Deca XP ion-trap spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source (Thermo Scientific). The sample dissolved in methanol was introduced directly into the source at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. The LCQ was operated in positive mode under manual control in the Tune Plus view with default parameters and active automatic gain control. To confirm the structure of the precursor ions, low-energy collision-induced dissociation (relative collision energy of 25%) was utilized. Vmax and Km for the peptide synthase activity of studied enzymes were calculated with Prism 4.0 (GraphPad software) using a nonlinear regression. During its purification, carnosine synthase activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of [3H]β-alanine to [3H]carnosine in the presence of l-histidine and ATP. Carnosine synthase was purified from chicken breast muscle about 1500-fold by a procedure involving chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, Superdex-200, and ATP-Sepharose. The ligase was eluted as a single peak in each of the purification steps (Fig. 1), indicating the presence of a single enzyme species. The gel filtration step on Superdex-200 disclosed that the size of native carnosine synthase was ≈415 kDa (not shown). The overall yield of the purification was only about 1.2% (Table 1), but this low yield was due to the fact that only the most active fractions from one step were used for the next one. For instance, only fraction 27 of the Superdex-200 column (i.e. only about 28% of the recovered activity) was used for the final affinity chromatography.TABLE 1Purification of carnosine synthase from chicken pectoral muscleFractionVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgpmol min−1pmol min−1mg−1-fold%15,000 × g supernatant75017,24012,7100.741100DEAE-Sepharose55.664.74,45968.99335.1Q-Sepharose2316.73,77522630529.7Superdex 20032.271,66073198713.0ATP-SepharoseaThe data represent values only for the most purified fraction.0.40.1391561,1191,5121.2a The data represent values only for the most purified fraction. Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that carnosine synthase coeluted with two major polypeptides of about 100 and 90 kDa in the last purification step (cf. Fig. 1). Both bands were cut from the gel, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry and compared with the chicken, mouse, and human proteomes. Surprisingly, the analysis indicated that both bands contained heat-shock protein 90-α (Hsp90) as well as other proteins, but that none of these appeared to correspond to a putative ATP-dependent ligase. Similar negative results were obtained when the whole ATP-Sepharose-purified fraction was analyzed by tandem MS after trypsin digestion (not shown). The availability of a substantially purified carnosine synthase preparation enabled us to identify the nucleotide produced from ATP by this enzyme. Fig. 2 shows an experiment in which we followed carnosine synthesis catalyzed by the 1000-fold purified carnosine synthase preparation in the presence of 1 mm β-alanine, 3 mml-histidine, and 1 mm ATP. Carnosine formation was determined with the radiochemical assay, and ADP and AMP formation by HPLC. The incubation mixture was supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, a nonspecific inhibitor of many ATPases and phosphatases, and 100 μm Ap5A, to prevent any conversion of AMP to ADP by traces of adenylate kinase that still contaminated the preparation (19.Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The figure shows that the formation of carnosine was matched by a stoichiometric formation of ADP, if one took into account the slight ATPase activity observed in the absence of l-histidine and β-alanine (possibly contributed by Hsp90). Remarkably, barely any formation of AMP was detected (4 μm in 60 min as compared with ≈150 μm carnosine during the same time). To verify whether adenylate kinase was inactive under our assay condition, we replaced β-alanine and l-histidine with 100 μm AMP in the reaction mixture and checked the concentration of this nucleotide after increasing incubation times. Less than 3% AMP was consumed after 1 h (not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that carnosine synthase catalyzes the reaction: β-alanine + l-histidine + ATP → carnosine + ADP + inorganic phosphate. The finding that carnosine synthase converts ATP to ADP during carnosine synthesis suggested that this enzyme most probably belonged to the ATP-grasp superfamily. The latter includes mostly enzymes catalyzing ATP-dependent ligation of a carboxylate-containing molecule to an amine- or thiol-containing molecule with concomitant formation of ADP and Pi (22.Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We searched the pfam data base for human or mouse proteins of the ATP-grasp family with unknown function and checked their size and tissue distribution (BioGPS data base and Huge Protein data base (23.Nagase T.

https://openalex.org/W2010571219,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) binds diverse ligands to transcriptionally regulate metabolism and inflammation. Activators of PPARgamma include lipids and anti-hyperglycemic drugs such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Recently, TZDs have raised concern after being linked with increased risk of peripheral edema, weight gain, and adverse cardiovascular events. Most reported endogenous PPARgamma ligands are intermediates of lipid metabolism and oxidation that bind PPARgamma with very low affinity. In contrast, nitro derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids (NO(2)-FA) are endogenous products of nitric oxide ((*)NO) and nitrite (NO(2)(-))-mediated redox reactions that activate PPARgamma at nanomolar concentrations. We report that NO(2)-FA act as partial agonists of PPARgamma and covalently bind PPARgamma at Cys-285 via Michael addition. NO(2)-FA show selective PPARgamma modulator characteristics by inducing coregulator protein interactions, PPARgamma-dependent expression of key target genes, and lipid accumulation is distinctively different from responses induced by the TZD rosiglitazone. Administration of this class of signaling mediators to ob/ob mice revealed that NO(2)-FA lower insulin and glucose levels without inducing adverse side effects such as the increased weight gain induced by TZDs."
https://openalex.org/W2056315941,"At the core of the mammalian circadian clock is a negative feedback loop in which the dimeric transcription factor CLOCK-BMAL1 drives processes that in turn suppress its transcriptional activity. To gain insight into the mechanisms of circadian feedback, we analyzed mouse protein complexes containing BMAL1. Receptor for activated C kinase-1 (RACK1) and protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha) were recruited in a circadian manner into a nuclear BMAL1 complex during the negative feedback phase of the cycle. Overexpression of RACK1 and PKCalpha suppressed CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity, and RACK1 stimulated phosphorylation of BMAL1 by PKCalpha in vitro. Depletion of endogenous RACK1 or PKCalpha from fibroblasts shortened the circadian period, demonstrating that both molecules function in the clock oscillatory mechanism. Thus, the classical PKC signaling pathway is not limited to relaying external stimuli but is rhythmically activated by internal processes, forming an integral part of the circadian feedback loop."

In limited types of cells, viral RNA is detected by certain membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, in most cell types, viral RNA is recognized by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) RIG-I and MDA5. Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two CARD modules at their N terminus and a DexD/H-box RNA helicase domain at their C terminus. Upon viral infection, the RNA helicase domains of RIG-I and MDA5 serve as intracellular viral RNA receptors. The recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5 leads to their recruitment to the downstream mitochondrion-located CARD-containing adapter protein VISA (also known as MAVS, IPS-1, and Cardif) (6.Sun Q.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that in unstimulated cells, TRAF2/3 and cIAP1/2 form a cytoplasmic complex, which constitutively ubiquitinates NIK and promotes its proteasome-dependent degradation (28.Zarnegar B.J.

Upon stimulation by TNF family members, such as BAFF and CD40L, the TRAF2/3-cIAP1/2 complex is recruited to the receptors, where cIAP1/2 mediate Lys-48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3. Such ubiquitination of TRAF3 is critical for activation of downstream MEKK and MAPK kinase cascades (30.Matsuzawa A. Tseng P.H. Vallabhapurapu S. Luo J.L. Zhang W. Wang H. Vignali D.A. Gallagher E. Karin M. Science. 2008; 321: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this report, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 caused TRAF3 ubiquitination following viral infection and this is essential for virus-triggered IRF3 activation as well as IFN-β induction. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms on how TRAF3 is positively regulated in the virus-triggered signaling pathways and cellular antiviral response.DISCUSSIONVirus-triggered induction of type I IFNs is crucial for the early innate antiviral response as well as late stage adaptive immunity. This process is delicately regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by various molecules and distinct mechanisms. Ubiquitination has emerged as critical post-translational regulatory mechanisms for activation or attenuation of the virus-triggered IFN response pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for the adapter protein TRAF3 and TRAF6 in the virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs (17.Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 18.Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). However, how TRAF3 and TRAF6 are regulated in virus-triggered IFN induction pathways is not understood. In this report, we demonstrate that TRAF3 and TRAF6 are ubiquitinated by cIAP1 and cIAP2 after viral infection, which are important for virus-triggered IFN induction.Because of the close partnership between cIAP1/2 and TRAF3/6, critical mediators of the virus-triggered signaling pathways, we investigated the involvement of cIAP1/2 in these processes. Knockdown of either cIAP1 or cIAP2 strongly inhibited virus-triggered activation of IRF3 and NF-κB, as well as IFN-β induction. Interestingly, knockdown of cIAP1 and cIAP2 also potently inhibited cytoplasmic poly(I:C) and B-DNA-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter. In plaque assays, knockdown of either cIAP1 or cIAP2 enhanced VSV replication and abrogated cytoplasmic poly(I:C)-mediated cellular antiviral activity. Taken together, these studies suggest that cIAP1/2 play important roles in virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs and cellular antiviral response.Several lines of evidences suggest that cIAP1/2 target TRAF3/6 in the virus-triggered signaling pathways. Firstly, reporter assays indicated that knockdown of cIAP1/2 inhibited upstream signaling components RIG-I-, MDA5-, VISA- but not downstream TBK1-, IRF3-, and p65-mediated signaling. This is consistent with the molecular orders of TRAF3/6 in the pathways; Second, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the associations of cIAP1/2 and TRAF3/6 was increased following viral infection. This increase reflected the recruitment of cIAP1/2 to mitochondrial associated TRAF3; Third, several experiments indicated that virus-triggered TRAF3 ubiquitination was abrogated by both RNAi- and Smac mimetic-mediated knockdown of cIAP1/2.In BAFF and CD40L-mediated signaling pathways, cIAP1/2 catalyze Lys-48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and subsequent degradation of TRAF3 by the proteasomes is critical for activating downstream kinase cascades (30.Matsuzawa A. Tseng P.H. Vallabhapurapu S. Luo J.L. Zhang W. Wang H. Vignali D.A. Gallagher E. Karin M. Science. 2008; 321: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This mechanism is obviously not the case in virus-triggered signaling pathways. In our experiments, we found that cIAP1/2 could catalyze both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3/6. Viral infection also induced both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3, which was completely inhibited by knockdown of cIAP1 and cIAP2. In addition, viral infection or cIAP1/2 overexpression did not cause noticeable degradation of TRAF3/6. These results suggest that degradation of TRAF3/6 is not required for virus-triggered IFN induction pathways. It is possible that polyubiquitins conjugated to TRAF3/6 are capable of activating downstream kinases, such as TBK1, IKKϵ, and TAK1. Interestingly, time course experiments indicated that virus-triggered ubiquitination of TRAF3/6 was temporally regulated by distinctly linked polyubiquitin moieties: the early stage of ubiquitination was primarily K48-linked whereas the later stage K63-linked. The functional significance of this temporal regulation of ubiquitination is currently unknown.A recent study suggest that cIAP1/2 ubiquitinate RIP2 and are required for innate immune responses mediated by the PRRs NOD1 and NOD2, which sense intracellular bacteria infection (33.Bertrand M.J. Doiron K. Labbé K. Korneluk R.G. Barker P.A. Saleh M. Immunity. 2009; 30: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In light of this and our study, it is possible that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are generally involved in innate immune responses mediated by a variety of PRRs.

Type I IFNs activate the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathways, leading to transcriptional induction of a wide range of downstream antiviral genes and subsequent innate antiviral response (4.Honda K.

In limited types of cells, viral RNA is detected by certain membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, in most cell types, viral RNA is recognized by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) RIG-I and MDA5. Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain two CARD modules at their N terminus and a DexD/H-box RNA helicase domain at their C terminus. Upon viral infection, the RNA helicase domains of RIG-I and MDA5 serve as intracellular viral RNA receptors. The recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I and MDA5 leads to their recruitment to the downstream mitochondrion-located CARD-containing adapter protein VISA (also known as MAVS, IPS-1, and Cardif) (6.Sun Q.

https://openalex.org/W2013898850,"Background Subsurface fluids from deep-sea hydrocarbon seeps undergo methane- and sulfur-cycling microbial transformations near the sediment surface. Hydrocarbon seep habitats are naturally patchy, with a mosaic of active seep sediments and non-seep sediments. Microbial community shifts and changing activity patterns on small spatial scales from seep to non-seep sediment remain to be examined in a comprehensive habitat study. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a transect of biogeochemical measurements and gene expression related to methane- and sulfur-cycling at different sediment depths across a broad Beggiatoa spp. mat at Mississippi Canyon 118 (MC118) in the Gulf of Mexico. High process rates within the mat (∼400 cm and ∼10 cm from the mat's edge) contrasted with sharply diminished activity at ∼50 cm outside the mat, as shown by sulfate and methane concentration profiles, radiotracer rates of sulfate reduction and methane oxidation, and stable carbon isotopes. Likewise, 16S ribosomal rRNA, dsrAB (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) and mcrA (methyl coenzyme M reductase) mRNA transcripts of sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae) and methane-cycling archaea (ANME-1 and ANME-2) were prevalent at the sediment surface under the mat and at its edge. Outside the mat at the surface, 16S rRNA sequences indicated mostly aerobes commonly found in seawater. The seep-related communities persisted at 12–20 cm depth inside and outside the mat. 16S rRNA transcripts and V6-tags reveal that bacterial and archaeal diversity underneath the mat are similar to each other, in contrast to oxic or microoxic habitats that have higher bacterial diversity. Conclusions/Significance The visual patchiness of microbial mats reflects sharp discontinuities in microbial community structure and activity over sub-meter spatial scales; these discontinuities have to be taken into account in geochemical and microbiological inventories of seep environments. In contrast, 12–20 cm deep in the sediments microbial communities performing methane-cycling and sulfate reduction persist at lower metabolic rates regardless of mat cover, and may increase activity rapidly when subsurface flow changes."
https://openalex.org/W2025167511,"Space and Spikelets In neurons, spikelets are voltage fluctuations of small amplitude with a spike-like waveform. Spikelets are difficult to detect with extracellular techniques traditionally used to record neuronal activity in freely moving animals. Epsztein et al. (p. 474 ) used head-anchored whole-cell recordings to analyze spikelet activity during spatial exploration in freely moving rats. A high incidence of spikelets was often followed by action potentials. Like action potentials, spikelets were all-or-none, but had different kinetics and amplitude, and were clearly distinct from excitatory postsynaptic potentials and occurred to a different extent in different cells. In cells with clear place fields, spikelets had similar spatial firing preferences, as did regular action potentials. Thus, spatially modulated spikelets may be involved in information processing in cortical neuronal networks."
https://openalex.org/W1984028174,"Epitaxial growth, a bottom-up self-assembly process for creating surface nano- and microstructures, has been extensively studied in the context of atoms. This process, however, is also a promising route to self-assembly of nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles into microstructures that have numerous technological applications. To determine whether atomic epitaxial growth laws are applicable to the epitaxy of larger particles with attractive interactions, we investigated the nucleation and growth dynamics of colloidal crystal films with single-particle resolution. We show quantitatively that colloidal epitaxy obeys the same two-dimensional island nucleation and growth laws that govern atomic epitaxy. However, we found that in colloidal epitaxy, step-edge and corner barriers that are responsible for film morphology have a diffusive origin. This diffusive mechanism suggests new routes toward controlling film morphology during epitaxy."

It has become increasingly clear that loss of cell-cell adhesion in PV is a complex and active process involving multiple signaling events such as activation of p38MAPK. It has also been demonstrated that incubating keratinocytes with PV IgG causes a redistribution of DSG3 from the cell surface to endosomes, which target these proteins for degradation. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between p38MAPK and DSG3 endocytosis in pemphigus. In this work, we confirm that PV IgG causes internalization of cell-surface DSG3 into endosomes (as early as 4 h), which are then depleted from both detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble pools. Cell-surface DSG3 internalization and depletion from both the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions were blocked by the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190. These data suggest that p38MAPK is capable of regulating PV IgG-mediated DSG3 internalization and that previously isolated mechanistic observations may be linked to a common pathway by which pemphigus autoantibodies lead to acantholysis.

https://openalex.org/W2031389208,"MAPK and Akt pathways are predominant mediators of trophic signaling for many neuronal systems. Among the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/glucagon family of related peptides, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) binding to specific PAC1 receptor isoforms can engage multiple signaling pathways and promote neuroprotection through mechanisms that are not well understood. Using a primary sympathetic neuronal system, the current studies demonstrate that PACAP activation of PAC1HOP1 receptors engages both MAPK and Akt neurotrophic pathways in an integrated program to facilitate neuronal survival after growth factor withdrawal. PACAP not only stimulated prosurvival ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation but also abrogated SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK signaling in parallel. In contrast to the potent and rapid effects of PACAP in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, PACAP stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a late phase of PAC1HOP1 receptor signaling. From inhibitor and immunoprecipitation analyses, the PACAP/PAC1HOP1 receptor-mediated Akt responses did not represent transactivation mechanisms but appeared to depend on Gαq/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ activity and vesicular internalization pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ-selective inhibitors blocked PACAP-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in primary neuronal cultures and in PAC1HOP1-overexpressing cell lines; RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the receptor effectors attenuated PACAP-mediated Akt activation. Similarly, perturbation of endocytic pathways also blocked Akt phosphorylation. Between ERK and Akt pathways, PACAP-stimulated Akt signaling was the primary cascade that attenuated cultured neuron apoptosis after growth factor withdrawal. The partitioning of PACAP-mediated Akt signaling in endosomes may be a key mechanism contributing to the high spatial and temporal specificity in signal transduction necessary for survival pathways. MAPK and Akt pathways are predominant mediators of trophic signaling for many neuronal systems. Among the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/glucagon family of related peptides, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) binding to specific PAC1 receptor isoforms can engage multiple signaling pathways and promote neuroprotection through mechanisms that are not well understood.

Two α-amidated forms of PACAP arise from alternative post-translational processing of the 175-amino acid rat precursor molecule; PACAP38 has 38 amino acid residues (proPACAP-(131–168)), whereasPACAP27 corresponds to the amino terminus of PACAP38 (proPACAP-(131–157)). As PACAP and VIP appear to stem from the same molecular cladistic tree during evolution (1.Sherwood N.M. Krueckl S.L. McRory J.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 619-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), the two peptides not only share considerable structural homology but also function through three distinct G protein-coupled receptors (2.Spengler D.

Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Only PACAP peptides exhibit high affinity for the PAC1 receptor, whereas VIP and PACAP have similar high affinities for the VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. Although VPAC receptors appear to be coupled predominantly to adenylyl cyclase, PAC1 receptor isoforms can display unique patterns of second messenger activation through the alternative splicing of HIP and/or HOP cassettes in the region encoding the third cytoplasmic loop (2.Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the PAC1 receptor isoforms with neither HIP nor HOP (PAC1null receptor), HIP (PAC1HIP), HOP1 (PAC1HOP1), a shortened form of HOP1 termed HOP2, or HIPHOP (PAC1HIPHOP) cassette inserts can engage distinct or multiple intracellular signaling cascades. The PAC1null receptor expressed in rat cortical neuroblasts, for example, is coupled primarily to Gs for adenylate cyclase activation (9.Nicot A. DiCicco-Bloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4758-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PAC1HIP receptor expression in LLC-PK1 porcine kidney epithelial cells or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts results in adenylate cyclase activation but with impaired phospholipase C coupling. The PAC1HOP1 receptor, by contrast, is dually coupled to Gαs and Gαq/11 to potently and efficaciously stimulate adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and other intracellular effectors that in aggregate have the potential of generating diverse cellular response (2.Spengler D.

The PAC1HOP1 receptor is a significant variant in nearly all neural tissues, and dominant PAC1HOP1 receptor expression and signaling in primary cerebellar granule and sympathetic cells appear key in promoting neuronal survival from apoptosis after growth factor or serum withdrawal, cessation of depolarizing conditions, or cytotoxic challenges (10.Villalba M.

Despite these well studied prosurvival effects, the dynamic events underlying PACAP/PAC1 neurotrophic signaling are still not well understood. To examine the abilities for PACAP/PAC1 receptor signaling to engage and coordinate these events in one neuronal system, we have employed primary sympathetic neurons that we have shown previously to preferentially express the PAC1HOP1 receptor isoform (13.May V. Braas K.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37.Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the highly conserved members of the MAPK family, including ERK1 and ERK2 (p44 and p42, respectively), ERK5, JNK, and p38 MAPK, have been well described to participate in neuronal development, differentiation, cell cycle progression, and survival; how PAC1HOP1 receptor signaling impacts one or all of the MAPKs is not known. Moreover, prosurvival mechanisms for many central and peripheral neuronal systems can also stem from PI3K/Akt signaling. PI3K facilitates neurotrophin-mediated survival in cerebellar, sympathetic, sensory, cortical, and motor neurons and targets Akt serine/threonine kinase as a central mediator of the trophic response (39.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 40.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Although the potent neuroprotective effects of PACAP in a variety of injury paradigms strongly implicate PACAP/PAC1 receptor convergence on PI3K/Akt pathways, the mechanisms and contributions of Akt activation with MAPK cascades in PAC1HOP1 receptor-mediated neurotrophic signaling have not been well examined. Using an in vitro growth factor withdrawal paradigm, the current studies demonstrated that PACAP can regulate multiple sympathetic MAPKs in distinct temporal patterns consistent with neuronal survival processes. Furthermore, PACAP also stimulated late phase Akt signaling in a Gαq/PI3Kγ- and vesicular internalization-dependent manner that did not appear to rely on tyrosine receptor kinase mechanisms. Although PACAP stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt pathways, comparative studies showed that the prosurvival responses of sympathetic PACAP/PAC1HOP1 receptor signaling rested predominantly with PI3K/Akt activation. These studies show that sympathetic PAC1HOP1 receptor neurotrophic signaling reflects a complex, coordinate, and multifaceted strategy to facilitate neuronal survival, repair, and/or development after injury. Late gestation female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Charles Rivers Canada; all animal procedures were approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Superior cervical ganglia from mixed sex neonatal (postnatal day 1–2) rat litters were dissected for primary sympathetic neuronal cultures as previously described (13.May V. Braas K.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37.Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol.

The pooled ganglia were enzymatically dispersed, and the resulting cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 104 neurons/cm2 on double-collagen coated dishes, treated with cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside to eliminate nonneuronal cells, and maintained in defined complete serum-free medium containing 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) for 8–10 days before treatments. In PACAP signaling studies NGF was acutely withdrawn from mature sympathetic neuronal cultures as described under “Results.” The cultures were rinsed once and maintained in complete serum-free medium without NGF supplements for the times shown; an NGF neutralizing antiserum (1 μg/ml; monoclonal 27/21, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was also included in some experiments. Cultures were treated with PACAP27 or PACAP38 (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA) at the indicated concentrations prepared from 100 μm stocks. All inhibitors were prepared from 100- or 1000-fold stocks in DMSO or methanol, and the efficacy of these reagents was tested in previous work (37.Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38.Beaudet M.M. Parsons R.L. Braas K.M. May V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors H89 (25 μm), PD98059 (25 μm), LY294002 (25 μm), LY30311 (25 μm), bisindolylmaleimide I (15 μm), PP1 (10 μm), K252a (200 nm), cycloheximide (5 μg/ml), brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), chlorpromazine (10 μg/ml), and nystatin (10 μg/ml) were all from Calbiochem. Monodansylcadaverine (200 μm) and filipin (5 μg/ml) were from Sigma. AS252424 and AS605240 were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Dynasore reagent was from Thomas Kirchhausen (Harvard Medical School). For cell viability assessments, replicate sympathetic neuronal cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated in bisbenzimide 33258 (1 μg/ml, Hoechst reagent, Sigma) for 10 min before mounting in anti-fade medium and visualization by fluorescence microscopy using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/Hoechst/AMCA filter set (Chroma, Brattleboro, VT). For routine measurements, 10 random fields per culture were enumerated for total and condensed nuclei staining. Biochemical viability assays were also performed to complement the morphological analyses. After treatments, 20 μl of the MTS tetrazolium salt/phenazine methosulfate solution (AQueous Assay, Promega, Madison, WI) was added directly to sympathetic neuronal cultures with 100 μl of serum-free medium in 96-well tissue culture plates. The dishes were returned to the humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4–6 h before spectrophotometric quantitation of the metabolized MTS formazan reaction product in the medium at 490 nm using an absorbance microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data represent the mean of 5–6 culture replicates ±S.E. One-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls post hoc analyses were used to determine differences among treatment; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Control and treated cultures were extracted with 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing 0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (16 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and phosphatase inhibitor mix (5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride) (44.May V.

Pept. 2004; 123: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Total sample proteins were determined using the BCA reagent (Pierce). For Western analyses, protein samples (30 μg) were fractionated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), blocked, and incubated with primary antisera for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (44.May V. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6980-6990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or quantitative infrared imaging (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Pan and phospho-specific antisera to ERK1/2, ERK5, JNK, p38, and Akt were all from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Pan and phosphorylated TrkA antisera were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA); actin antiserum was from Sigma. For reprobing, the blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min before the readdition of antisera. For these analyses the blots were hybridized first with antibodies that generated weaker signals before reprobing with those that produced stronger bands. In all instances, antibody to actin or total Akt was applied to the blots at the conclusion of the experiment. ERK activity assays were performed using an Elk-1 fusion protein substrate (p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase assay; Cell Signaling). Briefly, treated sympathetic cultures in 6-well culture plates were harvested in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. After sample incubation with p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody-coupled agarose beads for 24 h at 4 °C, the beads were recovered and incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg Elk-1 fusion protein. The reaction was terminated after 30 min, and the samples were fractionated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blotting using a 1:1000 phospho-Elk-1 antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Immunoprecipitations were performed as in previous work (46.May V. Stoffers D.A. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cleared cell lysate supernatants were incubated with 1:100 anti-TrkA overnight at 4 °C, and the samples were incubated subsequently with 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-agarose (Sigma) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The immune complexes were washed in several changes in lysis buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and boiled before SDS-PAGE fractionation and Western blotting as above using a phosphotyrosine antibody (pY-100; Cell Signaling). Control and treated sympathetic neurons were cultured on collagen-coated Aclar dishes for immunocytochemistry as described (37.Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and incubated in 1:500 anti-phosphoERK1/2 (Promega) for 24 h at 4 °C. Phosphorylated ERK was localized by culture incubation with 1:500 indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG and imaged with a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope equipped with a Cy3 filter set (37.Braas K.M. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mouse Gβ(1–4) monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; sc-166123, 1:50); rabbit monoclonal antibody to phosphoAkt (Ser-473) was from Cell Signaling (D9E, 1:50). The construction scheme for the PAC1HOP1-GFP expression plasmid is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. To create the carboxyl-terminal GFP-tagged receptor construct, the human PAC1HOP1 receptor cDNA clone (EM4 (47.Lutz E.M. Ronaldson E. Shaw P. Johnson M.S. Holland P.J. Mitchell R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) was amplified using synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs hPRD03 (5′-CCCAGAGACACATTGGGGCTGAC-3′) and hPAC1AgeCT.rp (5′-GGGAGACCGGTCCGGTGGCCAG-3′) and the KOD DNA polymerase system (Novagen, Merck Biosciences UK); the PAC1HOP1 stop codon was replaced with a Gly codon, and an AgeI restriction site was engineered into the sequence. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the 1.4-kb PCR amplification product was purified using Qiaex II silica particles (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) and subcloned into the pCR4Blunt-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Clones with the appropriate insert size and restriction patterns were then digested with EcoRI/AgeI, and the PAC1HOP1 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/AgeI site of pAcGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The reading frames and sequence integrity of selected clones were verified by restriction digest and by nucleotide sequence analysis; clone 4t26 was used for all expression studies. AtT-20 cells were transfected with the full-length PAC1HOP1 receptor expression plasmid by electroporation and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% NuSerum, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin for stable cell selection. Functional expression of the PAC1HOP1 receptor was verified by PCR analyses and PACAP-induced stimulation of MAPK and calcium signaling. For knockdown studies, 70% confluent cells in 24-well plates were transfected with siRNAs to mouse Gαq or PI3K p110γ subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine 2000 (10 pmol of siRNA/2 μl of transfection reagent; Invitrogen). The medium was replaced after 8 h, and the cells were maintained in culture for an additional 48 h before treatments. Adenovirus for wild type and dominant negative (K44A) dynamin were obtained from Yoram Altschuler (Hebrew University of Jerusalem). For biolistic gene transfer, PAC1HOP1-GFP DNA coated onto 1.6-μm gold particles were delivered to primary sympathetic neuronal cultures at 180 p.s.i. Overexpression or knockdown of the effector targets was verified by Western analyses or immunocytochemistry. Mock and control siRNA transfections did not alter transcript expression in all cases. Previous studies have demonstrated the potent trophic properties of PACAP in many central and peripheral neuronal systems (1.Sherwood N.M. Krueckl S.L. McRory J.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 619-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 34.Arimura A. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1998; 48: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 36.Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all sympathetic superior cervical ganglion neurons express the PACAP-selective PAC1HOP1 receptor isoform, and receptor activation with PACAP peptides promoted neuronal survival after NGF withdrawal from growth factor-dependent immature sympathetic neurons (Fig. 1). Whereas NGF withdrawal and/or the addition of NGF-neutralizing antibodies to primary neonatal sympathetic cultures induced cell death to more than 50% that of the neurons within 18–24 h, the addition of 100 nm PACAP27 or PACAP38 to the cultures abrogated apoptotic signals and facilitated survival of most neurons (Fig. 1, A–C). The extent of neuronal cell death was accentuated by 48 h when >90% of the NGF-deprived neurons underwent apoptosis as measured by biochemical survival assays (Fig. 1D). PACAP-mediated neuroprotection was ∼50% over the same 48-h period, which appeared congruent with previous work, suggesting that the protective properties of PACAP were transient (28.Chang J.Y. Korolev V.V. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By contrast, VIP rescued only 15% of the neurons in the chronic NGF withdrawal paradigm, which was consistent with the preferential expression of sympathetic PAC1HOP1 receptor selectivity for PACAP peptides. The PAC1HOP1 receptor can engage several signaling cascades, and in evaluating the relevant mechanisms for neuroprotection, PACAP stimulated multiple MAPK pathways with different temporal dynamics (Fig. 2).

Previously we reported that PTH induces matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) transcription in osteoblastic cells. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) interacts with Runx2, binds the MMP-13 promoter, and suppresses MMP-13 gene transcription in the rat osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01. PTH induces the rapid cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent release of HDAC4 from the MMP-13 promoter and subsequent transcription of MMP-13. Knock-out of HDAC4 either by siRNA in vitro or by gene deletion in vivo leads to an increase in MMP-13 expression, and overexpression of HDAC4 decreases the PTH induction of MMP-13. All of these observations indicate that HDAC4 represses MMP-13 gene transcription in bone. Moreover, PTH stimulates HDAC4 gene expression and enzymatic activity at times corresponding to the reassociation of HDAC4 with the MMP-13 promoter and a decline in its transcription. Thus, HDAC4 is a basal repressor of MMP-13 transcription, and PTH regulates HDAC4 to control MMP-13 promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2045066522,"Background Anti-angiogenic treatments of malignant tumors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase are being used in different early stages of clinical trials. Very recently, VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Vetanalib, PTK787) was used in glioma patient in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, changes in the tumor size, tumor vascular permeability, vascular density, expression of VEGFR2 and other angiogenic factors in response to PTK787 are not well documented. This study was to determine the changes in tumor size, vascular permeability, fractional plasma volume and expression of VEGFR2 in PTK787 treated U-251 glioma rat model by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The findings were validated with histochemical and western blot studies. Methodologies and Principal Findings Seven days after implantation of U251 glioma cells, animals were treated with either PTK787 or vehicle-only for two weeks, and then tumor size, tumor vascular permeability transfer constant (Ktrans), fractional plasma volume (fPV) and expression of VEGFR2 and other relevant angiogenic factors were assessed by in vivo MRI and SPECT (Tc-99-HYNIC-VEGF), and by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) using a high molecular weight contrast agent albumin-(GdDTPA) showed significantly increased Ktrans at the rim of the treated tumors compared to that of the central part of the treated as well as the untreated (vehicle treated) tumors. Size of the tumors was also increased in the treated group. Expression of VEGFR2 detected by Tc-99m-HYNIC-VEGF SPECT also showed significantly increased activity in the treated tumors. In PTK787-treated tumors, histological staining revealed increase in microvessel density in the close proximity to the tumor border. Western blot analysis indicated increased expression of VEGF, SDF-1, HIF-1α, VEGFR2, VEGFR3 and EGFR at the peripheral part of the treated tumors compared to that of central part of the treated tumors. Similar expression patters were not observed in vehicle treated tumors. Conclusion These findings indicate that PTK787 treatment induced over expression of VEGF as well as the Flk-1/VEGFR2 receptor tyrosine kinase, especially at the rim of the tumor, as proven by DCE-MRI, SPECT imaging, immunohistochemistry and western blot."

There is a growing interest in targeting aerobic glycolysis for cancer therapy by exploiting the differential susceptibility of malignant versus normal cells to glycolytic inhibition, of which the proof-of-concept is provided by the in vivo efficacy of dietary caloric restriction and natural product-based energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs) such as resveratrol and 2-deoxyglucose in suppressing carcinogenesis in animal models.

Nephrol. 2005; 1: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These TZDs improve insulin sensitivity by transcriptional activation of insulin-sensitive genes involved in glucose homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and triacylglycerol storage in adipocytes and promote the differentiation of preadipocytes by mimicking the genomic effects of insulin (3.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4.Sharma A.M. Staels B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Moreover, TZD-mediated PPARγ activation has been shown to promote the differentiation of preadipocytes by mimicking the genomic effects of insulin on adipocytes and to modulate the expression of adiponectin, pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α and a host of endocrine regulators in adipocytes and macrophages (3.Olefsky J.M.

Through these beneficial effects, TZDs offer a new type of oral therapy for type II diabetes by reducing insulin resistance and assisting glycemic control.Like adipocytes, many human cancer cell lines exhibit high levels of PPARγ expression. In vitro exposure of these tumor cells to high doses (≥50 μm) of troglitazone and ciglitazone led to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and redifferentiation (5.Grommes C. Landreth G.E. Heneka M.T.

Furthermore, the in vivo anticancer efficacy of troglitazone was demonstrated in a few clinical cases that involved patients with liposarcomas or prostate cancer (10.Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Naujoks R. Campbell N. Spiegelman B.M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 11.Hisatake J.I. Ikezoe T. Carey M. Holden S. Tomoyasu S. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5494-5498PubMed Google Scholar). Although the identities of target genes that contribute to the antiproliferative activities of PPARγ agonists remain elusive (7.Koeffler H.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), accumulating evidence indicates that TZDs mediate PPARγ-independent antitumor effects by targeting diverse signaling pathways governing the proliferation and survival of cancer cells (12.Wei S. Yang J. Lee S.L. Kulp S.K. Chen C.S. Cancer Lett. 2009; 276: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of the various “off target” mechanisms identified, the effects of TZDs on the repression of diverse cell cycle- and apoptosis-regulatory proteins are especially noteworthy (13.Wei S. Lin L.F. Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Chang G.D. Chen H. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Wei S. Lin L.F. Chen C.S. Lee C.C. Lin C.C. Chen C.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that this effect was attributable to the ability of TZDs to activate β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-mediated proteolysis of target proteins, including β-catenin, cyclin D1, and Sp1, by increasing the expression level of β-TrCP, a versatile F-box protein of the Skp1/Cul1/F-box ubiquitin ligase (13.Wei S.

Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, decreased Sp1 expression leads to the transcriptional repression of a series of genes involved in oncogenic transformation (16.Wei S. Chuang H.C. Tsai W.C. Yang H.C. Ho S.R. Paterson A.J. Kulp S.K. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), including those encoding androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor α (ERα), and epidermal growth factor receptor (see Fig. 1A). In contrast, nonmalignant cells are resistant to these PPARγ-independent antitumor effects, underscoring the translational potential of TZDs to develop novel antitumor agents with a unique mode of mechanism. The proof-of-principle of this premise was provided by two PPARγ-inactive derivatives, STG28 and OSU-CG12, which exhibit multifold higher antitumor potencies than the respective parent compounds, troglitazone and ciglitazone, while lacking the ability to transactivate PPARγ (17.Huang J.W.

Here, we demonstrate that troglitazone, ciglitazone, STG28, and OSU-CG12 were able to elicit hallmark cellular responses characteristic of energy restriction in LNCaP prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, paralleling those induced by glucose starvation and two known energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs), 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and resveratrol (19.Baur J.A.

These changes include reduced glycolytic rate, transient induction of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sirt1 (silent information regulator 1) (22.Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A.

This study provides the first evidence that β-TrCP-dependent proteolysis represents a downstream cellular event of transient Sirt1 induction, which underlies the effect of energy restriction on apoptosis induction.DISCUSSIONCancer cells gain growth advantages in the microenvironment by shifting cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect (52.Gatenby R.A.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), resveratrol (19.Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 20.Cucciolla V. Borriello A. Oliva A. Galletti P. Zappia V. Della Ragione F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2495-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and 2-DG (59.Zhu Z. Jiang W. McGinley J.N. Thompson H.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7023-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in suppressing carcinogenesis in various spontaneous or chemical-induced tumor animal models. Because chronic energy restriction proves to be difficult to implement as a chemopreventive strategy, 2-DG and resveratrol have received wide attention because of their abilities to mimic the beneficial effects of energy restriction by inhibiting glucose metabolism and uptake, respectively (19.Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 20.Cucciolla V. Borriello A. Oliva A. Galletti P. Zappia V. Della Ragione F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2495-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 59.Zhu Z. Jiang W. McGinley J.N. Thompson H.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7023-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, as indicated by our data, 2-DG and resveratrol require at least 1 mm and 100 μm, respectively, to attain antitumor activities. Thus, the relatively weak in vitro potencies of these agents limit their therapeutic applications.Here, we demonstrate that TZDs represent a novel class of ERMAs in that they elicit hallmark cellular responses characteristic of energy restriction in a manner reminiscent of that of resveratrol and 2-DG. OSU-CG12 mimicked the effect of energy restriction, as manifested by a reduced glycolytic rate and decreased NADH and lactate production. This drug-induced metabolic deficiency signaled the induction of key starvation-associated responses, including transient Sirt 1 induction, AMPK activation, and ER stress, each of which mediates a distinct signaling pathway culminating in the antiproliferative effects of OSU-CG12 (Fig. 9C). Moreover, these energy restriction-associated responses could be achieved at concentrations in the 5 μm range relative to 100 μm and 5 mm for resveratrol and 2-DG, respectively, indicating that the development of potent ERMAs from the molecular scaffold of TZDs is feasible. From a translational perspective, the development of novel ERMAs with greater antitumor potencies may provide advantages in clinical development.Several lines of evidence suggest that OSU-CG12-mediated inhibition of glucose metabolism might be attributable to the cumulative effect of a series of biochemical events at different stages of drug action, including the immediate responses of reduced glucose uptake and inhibition of mTOR-p70S6K signaling, followed by Akt inactivation and eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, OSU-CG12 inhibits glucose metabolism through effects at different molecular levels, including the cellular uptake of glucose and the transcription of genes associated with glycolysis and energy metabolism. Further investigation of additional mechanisms is currently underway.Previous studies have implicated AMPK activation and ER stress as targets for selective cancer cell killing during calorie restriction (23.Jiang W. Zhu Z. Thompson H.J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 60.Saito S. Furuno A. Sakurai J. Sakamoto A. Park H.R. Shin-Ya K. Tsuruo T. Tomida A. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4225-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the role of Sirt1 in regulating cell death response is less well defined considering its controversial role as a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor (61.Deng C.X. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2009; 5: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Sirt1 is able to regulate epigenetic changes as well as the functions of a broad spectrum of nonhistone signaling proteins via deacetylation (62.Anastasiou D. Krek W. Physiology. 2006; 21: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first evidence that the transient increase in Sirt1 expression plays a crucial role in mediating the induction of apoptosis by ERMAs through the activation of β-TrCP-facilitated proteolysis. It is noteworthy that the Sirt1-mediated up-regulation of β-TrCP expression was achieved through protein stabilization, for which Sirt1 deacetylase activity was critical. This stabilization of β-TrCP protein might be attributable to the ability of Sirt1 to suppress the expression/activity of a specific E3 ligase that targets β-TrCP for proteasome-mediated proteolysis, which is currently under investigation. Moreover, although AMPK has been reported to enhance Sirt1 activity by increasing intracellular NAD+ levels (63.Cantó C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Feige J.N. Lagouge M. Noriega L. Milne J.C. Elliott P.J. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Nature. 2009; 458: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar), our data indicate that neither genetic nor pharmacological inhibition of AMPK had any effect on β-TrCP expression in TZD-treated cancer cells, suggesting that AMPK activation did not play a role in β-TrCP protein stabilization. Although substantial evidence indicates the importance of autophagy in cancer, its role in modulating therapeutic response, by either enhancing or protecting cells from drug-induced cell death, remains unclear (50.Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 51.Tsuchihara K. Fujii S. Esumi H.

In the case of ERMAs, our data suggest that the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis plays a key role in mediating their antiproliferative activities.

Nephrol. 2005; 1: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These TZDs improve insulin sensitivity by transcriptional activation of insulin-sensitive genes involved in glucose homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and triacylglycerol storage in adipocytes and promote the differentiation of preadipocytes by mimicking the genomic effects of insulin (3.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4.Sharma A.M. Staels B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Moreover, TZD-mediated PPARγ activation has been shown to promote the differentiation of preadipocytes by mimicking the genomic effects of insulin on adipocytes and to modulate the expression of adiponectin, pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α and a host of endocrine regulators in adipocytes and macrophages (3.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 4.Sharma A.M. Staels B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Through these beneficial effects, TZDs offer a new type of oral therapy for type II diabetes by reducing insulin resistance and assisting glycemic control.Like adipocytes, many human cancer cell lines exhibit high levels of PPARγ expression. In vitro exposure of these tumor cells to high doses (≥50 μm) of troglitazone and ciglitazone led to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and redifferentiation (5.Grommes C. Landreth G.E. Heneka M.T.

Furthermore, the in vivo anticancer efficacy of troglitazone was demonstrated in a few clinical cases that involved patients with liposarcomas or prostate cancer (10.Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D.

Although the identities of target genes that contribute to the antiproliferative activities of PPARγ agonists remain elusive (7.Koeffler H.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), accumulating evidence indicates that TZDs mediate PPARγ-independent antitumor effects by targeting diverse signaling pathways governing the proliferation and survival of cancer cells (12.Wei S. Yang J. Lee S.L. Kulp S.K. Chen C.S. Cancer Lett. 2009; 276: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of the various “off target” mechanisms identified, the effects of TZDs on the repression of diverse cell cycle- and apoptosis-regulatory proteins are especially noteworthy (13.Wei S. Lin L.F. Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Chang G.D. Chen H. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Wei S. Lin L.F. Chen C.S. Lee C.C. Lin C.C. Chen C.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that this effect was attributable to the ability of TZDs to activate β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-mediated proteolysis of target proteins, including β-catenin, cyclin D1, and Sp1, by increasing the expression level of β-TrCP, a versatile F-box protein of the Skp1/Cul1/F-box ubiquitin ligase (13.Wei S.

Furthermore, decreased Sp1 expression leads to the transcriptional repression of a series of genes involved in oncogenic transformation (16.Wei S. Chuang H.C. Tsai W.C. Yang H.C. Ho S.R.

Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), including those encoding androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor α (ERα), and epidermal growth factor receptor (see Fig. 1A). In contrast, nonmalignant cells are resistant to these PPARγ-independent antitumor effects, underscoring the translational potential of TZDs to develop novel antitumor agents with a unique mode of mechanism. The proof-of-principle of this premise was provided by two PPARγ-inactive derivatives, STG28 and OSU-CG12, which exhibit multifold higher antitumor potencies than the respective parent compounds, troglitazone and ciglitazone, while lacking the ability to transactivate PPARγ (17.Huang J.W.

Here, we demonstrate that troglitazone, ciglitazone, STG28, and OSU-CG12 were able to elicit hallmark cellular responses characteristic of energy restriction in LNCaP prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, paralleling those induced by glucose starvation and two known energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs), 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and resveratrol (19.Baur J.A.

Here we provide one explanation for this restriction: the species specificity exhibited by the NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B protein). This viral protein combats a major host antiviral response by binding the interferon-α/β-induced, ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein and inhibiting its conjugation to an array of proteins. We demonstrate that the NS1B protein exhibits species-specific binding; it binds human and non-human primate ISG15 but not mouse or canine ISG15. In both transfection assays and virus-infected cells, the NS1B protein binds and relocalizes only human and non-human primate ISG15 from the cytoplasm to nuclear speckles. Human and non-human primate ISG15 proteins consist of two ubiquitin-like domains separated by a short hinge linker of five amino acids. Remarkably, this short hinge plays a large role in the species-specific binding by the NS1B protein. The hinge of human and non-human primate ISG15, which has a sequence that differs from that of other mammalian ISG15 proteins, including mouse and canine ISG15, is absolutely required for binding the NS1B protein.

IntroductionInfluenza A and B viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans. Influenza A viruses infect a wide variety of species, whereas influenza B viruses infect only humans (1.Wright P.F. Webster R.G. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed.

Here we focus on a function of the NS1 protein of influenza B virus (NS1B protein) that is not shared by the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein).

The C-terminal ISG15 domain, which is recognized by Ube1L, contains the C-terminal LRLRGG motif that is conjugated to target proteins (11.Chang Y.G. Yan X.Z. Xie Y.Y. Gao X.C. Song A.X. Zhang D.E.

The first evidence for the antiviral role of ISG15 conjugation was the finding that the NS1B protein of influenza B virus binds ISG15 and blocks its conjugation (3.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), suggesting that ISG15 and/or its conjugation are inhibitory to the replication of influenza B virus. Subsequently, it was shown that both ISG15 knock-out (ISG15−/−) and Ube1L−/− mice are more susceptible to influenza B virus infection, establishing that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza B virus replication (14.Lenschow D.J. Lai C. Frias-Staheli N. Giannakopoulos N.V. Lutz A. Wolff T. Osiak A. Levine B. Schmidt R.E. García-Sastre A. Leib D.A. Pekosz A. Knobeloch K.P. Horak I. Virgin 4th, H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2009; 83: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear why NS1B did not protect influenza B virus from the antiviral effects of ISG15 and its conjugation system in wild-type (ISG15+/+, Ube1L+/+) mice.Here we demonstrate that the NS1B protein exhibits species-specific binding. It binds human and non-human primate ISG15 but not mouse or canine ISG15. These results explain why influenza B virus replication is inhibited in wild-type mice that express mouse ISG15 and Ube1L. Surprisingly, we show that the 5-amino acid hinge of human and non-human primate ISG15, which has a different sequence than the ISG15 hinges of other mammalian species, is absolutely required for binding the NS1B protein. This study provides the first example of an influenza B virus protein that exhibits human (and non-human primate)-specific properties and thus provides one explanation for the restriction of influenza B virus to humans.DISCUSSIONInfluenza B virus is predominately, if not totally, restricted to humans (1.Wright P.F. Webster R.G. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1533-1579Google Scholar), but the basis for this restriction had not been determined. Here we provide one explanation for this restriction, namely that the influenza B virus NS1B protein binds only human and non-human primate ISG15. Consequently, the NS1B protein would only be able to protect influenza B virus from the antiviral effects of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugation in humans, and presumably in non-human primates. No protection would be possible in other mammalian species, as already documented by the finding that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza B virus replication in mice (14.Lenschow D.J. Lai C. Frias-Staheli N. Giannakopoulos N.V. Lutz A. Wolff T. Osiak A. Levine B. Schmidt R.E. García-Sastre A. Leib D.A. Pekosz A. Knobeloch K.P. Horak I. Virgin 4th, H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2009; 83: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because influenza B virus would not be protected from this IFN-induced antiviral system, it would not be able to be maintained in these other mammalian species. However, influenza B virus might also be found in non-human primates, a possibility that has not yet been explored. Future experiments will determine whether other influenza B virus proteins also exhibit human-specific properties.Surprisingly, the small 5-amino acid hinge between the two ubiquitin-like domains of ISG15 is crucial for NS1B binding. Only the human and primate hinges are suitable for binding. Replacement of individual amino acids in the human hinge sequence with the corresponding mouse amino acid was sufficient to eliminate NS1B binding. In addition, substitution of the human hinge sequence for the canine hinge sequence in the canine ISG15 molecule was sufficient to result in optimum binding of the NS1B protein. It has been proposed that the hinge of human ISG15 is flexible and might adopt a different orientation upon binding other proteins (10.Narasimhan J. Wang M. Fu Z. Klein J.M. Haas A.L. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27356-27365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perhaps only the human hinge sequence allows an orientation suitable for the NS1B protein to bind to a region in the N-terminal domain. Alternatively, human hinge amino acids may interact directly with the NS1B protein.The N-terminal domain of human ISG15 contains a binding site for the NS1B protein, as shown by the results with mouse ISG15. Substitution of the human hinge in mouse ISG15 resulted in little or no NS1B binding, indicating that the N-terminal mouse domain contains sequences that are inhibitory to NS1B binding. Such inhibitory sequences likely include some, or all, of the 8 amino acids in the N-terminal domain of mouse ISG15 that differ from the corresponding amino acids in both human and canine ISG15. To definitively identify the binding site in the N-terminal domain of human ISG15, we and our collaborators are determining the x-ray crystal structure of human ISG15 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of the NS1B protein. 3R. Guan, H. Sridharan, C. Zhao, R. M. Krug, and G. T. Montelione, unpublished results. This structure should also identify the NS1B amino acids that directly interact with human ISG15 and hence would enable us to generate a recombinant influenza B virus encoding a NS1B protein that does not bind human ISG15. Such a virus would be expected to be susceptible to inhibition by ISG15 conjugation in human cells, thereby enabling us to identify the mechanism by which IFN-induced ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza B virus replication in human cells.

The first evidence for the antiviral role of ISG15 conjugation was the finding that the NS1B protein of influenza B virus binds ISG15 and blocks its conjugation (3.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), suggesting that ISG15 and/or its conjugation are inhibitory to the replication of influenza B virus. Subsequently, it was shown that both ISG15 knock-out (ISG15−/−) and Ube1L−/− mice are more susceptible to influenza B virus infection, establishing that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza B virus replication (14.Lenschow D.J.

However, it was not clear why NS1B did not protect influenza B virus from the antiviral effects of ISG15 and its conjugation system in wild-type (ISG15+/+, Ube1L+/+) mice.Here we demonstrate that the NS1B protein exhibits species-specific binding. It binds human and non-human primate ISG15 but not mouse or canine ISG15. These results explain why influenza B virus replication is inhibited in wild-type mice that express mouse ISG15 and Ube1L. Surprisingly, we show that the 5-amino acid hinge of human and non-human primate ISG15, which has a different sequence than the ISG15 hinges of other mammalian species, is absolutely required for binding the NS1B protein. This study provides the first example of an influenza B virus protein that exhibits human (and non-human primate)-specific properties and thus provides one explanation for the restriction of influenza B virus to humans."

The crystal structure of the closed zebrafish P2X4.1 receptor directly reveals that the ion-conducting pathway is formed by three transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) α-helices, each being provided by the three subunits of the trimer. However, the transitions in TM2 that accompany channel opening are incompletely understood and remain unresolved. In this study, we quantified gated access to Cd2+ at substituted cysteines in TM2 of P2X2 receptors in the open and closed states. Our data for the closed state are consistent with the zebrafish P2X4.1 structure, with isoleucines and threonines (Ile-332 and Thr-336) positioned one helical turn apart lining the channel wall on approach to the gate. Our data for the open state reveal gated access to deeper parts of the pore (Thr-339, Val-343, Asp-349, and Leu-353), suggesting the closed channel gate is between Thr-336 and Thr-339. We also found unexpected interactions between native Cys-348 and D349C that result in tight Cd2+ binding deep within the intracellular vestibule in the open state. Interpreted with a P2X2 receptor structural model of the closed state, our data suggest that the channel gate opens near Thr-336/Thr-339 and is accompanied by movement of the pore-lining regions, which narrow toward the cytosolic end of TM2 in the open state. Such transitions would relieve the barrier to ion flow and render the intracellular vestibule less splayed during channel opening in the presence of ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1979190028,"Prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) suppresses adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. However, PGF(2alpha) synthase (PGFS) in adipocytes remains to be identified. Here, we studied the expression of members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B family acting as PGFS during adipogenesis of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. AKR1B3 mRNA was expressed in preadipocytes, and its level increased about 4-fold at day 1 after initiation of adipocyte differentiation, and then quickly decreased the following day to a level lower than that in the preadipocytes. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Akr1b8 and 1b10 were clearly lower than that level of Akr1b3 in preadipocytes and remained unchanged during adipogenesis. The transient increase in Akr1b3 during adipogenesis was also observed by Western blot analysis. The mRNA for the FP receptor, which is selective for PGF(2alpha), was also expressed in preadipocytes. Its level increased about 2-fold within 1 h after the initiation of adipocyte differentiation and was maintained at almost the same level throughout adipocyte differentiation. The small interfering RNA for Akr1b3, but not for Akr1b8 or 1b10, suppressed PGF(2alpha) production and enhanced the expression of adipogenic genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (aP2), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Moreover, an FP receptor agonist, Fluprostenol, suppressed the expression of those adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells; whereas an FP receptor antagonist, AL-8810, efficiently inhibited the suppression of adipogenesis caused by the endogenous PGF(2alpha). These results indicate that AKR1B3 acts as the PGFS in adipocytes and that AKR1B3-produced PGF(2alpha) suppressed adipocyte differentiation by acting through FP receptors."

In exocytosis, their function relies on the pairing of t-SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25) on the plasma membrane with a vesicle SNARE (synaptobrevin). The t-SNAREs have been observed to colocalize in clusters on the plasma membrane and have been proposed to define the sites of exocytosis (4Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol.

In addition to observing t-SNARE membrane organization, several studies have sought to uncover the mechanisms driving t-SNARE cluster formation. Lipid order has been shown to play a role in t-SNARE cluster organization using sheets of plasma membrane (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R.

These findings led to the hypothesis that plasma membrane t-SNARE protein clusters may be maintained by membrane rafts (13Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell culture reagents were supplied by Invitrogen. Anti-SNAP-25 (SMI81) was obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals (Lutherville, MD). Anti-syntaxin1a (HPC-1) was supplied by Sigma. The rabbit anti-syntaxin1a was a generous gift from Dr. Bazbek Davletov (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). Anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexafluor-647 or Alexafluor-488, propidium iodide, and calcein AM were obtained from Invitrogen. Protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Neuroblastoma 2a cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm l-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air. Pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamicin and maintained at 37 °C in 7.5% (v/v) CO2, 92.5% (v/v) air. Transfections were performed using ExGen 500 (Fermentas) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To deplete cholesterol, cells were incubated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) in serum-free medium for 15–30 min at 37 °C. To assess cell viability following cholesterol depletion, both propidium iodide and calcein AM (Invitrogen) were added to a final concentration of 3 μm, incubated for 5 min, and then imaged immediately. Live cells were maintained on a heated stage (37 °C) in a chamber containing 5% (v/v) CO2, 95% (v/v) air during imaging. The vector pEGFP-C2 was obtained from Clontech. An EYFP-SNAP-25 fusion was generated by ligation of SNAP-25-(1–206) into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C, followed by the replacement of enhanced green fluorescent protein with EYFP. SNAP-25-EGFP in pEGFP-N1 was a gift from M. Linder. The plasmid pmCerulean-syntaxin1a-(1–288), was described previously (15Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding PACherry-SNAP-25-(1–206) and PACherry-syntaxin1a-(1–288) were generated from the plasmids above by replacement of DNA encoding EYFP or mCerulean with PACherry using AgeI/BsrGI. All cells were cultured on glass coverslips, and transfections were performed using ExGen500 (Fermentas). To label cholesterol, neuroblastoma 2a cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min. Following phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were incubated with filipin (50 μg/ml) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Filipin fluorescence was excited using a titanium sapphire two-photon laser at 780 nm. The same settings were employed for all samples so that their relative staining intensities could be compared. To quantify lipid order, we used laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene; Invitrogen) as described previously (16Gaus K. Gratton E. Kable E.P. Jones A.S. Gelissen I. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), except that 780-nm two-photon excitation was used. All images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M confocal microscope fitted with an LSM510 scanning head. Images were sampled at the Nyquist sampling frequency with the photomultiplier tube detector gain and amplifier offset adjusted so that voxel intensities were spread over the full dynamic range. All three-dimensional image data were deconvolved using Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands), using a theoretical or measured point spread function, prior to further analysis. PALM data (supplemental Fig. 1) were acquired from fixed cells transfected with constructs expressing either SNAP-25 or syntaxin fused to PACherry. Cycles of brief activation at 405 nm, followed by rapid imaging in total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy mode at 561 nm were performed using an Olympus IX-81 microscope equipped with the Olympus Cell-R acquisition software and an ImageEM EM-CCD 512 × 512 camera (Hamamatsu UK). All PALM imaging used an Olympus 150X UApo 1.45NA oil lens with a resulting pixel size of 106 nm. Activation and bleaching steps in each cycle were optimized to ensure a sparse distribution of single molecules was activated and photo-destroyed during each cycle. PALM data analysis was performed using a Matlab routine written by Dr. Samuel Hess (Maine). Spatial distributions of localized single molecules were analyzed using Ripley's analyses using custom-written algorithms in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc., Cambridge, UK). For the STED experiments, cells were plated onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips and grown between 36 and 40 h. The plated cells were then incubated with or without 10 mm MβCD (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min. After treatment, the cells were sonicated as described previously (17Avery J. Ellis D.J. Lang T. Holroyd P. Riedel D. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a 100-ms ultrasound pulse in ice-cold KGlu sonication buffer (120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Paraformaldehyde was quenched using 50 mm NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and immunostained for endogenous syntaxin1a and synaptobrevin-2 using mouse monoclonal HPC-1 (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Synaptic Systems). Primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Dianova) and Atto647N-labeled sheep anti-mouse (provided by Dept. of Nanobiophotonics, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany) essentially as described previously (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The samples were embedded in Mowiol (Merck) before imaging. The samples were imaged using a TCS-STED (Leica Microsystems) super-resolution fluorescence microscope equipped with a 1.4 NA ×100 objective. Multichannel confocal images of immunostained plasma membrane sheets were then obtained simultaneously (at 100-Hz scan speed) for Cy3 (synaptobrevin 2) and Atto647N (syntaxin1a) followed by imaging Atto647N applying STED resolution (at 10-Hz scan speed). Pixel size was 21.6 nm. STED excitation was performed with a 635-nm diode laser, and depletion was achieved via a MaiTai tunable laser (Spectra-Physics) at 750 nm. Emission was collected at 645–720 nm for the Atto647N and at 551–602 nm for Cy3. Confocal imaging was performed using photomultiplier tubes, and an avalanche photodiode was used for STED image acquisition. The system resolution limit was ∼70–90 nm, measured by analysis of 20 nm crimson-fluorescent beads (Invitrogen). Metamorph (Universal Imaging) was used for the alignment of confocal and STED images. The Cy3- and STED-resolved channels were aligned using the alignment of the Atto647N STED image to the Atto647N confocal image as reference. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were made under 800–820-nm two-photon excitation that efficiently excited cerulean, without any detectable direct excitation or emission from EYFP, using a fast photomultiplier tube (H7422; Hamamatsu Photonics UK) coupled directly to the rear port of the Axiovert microscope (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). Full frame TCSPC recordings were acquired between 30 and 60 s, with mean photon counts between 105 and 106 counts/s. Images were recorded at 256 × 256 pixels from a 1024 × 1024 image scan with 256 time bins over a 12-ns period. Off-line FLIM data analysis used pixel-based fitting software (SPCImage, Becker & Hickl). The optimization of the fit parameters was performed by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, minimizing the weighted χ2 quantity. As controls for nonspecific FRET, or FRET between green fluorescent proteins that may form dimers spontaneously when overexpressed in cells, we determined the fluorescence lifetimes of cerulean-Syx-(1–288) alone, cerulean alone, or cerulean-Syx-(1–288) cotransfected with EYFP (15Rickman C.

We first examined the localization of single molecules of SNAP-25 (Fig. 1a, upper panels) in PC12 cells. Using PALM (18Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S.

Similarly, syntaxin1a molecules are concentrated into ensembles interspersed with largely single molecules (Fig. 1a, lower panels). Statistical analysis of the spatial distributions of these molecules was performed. Hopkin's statistics compares the nearest neighbor distances from a random subset of data events to the nearest neighbor distances from points placed at random in the data to be tested (20Numahara T. Nakagawa T. Takaiwa T. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1992; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 21Hopkins B. Skellam J.G. Ann. Bot. 1954; 18: 213-226Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We thus compared the XY coordinates of single t-SNARE molecules to synthetic data exhibiting complete spatial randomness, finding that single SNARE molecules are subject to higher order organization into clusters (data not shown). Furthermore, Ripley's K and L function analyses (Fig. 1b) (22Ripley B.D. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1977; 39: 172-212Google Scholar) of these datasets revealed that the molecular spatial organization of SNAP-25 and syntaxin1a is nonrandom. Together, these data demonstrate higher order organization of the t-SNAREs in the living plasma membrane at the molecular level. PALM cannot provide an exact measure of the number of molecules in a region as it can never be known that every molecule has been counted (18Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S. Davidson M.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hess H.F. Science. 2006; 313: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar); however, it can provide a lower limit for the number of molecules per unit area. Our data provided an estimate of ∼30–40 syntaxin molecules in an area covered by a 50-nm diameter spot (over the dense ensembles). This complements a recent study (10Sieber J.J. Willig K.I. Kutzner C. Gerding-Reimers C. Harke B. Donnert G. Rammner B. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Grubmüller H. Lang T. Science. 2007; 317: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), using another super-resolution imaging technique, STED, in combination with molecular modeling that predicted 70 molecules per 50-nm cluster. PALM allows the further localization of single molecules within and between these macromolecular assemblies. To test whether the distributions of these two proteins overlap, we quantified the covariance of SNAP-25 and syntaxin1a, finding a high degree of overlap (>86%; supplemental Fig. 2). Super-resolution optical approaches lack sufficient resolution to provide insight into protein interactions at the molecular level. Therefore, we quantified the interaction between SNAP-25 and syntaxin using TCSPC-FLIM (for explanation of FLIM analysis and presentation see supplemental Fig. 3), an imaging spectroscopy approach we used previously to measure SNARE protein interactions in living cells (15Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 22775-22785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FLIM has the advantage that it delivers data unaffected by donor or acceptor concentration, the emission light path, sample scatter, or donor/acceptor ratio (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The donor, mCerulean-Syx-(1–288), in the presence of unfused EYFP, had a single fluorescence lifetime at the plasma membrane (shown in Fig. 1, c and d) in agreement with our previous findings in neuroblastoma 2a cells (15Rickman C. Medine C.N. Bergmann A. Duncan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12097-12103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FLIM reports protein interactions as a specific quenching of the donor fluorescence lifetime in the presence of a proximal acceptor. To exclude any possibility that high concentrations of donor and acceptor molecules, in clusters at the cell surface, could lead to donor fluorescence lifetime quenching due merely to density, we analyzed cells expressing mCerulean-syntaxin and EYFP-syntaxin. These fluorescent proteins coexisted at the plasma membrane as expected (10Sieber J.J. Willig K.I. Kutzner C. Gerding-Reimers C. Harke B. Donnert G. Rammner B. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Grubmüller H. Lang T. Science. 2007; 317: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and no donor fluorescence lifetime quenching could be detected (supplemental Fig. 4). However, in the presence of the FRET acceptor EYFP-SNAP-25-(1–206), a change in the donor, mCerulean-syntaxin, fluorescence lifetime was reported, indicating a specific protein-protein interaction (i.e. a second fluorescence lifetime component appeared; Fig. 1b). TCSPC-FLIM uniquely delivers information describing both interaction (lifetime) and the proportion of donor molecules participating in energy transfer in each pixel of the image. This allows the influence of proximity and number of interacting partners to be dissected. A fuller description of this type of analysis is included in supplemental Fig. 3; in addition, a SNARE-specific FLIM review (26Altenbach K. Duncan R.R. Valkonen M. Fungal Biol. Rev. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar) and a general text (27Becker W. Advanced Time-correlated Single Photon Counting Techniques. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2005Crossref Google Scholar) on time-correlated single photon counting provides a complete background to this technique. Further analysis at the cell surface measured an interaction between syntaxin and SNAP-25 within the clusters on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, a, c, and d). Importantly, the weighted mean fluorescence lifetime data (containing both interacting and noninteracting values and their respective amplitudes; supplemental Fig. 3) were bimodal (Fig. 2a, left panel) due to two spatially segregated types of SNARE cluster containing different FRET “efficiencies” (Fig. 2a, right panels). The t-SNARE dimer is thought to serve as an acceptor for the vesicular SNARE, synaptobrevin. It was therefore theoretically possible that the two spatially segregated states we observed could be due to the presence, or not, of synaptobrevin. To address this, we employed super-resolution STED imaging (previously used to resolve single SNARE clusters (10Sieber J.J. Willig K.I. Kutzner C. Gerding-Reimers C. Harke B. Donnert G. Rammner B. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Grubmüller H. Lang T. Science. 2007; 317: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar)) to ascertain the level of colocalization between synaptobrevin and single t-SNARE clusters on the cell surface (Fig. 2b). This showed that the large majority of single syntaxin clusters do not have coincident synaptobrevin. In addition, we found only 9 ± 5% overlap (Mander's overlap coefficient; mean ± S.E., n = 8 independent experiments), in immunostained cells using deconvolution microscopy (supplemental Fig. 2). This low level of overlap between the vesicle SNARE and the t-SNAREs is insufficient to account for the observed cluster heterogeneity across the cell surface. Differences in FRET “efficiency” can be a result of either a change in the number of interacting molecules or differences in the inter-molecular proximity at specific cellular locations. However, FLIM can distinguish between these two possibilities (supplemental Fig. 3), allowing control for any interference from unlabeled SNAREs, which would ordinarily go undetected. First, we quantified the proportion of interacting molecules within every diffraction-limited cluster (containing 30–70 SNARE molecules each) in an image. This is described by a single distribution (Fig. 2c, left panel) and is further emphasized by an image showing spatial uniformity of this measurement (Fig. 2c, right panel). Therefore, differences in the number of interacting molecules between clusters cannot account for the observed spatial variations. Next, we analyzed the fluorescence lifetime component derived from only the proportion of interacting molecules within clusters. This revealed two distinct populations, for simplicity here termed state 1 and state 2 (Fig. 2d, left panel). Importantly, not only do these two states possess different molecular conformations, they are also spatially segregated on the plasma membrane into distinct clusters where one of the two forms predominates (Fig. 2d, right panel). To gain structural insights into the two observed t-SNARE heterodimer states, we took advantage of the thorough biochemical and structural understanding of SNARE proteins. Recent work suggested that the t-SNAREs can exist in different conformational forms in vitro (28Weninger K. Bowen M.E. Choi U.B. Chu S. Brunger A.T. Structure. 2008; 16: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), where one form corresponded to a parallel three-helical bundle, whereas a second major form was shown to have the second SNAP-25 helix dissociated. We therefore tested whether these forms could account for the two states we observe in intact cells. We employed another mutant of SNAP-25 to mimic the cleavage product of botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (BoNT/E); this specific cleavage of SNAP-25 (removing the 25 C-terminal amino acids) is known to disrupt t-SNARE interactions (4Rickman C. Meunier F.A. Binz T. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 644-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and abolish exocytosis (29Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant maintained micro-patterns morphologically indistinguishable from full-length SNAP-25; however, state 2 (the three helical bundle) was reduced to undetectable levels (Fig. 3a). To further understand this, a mutant SNAP-25, where the entire second SNARE helix was deleted (SNAP-25-(1–121)), still formed clusters at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3b). Importantly, however, the heterodimer conformation was now uniform across the membrane, with the complete loss of state 2 (Fig. 3b). These findings indicate that the first SNARE helix of SNAP-25 is sufficient to initiate the interaction with syntaxin1a but that state 2 relies on the second SNARE helix of SNAP-25 to be present in the heterodimer complex. A previously reported substitution in SNAP-25 (G43D), a mutation in this first helix, was proposed to prevent the formation of a four helical bundle containing two SNARE helices from syntaxin and two N-terminal SNARE helices of SNAP-25 (30An S.J. Almers W. Science. 2004; 306: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We re-examined the effect of this mutation on the interaction between full-length SNAP-25 with syntaxin in vitro; in all assays, we found little or no significant effects (supplemental Fig. 5). We conclude that the heterodimer states we observe represent two different conformations of the t-SNARE heterodimer resulting from a differential engagement of the second SNARE helix of SNAP-25. How are the two t-SNARE conformations spatially segregated? It has been suggested that these clusters may in some way be affected by the surrounding lipids (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 13Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, this was at the gross topological or biochemical level and could not examine the interaction status of the proteins in situ. Therefore, we addressed the role of lipid order in plasma membrane cluster organization at the molecular level, reasoning that lipid order may play a role in segregating the two conformational states we have defined. We examined the effect of sublethal (supplemental Fig. 6) cholesterol depletion on the lipid order of the plasma membrane, using laurdan, which reports changes in the packing of surrounding lipids as a spectral shift (31Parasassi T. Gratton E. Yu W.M. Wilson P. Levi M. Biophys. J. 1997;"
https://openalex.org/W2028024035,"Possible cardiac repair by adult stem cell transplantation is currently hampered by poor cell viability and delivery efficiency, uncertain differentiating fate in vivo, the needs of ex vivo cell expansion, and consequent delay in transplantation after the onset of heart attack. By the aid of magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and immunohistochemistry, we show that injection of a hyaluronan mixed ester of butyric and retinoic acid (HBR) into infarcted rat hearts afforded substantial cardiovascular repair and recovery of myocardial performance. HBR restored cardiac [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and increased capillary density and led to the recruitment of endogenous Stro-1-positive stem cells. A terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay demonstrated that HBR-treated hearts exhibited a decrease in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes and Stro-1 stem cells, HBR enhanced the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, kdr, akt, and pim-1. HBR also increased the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor, suggesting that the mixed ester may have recruited both myocardial and Stro-1 cells also. An increase in capillarogenesis was induced in vitro with medium obtained from HBR-exposed cells. In the infarcted myocardium, HBR injection increased histone H4 acetylation significantly. Acetyl-H4 immunoreactivity increased in rat cardiomyocytes and Stro-1 cells exposed to HBR, compared with untreated cells. In conclusion, efficient cardiac regenerative therapy can be afforded by HBR without the need of stem cell transplantation or vector-mediated gene delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1975758824,"The current treatment of botulism is to administer animal-derived antitoxin, which frequently causes severe adverse reactions in the recipients. In this study, a heavy chain antibody fragment (VH/V(H)H) phage display library was constructed by amplification of the immunoglobulin genes of a nonimmune camel, Camelus dromedarius, using primers specific to human VH gene segments. A recombinant light chain of type A botulinum toxin, BoTxA/LC, with zinc endoprotease activity was used in phage bio-panning to select phage clones displaying BoTxA/LC-bound VH/V(H)H. Soluble VH/V(H)H were produced and purified from 10 VH/V(H)H phagemid-transformed E. coli clones. Complementary determining regions (CDRs) and immunoglobulin frameworks (FRs) of the 10 camel VH/V(H)H-deduced amino acid sequences were determined. FR2 sequences of two clones showed a hallmark of camel V(H)H, i.e. (F/Y)(42)E(49)R(50)(G/F)(52). The remaining eight clones had an FR2 amino acid tetrad of conventional VH, i.e. V(42)G(49)L(50)W(52). V(H)H of one clone (V(H)H17) neutralized the SNAP25 hydrolytic activity of BoTxA/LC, whereas mouse polyclonal anti-BoTxA/LC did not have such activity. Mimotope sequences of V(H)H17 matched with the 194-206 amino acid residues of BoTxA/LC, which are located near the S'1 subsite of the catalytic cleft of the enzyme. Molecular docking revealed that CDR3 of the V(H)H17 bound to epitope in the toxin enzymatic cleft. Therefore, the BoTxA/LC neutralization by the V(H)H17 should be due to the V(H)H insertion into the enzymatic cleft of the toxin, which is usually inaccessible to a conventional antibody molecule. This antibody fragment warrants further development as a therapeutic agent for botulism."

However, unlike the other serotonin receptors, the cellular mechanisms of 5-HT6R are poorly elucidated relative to its significance in human brain diseases. Here, using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the human 5-HT6R interacts with Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1). We also confirmed a physical interaction between 5-HT6R and Jab1 using glutathione S-transferase pulldown, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunocyto(histo)chemistry assays. The manipulation of Jab1 expression using Jab1 small interference RNA decreased 5-HT6R-mediated activity and cell membrane expression of 5-HT6R, whereas overexpression of Jab1 produced no significant effect. In addition, we demonstrated that the activation of 5-HT6R induced the translocation of Jab1 into the nucleus and increased c-Jun phosphorylation and the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun. Furthermore, we found that 5-HT6R and Jab1 were up-regulated in middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced focal cerebral ischemic rats and in cultured cells exposed to hypoxic insults, suggesting possible protective roles for 5-HT6R and Jab1.

The serotonergic system has also been implicated in the neurobiological control of learning and memory. Therefore, it emerges as a key player in affective, cognitive, complex sensory, and motor functions (1.Svenningsson P. Tzavara E.T. Liu F. Fienberg A.A. Nomikos G.G. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3188-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 5-HT mediates its diverse physiological responses through seven distinct receptor families: the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, all of these receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (2.Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Among the 5-HT receptors, the 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) is coupled to a stimulatory Gα (GαS) protein. This receptor increases cAMP formation and then activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3.Kohen R. Metcalf M.A. Khan N. Druck T. Huebner K. Lachowicz J.E. Meltzer H.Y. Sibley D.R. Roth B.L. Hamblin M.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). 5-HT6R is abundantly distributed in the brain, especially in the limbic region (4.Ward R.P. Hamblin M.W. Lachowicz J.E. Hoffman B.J. Sibley D.R. Dorsa D.M. Neuroscience. 1995; 64: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and it has a high affinity for antipsychotic compounds and tricyclic antidepressants (5.Roth B.L. Craigo S.C.

These preliminary reports imply that 5-HT6R has a significant role in the control of mood and emotion in the central nervous system. To date, most findings suggest that 5-HT6R plays crucial roles in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease, depression, and learning and memory disorders (6.Branchek T.A. Blackburn T.P.

Chuang T.T. Hunter A.J. Virley D.J. Neurotherapeutics. 2008; 5: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate possible underlying mechanisms of 5-HT6R antagonist-mediated cognition enhancement, microdialysis studies have shown that a 5-HT6R blockade elevates cholinergic or glutaminergic neurotransmission in the brain (12.Dawson L.A.

Although it has been reported that selective 5-HT6R antagonists produced antidepressant-like effects (15.Wesołowska A. Nikiforuk A.

Alzheimer disease, depression, and learning and memory disorders are important severe neurological diseases that cause extensive human suffering. Therefore, it is very important to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for 5-HT6R-mediated cognition and mood changes in the brain.

Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1) was initially identified as a protein that interacts with c-Jun and stimulates the binding of c-Jun and JunD to AP-1 sites, potentiating them as transcription factors (17.Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Jab1 is also known as CSN5, which is the fifth member of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex consisting of eight subunits, CSN1–CSN8 (18.Deng X.W. Dubiel W. Wei N. Hofmann K. Mundt K. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Jabl exists and functions both as a monomer and as a subunit of the CSN complex. Although Jab1 has been shown to be a key player in plant light signaling, development, cell cycle control, and stability of various proteins in a number of systems (see reviews in Refs. 19.Chamovitz D.A. Segal D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20.Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the specific role of Jab1 and its cellular mechanism in the central nervous system still remain obscure. In this study, we discovered a novel interaction between GαS-family GPCR 5-HT6R and Jab1, and we observed Jab1-mediated modulation of the membrane expression and activity of 5-HT6R. In addition, we found that 5-HT6R affects the cytosol/nuclear distribution of Jab1 as well as the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun, a target protein downstream of Jab1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 5-HT6R and Jab1 play important roles under conditions of in vitro hypoxia and in vivo cerebral ischemia.

Fluo-4-AM, Pluronic F-127, and WGA, Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human 5-HT6R and HA-tagged human 5-HT6R cDNAs were purchased from UMR cDNA Resource Center (Miner Circle Rolla, MO). The Myc-tagged 5-HT6R plasmid was constructed by recloning the human 5-HT6R cDNA into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pCMV-Tag 3B vector. 5-HT6R-eGFP was subcloned (Fw, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGGTCCCAGAGCC-3′; Rv, 5′-CCGGAATTCGGTTCGTGGGGATGCC-3′) into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). 5-HT6R-eYFP was recloned from 5-HT6R-eGFP into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). cDNA fragments encoding the iL2, iL3, and CT domains of 5-HT6R were subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the Gal4 activation domain vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) with the following sets of primers: iL2 (Fw, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACCGCTACCTG-3′; Rv, 5′-CGGGATCCGCAGGGCACGCAG-3′), iL3 (Fw, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGTGCAGGATCCTG-3′; Rv, 5′-CGGGATCCGCTTCAGGGCCTTC-3′), and CT (Fw, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGCCACTCTTCATG-3′; Rv, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGTTCGTGGG-3′).

His-Jab1 was recloned from GST-Jab1 into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pET-28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). His-NT-Jab1 (Fw, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCAGCTTCCG-3′; Rv, 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAATCAATCCCGGAGAG-3′) and His-CT-Jab1 (Fw, 5′-CGCGGATCCGTTAGTACACAGATGC-3′; Rv, 5′-CCGGAATTCCTAAGCAACGTTAATCTG-3′) were constructed by cloning from His-Jab1 into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen). siRNA sequences were designed using siRNA target finder software (Turbo si-Designer, Bioneer, Korea), and two single-strand RNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and annealed to form the siRNA duplex. The sequences of siRNA for 5-HT6R and Jab1 genes were as follows: 5-HT6R (sense, 5′- CUGUAACAGCACCAUGAACdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-GUUCAUGGUGCUGUUACAGdTdT-3′), Jab1 (sense, 5′-CUACAAACCUCCUGAUGAAdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-UUCAUCAGGAGGUUUGUAGdTdT-3′; or sense, 5′-GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAAdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-UUUCAUCGAUACUCUGAGCdTdT-3′), and negative control siRNA (sense, 5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGUdTdT-3′; antisense; 5′-ACGAAAUUGGUGGCGUAGGdTdT-3′). The bait plasmids, pGBKT7/iL2, iL3, or CT of 5-HT6R, were stably expressed in yeast strain AH109 and did not display a self-transcriptional activity. The prey plasmid, human brain cDNA library/pACT2, was transformed into yeast strain Y187. All yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (21.Yun H.M. Kim S. Kim H.J. Kostenis E.

GST, GST-tagged proteins, and His-tagged proteins were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C during the midlog phase. The cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). All His-tagged proteins formed inclusion bodies except GST and GST-tagged protein. The inclusion bodies were isolated and dissolved as previously described (22.Kang H. Lee W.K. Choi Y.H. Vukoti K.M.

After GST, the GST-tagged proteins and the His-tagged proteins were purified and GST pulldown assays were performed using the Profound Pulldown GST Protein:Protein Interaction kit (Pierce). In detail, after GST, GST-iL2, GST-iL3, and GST-CT were expressed in Escherichia coli, the proteins were immobilized on glutathione gel, and purified His-tagged Jab1 was incubated with the glutathione gel bound to GST or GST-tagged proteins. GST pulldown assays using CHO/K1 cells and rat brain lysates were performed as described previously (21.Yun H.M. Kim S. Kim H.J. Kostenis E. Kim J.I. Seong J.Y. Baik J.H. Rhim H. J. Biol.

HEK393 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. HEK293 cell lines stably expressing HA-5-HT6R (HEK/HA-5-HT6R) were selected with 800 μg/ml G-418 and maintained with 400 μg/ml G-418. CHO cells stably expressing 5-HT6R (CHO/5-HT6R) cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Teitler (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY), and the cells were maintained with 400 μg/ml G-418. Cultured hippocampal neurons were dissected from 16- to 18-day fetal Sprague-Dawley rats and dissociated using trypsin and trituration through a Pasteur pipette. The neurons were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine in Neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mml-glutamine, 25 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Experiments were carried out on neurons after 14 days in vitro. For transient transfection, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected with eCFP-Jab1 (donor) and 5-HT6R-eYFP (acceptor), fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed three times in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on slides using CRYSTAL/MOUNTTM (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and examined under Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Tokyo). A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is defined as the light emitted by 5-HT6R-eYFP at 535–565 nm in response to the light emitted at 480–495 nm by eCFP-Jab1. The background FRET signal was detected when eYFP and eCFP vectors were expressed. FRET signal was also detected by the acceptor photobleaching method as previously reported (23.Hwang C.Y. Ryu Y.S.

This method measures the release of donor quenching after acceptor photobleaching, thus providing a measurement of close co-localization of the two fusion proteins. HEK293 cells were gently lysed with lysis buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was then collected. Rat brain was homogenized in lysis buffer added to 0.32 mm sucrose. Cell and brain lysates were precleared with 50 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized Protein G Plus (Pierce) for 2 h, and the precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of each specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. The lysates were then were incubated with 50 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized Protein G Plus for 4 h at 4 °C and were washed six times. Immune complexes were eluted by boiling for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer, followed by immunoblotting. The immunocytochemistry procedure was performed as described previously (21.Yun H.M.

In detail, HEK293 or CHO/K1 cells were cultured and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 24 h after transfection. Cultured hippocampal neurons were grown until 14 days in vitro and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For immunohistochemistry, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were sectioned at 10 μm in a cryostat at −20 °C. Sections were collected on a coated glass slide and dried at room temperature before being returned to −70 °C for storage. Slides were post-fixed with acetone for 30 min on ice. 5-HT6R activity was measured using an FDSS6000 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) as previously described (21.Yun H.M.

Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with human 5-HT6R and Gα15 protein using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were seeded into 96-well black wall clear-bottom plates, and 5-HT6R activity was measured the next day. After the cells were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4/AM and 0.001% Pluronic F-127 for 60 min at 37 °C in an HEPES-buffered solution (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 13.8 mm glucose, pH 7.4), cells were assayed with the FDSS6000 system. After determination of a short baseline, 10 μm or one of various indicated doses of 5-HT was added to HEK293 cells, and the Ca2+ response was measured at 480 nm. All data were collected and analyzed using the FDSS6000 system and related software (Hamamatsu Photonics). After CHO/5-HT6R cells were treated with 5-HT in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision), following the manufacturer's protocol. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were used for a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. The animals were anesthetized by inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane and were submitted to 2 h of ischemia by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with intraluminal Mononylon 4.0 sutures introduced through the internal cervical carotid artery form. After 2 h of MCAO, the intraluminal filament was withdrawn from the internal cervical carotid artery to allow reperfusion for 1 day. HEK293 cells and HEK/HA-5-HT6R cells were exposed to various doses of CoCl2 or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) as described previously (26.Chan P.H. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, the cells were washed two times with a glucose-free HEPES-buffered solution and then immersed in deoxygenated glucose-free HEPES-buffered solution bubbled with nitrogen gas for 30 min to remove residual oxygen. The cells were transferred to an anaerobic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc., Del Mar, CA), exposed to the anaerobic gas mixture (5% CO2, 10% H2, and 85% N2), and maintained at 37 °C for 6 h. After incubation, the cells were removed from the anaerobic chamber, and the media was replaced with normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-based culture media. Cells were allowed to recover for 12 h before being analyzed. Cell viability was measured by the detection of dehydrogenase activity retained in living cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (50 μl, 5 mg/ml) was added to the cells, and the formazan was dissolved by adding DMSO after the media was removed. The optical densities were measured at 570 nm. The optical intensity was measured using the AlphaEase program (Version 5.1, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and was analyzed using the Prism Version 4 program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All numeric values are represented as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the data was determined using a Student's unpaired t test. We previously demonstrated that the C-terminal region of human 5- HT6R interacts with the Fyn tyrosine kinase. We also characterized the signaling pathways downstream of 5-HT6R activation via a direct interaction with Fyn (21.Yun H.M. Kim S. Kim H.J. Kostenis E. Kim J.I. Seong J.Y. Baik J.H. Rhim H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5496-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found a new binding protein, Jab1, that bound to 5-HT6R in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay using a human brain cDNA library. We found that Jab1 binds to both the intracellular loop 3 (iL3) and the C-terminal (CT) region of human 5-HT6R based on the yeast two-hybrid screening assay (Fig. 1A). To verify a specific interaction between Jab1 and 5-HT6R, we attempted to determine whether Jab1 selectively binds to 5-HT6R using a GST pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, His-tagged Jab1 specifically interacted with GST-iL3 or GST-CT, which contain the iL3 and CT regions of 5-HT6R, respectively, but Jab1 did not interact with GST alone or with GST-iL2 (intracellular loop 2 of 5-HT6R). We then sought to identify the specific residues within Jab1 that are responsible for binding to 5-HT6R. After Jab1 was arbitrarily divided into two constructs based on amino acid size (the N-terminal portion of Jab1, NT-Jab1: amino acids 1–151 and the C-terminal portion of Jab1, CT-Jab1: amino acids 152–334, Fig. 1A), and GST pulldown assays were again performed using His-tagged NT- Jab1 or His-tagged CT-Jab1. The Jab1 fragments were detected with anti-His antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, we found that CT-Jab1 and NT-Jab1 selectively interacted with GST-iL3 and GST-CT of 5-HT6R, respectively. These GST pulldown results were also confirmed in a mammalian system using CHO/K-1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged Jab1 and in rat brain lysates. Endogenous and full-length exogenous Jab1 from CHO/K-1 cells (Fig. 1D) and endogenous Jab1 from rat brain (Fig. 1E) bound to both GST-iL3 and GST-CT of 5-HT6R, whereas no signal was detected using GST alone. To show the relevance of the specific binding of Jab1 to 5-HT6R, it is necessary to demonstrate the association of the two full-length proteins in mammalian cells using an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. After HA-tagged full-length 5-HT6R was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-Jab1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1F, the transfected HA-5-HT6R was able to bind to endogenous Jab1 (the middle lane of the second row) in HEK293 cells, whereas no signal was detected from nontransfected cells. When co-immunoprecipitation was performed in reverse with anti-Jab1 antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies, the same result was obtained (the last lane of the first row in Fig. 1F). We also detected the association of 5-HT6R and Jab1 in native tissues using rat brain lysates. As shown in Fig. 1G, endogenous 5-HT6R selectively binds to endogenous Jab1 (third lane) in the rat brain, whereas no signal was detected in immunoprecipitates using control IgG antibody (second lane). These results strongly demonstrate that Jab1 selectively interacts with human 5-HT6R in mammalian cell lines and in native tissues. FRET has been used as a spectroscopic ruler to measure molecular proximity (27.Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Monitoring energy transfer between versatile green fluorescent proteins has frequently been used to detect molecular interactions between proteins. We therefore utilized FRET techniques using enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (eCFP)-tagged Jab1 (eCFP-Jab1) and enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (eYFP)-tagged 5-HT6R (5-HT6R-eYFP). When eCFP and eYFP control constructs were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and imaged, no FRET signal was observed (Fig. 2A). However, when eCFP-Jab1 and 5-HT6R-eYFP were co-expressed and imaged under the same experimental conditions, excitation of the eCFP component of Jab1 allowed detection of eYFP with FRET, which is represented by pseudocolor images (the last column in Fig. 2A). This FRET-based molecular proximity was also confirmed using an acceptor photobleaching method (23.Hwang C.Y. Ryu Y.S. Chung M.S. Kim K.D. Park S.S. Chae S.K. Chae H.Z. Kwon K.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8868-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24.Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). If eCFP and eYFP are in close proximity, the donor (eCFP) fluorescence should increase in the region where the acceptor (eYFP) has been bleached. After bleaching eYFP-5-HT6R, we observed increased fluorescence of eCFP-Jab1 in the region of acceptor bleaching when compared with the pre-bleaching images (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1A). These results indicate that 5-HT6R-eYFP and eCFP-Jab1 were in close proximity in the cells. We next examined the co-localization of 5-HT6R and Jab1 using double immunofluorescence staining in various mammalian cell lines. In HEK293 and CHO/K1 cells, we examined the co-localization of endogenous Jab1 and exogenously transfected 5-HT6R. As shown in Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1B, HA-5-HT6R was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, and Jab1 was shown to be diffusely distributed in the cytosol and nucleus, as well as at the plasma membrane. The merged images showed a prominent co-localization between 5-HT6R and Jab1 at or near the plasma membrane in HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we also examined the co-localization of the two proteins their endogenous native forms. Although the sta"
https://openalex.org/W2020808884,The spatial and temporal distribution of fault slip is a critical parameter in earthquake source models. Previous geomorphic and geologic studies of channel offset along the Carrizo section of the south central San Andreas Fault assumed that channels form more frequently than earthquakes occur and suggested that repeated large-slip earthquakes similar to the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake illustrate typical fault behavior. We found that offset channels in the Carrizo Plain incised less frequently than they were offset by earthquakes. Channels have been offset by successive earthquakes with variable slip since ~1400. This nonuniform slip history reveals a more complex rupture history than previously assumed for the structurally simplest section of the San Andreas Fault.
https://openalex.org/W1988229704,"Leukocyte recruitment from the blood into injured tissues during inflammatory diseases is the result of sequential events involving chemokines binding to their GPC receptors as well as to their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) co-receptors. The induction and the crucial role of MCP-1/CCL2 in the course of diseases that feature monocyte-rich infiltrates have been validated in many animal models, and several MCP-1/CCL2 as well as CCR2 antagonists have since been generated. However, despite some of them being shown to be efficacious in a number of animal models, many failed in clinical trials, and therapeutically interfering with the activity of this chemokine is not yet possible. We have therefore generated novel MCP-1/CCL2 mutants with increased GAG binding affinity and knocked out CCR2 activity, which were designed to interrupt the MCP-1/CCL2-related signaling cascade. We provide evidence that our lead mutant MCP-1(Y13A/S21K/Q23R) exhibits a 4-fold higher affinity toward the natural MCP-1 GAG ligand heparan sulfate and that it shows a complete deficiency in activating CCR2 on THP-1 cells. Furthermore, a significantly longer residual time on GAG ligands was observed by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, we were able to show that MCP-1(Y13A/S21K/Q23R) had a mild ameliorating effect on experimental autoimmune uveitis and that a marginal effect on oral tolerance in the group co-fed with Met-MCP-1(Y13A/S21K/Q23R) plus immunogenic peptide PDSAg was observed. These results suggest that disrupting wild type chemokine-GAG interactions by a chemokine-based antagonist can result in anti-inflammatory activity that could have potential therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2020646635,"Mutualistic associations are shaped by the interplay of cooperation and conflict among the partners involved, and it is becoming increasingly clear that within many mutualisms multiple partners simultaneously engage in beneficial interactions. Consequently, a more complete understanding of the dynamics within multipartite mutualism communities is essential for understanding the origin, specificity, and stability of mutualisms. Fungus-growing ants cultivate fungi for food and maintain antibiotic-producing Pseudonocardia actinobacteria on their cuticle that help defend the cultivar fungus from specialized parasites. Within both ant-fungus and ant-bacterium mutualisms, mixing of genetically distinct strains can lead to antagonistic interactions (i.e., competitive conflict), which may prevent the ants from rearing multiple strains of either of the mutualistic symbionts within individual colonies. The success of different ant-cultivar-bacterium combinations could ultimately be governed by antagonistic interactions between the two mutualists, either as inhibition of the cultivar by Pseudonocardia or vice versa. Here we explore cultivar-Pseudonocardia antagonism by evaluating in vitro interactions between strains of the two mutualists, and find frequent antagonistic interactions both from cultivars towards Pseudonocardia and vice versa. To test whether such in vitro antagonistic interactions affect ant colonies in vivo, we performed sub-colony experiments using species of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants. We created novel ant-fungus-bacterium pairings in which there was antagonism from one, both, or neither of the ants' microbial mutualists, and evaluated the effect of directional antagonism on cultivar biomass and Pseudonocardia abundance on the cuticle of workers within sub-colonies. Despite the presence of frequent in vitro growth suppression between cultivars and Pseudonocardia, antagonism from Pseudonocardia towards the cultivar did not reduce sub-colony fungus garden biomass, nor did cultivar antagonism towards Pseudonocardia reduce bacteria abundance on the cuticle of sub-colony workers. Our findings suggest that inter-mutualist antagonism does not limit what combinations of cultivar and Pseudonocardia strains Acromyrmex fungus-growing ants can maintain within nests."
https://openalex.org/W1982166077,"Pestiviruses, a group of enveloped positive strand RNA viruses belonging to the family <i>Flaviviridae</i>, express their genes via a polyprotein that is subsequently processed by proteases. The structural protein region contains typical signal peptidase cleavage sites. Only the site at the C terminus of the glycoprotein E<sup>rns</sup> is different because it does not contain a hydrophobic transmembrane region but an amphipathic helix functioning as the E<sup>rns</sup> membrane anchor. Despite the absence of a hydrophobic region, the site between the C terminus of E<sup>rns</sup> and E1, the protein located downstream in the polyprotein, is cleaved by signal peptidase, as demonstrated by mutagenesis and inhibitor studies. Thus, E<sup>rns</sup>E1 is processed at a novel type of signal peptidase cleavage site showing a different membrane topology. Prevention of glycosylation or introduction of mutations into the C-terminal region of E<sup>rns</sup> severely impairs processing, presumably by preventing proper membrane interaction or disturbing a conformation critical for the protein to be accepted as a substrate by signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W2076253442,"Background In the context of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on HIV testing in the emergency department (ED) setting, we evaluated preferences for survey modality and data quality arising from each modality. Methods Enrolled participants were offered the choice of answering a survey via audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) or pen and paper self-administered questionnaire (SAQ). We evaluated factors influencing choice of survey modality. We defined unusable data for a particular survey domain as answering fewer than 75% of the questions in the domain. We then compared ACASI and SAQ with respect to unusable data for domains that address sensitive topics. Results Of 758 enrolled ED patients, 218 (29%) chose ACASI, 343 chose SAQ (45%) and 197 (26%) opted not to complete either. Results of the log-binomial regression indicated that older (RR = 1.08 per decade) and less educated participants (RR = 1.25) were more likely to choose SAQ over ACASI. ACASI yielded substantially less unusable data than SAQ. Conclusions In the ED setting there may be a tradeoff between increased participation with SAQ versus better data quality with ACASI. Future studies of novel approaches to maximize the use of ACASI in the ED setting are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1998585137,"KtrB, the K+-translocating subunit of the Na+-dependent bacterial K+ uptake system KtrAB, consists of four M1PM2 domains, in which M1 and M2 are transmembrane helices and P indicates a p-loop that folds back from the external medium into the cell membrane. The transmembrane stretch M2C is, with its 40 residues, unusually long. It consists of three parts, the hydrophobic helices M2C1 and M2C3, which are connected by a nonhelical M2C2 region, containing conserved glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, and lysine residues. Several point mutations in M2C2 led to a huge gain of function of K+ uptake by KtrB from the bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus. This effect was exclusively due to an increase in Vmax for K+ transport. Na+ translocation by KtrB was not affected. Partial to complete deletions of M2C2 also led to enhanced Vmax values for K+ uptake via KtrB. However, several deletion variants also exhibited higher Km values for K+ uptake and at least one deletion variant, KtrBΔ326–328, also transported Na+ faster. The presence of KtrA did not suppress any of these effects. For the deletion variants, this was due to a diminished binding of KtrA to KtrB. PhoA studies indicated that M2C2 forms a flexible structure within the membrane allowing M2C3 to be directed either to the cytoplasm or (artificially) to the periplasm. These data are interpreted to mean (i) that region M2C2 forms a flexible gate controlling K+ translocation at the cytoplasmic side of KtrB, and (ii) that M2C2 is required for the interaction between KtrA and KtrB.

These data are interpreted to mean (i) that region M2C2 forms a flexible gate controlling K+ translocation at the cytoplasmic side of KtrB, and (ii) that M2C2 is required for the interaction between KtrA and KtrB. The alkali cation potassium is the main osmolyte in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes (1.Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S.

Hence, prokaryotes regulate their K+ contents and adapt them rapidly in response to changes in the environment. For this purpose, they possess a number of K+ channels, pumps, and transporters (1.Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S.

Several of the K+-uptake systems contain a K+-translocating subunit belonging to the superfamily of K+ transporters (7.Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys.

Whereas the channels form homo-tetramers from four identical M1PM2 subunits, SKT proteins consist of four covalently linked M1PM2 motifs connected by cytoplasmic loops. The four p-loops (P) are thought to fold back from the external medium to the middle of the membrane, where they form a part of the permeation pathway for K+ through the channel center (7.Durell S.R.

With single conserved glycine residues in SKT proteins, this filter appears to have a simpler structure than in K+ channels, in which the filter is formed by the well conserved p-loop sequence TVGYG from each subunit (18.Zhou Y.

KtrA, the other subunit from KtrAB, is located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is a member of the RCK/KTN protein family (1.Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N.

KtrA may regulate K+ transport by binding ATP (24.Albright R.A. Ibar J.L. Kim C.U. Gruner S.M. Morais-Cabral J.H.

KtrB alone transports K+ slowly in a process that is independent of Na+. In addition, it transports Na+ with relatively low affinity (Km value of ∼3 mm Na+ (9.Tholema N. Vor der Brüggen M. Mäser P. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Kobayashi H. Uozumi N. Bakker E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41146-41154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). The exact structure of KtrB is unknown, but it has been modeled based on the structure of KcsA (11.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar, 13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most of the KtrB structure was similar to that of KcsA. However, in particular, the C termini from the membrane spans M2C and M2D deviated from that of KcsA-M2. This may reflect the difference in function between the channel KcsA and the transporter KtrB (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Subsequent cross-linking studies showed that the external half of KtrB is very similar to that of the KcsA tetramer, whereas its cytoplasmic half deviates. In addition, KtrB may form dimers (26.Albright R.A. Joh K. Morais-Cabral J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35046-35055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In their modeling studies, Durell and Guy (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) focused on membrane span M2C. They divided it into three regions, from M2C1 to M2C3 (see Fig. 1A). M2C1 and M2C3 can form hydrophobic α-helices. However, M2C2 contains many conserved small and polar residues (Ala, Gly, and Ser, Thr, Lys, respectively; see Fig. 1B). It may form a random coil or β-turn structure (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). According to the first Durell and Guy model (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), M2C1 and M2C3 span the membrane, and M2C2 forms a loop that fills the cavity just beneath the p-loops. Alternatively, these authors proposed (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that M2C1 and M2C2 span the membrane (the latter in a coiled conformation) and helix M2C3 is located within the inner surface of the membrane. The conserved lysine residue (Lys325 in VaKtrB from Vibrio alginolyticus; see vertical arrow in Fig. 1B) may form a salt bridge with a conserved aspartate residue from the C terminus of M2B (VaKtrB Asp222; 13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Region M2C2 is conserved among the bacterial SKT protein families KtrB, TrkH, and KdpA (7.Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8.Durell S.R. Bakker E.P. Guy H.R. Biophys.

J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All of these require at least one additional subunit for activity. The interaction with the other subunit(s) (i.e. KtrA for KtrB) may modulate the conformation of M2C2, thereby allowing the passage of K+ through a gate (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study, we report on the effects of point mutations and deletions in region M2C2 of KtrB from V. alginolyticus (VaKtrB) on the uptake of K+ and Na+ by Escherichia coli cells. Many of the changes cause a huge gain of function effect on K+ transport, whereas Na+ transport remained unaltered. In addition, KtrB-PhoA fusions suggest that region M2C2 possesses a flexible structure. These results are interpreted to mean that M2C2 forms a gate for K+ permeation through the KtrB protein. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the supplemental Table. Plasmids pKtrBG314A to pKtrBS327C containing point mutations in codons from M2C2 of VaktrB were generated from plasmid pEL903-100 by PCR using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmids with deletions in region M2C of ktrB (pKtrBΔ314–328 to pKtrBΔ326–328, and pKtrBΔ314–328Leu340-PhoA to pKtrBΔ326–328Leu340-PhoA) were generated with the Finnzymes PhusionTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany) from plasmids pEL900-100 and pKtrBL340-PhoA, respectively. KtrAB plasmids with point mutations or deletions in region M2C2 from ktrB were generated by replacing a 1-kb BlpI-MscI restriction fragment from ktrB in plasmid pIH301 by the same fragment from a ktrB plasmid carrying the desired mutation. Plasmids encoding KtrB-PhoA fusion proteins were generated with the aid of plasmid pPAB404 as described in Ref. 27.Buurman E.T. Kim K.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. For this purpose, ktrB fragments were generated by PCR from plasmid pEL903-100 with a BamHI site in front of the ktrB ribosomal-binding site and a PstI site at the proper position behind the ktrB codon that should be fused to the first phoA codon from pPAB404. The fragments were digested with BamHI and PstI and ligated with pPAB404 opened with the same restriction enzymes. Cells of E. coli LB2003 (28.Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch.

After a further 90 min of growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation and prepared for the K+-uptake experiments (protocol 1). Most of the cells of LB2003 containing the M2C-deletion plasmids were grown at 3 mm K+ (K3 medium) containing 0, 0.002, 0.005, or 0.02% l-arabinose. These cells were harvested by centrifugation at a value of OD578 of 0.5–0.8 and prepared for the K+-uptake experiments (protocol 2). Cells of strain TO114 (30.Sakuma T. Yamada N. Saito H. Kakegawa T.

Cells of strain TO114 containing the M2C-deletion plasmids were grown aerobically in K3Na0 medium (31.Giffard P.M. Rowland G.C. Kroll R.G. Stewart L.M. Bakker E.P. Booth I.R. J.

Growth tests were done in liquid medium at K+ concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, and 115 mm using a 1:300 inoculum of cells growing exponentially at 30 mm K+ in the absence of l-arabinose. Growth was measured as OD578 for ∼8 h and at ∼24 h after inoculation. The l-arabinose concentrations used for the induction of ktrB are given in the figure legends. Depletion of the cells from alkali cations, net K+ uptake by K+-depleted LB2003 cells, and Na+ uptake by Na+-depleted TO114 cells were carried out as described in Ref. 9.Tholema N. Vor der Brüggen M.

Alkaline phosphatase activity of the suspension was determined according to Ref. 33.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 401Google Scholar and expressed in nmol·min−1·mg−1 cell (dry weight). Cells of strain LB2003 containing plasmid pIH301 or one of its derivatives were grown in 1 liter of K30 medium (29.Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2% glycerol (v/v) and 0.02% l-arabinose (w/v) up to an OD518 value of 1.0–1.5, harvested by centrifugation, washed once with buffer S containing 600 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), and 50 mm TrisCl, pH 8, and resuspended at 10 mg (dry weight)/ml of the buffer S in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and some DNase. Cells were broken by sonication with a Branson 250 Sonifier II cell disruptor (Branson). Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and its supernatant was centrifuged overnight at 100,000 × g. The pellet was suspended at 10 mg protein/ml of buffer S, and its proteins were solubilized by incubation with 1% β-d-dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace) and 1% protease-inhibitor mixture P8849 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 45 min at 200,000 × g in a TL100.3 Mini-ultracentrifuge (Beckmann, Frankfurt, Germany). The supernatant was incubated at a concentration of 150 mg of protein/ml packed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in the presence of 10 mm imidazole in a 10-ml polypropylene column for 1 h. Subsequently, the agarose was washed with 50 volumes of buffer W, containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm TrisCl, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (w/v), 0.04% β-d-dodecylmaltoside (w/v) plus 50 mm imidazole. His-tagged protein was eluted with 3 volumes of buffer W containing 500 mm imidazole. The samples were diluted with an equal volume of twice concentrated sample buffer, containing 4% SDS (w/v), 12% glycerol (v/v), 50 mm TrisCl (pH 6.8), 2% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), and 0.01% Serva blue G (w/v). The proteins in the sample were separated by SDS-PAGE (34.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amount of His-tagged KtrB in cells used for the growth or transport experiments was determined on a Western blot with a monoclonal mouse penta-His antibody from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) followed by incubation with ImmunoPure antibody goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) as the secondary antibody and visualization by the reaction with alkaline phosphatase with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride plus 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. For this purpose, an aliquot of the cell suspension containing 50 μg of cell protein was spun down and taken up in 50 μl of sample buffer. The proteins in the sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (34.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitro-cellulose sheet on which His-tagged KtrB was detected with the alkaline phosphatase reaction. Alkaline phosphatase in cells used for PhoA activity tests was detected similarly using a monoclonal mouse anti-PhoA antibody (Caltag Laboratories GmbH) and ImmunoPure antibody goat anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody followed by visualization with the alkaline phosphatase reaction as described above. Protein was determined according to Ref. 35.Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar. A cell suspension with an OD578 value of 1.0 was taken to contain 0.3 mg (dry weight)/ml (36.Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of K+ and Na+ by the cells was calculated as described in Ref. 9.Tholema N. Vor der Brüggen M. Mäser P. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Kobayashi H. Uozumi N. Bakker E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41146-41154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. Kinetics of cation uptake was determined by the Eadie-Hofstee method (37.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 475Google Scholar). Durell and Guy (13.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 789-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have proposed that region M2C2 plays an important role in the K+-transport cycle of KtrB. To obtain more information about this region, we changed single amino acids in M2C2 to cysteines in Cys-less VaKtrB containing an N-terminal His tag, as encoded by plasmid pEL903–100 and its derivatives. However, several of these cysteine variants were inactive. This was not unexpected in view of the large degree of conservation of several amino acid residues in M2C2 (Fig. 1B, residues with a gray to black background). To learn more about these residues, more conservative amino acid changes were engineered in VaKtrB residues at positions Gly314, Gly316, Gly321, Gly322, Gly323, Lys325, and Val326 (Fig. 2E). Together with the variants KtrBA315C, KtrBS317C, KtrBT318C, KtrBT320C, KtrBI324C, and KtrBS327C, it was investigated whether these constructs influenced growth of E. coli strain LB2003 at low K+ concentrations. This strain lacks functional K+ uptake systems, and, as a consequence, it grows only at an external [K+] >10 mm (28.Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding a functional K+ uptake system will lower this concentration to 0.1 mm K+ (14.Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, we measured the net uptake of K+ and Na+ by these strains and determined the produced amounts of these His-tagged KtrB variants by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-His5 antibody. The following variants were not characterized further because they inhibited growth of strain LB2003 completely at all K+ concentrations: KtrBG314S (Fig. 2B), KtrBG322A, KtrBG322C, KtrBG322S, KtrBG323A, KtrBG325C, and KtrBV326S. The remaining constructs showed four phenotypes (Fig. 2, panel E). First, growth occurred equally well at all K+ concentrations and was similar to that of KtrB (Fig. 2, panels A and C). This applied to variants KtrBT318C and KtrBK325R. Second, the cells grew well at low K+ concentrations, but growth was inhibited at elevated K+ concentrations (Fig. 2D). Growth inhibition was observed for variant KtrBG316A at ≥ 10 mm K+, for variants KtrBG316S, KtrBS317C, KtrBG321A, KtrBG321S, KtrBV326C (Fig. 2D), and KtrBV326T at ≥30 mm K+, and for variants KtrBG315C, KtrBT320C; KtrBI324C, and KtrBS327C at 115 mm K+, respectively. Third, constructs causing slow growth at all K+ concentrations, possibly with additional inhibition at high K+ concentrations (variants KtrBG314A, KtrBG314C, KtrBG316C, KtrBK325H, and KtrBK325Q). Fourth, constructs that neither complemented cell growth nor inhibited it at high K+ concentrations (variants KtrBG321C,KtrBG323C, and KtrBG323S). Western blots of KtrB samples taken from the growing cells showed that almost all of the variants were present at amounts similar to that of unaltered KtrB. Exceptions with significantly less to no KtrB protein were cells with the variants KtrBG314C and KtrBG323A. Both grew slowly at all K+ concentrations (probably due to lack of KtrB protein; Fig. 2E). Fig. 3, panels A–D, show time courses of net K+ uptake by some of the variants. Both in the absence and presence of the C90S exchange KtrB transported K+ relatively slowly (results not shown and Fig. 3A, respectively). By contrast, almost all of the KtrB variants transported K+ considerably faster than did KtrB (Fig. 3B for the KtrBK325C variant). For only two variants transport was somewhat faster than that of KtrB (Fig. 3C for KtrBK325R and KtrBS325C), and for two of the variants, KtrBG314A and KtrBT318C it was similar to that of KtrB (results not shown and Fig. 3D, respectively). The kinetic analysis of the transport data showed that His-tagged KtrB transported K+ with a 25-fold lower affinity than did KtrB without this tag (Km values for K+ uptake of ∼0.5 and 0.02 mm K+, respectively; Fig. 4B and (9.Tholema N.

More importantly, the stimulation of K+ uptake for the variants was due exclusively to an increase in Vmax, which increased from about 35 nmol·min−1·mg−1 (dry weight) of cells for KtrB (Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A, two first columns) to 200 nmol·min−1·mg−1 (dry weight) for the KtrBG316S variant (Fig. 4A). By contrast, changes in Km for K+ uptake by the different variants were relatively small (Fig. 4B). The observed effects on Vmax were not due to an increased amount of KtrB variant protein in the cells, as Western blots showed similar amounts of KtrB in cell suspensions used for the K+-uptake experiments (results not shown).FIGURE 4Survey of the kinetic parameters of K+ uptake (A and B) and Na+ uptake (C and D) by cells containing KtrB variants with single amino acid changes.

For the Na+ uptake experiment, cells were suspended at 1 mg (dry weight)/ml of medium containing 200 mm triethanolamine Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.2% glycerol, and 0.02% l-arabinose. The suspension was shaken at room temperature. After 10 min, NaCl was added at 1.3 mm, 1.9 mm, 5 mm, or 7 mm.

Here, we show that c-Jun directly binds to and activates the Wip1 promoter in response to UV irradiation. The binding of p53 to the promoter occurs earlier than that of c-Jun. In experiments, mutation of the p53 response element (p53RE) or c-Jun consensus sites reduced promoter activity in both non-stressed and stressed A549 cells. Overexpression of p53 significantly decreased Wip1 expression in HCT116 p53+/+ cells but increased it in HCT116 p53−/− cells. Adenovirus-mediated p53 overexpression greatly decreased JNK activity. Up-regulation of Wip1 via the p38 MAPK-p53 and JNK-c-Jun pathways is specific, as demonstrated by our findings that p38 MAPK and JNK inhibitors affected the expression of the Wip1 protein, whereas an ERK inhibitor did not. c-Jun activation occurred much more quickly, and to a greater extent, in A549-E6 cells than in A549 cells, with delayed but fully induced Wip1 expression. These data indicate that Wip1 is activated via both the JNK-c-Jun and p38 MAPK-p53 signaling pathways and that temporal induction of Wip1 depends largely on the balance between c-Jun and p53, which compete for JNK binding.

Spontaneous conversion of 263NGR and/or 501NGR to iso-DGR possibly explains this enigma, i.e. ligation of iso-DGR by αvβ3 integrin may allow cells to assemble FN. Partial modification of 263NGR to DGR or iso-DGR was detected in purified plasma FN by mass spectrometry. To test functions of the conversion, one or both NGR sequences were mutated to QGR in recombinant N-terminal 70-kDa construct of FN (70K), full-length FN, or FN-RGE. The mutations did not affect the binding of soluble 70K to already adherent fibroblasts or the ability of soluble 70K to compete with non-mutant FN or FN-RGE for binding to FN assembly sites. Non-mutant FN and FN-N263Q/N501Q with both NGRs mutated to QGRs were assembled equally well by adherent fibroblasts. FN-RGE and FN-RGE-N263Q/N501Q were also assembled equally well. Although substrate-bound 70K mediated cell adhesion in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+ by a mechanism that was inhibited by cyclic RGD peptide, the peptide did not inhibit 70K binding to cell surface. Mutations of the NGR sequences had no effect on Mn2+-enhanced cell adhesion to adsorbed 70K but caused a decrease in cell adhesion to reduced and alkylated 70K. These results demonstrate that iso-DGR sequences spontaneously converted from NGR are cryptic and do not mediate the interaction of the 70K region of FN with the cell surface during FN assembly.

In vivo knock-in experiments in which the RGD sequence was replaced with an RGE sequence and in vitro experiments in which the RGD sequence was deleted, however, suggested that other regions of FN also play significant roles in the assembly process (12.Takahashi S.

Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and supports a direct interaction between FN and the cell surface. Further, 70K serves as a dominant negative inhibitor of assembly of full-length FN by blocking FN binding to the surface of adherent fibroblasts or platelets (19.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20.Cho J. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cellular components responsible for the interactions between 70K and fibroblasts during FN assembly are not known. 70K does not contain a classic integrin-binding sequence. It does, however, contain two NGR sequences flanked by glycines in homologous loops of 5FN1 and 7FN1. In cyclic peptides and recombinant 5FN1 module, this sequence can undergo deamidation and isomerization of the asparagine to isoaspartic acid (21.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A.

The GNGRG sequences are conserved in murine, bovine, rat, amphibian, and fish FNs (22.Di Matteo P. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo G. Sacchi A. Crippa L. Protti M.P. Ponzoni M. Toma S. Corti A. Mol.

Accordingly, it was hypothesized that this interaction allows for the FN assembly observed in mouse embryos in which the RGD sequence in 10FN3 is replaced by an RGE sequence (12.Takahashi S. Leiss M.

Further, it was hypothesized that interaction of iso-DGR with αvβ3 is essential for the binding of 70K to the cell surface during FN assembly (12.Takahashi S. Leiss M. Moser M. Ohashi T. Kitao T. Heckmann D. Pfeifer A. Kessler H. Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here, we explore the presence of the iso-DGR sequence in FN purified from human plasma and the importance of this sequence in FN assembly. We found evidence for DGR or iso-DGR in 5FN1 in plasma FN by mass spectrometry. Studies of recombinant 70K with mutations preventing conversion of NGR sequences to iso-DGR demonstrated that the mutations caused a decrease in cell adhesion to reduced and alkylated 70K but had no impact on the binding of soluble 70K to assembly sites on adherent FN-null fibroblasts or Mn2+-dependent adhesion of fibroblasts to native 70K. Recombinant FN with mutations of both NGR sequences in 5FN1 and 7FN1 plus mutation of RGD motif in 10FN3 was able to be assembled by adherent FN-null fibroblasts, and this assembly could be inhibited by 70K with the NGR mutations. Thus, we conclude that iso-DGR sequences spontaneously converted from NGR interact with αvβ3 when FN is denatured but do not mediate the interaction between native FN and the cell surface and are not required for FN assembly, even in the absence of an intact RGD sequence. VN was isolated from human plasma as described previously (24.Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human FN was purified from an FN-rich side fraction of plasma by precipitation of contaminating fibrinogen by brief (3-min) heating at 56 °C followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (25.Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6595-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic 70K N-terminal fragment of plasma FN was purified after limited digestion by cathepsin D, and the 40-kDa gelatin-binding fragment (40K) was purified from a limited tryptic digest of the 70K fragment (18.Ensenberger M.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant FNs with N263Q/N501Q mutations and/or mutation of RGD to RGE at 10FN3, 1FN3-C, and 70K (N-9FN1) with N263Q, N501Q, or N263Q/N501Q mutations (Fig. 1) were produced using a baculovirus expression system with either High 5 cells or SF9 cells as described before (26.Mosher D.F.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant whole-length FN constructs contained extra domain A (AFN3) and the V89 version of the variable region but not extra domain B (BFN3). 1FN3-C had the V89 version of the variable region but did not contain AFN3 or BFN3. In experiments of binding and assembly, medium containing protein were used immediately after harvesting ∼65 h after infection. The medium was clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 20 min. Western blotting was used to assess concentrations and intactness of the recombinant protein in the conditioned medium in comparison with purified plasma FN or proteolytic 70K. Recombinant FN, 1FN3-C, 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q constructs were purified using a C-terminal His tag as described previously (27.Xu J. Bae E. Zhang Q. Annis D.S. Erickson H.P. Mosher D.F. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To optimize solubility, proteins were dialyzed against MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 m NaBr and stored in portions in −80 °C until used. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a ThermoElectron Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) containing a linear ion trap and electrospray ionization source. The instrument was coupled with an Eksigent nano-liquid chromatography system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA). A 0.3 × 50-mm PLRP-S 5-μ 300 Å C4 column from Michrom Bioresources (Auburn, CA) was used for the nano-liquid chromatography with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile. MS and MS/MS data were collected on tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated 70K or 40K. Thus, proteins were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 56 °C, cooled to 22 °C, alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at 22 °C, and subjected to trypsinization (sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega, part number V511A, Madison, WI) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, with a protein:trypsin mass ratio of 20:1) for 16–20 h at 37 °C before application of 300–500 ng of protein to the NanoLC-LTQ system. Analysis of MS and MS/MS data was performed using Xcalibur 2.0.5 and Bioworks 3.3 software (Thermo Scientific). Sequences were compared against a filtered (ΔCn ≥ 0.080; XCorr (±1, 2, 3) = 1.5, 2.00, 2.50; and number of different peptides ≥ 1) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human data base in BioWorks. Carboxyamidomethylation (mass shift of +57.0215) of peptides was accounted for in searches. Expected masses were calculated using the GPMAW 5.02 software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Proteins (70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q) were labeled FITC (F-1906, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a slight modification. FITC was dissolved in 0.5 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed into 0.05 m carbonate buffer with 1 m NaBr, pH 9.5, and mixed with FITC for 1 h at room temperature. PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) were used for separation of FITC and FITC-labeled proteins. Proteins (FN, 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, 70K-N263Q/N501Q, FITC-70K, FITC-70K-N263Q, FITC-70K-N501Q, or FITC-70K-N263Q/N501Q) were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 3 m guanidine for 1 h at 56 °C, cooled to 22 °C, and then alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at 22 °C. Proteins were diluted to 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before coating plates for adhesion assays. FN-null fibroblastic cells from FN-null mouse embryonic stem cells were derived and handled as described previously (28.Bae E. Sakai T. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Triplicate wells of polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning Costar CLS3590 or CLS3596, Lowell, MA) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS as control or PBS containing 10 μg/ml FN, VN, laminin-111 (LN) (Invitrogen), 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, 70K-N263Q/N501Q, FITC-70K, FITC-70K-N263Q, FITC-70K-N501Q, FITC-70K-N263Q/N501Q, or the same proteins reduced and alkylated as above. Alternatively, triplicate wells were coated with various concentrations of VN or reduced and alkylated FITC-70K or FITC-70K-N263Q/N501Q. The plates were rinsed three times with PBS followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in 1% BSA in PBS. The wells were rinsed once with PBS and incubated with 100 μl of a suspension of FN-null cells (140,000 cells/ml), GD25 cells (200,000 cells/ml), or GD25-β1A cells (200,000 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 1 mm MnCl2 and with or without linear peptide RGDS (linRGD) (Sigma), linear peptide RGES (linRGE) (Sigma), or cyclic peptide RGDfv (cycRGD) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Wells were then rinsed three times with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 96% ethanol for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed once with water, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were rinsed with water until the rinse was colorless, Triton (0.2% Triton for .5% Triton for Fig. 6A) was added to solubilize cell-associated dye, and the plates were read for absorbance at 595 nm using a TECAN GENios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC). Experiments with FN-null fibroblasts were done on glass coverslips as described before (27.Xu J. Bae E. Zhang Q. Annis D.S. Erickson H.P. Mosher D.F. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 1FN3-C was diluted to 4 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, prior to coating overnight at 4 °C of the coverslips. Alternatively, LN was diluted to 15 μg/ml in PBS prior to coating. FN-null cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing once with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA. Recombinant non-mutant FN, FN-N263Q/N501Q, FN-RGE, FN-RGE-N263Q/N501Q, 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q in 400 μl of conditioned medium collected ∼65 h after infection or a non-infected conditioned medium control was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM containing 1% BSA. The FN-null cells were incubated with the mix for 3 h at 37 °C. For cells adherent to LN, cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA and incubated with recombinant proteins in the presence of 1 μm lysophosphatidic acid for 3 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked by 5% BSA containing 0.3% Triton for 30 min followed by mouse 4D1.7 recognizing 1FN1-3FN1 of FN (31.Cho J. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2006; 107: 3555-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing four times with PBS, FITC-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed four times with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were viewed and photographed as described before (27.Xu J. Bae E. Zhang Q. Annis D.S. Erickson H.P. Mosher D.F. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In competition assays, 400 μl of recombinant non-mutant FN or FN-RGE in conditioned medium, collected ∼65 h after infection, was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM plus 1% BSA and added to culture medium of FN-null fibroblasts with or without 500 nm or 1 μm purified recombinant 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q in the presence of 50 or 100 mm NaBr and incubated for 1 h before sample processing. Those samples were stained by IST-9 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), which recognizes the extra domain A (AFN3) of the recombinant FNs. Alternatively, 400 μl of recombinant 70K or 70K-N263Q/N501Q in conditioned medium, collected ∼65 h after infection, or a non-infected conditioned medium control, was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM plus 1% BSA and added to culture medium of FN-null fibroblasts with or without 100 μm cycRGD and incubated for 1 h before sample processing. Those samples were stained by mouse 4D1.7 followed by FITC-anti-mouse IgG as described previously. The N-terminal 70K fragment of FN contains NGR sequences in type 1 modules 5FN1 and 7FN1. These sequences are in β-bends linking the D and E strands of the CDE β-sheets of the modules (32.Bingham R.J. Rudiño-Piñera E. Meenan N.A. Schwarz-Linek U. Turkenburg J.P. Höök M. Garman E.F.

MS/MS sequencing demonstrated that the 1-Da shift occurs at residue 263 (Fig. 2). Finding a mixture of peptides with modified and unmodified Asn263 is in accordance with estimates of iso-D content of a 27K fragment of FN (that includes 5FN1) using an assay based on protein isoaspartyl carboxyl methyltransferase (21.Curnis F.

Open table in a new tab We identified the tryptic peptide containing Asn501 in 7FN1 in the proteolytic 70K fragment but could not find the same peptide with the 1-Da shift in mass (Table 1). When the 40K proteolytic plasma FN fragment was used to limit the ions present for MS analysis, again only the peptide containing Asn501 was detected (Table 1). Multiple analyses of recombinant 70K revealed 5FN1 and 7FN1 peptides only in the unmodified forms (Table 1). To determine whether NGR sequences mediate the interaction between the N-terminal 70K region of FN and assembly sites on adherent FN-null fibroblasts, we changed NGR to QGR, as is found at the homologous position of 8FN1, and compared recombinant 70K with 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q in which one, the other, or both of the NGR sequences cannot be converted to iso-DGR. We first studied the binding of 70K, 70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or 70K-N263Q/N501Q to adherent FN-null fibroblasts. Wild type 70K and 70K mutants (70K-N263Q, 70K-N501Q, or N263Q/N501Q) bound equally well to FN-null fibroblasts adherent to surface-adsorbed substrate 1FN3-C (27.Xu J. Bae E. Zhang Q. Annis D.S. Erickson H.P. Mosher D.F. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or LN (28.Bae E. Sakai T. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35749-35759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that support cell adhesion and assembly of FN (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that NGR sequences are not required for the binding of 70K to FN-null fibroblasts. 70K competes with FN for binding to the cell surface (19.McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). When we examined the ability of 70K with NGR mutations to compete with FN for binding to the cell surface, as with non-mutant recombinant 70K, 70K containing the N263Q, N501Q, or N263Q/N501Q mutation competed for FN binding to FN-null fibroblasts adherent to 1FN3-C when added at concentrations of 500 nm (result not shown) or 1 μm (Fig. 4A). To determine whether NGR sequences are required for FN assembly, we created recombinant FN containing the N263Q/N501Q double mutation in FN with an intact RGD sequence (FN-N263Q/N501Q) using a baculovirus system for production of secreted proteins. Non-mutant or mutant FN was present at similar concentrations in conditioned medium of infected cells and used without purification to minimize manipulations of the FNs that might alter the proteins. FN-null fibroblasts adherent to 1FN3-C or LN assembled both wild type FN and FN-N263Q/N501Q (Fig. 5, A and B). These results indicate that, as with the binding of 70K to assembly sites, NGR sequences are not required for assembly of FN. A mouse in which the integrin-binding RGD sequence of FN in 10FN3 was replaced with an RGE sequence is able to assemble FN in a manner that was hypothesized to depend on the interaction of αvβ3 with iso-DGR sequences in the 70K region of FN (12.Takahashi S. Leiss M. Moser M. Ohashi T. Kitao T. Heckmann D. Pfeifer A. Kessler H. Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To test the role of the NGR sequences in assembly of FN containing an RGE sequence, we compared the ability of FN-null fibroblasts to assemble FN-RGE and FN-RGE-N263Q/N501Q. Consistent with published results (12.Takahashi S. Leiss M. Moser M. Ohashi T. Kitao T. Heckmann D. Pfeifer A. Kessler H. Takagi J. Erickson H.P. Fässler R. J.

These arrays were not as intense as immunoarrays formed with wild type FN and were shorter and located more at the periphery of the cells. FN-RGE-N263Q/N501Q was similarly assembled into fibrils by FN-null fibroblasts (Fig. 5, A and B). We also looked at the inhibition of FN-RGE binding by the 70K NGR mutants. 70K and 70K harboring N263Q, N501Q, or N263Q/N501Q mutations all competed for the binding of FN-RGE (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that NGR sequences are not involved in assembly of FN-RGE. Fibroblasts pretreated with cycloheximide attach to tissue culture plates coated with baculovirally expr"

https://openalex.org/W2039032896,"We constructed a transposon (transposon assisted gene insertion technology, or TAGIT) that allows the random insertion of gfp (or other genes) into chromosomal loci without disrupting operon structure or regulation. TAGIT is a modified Tn5 transposon that uses KanR to select for insertions on the chromosome or plasmid, β-galactosidase to identify in-frame gene fusions, and Cre recombinase to excise the kan and lacZ genes in vivo. The resulting gfp insertions maintain target gene reading frame (to the 5′ and 3′ of gfp) and are integrated at the native chromosomal locus, thereby maintaining native expression signals. Libraries can be screened to identify GFP insertions that maintain target protein function at native expression levels, allowing more trustworthy localization studies. We here use TAGIT to generate a library of GFP insertions in the Escherichia coli lactose repressor (LacI). We identified fully functional GFP insertions and partially functional insertions that bind DNA but fail to repress the lacZ operon. Several of these latter GFP insertions localize to lacO arrays integrated in the E. coli chromosome without producing the elongated cells frequently observed when functional LacI-GFP fusions are used in chromosome tagging experiments. TAGIT thereby faciliates the isolation of fully functional insertions of fluorescent proteins into target proteins expressed from the native chromosomal locus as well as potentially useful partially functional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996076986,"The protein G18 (also known as AGS4 or GPSM3) contains three conserved GoLoco/GPR domains in its central and C-terminal regions that bind to inactive Galpha(i), whereas the N-terminal region has not been previously characterized. We investigated whether this domain might itself regulate G protein activity by assessing the abilities of G18 and mutants thereof to modulate the nucleotide binding and hydrolytic properties of Galpha(i1) and Galpha(o). Surprisingly, in the presence of fluoroaluminate (AlF(4)(-)) both G proteins bound strongly to full-length G18 (G18wt) and to its isolated N-terminal domain (G18DeltaC) but not to its GoLoco region (DeltaNG18). Thus, it appears that its N-terminal domain promotes G18 binding to fluoroaluminate-activated Galpha(i/o). Neither G18wt nor any G18 mutant affected the GTPase activity of Galpha(i1) or Galpha(o). In contrast, complex effects were noted with respect to nucleotide binding. As inferred by the binding of [(35)S]GTPgammaS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) to Galpha(i1), the isolated GoLoco region as expected acted as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, whereas the N-terminal region exhibited a previously unknown guanine nucleotide exchange factor effect on this G protein. On the other hand, the N terminus inhibited [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(o), albeit to a lesser extent than the effect of the GoLoco region on Galpha(i1). Taken together, our results identify the N-terminal region of G18 as a novel G protein-interacting domain that may have distinct regulatory effects within the G(i/o) subfamily, and thus, it could potentially play a role in differentiating signals between these related G proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2115011865,"We have identified a cytosine-adenosine (CA) repeat length polymorphism in the 5'-regulatory region of the human integrin alpha2 gene ITGA2 that begins at -605. Our objective was to establish the contribution of this polymorphism to the regulation of integrin alpha2beta1 expression, which is known to vary several-fold among normal individuals, and to investigate the underlying mechanism(s).In combination with the SNP C-52T, previously identified by us as a binding site for the transcription factor Sp1, four ITGA2 haplotypes can be distinguished, in the order in which they enhance ITGA2 transcription: (CA)(12)/-52C>(CA)(11)/-52C>(CA)(11)/-52T>(CA)(10)/-52T. By DNA affinity chromatography and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and Ku80/70 bind specifically and with enhanced affinity to the longer (CA)(12) repeat alleles.The increased binding of PARP-1 and Ku80/70, known components of transcription co-activator complexes, to the longer (CA)(12) alleles of ITGA2 coincides with enhanced alpha2beta1 expression. The most likely explanation for these findings is that PARP-1 and Ku80/70 contribute to the transcriptional regulation of ITGA2. These observations provide new insight into the mechanisms(s) underlying haplotype-dependent variability in integrin alpha2beta1 expression in human platelets and other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039960757,"Meteorites and their components provide the only means to study the circumstances and processes that gave rise to our solar system. But the task of unraveling our origins is by no means straightforward. A single undifferentiated meteorite—a chondrite—typically contains matrix and inclusions formed over a wide range of conditions and time before eventually being accreted into a single body. Understanding this complex assemblage, especially over the critical first 10 million years, allows the formulation of models of the spatially and temporally evolving thermochemical conditions that gave rise to the solar system. Geochronology—the determination of ages of events recorded by meteorites—provides the requisite temporal information. Although advances have been made over the past decade in this field, on page 449 of this issue, Brennecka et al. ( 1 ) present data suggesting that a basic assumption for the use of the U-Pb chronometer in geochronology, the golden spike for deep time, may be incorrect."
